A BSTRACT. We study the representation theory of the braids and ties algebra, or
the bt -algebra, En (q). Using the cellular basis {m st } for En (q) obtained in previous joint work with J. Espinoza we introduce two kinds of permutation modules
M (λ) and M (Λ) for En (q). We show that the tensor product module V ⊗n for En (q)
is a direct sum of M (λ)'s. We introduce the dual cellular basis {n st } for En (q)
and study its action on M (λ) and M (Λ). We show that the annihilator ideal I in
En (q) of V ⊗n enjoys a nice compatibility property with respect to {n st }. We finally
study the quotient algebra En (q)/I , showing in particular that it is a simultaneous
generalization of Härterich's 'generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra' and Juyumaya's
'partition Temperley-Lieb algebra'.

I NTRODUCTION

In this paper we study the representation theory of the braids and ties algebra En (q), or
the bt-algebra for short. It was introduced by Aicardi and Juyumaya in [Aicar-Juyu1],
via an abstraction of the presentation for the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra Yr,n (q) of type
A n−1 . The bt -algebra carries a diagrammatics consisting of braids and ties, as illustrated below where braids are black and ties are dashed red.

The study of En (q) has attracted much attention recently, both from knot theorists and from representation theorists, see for example [Arcis-Juyu], [Aicar-Juyu2],
[Aicar-Juyu3], [Aicar-Juyu4], [Ban], [ChlouPou], [EspRy],[Flo], [JacoAn], [Juyu], [Mar],
[Ry] and the references therein. Interesting enough, even though En (q) is derived from
Yr,n (q), both the knot theory and the representation theory of En (q) are almost completely independent from those of Yr,n (q), in the sense that almost no statement in
the literature about En (q) is obtained directly from a corresponding statement about
Yr,n (q).
In our paper [Ry] we constructed a tensor space module V ⊗n for En (q), extending Jimbo's classical tensor space module for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn (q) of type
A n−1 , and showed that it is faithful when the dimension of V is large enough, although
not in general. Using this we obtained a basis for En (q) which involves set partitions

on n := {1, 2, . . . , n}, in particular we found that the dimension of En (q) is b n n!, where
b n is the n'th Bell number, that is the number of set partitions on n.
In the present paper we develop methods that allow us to treat the En (q)-structure
on V ⊗n when V ⊗n is not a faithful, and in particular to determine the annihilator
ideal I for the En (q)-action on V ⊗n in all cases. Our methods rely on cellular algebra theory, in particular on the cellular basis {m st } for En (q) that was introduced in
[EspRy], in joint work with J. Espinoza, and hence they are independent of the ground
ring. We acknowledge that the construction of the {m st }-basis for En (q) is combinatorially much more involved than the construction of the {E A g w }-basis, or other similar
non-cellular bases, but throughout our arguments rely crucially on the compatibility
between the multiplicative structure and the order relation on En (q), given by the cell
datum. In fact, it appears to be very difficult to obtain the results of our paper without
using an appropriate order relation, even for the ground field C and generic q.
The basis {m st } is a generalization of Murphy's standard basis {x st } for Hn (q).
In the classical representation theory of Hn (q), see for example [DipperJames] and
[DipperJamMathas], an important application of {x st } is to introduce permutation
modules M (λ) for Hn (q), where λ runs over integer partitions of n, and to realize
Jimbo's tensor space module V ⊗n as a direct sum of these M (λ)'s. The M (λ)'s have
many important properties, but for us it is of special relevance that they are endowed
with canonical symmetric bilinear forms (*, *)λ , that satisfy a certain non-vanishing
property with respect to the dual basis {y st } of {x st }.
In the paper we generalize the M (λ)'s to En (q)-permutation modules M (λ), for
λ running over multipartitions, and show in our Theorem 17 that the En (q)-tensor
module V ⊗n from [Ry] is a direct sum of these M (λ)'s in analogy with the Hn (q)case. The M (λ)'s are endowed with bilinear forms, in analogy with the M (λ)'s, but
the parametrizing poset Ln for En (q) is a combinatorial object which is more complicated than multipartitions, and so the M (λ)'s are not sufficient for our determination
of the annihilator ideal I.
To solve this problem we introduce, via {m st }, another kind of permutation modules that we denote M (Λ). We show in a series of Lemmas, culminating with Lemma
14, that the canonical bilinear form (*, *)Λ on M (Λ) indeed satisfies the nonvanishing
property with respect to the dual basis {n st }.
The above results constitute the bulk of work of our paper. The situation is not
completely analogous to the situation for Hn (q), but in general there is an inclusion
M (Λ) ⊆ M (λ) and this is in fact enough to execute Härterich's wonderful argument,
see [Härterich], for the determination of the annihilator ideal of the action of Hn (q)
in Jimbo's tensor space V ⊗n , but in the En (q)-setting. We do so in Theorem 18.
When working over a ground field K, Theorem 18 gives a K-vector space basis for
I in terms of an explicit subset of {n st }, thus generalizing Härterich's compatibility
result. Note that Härterich's compatibility result is the starting point for the author's
joint work with D. Plaza on KLR-gradings on the Temperley-Lieb algebras of type A
and B , see [PlaRy]. Note also that other compatibility results for {m st } were obtained
in [EspRy].
In the final paragraphs of the paper we introduce and study the quotient algebra ET Ln,N (q) := En (q)/I. It is a simultaneous generalization of Härterich's 'generalized Temperley-Lieb' algebra and of Juyumaya's 'partition Temperley-Lieb algebra
PT Ln (q), that themselves are generalizations of the original Temperley-Lieb algebra.
Our Theorem 18 allows us to determine the dimension of ET Ln,N (q) as the cardinality
of an explicit subset of {n st },
Let us now indicate the layout of the paper. In the next section we introduce the
basic notation that shall be used throughout the paper. It is mostly concerned with
combinatorial notions related to the symmetric group Sn , that is partitions, Young
diagrams, Young tableaux, etc. Throughout the paper, Sn is viewed as a Coxeter group
2

and we only consider subgroups of Sn that are parabolic subgroups, in the sense of
Coxeter groups. It is well known that parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups give rise
to distinguished coset representatives. Throughout we need these distinguished coset
representatives and their associated decompositions of the group elements, and we
therefore briefly explain why they exist, but from an algorithmic point of view which
is possibly less known. In the final paragraphs of this section we recall the definition
of En (q), together with its {E A g w } basis.
In section 3 we first recall from [EspRy] the ideal decomposition
M
Enα (q)
(2)
En (q) =
α∈P ar n

that reduces the study of En (q) to the study of its summands Enα (q). We next recall
from [EspRy] the construction of the cellular basis {m st } for Enα (q) and at the same
time we introduce the new dual cellular basis {n st } by making the appropriate adaptions. It is a generalization of Murphy's dual standard basis {y st } for Hn (q). The cell
poset Ln (α) for both bases consists of pairs (λ | μ) of multipartitions, satisfying certain
conditions.
In section 4 we first introduce the permutation module M (λ). In Lemma 10 we
describe a basis {xs } for M (λ) together with its Enα (q)-action. We next introduce, for
Λ ∈ Ln (α), the permutation module M (Λ). We describe in the Lemmas 11 and 12 a
basis {ms } together with the Enα (q)-action on it. We then introduce the bilinear form
(*, *)Λ on M (Λ) and show that it is symmetric and invariant. Finally, in Lemma 14 we
prove the following crucial property, alluded to above
(m t n t0 s0 , m s )Λ 6= 0.

(3)

In section 5 we obtain the main results of our paper. We first give the decomposition of V ⊗n corresponding to 2 and then the decomposition in terms of the M (λ)'s.
Finally, in the main Theorem 18, we give the description of I, proving that a subset of
{n st } induces a basis for it.
It is a great pleasure to thank J. Espinoza for many useful discussions related to
the contents of the paper, for sending us comments on preliminary versions of it, and
for sharing with us his formula for dim PT Ln (q). We also also thank J. Juyumaya for
communicating to us his and P. Papi's MAGMA calculations and for pointing out an
error in a preliminary version of the paper. Finally, it is a special pleasure to thank M.
Härterich for introducing us to Murphy's standard basis and all its deep properties.

N OTATION AND B ASIC C ONCEPTS

We fix the ground ring S := Z[q, q −1 ], where q is an indeterminate.
Let Sn be the symmetric group consisting of bijections of n := {1, 2, . . . , n}. Throughout we consider the natural action of Sn on n as a right action. As is well known, Sn
is a Coxeter group on Σn := {s 1 , . . . , s n−1 } with relations
si s j = s j si
s i s i +1 s i = s i +1 s i s i +1
s i2

=1

for |i − j | > 1

(4)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2

(5)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

(6)

where s i := (i , i +1). We denote by < the Bruhat-Chevalley order and by `(*) the length
function on Sn .
Let N denote the set of natural numbers. A composition μ = (μ1 , μ2 , . . . , μl ) of n ∈ N,
written μ |= n, is a sequence in N0 with sum n. The μi 's are called the parts of μ.
An integer partition of n, written λ ` n, or simply a partition of n, is a composition
whose parts
form a non-increasing
sequence. If μ |= n we define |μ| := n and denote
©
a
by min i | μk = 0 for k > i the length of μ.
3

Suppose that μ = (μ1 , μ2 , . . . , μl ) |= n of length l . The set of all compositions of n is
denoted Comp n and the set of all partitions of n is denoted P ar n . We set Comp :=
S
S
n Comp n and P ar := n P ar n . If μ = (μ1 , μ2 , . . . , μl ) |= n we define the Young diagram
0
of μ as the subset of N × N0 given by
©
a
Y(μ) := (i , j ) | 1 ≤ j ≤ μi and i ≥ 1 .

(7)

The elements of Y(μ) are the nodes of μ. We represent Y(μ) by an array of boxes in
the plane, using matrix convention for the placement of the nodes. For example, if
μ = (4, 4, 0, 3) then
Y(μ) =

(8)

If λ ∈ P ar n we denote by λ0 the conjugate partition, which is the one obtained from λ
by interchanging rows and columns, that is Y(λ0 ) = {(i , j ) | ( j , i ) ∈ Y(λ)}.
Suppose that μ |= n. Then a μ-tableau is a bijection t : Y(μ) → n. If t is a μ-tableau
we identify it with a labelling of the nodes of Y(μ), using the elements of n. For example, if μ = (4, 4, 4, 1) then
1 4 3 13

t = 2 6 10 8

12

(9)

is the μ-tableau t, that satisfies t(1, 1) = 1, t(1, 2) = 4, t(1, 3) = 3, etc. If t is a μ-tableau
we define Shape(t) := μ. The set of μ-tableaux is denoted Tab(μ). A μ-tableau t is
row standard if the entries in t increase from left to right in each row and it is standard if the entries also increase from top to bottom in each column. The set of row
standard λ-tableaux is denoted RStd(λ) and the set of standard λ- tableaux is denoted
Std(λ). For μ |= n we denote by tμ (resp. tμ ) the standard tableau in which the integers 1, 2, . . . , n are entered in increasing order from left to right along the rows (resp.
columns) of Y(μ). For example, if μ = (4, 3) then tμ = 15 26 37 4 (resp. tμ = 12 34 56 7 ). If
λ ∈ P ar n and t is a λ-tableau we denote by t0 the conjugate tableau. It is the λ0 -tableau
defined via t0 (i , j ) := t( j , i ).
Sn acts naturally on the right on Tab(λ), via composition of a function t ∈ Tab(λ)
with an element σ ∈ Sn viewed as a bijection of n. For t ∈ Tab(λ), we denote by d (t)
the unique element of Sn such that t = tλ d (t). We set w λ := d (tλ ) ∈ Sn . Then for any
t ∈ Tab(λ) we have that
d (t)d (t0 )−1 = w λ and `(d (t)) + `(d (t0 )) = `(w λ )

(10)

see for example the proof of Lemma 2.2 of [Murphy92]. The Young subgroup Sλ associated with λ is the row stabilizer
of tλ . It isa a parabolic subgroup of Sn in the sense
©
of Coxeter groups. The set d (t) | t ∈ RStd(λ) is a set of distinguished right coset representatives for Sλ in Sn , that is `(w 0 d (t)) = `(w 0 ) + `(d (t)) for w ∈ Sλ . In other words,
for any w ∈ Sn there is a unique decomposition
w = w 0 d (t) where w 0 ∈ Sλ and t ∈ RStd(λ)

(11)

see Proposition 3.3 of [Mathas] and chapter 1.10 of [Hump]. The determination of
w 0 and t can be realized in an algorithmic way that we now explain. Define first s ∈
Tab(λ) via w = d (s). Let next s j 1 , s j 2 , . . . , s j k be a sequence of elements in S such that
when setting s0 := s, s1 := s0 s j 1 , s2 := s1 s j 2 , . . . , sk := sk−1 s j k we have that i j appears
strictly below i j + 1 in s j and that sk is equal to sλ modulo a permutation of the row
elements. Such a sequence always exists. Then w 0 = d (sk ) and t = tλ s j k s j k−1 . . . s j 1 ,
that is d (t) = s j k s j k−1 . . . s j 1 . Note that although w 0 and d (t) are unique, the sequence
4

s j 1 , s j 2 , . . . , s j k is in general not unique. Here is an example of this algorithm, using
λ = (2, 3, 2) and w = d (s) where
2 6
(12)
s= 3 5 1 .
7 4
Then a possible sequence of s j i 's is given as follows

and so d (t) = s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 4 s 1 whereas w 0 = d (t) = s 4 s 3 s 6 . Note that
2 6

t = tλ s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 4 s 1 = 1 3 5

which is also the tableau obtained from s by ordering the rows.
Let μ, ν ∈ Comp. We write μ E ν if for all i ≥ 1 we have

μj ≤

where, if necessary, we add zero parts at the end of μ and ν so that the sums are
defined. This is the dominance order on compositions. It is extended to row standard
tableaux as follows. Suppose λ |= n and that t ∈ RStd(λ). We then define t|≤m to be
the tableau obtained from t by deleting all nodes with entries strictly greater than m.
Then, for row standard μ-tableaux s and t we write sEt if Shape(s|≤m ) E Shape(t|≤m )
for all m = 1, . . . , n. We write sCt if sEt and s 6= t. This defines the dominance order on
the set of all row standard tableaux. We have that tλ (resp. tλ ) is the unique maximal
(resp. minimal) row standard λ-tableau under the dominance order.
An r -multicomposition, or just a multicomposition if confusion is not possible,
of n is an r -tuple λ = (λ(1) , λ(2) , . . . , λ(r ) ) of (possibly empty) compositions λ(k) such
P
that ri=1 |λ(i ) | = n. We call λ(k) the k'th component of λ. An r -multipartition is an
r -multicomposition whose components are all partitions. The nodes Y(λ) of an r multicomposition λ are labelled by triples (x, y, p) with p giving the component number and (x, y) the node of that component. This is the Young diagram for λ and is
represented graphically as the r -tuple of Young diagrams of the components. For example, the Young diagram of λ = ((3, 3), (3, 1), (1, 1, 1)) is




,

,

.

The set of r -multicompositions of n is denoted by C omp r,n and the subset of r -multipartitions of n is denoted by P ar r,n . If λ ∈ C omp r,n , then a λ-multitableau t is a bijection t : Y(λ) → n; it is identified with a labelling of Y(λ) using the elements of n. The
restriction of t to λ(i ) is the i 'th component t(i ) of t and we write t = (t(1) , t(2) , . . . , t(r ) ).
We say that t is row standard if all its components are row standard, and standard if
they are all standard. If t is a λ-multitableau we write Shape(t ) = λ. The set of all
λ-tableaux is denoted by Tab(λ), the set of all row standard λ-tableaux is denoted by
RStd(λ) and the set of all standard λ-multitableaux by Std(λ). In the following examples

t is a standard multitableau whereas s is only a row standard multitableau. We denote by t λ (resp. t λ ) the λ-multitableau in which 1, 2, . . . , n appear in order along the
5

rows (resp. columns) of the first component, then along the rows of the second component, and so on. For example, in (15) we have t = t λ with λ = ((3, 2), (1, 1, 1)). For
each multicomposition λ we define the Young subgroup Sλ as the row stabilizer of
t λ . It is a parabolic subgroup in the sense of Coxeter groups. For s a row standard λmultitableau,
we denote
by d (s ) the unique element of Sn such that s = t λ d (s ). The
©
a
set d (s ) | s ∈ RStd(λ) is a set of distinguished right coset representatives for Sλ in Sn ,
that is `(w 0 d (s )) = `(w 0 )+`(d (s )) for w ∈ Sλ . Suppose that λ := (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) ∈ P ar r,n
and that t := (t(1) , . . . , t(r ) ) ∈ Tab(λ). Then we define the conjugation of λ and t componentwise, that is
λ0 := ((λ(1) )0 , . . . , (λ(r ) )0 ) and t 0 := ((t(1) )0 , . . . , (t(r ) )0 )

(16)

Similarly to 11, there is for any w ∈ Sn a unique decomposition
w = w 0 d (t ) where w 0 ∈ Sλ and t ∈ RStd(λ).

(17)

Suppose that w = d (s ). Then applying the algorithm in 11 on the tableau s obtained
from s = (s(1) , s(2) , . . . , s(r ) ) by concatenating all its components, with s(1) on top followed by s(2) just below s(1) and so on, we obtain w 0 and t in 17.
Suppose that λ ∈ C omp r,n and that t ∈ Tab(λ) is row standard. Then for j = 1, . . . , n
we set pt ( j ) := k if j appears in t(k) . We call pt ( j ) the position of j in t . When t = t λ ,
we write p λ ( j ) for pt λ ( j ). We say that t is of the initial kind if pt ( j ) = p λ ( j ) for all
j = 1, . . . , n.
Suppose that λ, μ ∈ C omp r,n . We write λ E μ if λ(i ) E μ(i ) for all i = 1, . . . , n, this is
the dominance order on C omp r,n . If s and t are row standard multitableaux and m =
1, . . . , n we define s |≤m and t |≤m as for usual tableaux and write s Ett if Shape(s |≤m ) E
Shape(t |≤m ) for all m. Note that our dominance order E is different from the dominance order on multicompositions and multitableaux that is used sometimes in the
literature, for example in [DipperJamMathas].
To an r -multicomposition λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) we associate a composition kλk of
length r in the following way
 ́
° ° 3 (1)
°λ° := |λ |, . . . , |λ(r ) | .
(18)
Let Skλk be the associated Young subgroup. Then w ∈ Skλk iff t λ w is of the initial
kind. For t = (t(1) , . . . , t(r ) ) ∈ Tab(λ) we define kt k ∈ Tab(kλk) via
kt k = (|t(1) |, . . . , |t(r ) |)

(19)

where |t(i ) | is the row reading of t(i ) . For the multitableaux t and s in 15 we have for
example

Skλk is yet another parabolic subgroup of Sn , with corresponding distinguished right
 ̄
©
a
coset representatives t ∈ Tab(λ)  ̄ kt k ∈ RStd(kλk) . Hence, for any w ∈ Sn there is a
unique decomposition
w = w 0 d (t ) where w 0 ∈ Skλk and t ∈ Tab(λ) with kt k ∈ RStd(kλk).

(21)

We define s 0 ∈ Tab(λ) via w 0 = t λ d (s 0 ); it is of the initial kind. We obtain s 0 and t concretely by applying the algorithm given in 13 with respect to w and kλk. For example,
if w = d (s ) where

It follows from the algorithm that s 0 is row standard
° ° if s° is row
° standard.
Suppose that s ∈ RStd(λ), s 1 ∈ RStd(λ1 ) with °λ° = °λ1 °. Let w = d (s ), w 1 = d (s 1 )
and let w = w 0 d (t ), w 1 = (w 1 )0 d (t 1 ) be the decompositions of w and w 1 as in 21. Suppose furthermore that d (t ) = d (t 1 ). Then we have that

s Ess1 if and only if s 0 E (s 1 )0 .

(24)

For λ any r -multipartition we define w λ ∈ Sn via w λ := d (t λ ). Suppose now that
s ∈ Tab(λ) and let s 0 be the conjugate multitableau. Set w = d (s ) and w 0 = d (s 0 ) with
decompositions w = w 0 d (t ) and w 0 = (w 0 )0 d (t 0 ) as in 21. Then it follows from the
algorithm described above that d (t ) = d (t 0 ) and that (w 0 )0 = d (t 00 ) where w 0 = d (t 0 ).
Moreover, since t 0 is of the initial kind we get via 10 that
d (s )d (s 0 )−1 = w λ and `(d (t 0 )) + `(d (t 00 )) = `(w λ ).

(25)

Note that we cannot here replace d (t 0 ) and d (t 00 ) by d (s ) and d (s 0 ).
Let us now recall the bt -algebra of the title of the paper. It was originally introduced by Aicardi and Juyumaya in [Aicar-Juyu1].
Definition 1 Let n be a positive integer. The braids and ties algebra En = En (q), or
the bt -algebra, is the associative S-algebra generated by the elements g 1 , . . . , g n−1 and
e 1 , . . . , e n−1 , subject to the following relations:
gi g j = g j gi

for |i − j | > 1

(26)

gi ei = ei gi

for all i

(27)

gi g j gi = g j gi g j

for |i − j | = 1

There is a diagrammatic interpretation of these relations that explains the name of
En (q) and that we now briefly indicate even though it only plays a minor role in the
present paper. It uses n strands connecting a northern and a southern border. Under
the interpretation, the g i 's correspond to usual simple braids involving the i 'th and
the i + 1'st strand and the e i 's correspond to ties involving the i 'th and i + 1'st strands.
The relations 29 and 30 are for example visualized as follows.

If K is a commutative ring containing an invertible element, that we also denote q,
then we define the specialized algebra EnK (q) via EnK (q) := En (q) ⊗S K where K is made
into an S-algebra by mapping q ∈ S to q ∈ K.
The concept of set partitions is important in the study of En (q). Recall that a set
partition A = {I 1 , I 2 , . . . I r } of n is a set of nonempty and disjoint subsets of n whose
7

union is n, in order words, A is the set of classes of an equivalence relation on n.
We refer to the I i 's as the blocks of A. We denote by SP n the set of all set partitions
of n. There is a canonical poset structure on SP n defined as follows. Suppose that
A = {I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I k }, B = {J 1 , I 2 , . . . , J l } ∈ SP n . Then we say that A ⊆ B if each J j is a union
of some of the I i 's.
Returning to En (q), for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n we define E i j ∈ En (q) by E i j = e i if i = j − 1,
and recursively downwards on i via
E i j := g i E i +1, j g i−1 .

(37)

Note that g i is invertible with inverse g i−1 = g i +(q −1 − q)e i , as follows from 34, so that
37 makes sense. For A ∈ SP n we define E A ∈ En (q) as
Y
E A := E i j
(38)
i,j

where the product runs over pairs (i , j ), such that i < j and such that i and j belong
to the same block of A. One checks that the E i j 's commute and so the product is independent of the order in which it is taken. For w = s i 1 * * * s i k ∈ Sn a reduced expression
for w we define g w := g i 1 * * * g i k ∈ En (q). By the relations it is independent of the choice
of reduced expression. We have the following relations in En (q)
E A g w = g w E Aw and E A E B = EC for w ∈ Sn , A, B ∈ SP n

(39)

where C ∈ SP n is minimal with respect ©to A ⊆ C , B ⊆ C . Moreover,
a it was shown in [Ry]
that En (q) has an S-basis of the form E A g w |A ∈ SP n , w ∈ Sn and so, in particular,
the dimension of En (q) is n!b n where b n is the Bell number, that is the cardinality of
SP n .

C ELLULAR BASIS FOR En (q).

In the paper [EspRy], a cellular basis {m st } for En (q) was constructed. Moreover, it was
shown that {m st } induces cellular bases for interesting subalgebras of En (q) and via
this an isomorphism between En (q) and a direct sum of matrix algebras over certain
wreath products of Hecke algebras was established.
In this section we first recall the construction of {m st } and at the same time we
introduce a new, dual, cellular basis for En (q), that we denote {n st }. We next prove,
in a series of Lemmas, certain compatibility properties between the dominance order
associated with En (q) and the multiplication of elements from the two bases. These
compatibility properties are known in the Hecke algebra setting, and our proofs are
essentially reductions to that setting.
Let us first recall the formal definition of cellular algebras, as introduced in [GraLeh].

Definition 2 Let R be an integral domain. Suppose that A is an R-algebra. Suppose
that (P, ≤) is a poset and that for each λ ∈ P there is a finite indexing set T (λ) (the
λ
'λ-tableaux') and elements c st
∈ A such that
n

C = c st

If A has a cellular basis we say that A is a cellular algebra and (P, T, C, ∗) is called the
cell datum for A.
We now recall the, somewhat lengthy, construction of the cell datum for En (q). For
more details on this construction, the reader should consult [EspRy].
We first consider a certain ideal decomposition of En (q). Let μSP n be the Möebius
function for the lattice (SP n , ⊆). It is given by
(
Q −1 r i +1
(−1)r −s ir=1
(i !)
if A ⊆ B
μSP n (A, B ) =
(41)
0
otherwise
where r and s are the number of blocks of A and B respectively, and where r i is the
number of blocks of B containing exactly i blocks of A. Using it, we define for A ∈ SP n
orthogonal idempotents E A ∈ En (q) via
X
E A :=
μ(A, B )E B .
(42)
B :A⊆B

For example E{{1},{2},{3}} = E {{1},{2},{3}} −E {{1,2},{3}} −E {{1},{2,3}} −E {{1,3},{2}} +2E {{1,2,3}} . The following is Proposition 39 in [EspRy].
Proposition 3 The following properties hold.
(1) {E A |A ∈ SP n } is a set of orthogonal idempotents of En (q).
(2) For all w ∈ Sn and A ∈ SP n we have E A g w = g w E Aw .
(
E A if B ⊆ A
(3) For all A ∈ SP n we have E A E B =
0
if B 6⊆ A.
Let α ∈ P ar n . A set partition A = {I 1 , . . . , I k } of n is said to be of type α if there exists
a permutation σ such that (|I i 1σ |, . . . , |I i kσ |) = α. We write |A| = α if A ∈ SP n is of type
α and we let SP α
n be the set of set partitions of type α. For α ∈ P ar n we define the
following element Eα of En (q)
X
EA .
(43)
Eα :=
A∈SP n , |A|=α

Then the Eα 's form a family of central orthogonal idempotents in En (q) such that
P
α∈P ar n Eα = 1. As a consequence we have the following decomposition of En (q) into
a direct sum of two-sided ideals
M
En (q) =
Enα (q)
(44)
α∈P ar n

where Enα (q) := Eα En (q). Each ideal Enα (q) is an S-algebra with identity Eα and the set
{E A g w | w ∈ Sn , |A| = α}

(45)

is an S-basis for Enα (q). In particular the dimension of Enα (q) is n! times the Faà di
Bruno coefficient, that is b n (α)n!, where by definition the Faà di Bruno coefficient
b n (α) is the number of set partitions of n of type α. For K an arbitrary field with a
nonzero element we have a specialized version of Enα (q)
EnK,α (q) := Enα (q) ⊗S K.

(46)

In view of the decomposition in 44, in order to give the cell datum for En (q) it is
enough to give the cell datum for each Enα (q).
The antiautomorphism ∗ is relatively easy to define, since one checks on the relations for En (q) that En (q) is endowed with an S-linear antiautomorphism ∗, satisfying
e i∗ := e i and g i∗ := g i . Using the formula for g i−1 , one checks that E ∗A = E A and then
E∗A = E A . Hence ∗ induces an antiautomorphism on Enα (q).

Next we explain the poset denoted P in Definition 2. We first describe P as a set.
For λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) ∈ C omp r,n we define sets I i via I 1 := {1, 2, . . . , |λ(1) |}, I 2 := {|λ(1) | +
1, |λ(1) | + 2, . . . , |λ(1) | + |λ(2) |}, and so on. Leaving out the empty I i 's we obtain a set
partition in SP n that we denote A λ . For α ∈ P ar n we say that λ is of type α if A λ is
of type α.
An r -multipartition λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) is said to be increasing if λ(i ) < λ( j ) iff i < j ,
where < is any fixed extension of the dominance order C to a total order.
For α ∈ P ar n , we now define Ln (α) to be the set of pairs Λ = (λ | μ) where λ =
(λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) is an increasing r -multipartition of n of type α Let λ(i 1 ) < * * * < λ(i s ) be the
distinct λ(i ) 's and let m j be the multiplicity of λ(i j ) in (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ). Then we require
that μ be an s-multipartition μ = (μ(1) , . . . , μ(s) ) of r where μ( j ) ` m j . For P we choose
Ln (α).
We next describe the poset structure on Ln (α). Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) and Λ =
(λ | μ) are elements of Ln (α), such that λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) and λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ). Then
we write λC1 λ if there exists a permutation σ such that (λ(1σ) , . . . , λ(r σ) )C(λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) )
where C is the dominance order on r -multipartitions, introduced above. We then
write of Λ C Λ if λ C1 λ or if λ = λ and μ C μ. As usual we set Λ E Λ if Λ C Λ or if Λ = Λ.
This is the description of Ln (α) as a poset.
For Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α) as above, we now define the concept of Λ-tableaux. Suppose that t is a pair t = (t | u). Then t is called a Λ-tableau if t is a λ-multitableau and
u is a μ-multitableau of the initial kind. If t is a Λ-tableau we define Shape(t) := Λ.
We let Tab(Λ) denote the set of Λ-tableaux. We say that t = (t | u) ∈ Tab(Λ) is row
standard if its ingredients are row standard multitableaux in the sense of the previous
section and if moreover t is an increasing multitableau. By increasing we here mean
that whenever λ(i ) = λ( j ) we have that i < j if and only if min(t(i ) ) < min(t( j ) ) where
min(t ) is the function that reads off the minimal entry of the tableau t . We say that
t = (t | u) ∈ Tab(Λ) is standard if it is row standard and if its ingredients t and u are
standard multitableaux and we define Std(Λ) to be the set of all standard Λ-tableaux.
Note that our notation is here deviating slightly from the one used in [EspRy]
where the condition on t to be increasing was required for standardness of t, but not
for row standardness of t. In the following examples

s is not row standard but t is.
We fix the following combinatorial notation. Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α) with
λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) and μ = (μ(1) , . . . , μ(s) ). By construction, the numbers m i := |μ(i ) | are
the multiplicities of equal λ(i ) 's. Let SΛ ≤ Sn be the stabilizer subgroup of the set partition A λ = {I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I m }. Then the multiplicities give rise to the subgroup Sm
Λ of SΛ
consisting of the order preserving permutations of the blocks of A λ that correspond
to equal λ(i ) 's. We have Sm
Λ ≤ SΛ , and as an abstract group

Sm
Λ = Sm 1 × * * * × Sm s .

(48)

For example, if λ = ((12 ), (12 ), (12 ), (2), (2), (13 ), (13 ), (13 ), (2, 1)) then

and so Sm
Λ = S3 × S2 × S3 × S1 . For I i and I i +1 two consecutive blocks of A λ such
that λ(i ) = λ(i +1) we let B i ∈ Sn be the element of minimal length, in the sense of
10

Coxeter groups, that interchanges I i and I i +1 . For example in the above example we
have B 1 = (1, 3)(2, 4), B 2 = (3, 5)(4, 6), and so on. SΛ is generated by the B i 's such that
λ(i ) = λ(i +1) , in fact it is a Coxeter groups on these B i 's.
It is important that the group algebra S Sm
Λ can be realized as a subalgebra of
En (q). For this we need to describe B i concretely in terms of the Coxeter generators s i
for Sn . Let a := |I i |. Then there is a c such that
I i = {c + 1, c + 2, . . . , c + a} and I i +1 = {c + a + 1, c + a + 2, . . . , c + 2a}.

(49)

Hence B i is a product of transpositions, as follows
B i = (c + 1, c + a + 1)(c + 2, c + a + 2) * * * (c + a, c + 2a).

(50)

For i > j we set s i j := s i +c s i −1+c . . . s j +c and can then write B i in terms of the s i j 's, and
therefore in terms of simple transpositions s i , as follows
B i = s a,1 s a+1,2 . . . s 2a−1,a .

(51)

The complete expansion of B i in terms of s i 's is a reduced expression for B i . Inspired
by this formula for B i , we define Bi ∈ Enα (q) in the following way
Bi := Eλ g a,1 g a+1,2 . . . g 2a−1,a where g i j := g i +c g i −1+c . . . g j +c .

(52)

The following Lemma was proved in [EspRy].
Lemma 4 Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α). Then we have an S-algebra embedding
α
(i )
(i +1)
ι : S Sm
.
Λ ,→ En (q) given by B i 7→ Bi where λ = λ
We are now ready to recall the construction of the basis elements {m st } of the cell
datum for Enα (q), and at the same time we introduce the new basis elements {n st } for
Enα (q). For each Λ ∈ Ln (α), we first define elements m Λ and n Λ that act as starting
points for the bases. Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) is as above with λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) and
μ = (μ(1) , . . . , μ(s) ). We then define m Λ ∈ Enα (q) and n Λ ∈ Enα (q) as follows
m Λ := Eλ x λ b μ , n Λ := Eλ y λ c μ .

(53)

Let us explain the factors of these products. The idempotent Eλ has already been
introduced. The factors x λ ∈ Enα (q) and y λ ∈ Enα (q) are defined as
X `(w)
X
x λ :=
q
g w and y λ :=
(−q)−`(w) g w .
(54)
w∈Sλ

w∈Sλ

Note that Eλ commutes with x λ and y λ and that for w ∈ Sλ , we have that
Eλ x λ g w = g w Eλ x λ = q l (w) Eλ x λ and Eλ y λ g w = g w Eλ y λ = (−q)−l (w) Eλ y λ .

(55)

In the Hecke algebra case, corresponding to r = 1, the elements defined in 54 are the
elements denoted x λλ and y λλ in [Murphy95]. There is an automorphism of the Hecke
algebra, denoted # in loc. cit., that interchanges x λλ and y λλ . With our choice of
quadratic relation 34, the corresponding automorphism # of Enα (q), interchanging x λ
−1
and y λ , is given by E A g w 7→ (−1)`(w) E A g w
−1 .
In order to define the factors b μ and c μ we recall from 48 the decomposition Sm
Λ =

α
where ι : S Sm
Λ ,→ En (q) is the embedding from Lemma 4.

Let tΛ (resp. tΛ ) be the Λ-tableau given by tΛ := (t λ | t μ ) (resp. tΛ := (t λ | t μ )).
Let now s = (s | u) be an arbitrary Λ-tableau. Then we set d (s) := (d (s ) | ι(d (u))) where
μ
d (s ) ∈ Sn satisfies t λ d (s ) = s and d (u) ∈ Sm
Λ satisfies t d (u) = u. For simplicity, we
write (d (s )| d (u)) instead of (d (s ) | ι(d (u))). Note that since u = (u1 , . . . , us ) is of the
initial kind, we have a decomposition d (u) = (d (u1 ), . . . , d (us )), according to the decomposition in 48 and so
Bd (u) = Bd (u1 ) * * * Bd (us ) .
(58)
We can now finally introduce m st and n st . For s = (s | u), t = (t | v) row standard
Λ-tableaux we define
m st := Eλ g d∗(s ) x λ B∗d (u) b μ Bd (v) g d (t )
(59)
n st := Eλ g d∗(s ) y λ B∗d (u) c μ Bd (v) g d (t ) .

(60)

We set b uv := B∗d (u) b μ Bd (v) and c uv := B∗d (u) c μ Bd (v) and have then also
m st = Eλ g d∗(s ) x λ b uv g d (t )

(61)

n st = Eλ g d∗(s ) y λ c uv g d (t ) .

(62)

In the case where s = tΛ we write for simplicity
m t := m tΛ t and n t := n tΛ t .

(63)

In [EspRy] the following Theorem was proved.
Theorem 5 Enα (q) is a cellular basis with cell datum (Ln (α), Std(Λ), m st , ∗).
Making the straightforward adaptations of the proofs given in [EspRy], we also
have the following Theorem.
Theorem 6 Enα (q) is a cellular basis with cell datum (Ln (α), Std(Λ), n st , ∗).
By general cellular algebra theory, specialization induces a cell datum on EnK,α (q)
as well. We shall denote it the same way; in particular m st and n st may refer to elements of both Enα (q) and EnK,α (q).
The definition of cellular basis does not stipulate a partial order on the tableaux,
but in our setting there is a natural such order that we shall need. It was already introduced in [EspRy]. For t = (t(1) , . . . , t(r ) ) and t = (t(1) , . . . , t (r ) ) row standard r -multitableaux,
we define t C1 t if there exists a permutation σ such that (t(1σ) , . . . , t(r σ) ) C (t(1) , . . . , t(r ) ).
Suppose now that t = (t | u) ∈ Tab(Λ) and t = (t | u) ∈ Tab(Λ). Then we say that t Ctt if
t C1 t or if t = t and u C u. As usual we set t E t if t C t or t = t.
We now introduce the concept of conjugation of the elements of Ln (α) and of their
tableaux; this concept is also not present in general cellular algebras. Suppose that
Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α), with λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) and μ = (μ(1) , . . . , μ(s) ). Then we define the
conjugate of Λ via Λ0 := (λ0 | μ0 ). Note that Λ0 ∈ Ln (α). Similarly, if t = (t | u) ∈ Tab(Λ)
we define the conjugate tableau t0 ∈ Tab(Λ0 ) by conjugating all the components of
t, mimicking what we did for Λ. We have the following compatibility between the
0
dominance orders and conjugation: Λ E Λ iff Λ E Λ0 and s E t iff t0 E s0 .
The following simple Lemma shall be used repeatedly.
Lemma 7 Let α ∈ P ar n . Suppose that A ∈ SP n is of type α and that i and i + 1 are in
distinct blocks of A. Then in Enα (q) and EnK,α (q) the generator g i verifies the symmetric
group quadratic relation when acting on E A , that is
E A g i2 = E A .
12

(64)

P ROOF. By relation 34 we have that
E A g i2 = E A (1 + (q − q −1 )e i g i ) = E A + (q − q −1 )E A e i g i = E A

(65)



where we used (3) of Proposition 3 for the last equality.

For Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α), and Λ-tableaux s = (s | u) and t = (t | v), we define elements
of Enα (q) or EnK,α (q)
xst := g d∗(s ) Eλ x λ g d (t ) ,

yst := g d∗(s ) Eλ y λ g d (t ) .

(66)

We also need the following Lemma.
Lemma 8 Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α), that Λ1 = (λ1 | μ1 ) ∈ Ln (α) and that s , t ∈
Std(λ) and s 1 , t 1 ∈ Std(λ1 ). Suppose moreover that xst ys 1t 1 6= 0. Then t Ess01 .
P ROOF. For usual integer partitions this result is well-known, and as we shall see, the
proof can be reduced to that case. Without loss of generality we may assume that
s = t λ and t 1 = t λ1 and so we have that
xst ys 1t 1 = xt λt ys 1t λ1 = Eλ x λ g d (t ) g d∗(s ) Eλ y λ = x λ g d (t ) g d∗(s ) E A

Eλ y λ .
1
(67)
For the last step we used that x λ Eλ = Eλ x λ , together with part (2) of Proposition 3 and
the fact that Eλ = Eλ since λ and λ1 are both of type α. Now by hypothesis, 67 is
1
nonzero and so E A λ d (t )d (s 1 )−1 Eλ 6= 0. Hence using the orthogonality of the E A 's we get
that
A λ d (t ) = A λ d (s 1 ).

We now choose decompositions with respect to Skλk = Sα as in 21
d (t ) = d (t 0 )wt and d (s 1 ) = d ((s 1 )0 )ws 1 .

(69)

Clearly Sn acts transitively on SP α
n with Sα as the stabilizer group of A λ and so we
have an identification SP α

We can now use Lemma 7 repeatedly on the simple transpositions that appear in a
reduced expression for wt and hence 70 becomes
Eλ xt λt y (s ) t λ1 .

(71)

In view of 24 and the fact that t 0 and (s 1 )0 are both of the initial kind, the Lemma now
follows from the similar result in the Hecke algebra setting.

We wish to generalize the Lemma to a statement involving m st and n st . For this
we need to recall from [EspRy] some of the commutation relations between the various factors of m st and n st , as defined in 59 and 60.
The commutation relations involving Eλ and x λ (resp. y λ ) are easy to describe,
since Eλ and x λ (resp. y λ ) commute with all the factors of 59 (resp. 60), except the
ones on the extreme left and right. The commutation relations between Bd (v) and g d (t )
are more complicated to describe, but we shall here only need the case when t is of
the initial kind, that is t = t 0 . Combining Lemma 21 and Lemma 22 of [EspRy] we get
in that case that
Eλ Bd (v) g d (t 0 ) = Eλ g d (t 0 ) Bd (v)
(72)
and similarly for the two factors on the left of 59 and 60. We can now prove the following statement.
Lemma 9 Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) and that Λ1 = (λ1 | μ1 ) ∈ Ln (α) and that s, t ∈
Std(Λ) and s1 , t1 ∈ Std(Λ1 ). If in Enα (q) or EnK,α (q) we have m st n s1 t1 6= 0 then t E s01 .
13

P ROOF. Let s = (s | u), t = (t | v), s1 = (s 1 | u1 ) and t1 = (t 1 | v1 ). As in the proof of
Lemma 8, we can without loss of generality assume that s = tΛ and t1 = tΛ1 and so
we have that
(73)
m st n s1 t1 = Eλ x λ b μ Bd (v) g d (t ) g d∗(s 1 ) B∗d (u1 ) c μ1 y λ1 Eλ1 .
We now argue largely as in Lemma 8. We first observe that Eλ = Eλ since both λ and
1
λ1 are of type α. Using the commutation rules involving Eλ , see the paragraph prior
to 72 and part (3) of Proposition 3, we get that 73 is equal to
x λ b μ Bd (v) g d (t ) g d∗(s 1 ) B∗d (u1 ) E A

−1
λ d (t )d (s 1 )

Eλ c μ1 y λ1 .

(74)

By hypothesis, 73 is nonzero and so E A d (t )d (s )−1 = Eλ which implies that A λ d (t ) =
1
λ
A λ d (s 1 ). As in Lemma 8 we have decompositions d (t ) = d (t 0 )wt and d (s 1 ) = d ((s 1 )0 )ws 1
and so A λ wt = A λ ws 1 and wt = ws 1 . Hence 74 becomes

where we used that y

(76)

Lemma 8. We know that 76 is nonzero. Since t 0 and (s 1 )0 are of the initial kind we deduce from Lemma 8 that t Ess01 . But since 76 is nonzero we also get that b μ Bd (v) B∗d (u ) c μ1
1
is nonzero. Moreover v and u1 are of the initial kind as well, this time by construction,
and so we conclude that v E u01 . This proves the Lemma.

Suppose that λ ∈ C omp r,n is of type α. Then we define the Enα (q)-permutation module
M (λ) as the following right ideal of Enα (q)
M (λ) := Eλ x λ Enα (q) ⊆ Enα (q).

(77)

We also have a specialized version of the permutation module that we denote the
same way
M (λ) := Eλ x λ EnK,α (q) ⊆ EnK,α (q).
(78)
M (λ) is a generalization of the permutation modules that appear in the representation
theory of the symmetric group, the Hecke algebra, the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, and
so on, see [DipperJamMathas] and the references therein. For any s ∈ RStd(λ), we
introduce xs := Eλ x λ g d (s ) ∈ M (λ) and define r i = r is , c i = c is , p i = p is via s (r i , c i , p i ) = i .

We then have the following Lemma which describes the Enα (q)-module (or EnK,α (q)module) structure on M (λ).
Lemma 10

(1) The set {xs | s ∈ RStd(λ)} is a basis for M (λ), over S or K.

(2) Let s ∈ RStd(λ). Then

(79)

P ROOF. Using 45, we get that the set {Eλ g w | w ∈ Sn } generates M (λ) over S. On the
other hand, for w ∈ Sn we have the decomposition w = w 0 d (s ) with w 0 ∈ Sλ and
s ∈ RStd(λ), and from this it follows via 55 that
Eλ x λ g w = q `(w 0 ) Eλ x λ g s = q `(w 0 ) xs .

(80)

Hence in fact {xs | s ∈ RStd(λ)} generates M (λ) over S. In the expansion of xs in terms
of Eλ g w, s we know that Eλ g d (s ) appears exactly once, since the d (s )'s are distinguished
coset representatives for Sλ in Sn , whereas the other terms are of the form Eλ g d (s ) g w
for w ∈ Sλ . These elements all belong to the basis for Enα (q) given in 45, and are all
distinct, and so the xs 's are linearly independent, proving (1).
We next prove (2), where we first consider xs e i . Here we have that
xs e i = Eλ g d (s ) e i = g d (s ) E A λ d (s ) e i

(81)

and so the formula for xs e i follows from Proposition 3. Let us then consider xs g i
when p i = p i +1 . If r i = r i +1 then we have d (s )s i = s j d (s ) for some s j ∈ Sλ , and so
xs g i = q xs via 80. If r i < r i +1 then d (s )s i > d (s ) and so xs g i = xs si from the definition
of xs si . If r i > r i +1 then d (s )s i < d (s ). We can then choose a reduced expression for
d (s ) ending in s i and so
3
 ́
xs g i = Eλ g d (s ) g i = Eλ g d (s si ) g i2 = Eλ g d (s si ) 1 + (q − q −1 )e i g i = xs si + (q − q −1 )xs (82)
where we used the quadratic relation 34 for the third equality, and the formula for x s e i
for the last equality. Finally, if p i 6= p i +1 then either d (s )s i > d (s ) or d (s )s i < d (s ) and
so we can repeat the previous arguments, with the only difference that the second
term in 82 disappears. These arguments work over K as well and so the Lemma is
proved,

There is another kind of permutation module that we shall need. Suppose that
Λ = (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α). Then we define the permutation module M (Λ) as the following
right ideal of Enα (q)
M (Λ) := Eλ x λ b μ Enα (q) ⊆ Enα (q).
(83)
Once again there is a specialized version of M (Λ) obtained by replacing Enα (q) with
EnK,α (q). The only difference between M (Λ) and M (λ) is the factor b μ and so we have
M (Λ) ⊆ M (λ), with the inclusion being strict in general. For M (Λ) we have the following Lemma.
©
a
Lemma 11 Let Λ ∈ Ln (α). Let m t be as in 63. Then the set m t | t ∈ RStd(Λ) is an
S-basis (or a K-basis) for M (Λ).
P ROOF. For w ∈ Sn we have the decomposition w = w 0 d (t ) with w 0 ∈ Sλ and t ∈
RStd(λ) and hence, arguing as in 80, we get
Eλ x λ b μ g w = Eλ x λ b μ g w 0 g t = Eλ x λ g w 0 b μ g t = q `(w 0 ) Eλ x λ b μ g t .

(84)

Hence Eλ x λ b μ g t  ̄ t ∈ RStd(λ) generates M (Λ) over S, but the appearing t may not
be increasing in the sense of the definition of RStd(Λ). On the other hand, if t is not
increasing we can find B u ∈ Sm such that the multitableau u ∗ t ∈ RStd(Λ) defined by
d (u ∗ t ) = B u d (t )

(85)

becomes increasing; here Sm
Λ = Sm 1 × . . . × Sm s is the subgroup of Sn introduced in
48. We then get

Eλ x λ b μ g t = Eλ x λ b μ B−1

where we for the second equality used Lemma 54 of [EspRy]. Suppose μ = (μ(1) , . . . , μ(s) )
:= Sμ(1) × . . . × Sμ(s) the corresponding diagonal Young subgroup
and denote by Sm

of Sm
Λ . It gives rise to a diagonal decomposition of B u that is B u = (B u )0 d (u) where
m
(B u )0 ∈ SΛ,μ and u is a row standard μ-multitableau of the initial kind. Setting t =
(u ∗ t | u) ∈ Ln (α), we can now rewrite 86 as

Eλ x λ b μ Bu g u∗t = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g u∗t = m t .

(87)

Thus we have proved that the set {m t } generates M (Λ). To show that it is linearly
independent we argue as follows. Suppose that s = (s | u), that is
m s = Eλ x λ b μ Bd (u) g d (s ) .

(88)

We know that u is row standard of the initial kind and therefore b μ Bd (u) expands as a
sum of terms of the form Bu d (u) where u 0 ∈ Sm
Λ,μ . But using Lemma 54 of [EspRy] we
0
get that
(89)
Bu0 d (u) g d (s ) = g B u d (u)d (s ) .
0

We now note that the multitableau v corresponding to B u0 d (u)d (s ), in other words v
given by d (v ) = B u0 d (u)d (s ), is a row standard λ-tableau since it is obtained from t by
permuting components with equal λ(i ) 's and so m s expands as a sum of terms of the
form Eλ g xB d (u)d (s ) where u 0 ∈ Sm
Λ,μ and x ∈ Sλ . These expansions are distinct for
u0

distinct pairs (s | u) and so the set {m s } is linearly independent, as claimed. Hence it
is an S-basis, and therefore also a K-basis, for M (Λ).


We next give a description of the action of Enα (q) on {m s }. We first introduce the
following useful notation. Let s ∈ RStd(λ) and let let s i ∈ Σn ⊆ Sn be a simple transposition. Then we define s * s i via
(
s
if r i = r i +1
s * s i :=
(90)
s s i if r i 6= r i +1 .
This extends to an action of Sn on RStd(λ) that we denote (s , w) 7→ s * w. We extend
this further to Ln (α) as follows. Let s = (s | u) ∈ Ln (α) and suppose that Shape(t(p i ) ) =
Shape(t(p i +1 ) ). Then we define a transposition τi ∈ Sm
Λ via τi = (p i , p i +1 ). For s ∈
RStd(λ) we set m i := min(Shape(t(p i ) ). Using the notation τi ∗ s introduced in 85 we
then define


(s * s i | u)


 (s * s | u)

s*s i :=

if Shape(t(p i ) ) 6= Shape(t(p i +1 ) )
if Shape(t(p i ) ) = Shape(t(p i +1 ) ) and {m i , m i +1 } 6= {i , i + 1}
if Shape(t(p i ) ) = Shape(t(p i +1 ) ) and {m i , m i +1 } = {i , i + 1}.
(91)
One checks that these formulas extend to an action of Sn on RStd(Λ). They have
their origin in the straightening procedure that carries s s i to an increasing row standard tableaux. Here are two examples, corresponding to the last case in 91:

P ROOF. The proof of (2) is analogous to the corresponding statement for xs e i in Lemma
10, in detail
m s e i = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g d (s ) e i = x λ b μ Bu g d (s ) E A λ d (s ) e i
(94)
and we conclude via Proposition 3.
We therefore consider (1) where we first focus on the case p i = p i +1 . If r i = r i +1 we
have d (s )s i = s j d (s ) for some s j ∈ Sλ , and so
m s g i = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g d (s ) g i = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g j g d (s ) .

(95)

But s j is of the form s j = d (t ) where t is a multitableau of the initial kind and so 95
becomes
x λ g j b μ Bu g d (s ) = q x λ b μ Bu g d (s ) = qm s ,
(96)
as claimed. The two other cases when p i = p i +1 , that is r i > r i +1 or r i < r i +1 , are
proved the same way as in Lemma 10.
We then finally consider the case p i 6= p i +1 . Arguing as in Lemma 10 we have here
m s g i = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g d (s ) g i = Eλ x λ b μ Bu g d (s si )

(97)

which is equal to m s*si in all cases except {m i , m i +1 } = {i , i + 1} where t is not increasing. But in that case, arguing as we did for 86 and 87 we can rewrite 97 as follows
Eλ x λ b μ Bu g d (s si ) = Eλ x λ b μ Bu Bτi Bτi g d (s si ) = Eλ x λ b μ Bu*τi g d (τi ∗(s si )) = m s*si

(98)



as claimed.

Given the basis for M (Λ), we now introduce a bilinear form (*, *)Λ on M (Λ) as follows
(
1 if s = t
:=
(m s , m t )Λ
(99)
0 otherwise.
It is a generalization of the bilinear forms on the classical permutation modules,
see for example [DipperJamMathas].
Lemma 13 The following statements hold.
(1) (*, *)Λ is symmetric and nondegenerate.
(2) (*, *)Λ is invariant in the sense that for all m, m 1 ∈ M (Λ) and a ∈ Enα (q) or a ∈
EnK,α (q) we have that (ma, m 1 )Λ = (m, m 1 a ∗ )Λ .
P ROOF. (1) follows from the fact that {m s } is an orthogonal basis for M (Λ). To
show (2) we may assume that m = m s , m 1 = m t and a = g i or a = e i and must check
(m s a, m t )Λ = (m s , m t a)Λ for all possibilities of r sj , c sj , p sj , r tj , c tj , p tj and j = i , i +1. Here
the number of cases is reduced to the half by the symmetry of (*, *)Λ . Moreover if p si =
p si +1 and p ti 6= p ti +1 then it follows immediately from Lemma 12 that (m s e i , m t )Λ =
(m s , m t e i )Λ = 0 and that (m s g i , m t )Λ = (m s , m t g i )Λ = 0 and so we only need consider
the cases where p si = p si +1 and p ti = p ti +1 or p si 6= p si +1 and p ti 6= p ti +1 . In the rest of the
proof we shall use the formulas of Lemma 12 repeatedly.
Let us first consider a = g i and suppose that p si = p si +1 and p ti = p ti +1 . If r is < p si +1
and r it < p it+1 we have (m s g i , m t )Λ = (m s*si , m t )Λ = δs*si ,t whereas (m s , m t g i )Λ =
(m s , m t g i )Λ = δs,t*si , where δ is the Kronecker delta, and so (m s g i , m t )Λ = (m s , m t g i )Λ .
If r is < p is+1 and r it > p it+1 then again (m s g i , m t )Λ = δs*si ,t whereas (m s g i , m t )Λ =
(m s , m t g i )Λ = (m s , m t*si + (q − q −1 )m t )Λ = δs,t*si , since s 6= t, and so the two sides
coincide.
If r is > p si +1 and r it > p ti +1 we have (m s g i , m t )Λ = (m s*si + (q − q −1 )m s , m t )Λ =
δs*si ,t +(q−q −1 )δs,t and (m s , m t g i )Λ = (m s , m t*si +(q−q −1 )m t )Λ = δs,t*si +(q−q −1 )δs,t .
Once again, the two sides coincide.
We next consider a = g i but suppose that p si 6= p si +1 and p ti 6= p ti +1 . Here we have
(m s g i , m t )Λ = (m s*si , m t )Λ = δs*si ,t and similarly (m s , m t g i )Λ = (m s , m t*si )Λ = δs,t*si
and so the two side also coincide in this case.
17

Finally we consider the case a = e i and must check that (m s e i , m t )Λ = (x s , m t e i )Λ .
But if p si = p si +1 and p ti = p ti +1 we have m s e i = m s and m t e i = m t , and otherwise, if
p is 6= p is+1 and p it 6= p it+1 , we have m s e i = 0 and m t e i = 0. Hence the two sides also
coincide in this case. This finishes the proof of the Lemma.

We have the following crucial Lemma.
Lemma 14 Suppose that Λ = (λ | μ) and that s, t ∈ Std(Λ). Then we have
(m t n t0 s0 , m s )Λ 6= 0 or equivalently (m t , m s n s0 t0 )Λ 6= 0.

(100)

In particular m t n t0 s0 6= 0 and m s n s0 t0 6= 0.
P ROOF. Suppose that s = (s | u) and t = (t | v). Then the same chain of equalities that
took us from 73 to 76 in Lemma 9, but postmultiplied with Bd (u0 ) g d (s 0 ) , gives us
m t n t0 s0 = Eλ x

(101)

Eλ x λ g w λ y λ0 b μ Bw μ c μ0 Bd (u0 ) g d (s 0 )

where we used 10 for the last equality: note that t 0 and v are both of the initial kind.
Using the invariance property of the previous Lemma 13 we get from this that
(m t n t0 s0 , m s )Λ = (m t n t0 s0 g d∗(s ) B∗d (u) , m tΛ )Λ =
(Eλ x λ g w λ y λ0 b μ Bw μ c μ0 Bd (u0 ) g d (s 0 ) g d∗(s ) B∗d (u) , m tΛ )Λ

(102)

In view of 25, and the remarks preceding 25, we have decompositions d (s 0 ) = d (s 00 )d (t )
and d (s ) = d (s 0 )d (t ) and hence we can use Lemma 7 repeatedly on a reduced expres∗
sion of d (t ) to rewrite Eλ g d (s 0 ) g d∗(s ) = Eλ g d (s 0 ) g d∗(s ) = Eλ g w
and so 102 becomes

(Eλ x λ g w λ y λ0 b μ Bw μ c μ0 , Eλ x λ g w λ b μ Bw μ )Λ = (m tΛ y λ0 c μ0 , m t )Λ

(103)

Λ

Note that 103 does not depend on s and t, only on Λ. The expressions in 103 only involve multitableaux of the initial kind and so the Lemma is reduced to the corresponding Hecke algebra statement. To be precise, for λ ∈ P ar n , each element w of the double coclass Sλ w λ Sλ0 has a unique decomposition w = w 1 w λ w 2 where w 1 ∈ Sλ and
w 2 ∈ Sλ0 and moreover `(w) = `(w 1 )+`(w λ )+`(w 2 ), see Lemma 1.6 of [DipperJames].
Applying this on Sλ and Sμ we conclude that m tΛ occurs exactly once in the expansion of m tΛ y λ0 c μ0 , corresponding to the '1'-term in both y λ0 and c μ0 , and so 103 is
equal to 1. The Lemma is proved.

T HE TENSOR SPACE V ⊗n MODULE FOR En (q)

In this section we realize the tensor space V ⊗n module for En (q), introduced in [Ry],
as a sum of the permutation modules M (λ). When the dimension of V is sufficiently
large, it is known that V ⊗n is a faithful En (q)-module, but here we are interested in
the general case where V ⊗n may not be faithful. Using the results from the previous
section we determine the annihilator ideal in En (q) of V ⊗n . In turns out that is has
a nice description in terms of the dual cellular basis {n st }. It is a main point of our
constructions and proofs that they work for arbitrary K.
Let V be the free S-module with basis
B := {v is | 1 ≤ i ≤ N , 1 ≤ s ≤ r }
that is V is of dimension r N . We then define linear maps E, G ∈ EndS (V ⊗2 ) via

We extend them to linear maps Ei and Gi acting in the tensor space V ⊗n by letting
E and G act in the i 'th and i + 1'st factors. The following is Theorem 1 of [Ry]
Theorem 15 The rules e i 7→ Ei and g i 7→ Gi endow V ⊗n with the structure of an En (q)module.
In the case of EnC (q) it was proved in [Ry] that the specialized tensor module V C,⊗n is
faithful when r, N ≥ n. In [EspRy] this faithfulness statement was generalized to V ⊗n
itself, but still only for r, N ≥ n; in fact it does not hold otherwise, as we shall see.
Let seqN be the set of sequences i = (i 1 , . . . , i n ) of integers where each i j belongs
to {1, . . . , N }, and let similarly seqr be the set of sequences s = (s 1 , . . . , s n ) where each s j
belongs to {1, . . . , r }. For such i and s we define
s

Then the set {v i | i ∈ seqN , s ∈ seqr } is a basis for V ⊗n .
To s ∈ seqr we associate sets I j := {i | s i = j }, for j = 1, . . . , r . The I j 's may be empty,
but leaving out the empty I j 's we obtain a set partition in SP n , that we denote A s ,
and we say that s is of type α if A s is of© type α. For example, if r = 4, n =
a 13 and
s = (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2) then A s = {1, 4, 8, 11}, {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13}, {10} , and so
s is of type (8, 4, 1).

P ROOF. Statement (1) is immediate from the definition of E A given in 38, so let us
s
prove (2). Suppose that A = {I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I k }. Then by construction, the vector v i belongs
to the right hand side of (2) exactly when any two terms s i and s j of s coincide iff i
and j are in the same block I l of A. For example, if r = 3 and A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}}
then the s satisfying A s = A are the following ones
(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), (2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3), (3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2), (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
(1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1).

that v ∈ E A V ⊗n and consider its expansion v = αi v i with coefficients αi ∈ S. By (1)

by part (3) of Proposition 3 we also have that E A s 0 v = 0, and this gives the desired

For N any natural number we define C omp r,n,≤N ⊆ C omp r,n (resp. P ar r,n,≤N ⊆
P ar r,n ) as the set of multicompositions (resp. multipartitions) λ = (λ(1) , λ(2) , . . . , λ(r ) )
such that each λ(i ) is of length less than N .
Suppose now that λ ∈ C omp r,n,≤N and that t ∈ RStd(λ). Then we define i t =
(i 1 , . . . , i n ) ∈ seqN by letting i j be the row number of the node in t containing j , and
similarly we define st = (s 1 , . . . , s n ) ∈ seqr by letting s j be the component number of
the node in t containing j . For example if

The following Theorem relates the tensor space module V

Theorem 17 Let V be the free S-module (or K-vector space) of dimension r N with
basis as in 104. Suppose that λ ∈ C omp r,n,≤N is of type α ∈ P ar n and that α is of
length r .
(1) The S-linear map ιλ : M (λ) → V ⊗n given by ιλ (xt ) = vt for t ∈ RStd(λ), is an embedding of Enα (q)-modules.
(2) Identifying M (λ) with φλ (M (λ)) we have M (λ) ⊆ Eα V ⊗n and a direct sum decomposition of Enα (q)-modules

For any natural number N we define Ln,≤N (α) as the subset of Ln (α) consisting of
the pairs (λ | μ) such that the components λ(k) of λ all have less than N columns, and
we set Ln,N (α) := Ln (α)\Ln,≤N (α). We can now give the main Theorem of our paper.

Theorem 18 Let V be as in 104 with basis B and suppose that α ∈ P ar n is of length r .
Let I ⊆ Enα (q) be the annihilator ideal of the action of Enα (q) in Eα V ⊗n . Then I is free

P ROOF. Let us focus on1⁄2the S-case, since the K-case is3⁄4done the same way. Let I1 ⊆
Enα (q) be the S-span of n st | s, t ∈ Std(Λ), Λ ∈ Ln,N (α) . We first observe that I1 is a
two-sided ideal in Enα (q), as one sees from the n st -version of Lemma 56 of [EspRy]:
the number of columns of the components never decreases under the straightening
procedure of that Lemma. We first prove that I1 ⊆ I, that is for a basis element n st
of I1 we prove that M (λ)n st = 0 for any M (λ) appearing in 112, or equivalently that
M (λ)n st = 0. But since I1 is an ideal, in order to show M (λ)n st = 0 it is enough to
show x λ n st = 0. Note that λ may not be a multipartition, only a multicomposition,
but in any case t λ is of the initial kind and so we can use Lemma 4.4 of [Murphy95]
to rewrite x λ as a linear combination of xs 1t 1 where s 1 and t 1 are λ1 -multitableaux of
the initial kind, for λ1 an r -multipartition such that λ1 D λ. In general, for any σ ∈ Sr
there is an Enα (q)-isomorphism M (λ) ∼
= M (λσ ) where λσ is the r -multicomposition
σ
obtained from λ by permuting the components, as one checks using Lemma 10, and
so we may assume that λ1 is increasing. Moreover, since λ1 D λ and λ ∈ C omp r,n,≤N
we have λ1 ∈ P ar r,n,≤N . We now observe that xs 1t 1 is also of the form m s1 t1 , where
s1 = (s 1 | u1 ) and t1 = (t 1 | v1 ) and where the components of Shape(u1 ) and Shape(v1 )
are all one-column partitions, in particular d (u1 ) = d (v1 ) = 1. But from Lemma 9 we
know that m s1 t1 n st 6= 0 implies t1 E s0 which is impossible since all components of λ1
have less then N rows, whereas at least one component of Shape(s 0 ) has more then
N rows; here s = (s | u) for some u. Hence m s1 t1 n st = 0 and so the inclusion I1 ⊆ I is
proved.
Suppose now that the inclusion I1 ⊆ I is strict. Then there exists n ∈ I \ I1 . Our
plan is then to construct a λ ∈ C omp r,n,≤N such that |A λ | = α and M (λ)n 6= 0, which
is a contradiction since M (λ) is a direct summand of Eα V ⊗n by Lemma 17. We shall
do so by showing that there exists a Λ := (λ | μ) ∈ Ln (α) with λ ∈ C omp r,n,≤N , such
that M (Λ)n 6= 0. This gives the desired contradiction since M (Λ) ⊆ M (λ).
P
In order to do so we consider the expansion n = s,t∈Std(Λ),Λ∈L(α) λst n st . We may
assume that Shape(s) ∈ Ln,≤N (α) for all (s, t) occurring in the expansion of n: otherwise if Shape(s) ∈ Ln,N (α) we subtract the corresponding term λst n st from n and
still get an element in I1 ⊆ I, by the first part of the proof. We now choose (smi n , tmi n )
with λsmi n tmi n 6= 0 and minimal in the sense that if s E smi n , t E tmi n and λst 6= 0 then
(s, t) = (smi n , tmi n ). Let smi n = (s mi n | umi n ) and let Λmi n = Shape(smi n ) = (λmi n |
μmi n ). We then have λ0mi n ∈ C omp r,n,≤N of type α and so we may consider the perof
and m t0
mutation module M (Λ0mi n ). We are interested in the elements m s0
mi n

mi n

M (Λ0mi n ). Using the minimality of (smi n , tmi n ), together with Lemma 9 and the invariance of the bilinear form, we get

which is nonzero by Lemma 14. Hence M (Λ0mi n )n 6= 0, as needed. This proves the
Theorem.

In view of the above Theorem, it is natural to consider the following quotient algebra

α
ET Lα
n,N (q) := En (q)/I

(115)

where I is the ideal from 113. It is a generalization of the 'generalized Temperley-Lieb'
algebras introduced in [Härterich]. For K a field, there is also a specialized version of
K,α
α
ET Lα
n,N (q) that we denote ET Ln,N (q). By construction ET Ln,N (q) is the largest quoα

tient of En (q) acting faithfully on Eα V . We have the following Corollary to Theorem
18.

and define PT Lα

P ROOF. In Proposition 4.5 of [Juyu] it is shown that the e i e i +1 St i 's are all conjugate
to each other in Enα (q) and so the Ji 's are equal ideals, which proves the first statement. For simplicity we write J = J1 . We must then show that J = I where I is
the ideal described in Theorem 18. The inclusion J ⊆ I follows from the fact that
e n−1 e n St n−1 belongs the basis for I given in 113. In fact we have e n−1 e n St n−1 = n tΛ tΛ
where Λ = (λ | μ) is chosen such that all components of λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r ) ) are onecolumn partitions, except λ(r ) which is of the form λ(r ) = (3, 1s ) for some s, and such
that all components of μ are one-column partitions. For the other inclusion J ⊇ I we
consider a basis element n st for I, as given in 113. Letting Shape(s) = (λ | μ), there
is a component of λ with more than three columns and so there is an i such that
e i e i +1 St i is a factor of n st . This shows J ⊇ I and concludes the proof of the Corollary.

Remark. Using Corollary 19 we can determine the dimension of ET Lα
n,N (q), and
L
(q),
since
it
is
the
cardinality
of
hence also of PT Ln (q) := α∈P ar n PT Lα

n st | s, t ∈ Std(Λ), Λ ∈ Ln,≤2 (α) .

α∈P ar n

We have for example
dim PT L3 (q) = 29,

dim PT L4 (q) = 334,

dim PT L5 (q) = 5512.

(118)

These values are confirmed by Juyuamaya and Papi's MAGMA calculations and by Espinoza's preprint, [Esp], that contains a closed general formula for dim PT Ln (q).
Remark. There should be a diagrammatic calculus associated with PT Ln (q) that it
would be interesting to study.
