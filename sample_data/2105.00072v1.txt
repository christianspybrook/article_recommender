Abstract
Using the renormalization group approach, we consider the O(N )âŠ—O(M ) model in four and more dimensions.
We find that independently on N and M , for N â‰¥ M â‰¥ 2, a transition can be of both the first and second
order. In d > 4, we also cannot exclude a pseudo-first-order behavior. As specific physically interesting
cases, we consider the lattice version of the O(2) âŠ— O(2), O(3) âŠ— O(2) and O(3) âŠ— O(3) sigma models on a
four dimensional hypercubic lattice. In all these cases, we find a distinct first-order transition.

The distinction between first-order and continuous
phase transitions is obvious and consists in the presence (or absence) of a jump in an order parameter
p âˆˆ G/H and the internal energy. The phenomenological Landau theory formulates conditions based on
group theoretical properties of an order parameter
when a transition can be continuous [1, 2]. The most
famous condition is that the symmetric part of the
cubic term of an order parameter should not contain
the unit representation of the full symmetry group G.
However, accounting for critical fluctuations, usually
based on the renormalization group (RG) approach,
makes these conditions necessary but not sufficient.
In particular, in three dimensions d = 3 (and generally, in 2 < d < 4), a continuous transition corresponds to an attractive (stable) fixed point of RG
equations, but such a point may be absent. In this
case, one commonly says about a fluctuation-induced
first-order transition. At first time [3] (see also [4]),
it has been observed in the Abelian Higgs model [5].

In four dimensions, the fluctuational theory of
phase transitions predicts that a continuous transition is described by the Gaussian fixed point with
distinctive critical exponents independent on group
theoretical properties of an order parameter. These
exponents are perturbed by logarithmical corrections
arising in the upper critical dimension d = 4. Below four dimensions, a critical point of a continuous
transition may correspond to a non-trivial (not free)
conformal field theory [6], but in d â‰¥ 4 the theory of
critical phenomena, at least without supersymmetry,
predicts only free theories. There are rigorous proofs
of the triviality of the Ï†4 theory for d > 4 [7, 8, 9],
while for d = 4 such a proof is not exist, and the role
of perturbative logarithmic corrections is discussed
(see, e.g. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]).
Recently [17], using the specific non-perturbative
RG approach (so-called higher-order tensor RG) it
has been found the weak first-order transition in the
four-dimensional Ising model. The hidden heat of the
transition is so small that it is necessary to consider
huge size lattices (up to 10244 ) to discover it. This
makes it very difficult to check the result with other

methods, for example with Monte Carlo simulations.
Offhand, one can propose two ways to explain this
result. The first way is that a transition is of pseudofirst order, i.e. the sings of a first-order transition
(e.g., a jump in the internal energy) are observed only
on finite-size lattices and disappear in the thermodynamic limit. In terms of RG, the pseudo-first order
behavior corresponds to the situation when a RGtrajectory starting in the stability region (where the
potential is stable) passes through the region boundary but tends to the fixed point locating inside the
region or on the boundary. To stabilize the potential, one should add next terms resolved by symmetry in the order parameter expansion, like Ï†6 . It is
these terms (in accordance with the Landau theory)
that correspond to the appearance of the observed
jump in the internal energy on finite-size lattices. But
actually, such a situation cannot be realized in the
four-dimensional O(N ) model (or other models with
unique Ï†4 term), where the boundary of the stability
region is a single point, namely the Gaussian fixed
point.
If the transition is indeed of the first order, then
one can expect the presence of any non-perturbative
effects (remind, it is believed that perturbative corrections keep the theory trivial). The most obvious
non-perturbative aspect of the Ising model is that
fluctuations are topological defects, domain walls.
Of cause, the presence of topological defects in itself does not guarantee the appearance of new effects
in the critical behavior. E.g., monopole-like defects
in the three-dimensional O(3) model are not relevant [18, 19], and in general, the 3D O(N ) model
is successfully described by perturbative approaches,
although it can contains topological defects of any
types. Nevertheless, topological defects may affect
the critical behavior, and to test such a possibility
it is useful to consider at least two cases: a system
with the order parameter space G/H = Z2 âŠ— M,
where M is a connected homogeneous space, and a
system with topological defects of another type affecting the critical behavior. Both cases are present
in the O(N ) âŠ— O(M ) model.
The order parameter space in this model is a Stiefel
manifold VN,M â‰¡ O(N )/O(N âˆ’ M ) corresponding to
a set of orientations of M N -dimensional vectors. In

the particular case M = N , the order parameter contains the discrete part equivalent to the parameter of
the Ising model G/H = O(N ) â‰¡ Z2 âŠ— SO(N ), so one
should expect that a transition is of the first order.
Another interesting feature of this model is that in
the cases N = M and N = M + 1 the fundamental group is non-trivial Ï€1 (VN,M ) = Z2 for M > 1,
and so-called Z2 -vortices are present. Remind that
usual vortices play a crucial role in the critical behavior of systems from the universality class of the O(2)
model. In this case, perturbative fluctuations can be
linearized (by the Berezinskii â€“ Villain transformation [20, 21, 22]) and integrated out, so the resulting
system has a transition from the same universality
class. Of course, this is due to the fact that SO(2) is
abelian.
The influence of non-abelian Z2 -vortices on the
thermal and critical behavior is observable in all dimensions 2 â‰¤ d < 4. Thus, in two dimensions these
defects lead to a rather sharp change in the behavior
of the V3,2 model from low-temperature, describing
by the O(4) sigma model, to some high-temperature
[23, 24, 25, 26]. In the V3,3 model, vortices changes
an Ising-like transition to a first-order one [27, 28].
In 2 +  dimensions, a transition of the V3,2 model
belongs to the class universality of the O(4) model
[29, 30, 31], but close to  â‰ˆ 1 a transition becomes
of the first order [32]. In three dimensions, the VN,N
model has a distinct first-order transition, but the
situation for the V3,2 model is still controversial. So,
the 4 âˆ’ Îµ [33, 34, 35, 36], 1/N [37, 38] expansions
and the non-perturbative RG [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]
predict the first order, while the perturbative (fixeddimensional) RG [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] and the
conformal bootstrap [52, 53, 54] declare a secondorder transition.
Monte Carlo simulations for three-dimensional
models from the universality class of the V3,2 model
also give controversial results (a first-order transition in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a stackedtriangular lattice [55] and helimagnets [56], see however the recent work [57]). Nevertheless, direct simulations of the lattice version of the O(N ) âŠ— O(M )
sigma model predict a distinct first-order transition
for the V2,2 [58, 59], V3,2 [60] and V3,3 [61, 62] cases.
These results are not a defect of the model. For

expect that the same effects, which change the order

suitable reliable methods.
