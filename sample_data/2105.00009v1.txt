ABSTRACT
Magnetic reconnection is invoked as one of the primary mechanisms to produce energetic particles. We employ large-scale three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in
magnetically-dominated (σ = 10) pair plasmas to study the energization physics of high-energy particles. We identify a novel acceleration mechanism that only operates in 3D. For weak guide fields, 3D
plasmoids / flux ropes extend along the z direction of the electric current for a length comparable to
their cross-sectional radius. Unlike in 2D simulations, where particles are buried in plasmoids, in 3D
we find that a fraction of particles with γ & 3σ can escape from plasmoids by moving along z, and so
they can experience the large-scale fields in the upstream region. These "free" particles preferentially
move in z along Speiser-like orbits sampling both sides of the
√ layer, and are accelerated linearly in time
- their Lorentz factor scales as γ ∝ t, in contrast to γ ∝ t in 2D. The energy gain rate approaches
∼ eErec c, where Erec ' 0.1B0 is the reconnection electric field and B0 the upstream magnetic field.
The spectrum of free particles is hard, dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.5 , contains ∼ 20% of the dissipated magnetic
energy independently of domain size, and extends up to a cutoff energy scaling linearly with box size.
Our results demonstrate that relativistic reconnection in GRB and AGN jets may be a promising
mechanism for generating ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

1. INTRODUCTION

High-energy emission from pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe) and the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) raises a question about the origin of the emitting particles. Outflows
from these compact objects are believed to be dominated by Poynting flux, i.e., the magnetic energy density is greater than the plasma rest-mass energy density.
In GRB and AGN jets, magnetic field lines can reverse
on small scales, as a result of the nonlinear stages of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities (Romanova
& Lovelace 1992; Begelman 1998; Spruit et al. 2001;
Lyutikov & Blandford 2003; Giannios & Spruit 2006;
Böttcher 2019). Alternatively, the jet can carry current
sheets from its base, like in pulsar winds (Lyubarsky &
Kirk 2001; Drenkhahn & Spruit 2002; Drenkhahn 2002;
Kirk & Skjaeraasen 2003; Giannios & Uzdensky 2019;
zhan2966@purdue.edu
lsironi@astro.columbia.edu

Cerutti et al. 2020). In both cases, field reversals on
small scales are prone to magnetic reconnection, driving
heating and particle acceleration.
Magnetic reconnection, and in particular the "relativistic" regime where the magnetic energy dominates
over the plasma rest mass energy, is now established as
an efficient mechanism of particle acceleration. Threedimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which offer a self-consistent description of plasma kinetics, have
shown that relativistic reconnection naturally produces
power-law spectra of accelerated particles (Zenitani &
Hoshino 2008; Kagan et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2014; Sironi
& Spitkovsky 2014; Werner & Uzdensky 2017; Guo et al.
2020). The origin of the power-law particle spectrum in
two-dimensional relativistic reconnection has been recently investigated by, e.g., Guo et al. (2014); Uzdensky (2020). Yet basic questions, such as how particles
are accelerated to high energies, the time scale of acceleration, and whether these processes proceed up to
larger (fluid) scales, remain debated. The answer to
these questions is critical when evaluating the potential
of relativistic reconnection for explaining high-energy as-

2
trophysical phenomena in relativistic outflows (e.g., the
emission of very-high-energy photons or the acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, UHECRs). For
instance, Giannios (2010) proposed that protons escaping the reconnection layer can undergo first-order Fermi
acceleration due to repeated deflections by the converging reconnection upstream flows, and can reach energies
up to E ∼ 1020 eV in GRB and powerful AGN jets.
In this context, it is critical to determine from first
principles the acceleration rate of the highest energy
particles. PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection
showed that the reconnection layer fragments into a
chain of plasmoids / flux ropes (e.g., Sironi et al. 2016).
Recent large-scale 2D PIC simulations by Petropoulou &
Sironi (2018) and Hakobyan et al. (2020) suggested that
the particles populating the high-energy spectral cutoff
reside in a strongly magnetized ring around the plasmoid core. Their acceleration is driven by the increase
in the local field strength, coupled with the conservation
of the first adiabatic invariant. They also found
√that the
high-energy spectral cutoff grows in time as ∝ t, which
appears too slow to explain, e.g., UHECR acceleration.
These conclusions may change in a 3D geometry,
which would account for the finite length of plasmoids
along the z direction of the electric current. In 3D, the
z-invariance postulated by 2D simulations can be broken by the oblique tearing instability (e.g., Daughton
et al. 2011) and the drift kink instability (e.g., Zenitani & Hoshino 2007), which may modify the 2D picture of particle energization. While in 2D particles are
efficiently trapped within plasmoids, 3D simulations of
non-relativistic reconnection (Dahlin et al. 2017; Li et al.
2019) have shown that self-generated turbulence and
chaotic magnetic fields allow high-energy particles to
access multiple acceleration sites within the reconnected
plasma, resulting in faster acceleration rates than in 2D.
In this work, we perform 3D PIC simulations of
relativistic reconnection in a magnetically-dominated
electron-positron plasma, with magnetization (i.e., the
ratio of magnetic energy density to plasma rest mass energy density) σ = 10. Our inflow/outflow boundary conditions allow to reliably study the statistical steady state
of the system, beyond the initial transient. We identify
and characterize a novel acceleration mechanism, unique
to 3D. We find that a fraction of particles with γ & 3σ
can escape from plasmoids by moving along z and experience the large-scale fields in the "upstream" region.1
1

We point out that the mechanism discussed by Li et al. (2019) in
non-relativistic reconnection relied on particles moving between
multiple acceleration sites in the reconnection "downstream", i.e.,
in the post-reconnection plasma.

The momentum of these "free" particles is preferentially
oriented along z. They undergo Speiser-like deflections
by the converging upstream flows (as envisioned by Giannios (2010); see also de Gouveia dal Pino & Lazarian
(2005)), and are accelerated linearly in time - their
Lorentz factor scales as γ ∝ t. The energy gain rate approaches ∼ eErec c, where Erec ' 0.1B0 is the reconnection electric field and B0 the upstream magnetic field.
The spectrum of free particles is hard and can be modeled as a power law dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.5 - whose slope we
justify analytically - extending up to a cutoff energy
that scales linearly with box size. We find that the free
particles account for ∼ 20% of the dissipated magnetic
energy, independently of domain size, yet their number
(as compared to the particle count in the downstream
plasma) decreases with increasing box size.
The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we
describe the simulation setup we employ. In Section 3,
we present our main results, as regard to the particle energy and momentum spectrum, the characterization of
particle orbits inside and outside the reconnection layer,
and the dependence on the size of the computational domain. In Section 4, we draw our conclusions and discuss
implications for astrophysical systems. We argue that
relativistic reconnection in GRB and AGN jets may be
a promising mechanism for generating UHECRs.
2. SIMULATION SETUP

We employ 3D PIC simulations performed with the
TRISTAN-MP code (Buneman 1993; Spitkovsky 2005).
The magnetic field is initialized in Harris sheet configuration, with the field along x reversing at y = 0. We
parameterize the field strength B0 by the magnetiza2
2
2
tion σ = Bp
0 /4πn0 mc = (ωc /ωp ) , where ωc = eB0 /mc
and ωp = 4πn0 e2 /m are respectively the Larmor frequency and the plasma frequency for the cold electronpositron plasma outside the layer, with density n0 .
The Alfvén
p speed is related to the magnetization as
vA /c = σ/ (σ + 1); we take σ = 10. In addition to the
reversing field, we initialize a uniform guide field along
z with strength Bg = 0.1 B0 . We have also explored a
case with zero guide field and found similar results (see
Tab. 1). We resolve the plasma skin depth c/ωp with
2.5 cells, and initialize an average of one particle in each
cell. We have also tested a larger value of four particles
per cell, finding no significant change in reconnection
rate, maximum energy, and particle spectra (for more
details, see Tab. 1). The numerical speed of light is 0.45
cells/timestep. We employ periodic boundary conditions in z, outflow boundary conditions in x, while along
y two injectors continuously introduce fresh plasma and
magnetic flux into the domain (for details see Sironi

3
et al. 2016; Sironi & Beloborodov 2020). As opposed to
the commonly-adopted triple-periodic boundaries, our
setup allows to evolve the system to arbitrarily long
times, so we can study the statistical steady state for
several Alfvénic crossing times.
We trigger reconnection near the center of the simulation domain (i.e., near x = y = 0, but along the whole
z extent), by removing the pressure of the hot particles
initialized in the current sheet, as in Sironi et al. (2016).
The characteristic x-length of this region is defined as
∆init . For our largest 3D simulation (see below), we
choose ∆init = 500c/ωp . For smaller boxes, we have
tested different values of ∆init , finding no difference in
our main results (see Tab. 1 for details).
For our reference 3D simulation, the box length in
x and z (respectively, Lx and Lz ) is ' 4000 cells ∼
1600 c/ωp , while the box extent along y increases over
time as the two injectors recede from the current sheet.
We also present results from a set of boxes with fixed Lx
but various Lz from 1600 c/ωp down to 12 c/ωp , and two
sets of experiments with a fixed ratio Lx /Lz (Lx /Lz = 1
and Lx /Lz = 2), but different box sizes. In the following, unless otherwise indicated, we employ our reference
box with Lx = 1560 c/ωp and Lz = 1613 c/ωp , and we
define L = 1560 c/ωp as our unit of length.
We have also performed a 2D simulation with identical physical and numerical parameters as our reference
3D run (aside from a choice of 16 particles per cell to
increase particle statistics), to emphasize 3D effects.
3. RESULTS

Fig.1 shows two snapshots of the 3D density structure
from our reference simulation 2 . The top panel refers to
ct/L ' 0.47, and shows the two reconnection fronts (see
the two overdense regions at |x| ∼ L/4) propagating
away from the center, at near the Alfvén speed. The
bottom panel of Fig.1 refers to a representative time
(ct/L ' 2.13) when the layer has achieved a statistical
steady state. The layer is fragmented into flux ropes of
various sizes, with comparable lengths in the z direction
as in the x − y plane. The finite extent of plasmoids
along the z direction, likely due to the relativistic driftkink instability (Zenitani & Hoshino 2007, 2008), plays a
fundamental role for the physics of high-energy particle
acceleration, as we describe below.
3D instabilities can also change the reconnection rate,
as compared to 2D. Fig.2 illustrates the temporal evolution of the reconnection rate ηrec ≡ vin /vA for both 2D
(blue) and 3D (red) simulations, where vin is the inflow

Figure 1. Two snapshots of density from our reference 3D
simulation. We show the density structure at a relatively
early time (top, t = 0.47 L/c), when reconnection fronts are
moving outwards, and at a later time (bottom, t = 2.13 L/c),
when the system has achieved a steady state. The upstream
plasma flows into the layer along y, while reconnection outflows move along x. The electric current is along the z direction, which is invariant in 2D simulations.

speed and vA ' c for magnetically-dominated plasmas.
The initial growth of the box-averaged reconnection rate
before ct/L ∼ 0.8 is just due to the increase of the region where reconnection is active (i.e., between the two
reconnection fronts). When the two reconnection fronts
exit the computational domain, the rate becomes quasisteady. The reconnection rate in 3D, ηrec ∼ 0.075, is
slower than in 2D, ηrec ∼ 0.12. In either case, the rate
is in reasonable agreement with analytical expectations
(Lyubarsky 2005).
The inflowing particles from the two sides of the layer
mix in the reconnection region, which we shall also
call "reconnected plasma" or "downstream" region. In
contrast, the pre-reconnection flow shall be called "up-

4
from the upstream region (M < M0 ). We expect that
our results will not change significantly as long as M0
is near 0.3 (e.g., between 0.25 and 0.35).
In the following of this section, we first study the particle energy and momentum spectra in the 3D simulation and identify that high energy particles preferentially move along the z-direction (Section 3.1). Then,
we track particles and investigate in detail their acceleration mechanism (Section 3.2). Finally, we investigate
the dependence of our results on the domain size, in order to show that the acceleration physics should operate
effectively out to larger scales (Section 3.3).

3D (red) and 2D (blue) simulations. The reconnection rate is
calculated by averaging the plasma inflow velocity (in units
of the speed of light) in the region 0.03L < y < 0.08L.

stream". To identify the region of reconnected plasma,
we define a "mixing" factor M:
M≡1−2

ntop
1
− ,
n
2

(1)

where ntop is the density of particles that started from
y > 0, while n is the total density. It follows that M = 1
represents the downstream plasma, where particles from
the two sides of the layer are well mixed, whereas M = 0
characterizes the upstream, where no mixing has occurred. We will use the mixing factor M to identify
whether a particle is located in the upstream or downstream region.
Using M as a criterion for separating upstream and
downstream regions, we study where particles of different energies are located. Fig. 3 shows histograms of
the particle Lorentz factor γ (horizontal axis) and mixing factor M (vertical axis) at time t = 2.37L/c, for
3D (left) and 2D (right) simulations. Both histograms
suggest that most of the low-energy particles (γ . 30)
are located in the downstream region (i.e., M near
unity). In 2D, all of the high-energy particles are also
located in well-mixed regions, i.e., in the downstream.
In agreement with earlier studies, high-energy particles
in 2D are trapped within plasmoids (Sironi et al. 2016;
Petropoulou & Sironi 2018; Hakobyan et al. 2020). In
contrast, a significant fraction of high-energy particles
(γ & 30) in the 3D simulation lie in low-mixing regions,
i.e., in the upstream. As we show below, these are particles that have escaped from reconnection plasmoids,
and are now being rapidly accelerated by the large-scale
upstream fields. In the following, we will take a threshold of M0 = 0.3 (horizontal red dotted line in the left
panel) to separate the downstream region (M > M0 )

3.1. Particle Spectra
A non-thermal power-law spectrum extending to high
energies is a well-established outcome of relativistic reconnection (e.g., Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014). Fig. 4
shows the positron momentum spectrum pz dN/dpz ,
where pz = γβz is the dimensionless 4-velocity along
z (βz is the particle z-velocity in units of the speed of
light). The spectrum is obtained by averaging between
t = 3.34L/c and 3.56L/c, when the system is in steady
state. The box-integrated spectrum of positrons with
pz > 0 (blue, indicated as pz+,box in the legend) can be
modeled for pz & 3 as a power law pz dN/dpz ∝ p−1
z .
The figure compares the momentum spectrum between positrons with pz > 0 (blue lines, indicated as pz+
in the legend) and pz < 0 (green lines, indicated as pz−
in the legend), and further distinguishes between spectra integrated in the whole box (solid lines) and only extracted from the reconnection downstream (M > M0 ,
dashed lines). We find that high-energy positrons with
pz < 0 are mostly located within the downstream region (compare green solid and dashed lines), i.e., nonthermal positrons with pz < 0 are trapped in plasmoids,
in analogy to 2D results (see Petropoulou & Sironi 2018;
Hakobyan et al. 2020).
In contrast, a significant fraction of high-energy
positrons with pz > 0 reside outside the reconnection
region (compare blue solid and dashed lines), and we
shall call them "free". The fraction of free positrons is
an increasing function of momentum, and for pz & 100
they are more numerous than the ones located in the
reconnection downstream. The pz+ spectrum of free
positrons (dotted blue line) can be modeled as a hard
power law, dNfree /dpz ∝ pz−1.5 . In Appendix B, we provide an analytical justification of the measured spectral
slope. The cutoff in the spectrum of pz > 0 positrons is
much higher than for pz < 0 positrons, suggesting that

to distinguish upstream (M < M0 ) from downstream (M > M0 ).

where pz = γβz is the dimensionless 4-velocity along the

indicated as pz+ in the legend) and pz < 0 (green, indicated
as pz− in the legend). Spectra from the overall box are shown
as solid lines (indicated with subscript "box" in the legend),
whereas the dashed lines refer only to positrons belonging
to the downstream region, as defined by the mixing condition M > M0 (indicated with subscript "rr" in the legend).
The spectrum of high-energy "free" positrons residing in the
upstream region (with M < M0 ), which preferentially have
pz > 0, is indicated by the dotted blue line. The dotted
black line shows a power-law p−1

the box-integrated positron spectra of kinetic energy (grey)
and momenta in different directions, as indicated in the legend. All spectra in the main plot and in the inset are timeaveraged between t = 3.34L/c and 3.56L/c and normalized
to the total number of positrons in the box.

free positrons can be accelerated to much larger energies
than trapped ones, as we indeed demonstrate below.3
The asymmetry between positrons with pz > 0 vs pz <
0 is a unique feature of our 3D setup. In a corresponding
2D simulation (see Appendix A), pz+ and pz− spectra
are nearly identical, and nearly all high-energy particles
reside within the reconnection downstream, as already
shown by Fig. 3 (right panel).
In the inset of Fig. 4, we present the box-integrated
positron spectra of kinetic energy (grey) and momentum
in different directions, as indicated in the legend. In contrast to the pz spectrum, there is no broken symmetry
between positive and negative directions in the px and
py spectra. The inset shows that the peak of the energy
spectrum (grey), at γ − 1 ∼ 3, is dominated by motions
along the x direction of the reconnection outflows (compare with the px spectrum, red line). In contrast, the
high-energy cutoff of the positron energy spectrum at
γ ∼ 500 is dominated by the pz+ spectrum (blue). So,
the most energetic positrons move mostly along the +z
direction (conversely, the highest energy electrons along
−z). We also remark that the py spectrum (orange)
reaches rather high momenta (albeit, not as high as the
pz+ spectrum). This is consistent with the trajectories
of high-energy positrons that we illustrate in Sec. 3.2.
In summary, the momentum spectra in Fig. 4 show
that most of the highest energy positrons are located
in the reconnection upstream, and their momentum is
dominated by the z component, which is aligned with

the large-scale motional electric field E

~ rec is the primary agent of acceleration, we expect a

linear relation between the gain in Lorentz factor (∆γ)
and the displacement along the z-axis (∆z), of the form
3

The electron spectrum shows the opposite asymmetry: electrons
with pz > 0 mostly reside in plasmoids, and their spectrum extends to lower momenta than for free electrons with pz < 0.

and 2D (right plot). The positrons are selected at the end of the simulations (ct/L = 3.48) and traced back to the first time
they are saved. For the 2D case, the particle displacement along the z-axis is calculated by time integration of the z velocity.
The relation expected from Eq. 2 is marked with a dashed white line in the left panel. The red and yellow lines in the left panel
represent the tracks in the ∆γ − ∆z plane of the two high-energy positrons shown in Fig. 6; in this case, the differences ∆γ and
∆z are computed at each time with respect to the initial time when the particle Lorentz factor first exceeded γ = 3.

In Fig. 5, we show the relation between ∆γ and ∆z
for a sample of ∼ 2 × 106 positrons selected at the end
of the simulations (t = 3.48L/c), for 3D (left) and 2D
(right). Each particle is traced back to the first time
its Lorentz factor exceeded γ = 3, and its overall ∆γ
and ∆z are computed.4 The plot only shows the quadrant with ∆γ > 0 and ∆z > 0, which includes most of
positrons and displays the strongest difference between
2D and 3D.
For ∆γ . 100, 2D and 3D results are similar. There
appears a trend that particles gaining more energy also
display a larger z displacement, but the spread is quite
large (∆γ may vary by two orders of magnitude for the
same ∆z). The similarity between 2D and 3D for ∆γ .
100 suggests that most of these particles are accelerated
while trapped in plasmoids, as found in 2D simulations
(Petropoulou & Sironi 2018; Hakobyan et al. 2020).
The most striking difference between 2D and 3D results is in the behavior of particles experiencing large
energy gains, ∆γ & 100. In this range (∆γ & 100 and
∆z > 0.4 L), positrons from the 3D simulation follow
a linear relation ∆γ ∝ ∆z, indicating that they are all
accelerated by the same electric field. Such a branch is
absent in the corresponding 2D simulation. For comparison, in the left panel of Fig. 5 we plot with a dashed

white line the expectation of Eq. (2) for the measured
ηrec = 0.075. The agreement of the high-energy branch
in the 3D histogram with Eq. (2) confirms that particles
experiencing the largest energy gains are accelerated in
the upstream by the motional electric field Erec .
We also point out the excess of positrons lying along
the extrapolation of the dashed white line to low ∆γ,
in the left panel at 1 . ∆γ . 5. These positrons are
currently being injected into the acceleration process by
the reconnection electric field, so they still obey Eq. (2).
3.2. Particle Orbits
To investigate the acceleration mechanism of the highest energy particles, we have studied the trajectory of
a large number of high-energy (γ > 200) positrons.
We present in Fig. 6 two representative orbits.5 Their
∆γ − ∆z tracks are shown in the left panel of Fig. 5 by
the two colored lines, demonstrating that for ∆γ & 10
they follow a linear relation akin to Eq. (2).
Fig. 6 shows the particle orbits projected on the x − y
(left) and y − z (middle) planes, as well as the particle
Lorentz factor as a function of lifetime ∆t (right panel),

Figure 6. Trajectories of two representative positrons. For each particle, its trajectory in the x − y plane is shown in the left
panel, and in the y − z plane in the middle panel. The color of the line represents the particle energy (from red to white as
the energy increases). A white filled circle shows the position at a specific time: t = 2.28L/c for particle A, corresponding to a
time ∆t = 0.87L/c in the particle life; and t = 2.80L/c for particle B, corresponding to ∆t = 1.03L/c. The background color
shows the plasma density at that same time, in the x − y and y − z slices where the particle is located. In the right panel, we
show the particle Lorentz factor as a function of its lifetime ∆t since it first crossed a threshold γ = 3. The maximum expected
acceleration rate corresponding to Eq. (4) is shown with a red dashed line.

indicated by the dashed red line in Fig. 6 (right). We
refer to this as γ̇max , since it is the maximum acceleration rate that can be provided by the large scale electric
field. Even stronger electric fields may transiently appear within the reconnection region, which explains why
some particles can temporarily experience an energization rate even larger than this value (e.g., positron B
between ∆t ' 0.4-0.8L/c).
We find that both positron A and B are injected into
the acceleration process in the vicinity of an X-point in
the midplane of the layer (y = 0). Yet, at later times
their histories diverge. Positron A is energized at nearly
the maximal rate γ̇max for most of its life (compare blue
and dashed red lines in the right panel of Fig. 6). Its orbit in the y − z plane displays a series of quasi-periodic
deflections between the two sides of the reconnection
layer, as expected for Speiser motion (Speiser 1965).
Yet, while Speiser orbits in reconnection with a weak
guide field are expected to get focused towards the midplane y = 0 (e.g., Cerutti et al. 2013), the trajectory
of positron A displays a y-extent increasing over time.
This is caused by interactions with plasmoids, whose effect is not taken into account in standard Speiser orbits.
In fact, at the time corresponding to the white circle
in Fig. 6 (a-2), the positron has just been deflected towards the upstream by the interaction with the plasmoid located at z ∼ 0.45L. The positron Lorentz factor at this time is γ ∼ 200 and its Lamor radius is
rL = γmc2 /eB0 ' 0.08L, which is larger than the plas-

moid transverse width. It follows that the positron will
not be captured by the plasmoid, but rather it is deflected away from the midplane, which allows positron
A to keep gaining energy at nearly the maximal rate,
while executing a Speiser-like motion.
The orbit of particle B is different, and more typical
of the majority of high-energy positrons. It is trapped
in a plasmoid in the interval 0.1L/c . ∆t . 0.4L/c.
During this stage, it moves back and forth in both xand z-directions, while its Lorentz factor stays roughly
constant at γ ∼ 20. The positron succeeds in escaping
the plasmoid at ∆t ∼ 0.5L/c. After that, it experiences
fast acceleration while being deflected in a Speiser-like
fashion between the two converting upstream flows, similarly to positron A. By studying a sample of γ ∼ 30 particles temporarily trapped in a given plasmoid, we have
found that the ones that manage to escape have typically larger z velocities and are preferentially located
in the plasmoid outskirts. This is expected, since such
particles, by moving along z, will be able to successfully
travel outside the plasmoid, and thus experience efficient
acceleration by the upstream field. Clearly, this cannot
happen in 2D, where the z direction is invariant (i.e.,
plasmoids are infinitely long in z).
Motivated by the trajectory of particle B, we now
employ a statistical approach to further investigate the
properties of accelerated particles, and in particular ascertain at which energy they are most likely to escape
from plasmoids and start experiencing fast acceleration
by the upstream large-scale fields. This is shown in
Fig. 7. We first separate the positrons in six groups,
based on the largest Lorentz factor they attain in their
lifetime (we shall call it γend , given that it is typically
attained at the end of the particle life; we only consider

Figure 7. Statistical assessment of the properties of accelerated positrons. We first separate the positrons in six groups, based
on the largest Lorentz factor γend they attain in their lifetime (see legend in the left panel). For each group, we then compute
(as described in the text) the following quantities, as a function of the particle Lorentz factor γ: the median mixing factor M
(left); the median acceleration rate γ̇ (middle), distinguishing between particles in the downstream (solid) and in the upstream
(dashed); the fractional energy ∆γup /∆γtot gained while in the upstream (right panel). In the middle panel we also show, as a
reference, the maximum acceleration rate quantified by Eq. 3 (horizontal dotted line).

γend > 30). Each group corresponds to a different color
in Fig. 7. Each of the colored curves is obtained as follows. For each particle in a given γend -group, its history
is followed since its birth, dividing it depending on the
instantaneous Lorentz factor (for each of the six γend groups, we employ ten γ-bins, logarithmically spaced
between γ = 3 and γ = 300). Taking all the times when
a particle lies in a given γ-bin, we compute the median
mixing factor M, median acceleration rate γ̇, and the
fractional energy ∆γup /∆γtot gained while in the upstream (still, while crossing the selected γ-bin). The
colored lines are then computed by taking the median
among particles belonging to the same γend -group.
Fig. 7 (left panel) shows that at low energies (γ . 20)
most of the particles reside in the downstream region,
regardless of their γend . In fact, the mixing fraction is
M ' 0.8. As particles gain energy, the median M of the
two groups with the largest γend (green and blue lines in
Fig. 7) starts to drop, down to M . 0.1 for the particles reaching the highest energies. As also demonstrated
above, particles of high energy (γ & 100) are preferentially located in the upstream. The transition from
being trapped to breaking free appears at γ ∼ 3σ ∼ 30.
The middle panel of Fig. 7 presents the acceleration
rate, distinguishing between particles in the downstream
(solid lines) and in the upstream (dashed lines). The acceleration rate should be compared with the maximum
rate γ̇max in Eq. (4), which is indicated in the plot by
the horizontal dotted line. We find that, regardless of
γend , downstream particles gain energy at a relatively
slow rate, γ̇ . 0.1 ωp . Particles residing in the upstream
with Lorentz factors γ & 30 - the same threshold as
derived from M in the left panel - gain energy at a
faster rate, that asymptotes to γ̇ ∼ 0.2 ωp for the high-

est energy upstream particles.6 This rate approaches
' 0.8 γ̇max , which implies that the highest energy particles move with an average z velocity βz ' 0.8 (see
Eq. (3)). This is in agreement with the momentum spectra presented in Sec. 3.1, i.e., the highest energy particles
preferentially move in the z direction.
The right panel of Fig. 7 shows the fraction
∆γup /∆γtot of energy acquired in the upstream, while
traversing a given γ-bin. Regardless of the γend -group,
we find that this is an increasing function of γ, reaching
∼ 80% for the highest energy particles. Again, the transition to the stage when acceleration is dominated by
the upstream motional field occurs at γ & 30, the same
threshold already derived from the left and middle panels. So, we conclude that most particles ending up with
high energies escape from plasmoids at γ ∼ 3σ ∼ 30, at
which point their energization starts to be dominated
by the large-scale upstream field.
3.3. Dependence on the Domain Size
In this subsection, we investigate the dependence of
the properties of high-energy "free" particles on the size
of the computational domain, in order to extrapolate
our conclusions to larger (fluid) scales. Free particles
are defined such that they reside in the upstream, with
mixing parameter M < 0.3. We also require that they
have γ > 10, to exclude the cold upstream particles that
have yet to reach the reconnection region. Our results
are presented in Fig. 8 and Tab. 1.
6

In the highest γ-bin, all the curves bend towards slower acceleration rates. This can be simply understood as a selection bias:
for a given γend -group, particles in the highest γ-bin are biased
towards having slower acceleration rates, otherwise they would
move up in energy, and be classified in the next γend -group.

Table 1. Number and energy efficiency for the population
of high-energy free particles. The number (energy, respectively) efficiency is the ratio of the number (energy) of free
particles normalized to the number (energy) of particles in
the reconnection region. The unit of length for the box size
(leftmost column) is the plasma skin depth (c/ωp ).

In the left panel, we show the cutoff Lorentz factor γcut
of free particles, as a function of time (horizontal axis)
and box size (different colors, as indicated in the legend).
The cutoff Lorentz factor is obtained by calculating the
location of the peak of (γ − 1)3 dNfree /dγ. As described
in Petropoulou & Sironi (2018), this is generally a good
proxy for the location of the exponential cutoff of the
spectrum. We find that γcut ∝ Lx . The proportionality
constant is such that the Larmor radius of particles with

Lorentz factor γcut is rL (γcut ) ∼ 0.2 Lx , regardless of
Lx . This is expected, since particles accelerated near
the maximal rate in Eq. (4) over the typical advection
time ∼ Lx /c will obtain a Larmor radius rL ∼ ηrec Lx ∼
0.1Lx . This can be phrased as a "Hillas criterion" for
relativistic magnetic reconnection.
We also calculate the energy efficiency Efree /Err (filled
circles), where Efree and Err are respectively the energy
content of free particles and of particles in the reconnection region. The number fraction Nfree /Nrr (open
circles) is obtained in a similar way. We examine their
dependence on the x length of the box in the middle
panel (at fixed aspect ratio Lx /Lz , blue for Lx /Lz = 1
and red for Lx /Lz = 2) and on the z length in the
right panel, for fixed Lx ∼ 1600c/ωp (grey points).
As shown in Fig. 8b, Efree /Err is nearly independent
of Lx . This demonstrates that, regardless of the box
size, free particles carry a constant fraction (∼ 20%)
of the post-reconnection particle energy. Given that
γcut ∝ Lx and that the spectrum of free particles is
hard, dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.5 , this implies that their number
fraction needs to decrease with increasing box size, as
indeed confirmed by Fig. 8b (open circles).
Fig. 8c shows that convergent 3D results are obtained
only if the box is sufficiently extended in the z direction.
For our reference case with Lx ∼ 1600c/ωp , convergent
3D results are obtained for Lz & 400 c/ωp ∼ Lx /4. This
may be due to the requirement that the z extent of
the largest plasmoids, ∼ 0.1Lx (assuming spherical plasmoids), be smaller than the box length along z, i.e., z invariance should be broken even for the largest plasmoids.
Fig. 8c also shows that the 2D limit is approached for
Lz . 20 c/ωp , such that even small plasmoids do not fit
within the vertical extent of the box.

10
4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this work, we performed large-scale 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection in a σ = 10 electronpositron plasma. We found that a fraction of particles
with γ & 3σ can "break free" from plasmoids by moving along z and then experience the large-scale motional
electric field in the upstream region. This process cannot be captured by 2D simulations, which are invariant
along the z direction. The free particles preferentially
move along z and are accelerated linearly in time (γ ∝ t)
while undergoing Speiser-like deflections by the converging upstream flows, as already hypothesized by Giannios
(2010). Their spectrum is hard and can be modeled as a
power law dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.5 - in Appendix B, we analytically justify the value of the power-law slope. The
free particles account for ∼ 20% of the dissipated magnetic energy, independently of domain size.
The acceleration rate of the particles, in this mechanism, is closely connected to the reconnection speed. Its
accurate description, therefore, relies on the reconnection system having reached a statistical steady state.
To this end, our adopted boundary conditions are of
crucial importance. By adopting continuous injection
of plasma (and magnetic flux) in the far upstream and
outflow boundaries in the reconnection exhaust direction, the system can be followed for many Alfvén crossing times after it has reached a statistical steady state.
We find that the most energetic particles take a few
Alfvén crossing times to reach their maximum energy.
In contrast, the more commonly adopted triple periodic
boundaries can only study reconnection transiently and
may not be able to capture this mechanism accurately.
In addition, periodic boundaries do not allow plasmoids
to escape, so the largest plasmoids can grow up to a size
comparable to the system length. This would artificially
enhance the rate at which high-energy free particles get
captured back by plasmoids.
We find that the particle acceleration rate is
γ̇ ∼

ηrec eB
βz ,
mc

(5)

where B is the magnetic field in the upstream and
ηrec βz ∼ 0.06 as determined by our simulations. As
far as we can infer from our simulations, the maximum
energy achievable by this process is determined by either radiative losses or by the size of the reconnection
region. If synchrotron cooling is the dominant energy
loss, then the particles are accelerated until the energy
gain rate γ̇mc2 is balanced by the synchrotron loss rate

The corresponding synchrotron emission energy is
2
Esyn = γmax
Be~/mc = 160βz ηrec MeV∼ 10 MeV, for
electrons, i.e., about one order of magnitude below the
well-known burnoff limit (de Jager & Harding 1992). We
remark that in this argument we have assumed that the
accelerated particles have large pitch angles (i.e., the angle between the particle velocity and the magnetic field),
as indeed observed in our simulations. Yet, if this acceleration mechanism were to operate also in the limit of
strong guide fields, the accelerated particles would likely
have small pitch angles, which would comparatively reduce their synchrotron losses.7
If radiative losses are negligible, the maximum energy
is only limited by the size of the reconnecting system.
For a given length of the reconnection layer Lz in the
z direction, the maximum Lorentz factor a particle can
reach can be estimated as:
γmax = Lz eηrec B/mc2 .

(7)

The particle motion along the x-direction of reconnection outflows is unlikely to constrain the maximum energy, since we have shown that the accelerated particles
mostly move along the z direction, so their escape time
along x is likely longer than along z.
Although in this work we have only focused on
electron-positron plasmas, our results may still be applicable to electron-proton cases, since high-σ reconnection
is virtually identical in pair plasmas and electron-proton
plasmas. Protons are much less affected by cooling as
compared to leptons and may escape from plasmoids
with higher efficiency. Therefore, given that we have neglected cooling losses, our results may be most applicable to protons in astrophysical systems where radiative
lepton losses are severe. Nevertheless, in less extreme environments (e.g., the emission zone of a blazar jet), even
leptons should be able to able to escape small plasmoids
and participate in this acceleration process. Therefore,
one may expect that both leptonic and hadronic signatures will be affected by the acceleration mechanism we
have discussed here.
The sources and acceleration mechanism of UHECRs
with energies between ∼ 1018 and ∼ 1020 eV are still
under debate. Relativistic jets launched by GRBs (Milgrom & Usov 1995; Waxman 1995) and AGNs (Halzen
& Hooper 2002) have been proposed as sources of UHECRs. Magnetic reconnection taking place in the magnet7

On the other hand, a strong guide field would also help in enforcing invariance along the z direction (i.e., plasmoids are likely
to be very elongated in z), so our proposed mechanism may turn
out to be less efficient.

11
ically dominated plasma of these jets may be a promising
accelerator of UHECRs (Giannios 2010).
The rest-frame magnetic field strength can be estimated by the Poynting luminosity of the jet LP , the
bulk Lorentz factor Γ, and the distance R from the central engine (see, e.g., Giannios (2010)):

Combining with Eq. 7, we can estimate the maximum
energy that a proton can be accelerated to:
1/2

Emax = ηrec LP c−1/2 R−1 Le,

(9)

where L is the length scale of the reconnection region.
We also introduce a factor of Γ when we boost from the
jet frame to the observer frame.
For long-duration GRBs, the (isotropic equivalent) energy they release in gamma rays is around 1053 erg in
a duration of about 10 s. This gives a lower limit for
their Poynting luminosity of LP ∼ 1052 erg s−1 , since
the energy conversion efficiency to gamma rays needs to
be below unity. The size of the reconnection region can
be estimated as L ∼ R/Γ, and Γ usually varies from
100 to 1000 in GRB jets. Therefore, the maximum energy that a particle can be accelerated to is Emax ≈

LP,52 = LP /1052 erg s−1 , and Γ2 = Γ/102 .
A powerful AGN jet can reach a luminosity of
1048 erg s−1 . They usually have bulk Lorentz factors of Γ ∼ 3 − 30. Using these values, we estimate
that protons accelerated by reconnection in AGN jets

can reach energies Emax ∼ 6 × 1019 ηrec,−1 LP,48 Γ−1

where LP,48 = LP /10 erg s and Γ0.5 = Γ/ 10.
Both jets are then capable of accelerating protons
(or heavier nuclei in AGN jets) to 1018 eV and even
to the highest energies that have been observed so far,
1020 eV. Though we do not consider constrains imposed
by cooling losses (see, e.g., Giannios (2010) for further
discussion), our analysis demonstrates that relativistic
reconnection is, in principle, a promising way to produce UHECRs.

APPENDIX
A. 2D PARTICLE SPECTRA

In Fig. 4, we have shown the energy and momentum
spectra extracted from the 3D simulation. For comparison, in Fig. 9 we show the z-momentum spectrum from
the corresponding 2D run. In agreement with earlier
2D studies, the particle spectrum is non-thermal. Unlike the 3D case, where the cutoff in the pz+ spectrum
is much larger than in the pz− spectrum, here the two
are roughly comparable, though particles moving along
+z extend to slightly larger energies, and dominate in
number at high energies. In addition, as discussed in
the main text, at γ > 2 the spectra from the whole
box are coincident with corresponding spectra extracted
from the reconnection region alone.
In the inset, we compare energy spectra between 2D
and 3D simulations. The 3D spectrum has a higher cutoff than the 2D one and it is dominated at high energies
by particles outside the reconnection region. It indicates
once again that acceleration outside of plasmoids plays
an important role for the highest energy particles.

B. THE POWER-LAW SLOPE OF FREE

PARTICLES
In the main body of the paper, we have demonstrated
that the spectrum of free particles can be modeled as a
power law f = dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.5 followed by a cutoff,
which scales linearly with the system size. In this Appendix, we aim at providing a theoretical framework to
interpret the value of the power-law slope.8 In steady
state, the distribution of free particles will follow

We remark that, as shown in our paper, the acceleration mechanism of free particles is distinct from the one of particles accelerated in the reconnection layer, whose spectral shape has been
discussed by, e.g., Guo et al. (2014); Uzdensky (2020).

indicated by the dotted black line in the inset.

before getting trapped.9
In order to compute the escape time of free particles,
we assume a steady state scenario: the rate at which
free particles are trapped in plasmoids balances the rate
at which trapped particles advect out of the domain, so

For free particles, the acceleration time can be calcu√

yield ηrec βz ' 0.06. Free particles are accelerated while
residing in the upstream. When they get captured and
trapped by plasmoids, they effectively escape the accel-

We have computed the advection time tadv considering
the lifetime of particles that remain always trapped in
plasmoids. We find that tadv ∼ 0.4Lx /c independently
of the Lorentz factor. In retrospect, this is not surprising. The mass-weighted bulk motions of relativistic
reconnection are trans-relativistic, with typical outflow
velocities of ∼ 0.6 c (Sironi & Beloborodov 2020). On
average, a trapped particle travels a distance ∼ 0.25Lx
before advecting out of the system, which indeed leads
to an advection time tadv ∼ 0.4Lx /c.
It follows that the ratio of acceleration time to escape
time is energy-independent (for 30 . γ . 300) and equal
to tacc /tesc ' 1.6, where we have used that Lx /c/ωp ∼
1600 in our reference simulation. This allows to compute
the solution of Eq. (B1). As discussed by e.g., Kirk et al.
(1998), the solution of Eq. (B1) in the case that both
the acceleration time and the escape time scale linearly
with γ is a power law

dNfree
∝ γ −tacc /tesc

(B4)

which for our case yields dNfree /dγ ∝ γ −1.6 , in good
agreement with the spectrum measured directly from
our simulation.
Based on this model for the acceleration of free
particles, one can address the question of what is

For simplicity, we assume that no significant energization occurs
while trapped in plasmoids.

γ = 3σ = 30 and the spectral cutoff at γ ∼ 300, see the inset of
Fig. 9.

astrophysically-relevant) regime Lx  c/ωp . Let us
call s = −d log Nfree /d log γ the power-law slope of free
particles in the asymptotic limit Lx  c/ωp . Given
that s = tacc /tesc should be independent of the box size
Lx , this requires that tesc in Eq. (B2) be independent
of Lx . In turn, given that tadv ∝ Lx /c, the ratio in
Eq. (B3) should scale as ∝ 1/Lx . In other words, for
dNfree /dγ = Cfree γ −s and dNtrap /dγ = Ctrap γ −s−1 , we
require Cfree /Ctrap ∝ 1/Lx .
Let us now consider the specific case of s = 1, and
assume that the spectrum of free particles extends from
γmin,free ∼ 3σ up to γcut ∝ Lx , while the spectrum of
trapped particles extends from γmin,free ∼ σ up to the
same γcut ∝ Lx . The ratio of number of free particles

called Nrr for "reconnection region" in the main paper)

which, aside from logarithmic corrections, scales as ∝

trapped particles). Based on our model of acceleration,
and requiring that the energy fraction of free particles
stays constant with box size, we then expect that the
spectrum of free particles in the limit Lx  c/ωp should
reach an asymptotic power-law slope s ' 1.
