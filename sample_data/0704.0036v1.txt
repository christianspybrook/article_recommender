Abstract
This note studies the number of positive steady states in biomolecular reactions consisting of activation/deactivation futile cycles, such as those arising from phosphorylations and dephosphorylations
at each level of a MAPK cascade. It is shown that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least
n + 1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) There never are more than 2n steady states;
(3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most
n + 1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state
conditions, there is at most one steady state.

Keywords: futile cycles, bistability, signaling pathways, biomolecular networks, steady states

Introduction

A motif of great interest in current systems biology research is that of a "futile cycle" in which a substrate,
denoted here by S0 , is ultimately converted into a product, denoted here by Sn , through a cascade of
"activation" reactions triggered or facilitated by an enzyme E; conversely, Sn is transformed back (or
"deactivated") into the original S0 , helped on by the action of a second enzyme F . See Figure 1.

where kon0 , etc., are kinetic parameters for binding and unbinding, ES0 denotes the complex consisting
of the enzyme E and the substrate S0 , and so forth. A mass-action kinetics ODE model, described later,
is used.
Futile cycles (with any number of intermediate steps, and also called substrate cycles, enzymatic cycles,
or enzymatic inter-conversions, see [1]) underlie signaling processes such as GTPase cycles [2], bacterial
two-component systems and phosphorelays [3, 4] actin treadmilling [5]), and glucose mobilization [6], as
well as metabolic control [7] and cell division and apoptosis [8] and cell-cycle checkpoint control [9]. One
very important instance is that of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ("MAPK") cascades, which regulate
primary cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [10–13] in eukaryotes from
yeast to humans. MAPK cascades usually consist of three tiers of similar structures with multiple feedbacks [14–16]. An individual level of a MAPK cascade is often modeled as a futile cycle as depicted in
Figure 1 with n = 2.
Numerical analysis of the model with n = 2 to n = 5 indicates that the system may be monostable or
bistable (subject to conservation relations), depending on parameter values [17–19]. Bistable parameter
regimes allow possible switch-like behavior and memory, which are ubiquitous in cellular pathways [20–23].
In either case, simulations under meaningful biological parameters show convergence, not other dynamical properties such as periodic behavior or even chaotic behavior. Analytical studies done for the
quasi-steady-state version of the model (slow dynamics), which is a monotone system, indicate that the reduced system is indeed monostable or bistable, see [24]. Our paper [25] (see also [26] for preliminary results)
established mathematically, for n = 2 and based upon the theory of singular perturbations of monotone
systems, that, at least in certain parameter ranges (as required by singular perturbation theory), the full
system indeed inherits convergence properties from the reduced system. Other related theoretical work
is [27], where the general case n = 2 (any parameter values, not necessarily near quasi-steady state) is
studied and a persistence result is shown, as well as [28], where, for n = 1, it is shown, also for all parameter
values, that global convergence to steady states (subject to stoichiometric constraints) holds.
In this note, we study a complementary problem, namely the question of analyzing how many positive
steady states are possible. (Hereafter, when we say "steady state" we always mean a positive steady state.
Observe that there always exists at least one nonnegative steady state, because the dynamics evolve in a
compact convex set.)
Our main results are informally summarized as follows (precise statements are given later):
1. For some parameter ranges, there are at least n + 1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states.
2. There never are more than 2n steady states.
3. For parameter ranges near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at
most n + 1 steady states.
2

4. For parameter ranges very far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there is at most one steady state.
Our results make heavy use of beautiful observations made in [18], that allow one to reduce the search
for positive steady states to the study of algebraic equations involving the ratio u = e/f , where e and f are
the concentrations of E and F respectively. This construction was also used in [29] in order to show that
there are, for some parameters sets, n (or n + 1) steady states for a limiting quasi-steady state reduction
of the same system, as well as numerical evidence for the existence of n + 1 states for the full system.

and let Φ(x, κ, C) have components Φ1 , . . . , Φ3n+3 where the first 3n components are
Φ1 (x, κ, C) = −kon0 s0 e + koff0 c0 + lcat0 d1 ,
and so forth, listing the right hand sides of the equations (1), Φ3n+1 is

Lemma 1 For each κ, C, we have Z(κ, C) = Z̃(κ, C).
Proof. We pick an arbitrary x ∈ Z(κ, C). Since Φn+1 (x, κ, C), . . . , Φ3n (x, κ, C) are all zero, equations (5)
and (6) follow easily. We next prove that

When i = 0, from Φ1 (x, κ, C) + Φn+1 (x, κ, C) = 0, we get

Suppose that (10) holds for i = k, then for i = k + 1, we have

= kcatk ck + lcatk+1 dk+2 − kcatk+1 ck+1 − lcatk dk+1
= lcatk+1 dk+2 − kcatk+1 ck+1 ,
which is (10) when i = k + 2. Therefore, by induction, (10) holds for all i =P

From Φ3n+2 (x, κ, C) = 0, we have

that is, Gκ,C (s0 , e/f ) = 0. Now we have checked that x satisfies (4)-(9), so x ∈ Z̃(κ, C).
Conversely, for any x ∈ Z̃(κ, C), because of (5) and (6), we know that Φn+1 (x, κ, C), . . . , Φ3n (x, κ, C)
are all zero. For each i = 0, . . . , n − 1, because of (4), we have

and thus
Φ1 (x, κ, C) + Φn+1 (x, κ, C) = 0, when i = 0,
and
Φi+1 (x, κ, C) + Φn+i+1 (x, κ, C) + Φ2n+i (x, κ, C) = 0, otherwise.
We already know that Φn+1 (x, κ, C), . . . , Φ3n (x, κ, C) are zero, so Φ1 (x, κ, C), . . . , Φn (x, κ, C) are zero too.
We next check Φ3n+1 (x, κ, C) = 0, . . . , Φ3n+3 (x, κ, C) = 0. By (4)-(6), (11) holds. Because of (7), we have
that Φ3n+1 (x, κ, C) = 0 since:

Therefore, x ∈ Z̃(κ, C).
For each κ, C, let us define two functions H κ,C , F κ,C : R+ −→ R as:

Lemma 2 For each κ, C, there is a bijection between the set Z̃(κ, C) and the set of solutions of F κ,C (u) = 0.

Proof. We will show that the mapping θ(x) := u = e/f is a bijection.
First, we show that θ maps Z̃ into the set of solutions of F κ,C (u) = 0. Any x ∈ Z̃(κ, C) is a solution of
(9), i.e. Gκ,C (s0 , e/f ) = 0. Regarding Gκ,C (s0 , e/f ) as a quadratic polynomial in s0 with Gκ,C (0, e/f ) < 0,
it has a unique positive root, namely

s0 =

(13)
2φκ0 (e/f )φκ2 (e/f )
Plugging into (8) and multiplying by φκ0 (e/f ), we get F κ,C (e/f ) = 0.
Next, we show that θ is onto. Pick any solution u of F κ,C (u) = 0. We can construct a solution of
(4)-(9), i.e. an element of Z̃(κ, C), as follows.
Let
s0 =

−H κ,C (u) +

p

H κ,C (u)2 + 4Stot φκ0 (u)φκ2 (u)
,
2φκ0 (u)φκ2 (u)

so that Gκ,C (s0 , u) = 0. Substituting (14) into F κ,C (u) = 0 and dividing by φκ0 (u), we get

that θ(x) = u.
Finally, we show that θ is one to one. Suppose that θ(x1 ) = θ(x2 ). The formula (13) shows that s0 is
the same for x1 and x2 . Equation (7) gives that

such that the following
Theorem 1 For each positive numbers Stot , γ, there exist ε0 > 0 and κ ∈ R+
property holds. Pick any Etot , Ftot such that

Ftot = Etot /γ < ε0 Stot /γ;

(17)

then the system Σ(κ, C) with C = (Etot , Ftot , Stot ) has at least n + 1 (n) positive steady states when n is

(Then, given Stot , γ, Etot , and Ftot satisfying (17), we let ε = Etot /Stot < ε0 , and apply the result.)

A straightforward computation shows that when ε = 0,
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = uφκ0 (u) + Stot (uφκ1 (u) − γφκ2 (u)) − γφκ0 (u)

where the λi 's and KMi 's are defined as in (3), and βi = kcati /lcati . The polynomial F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
is of degree n + 1, so there are at most n + 1 positive roots. Notice that u = 0 is not a root because
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = −γ < 0, which also implies that when n is odd, there can not be n + 1 positive roots.
Now fix any Stot and γ. We will construct a vector κ such that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) has n + 1 distinct positive
roots when n is even.
Let us pick any n + 1 positive real numbers u1 < * * * < un+1 , such that their product is γ, and assume
that

in order to satisfy (22). From the given
λ0 , . . . , λn−1 , KM0 , . . . , KMn−1 , β0 , . . . , βn−1 ,
we will find a vector
κ =(kon0 , . . . , konn−1 , koff0 , . . . , koffn−1 , kcat0 , . . . , kcatn−1 ,

lon0 , . . . , lonn−1 , loff0 , . . . , loffn−1 , lcat0 , . . . , lcatn−1 ) ∈ R+

such that βi = kcati /lcati , i = 0, . . . , n − 1, and (3) holds. This vector κ will guarantee that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
has n + 1 positive distinct roots. When n is odd, a similar construction will give a vector κ such that
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) has n positive roots and one negative root.
One construction of κ is as follows. For each i = 0, . . . , n − 1, we start by defining:
LM i =

λi KMi
,
βi

consistently with the definitions in (3). Then, we take
koni = 1, loni = 1,
and
koffi = αi KMi , kcati = (1 − αi )KMi , lcati =

1 − αi
KMi , loffi = LMi − lcati ,
βi

where αi ∈ (0, 1) is chosen such that
loffi = LMi −

1 − αi
KMi > 0.
βi

This κ satisfies βi = kcati /lcati , i = 0, . . . , n − 1, and (3).
In order to apply the Implicit Function Theorem, we now view the functions defined by formulas in
(18) and (19) as defined also for ε ≤ 0, i.e. as functions R × R+ −→ R. It is easy to see that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u)
is C 1 on R × R+ because the polynomial under the square root sign in F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) is never zero. On
κ,γ,S
tot (0, u ) 6= 0. By the
the other hand, since F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) is a polynomial in u with distinct roots, ∂ F̃
∂u

i

Implicit Function Theorem, for each i = 1, . . . , n + 1, there exist open intervals Ei containing 0 and Ui
containing ui , and a differentiable function
αi : Ei → Ui
such that αi (0) = ui , F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, αi (ε)) = 0 for all ε ∈ Ei , and the images αi (Ei )'s are non-overlapping. If
we take
n+1
\
\
(0, +∞),
Ei
(0, ε0 ) :=
1

then for any ε ∈ (0, ε0 ), we have {αi (ε)} as n + 1 distinct positive roots of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u). The case when
n is odd can be proved similarly.

Remark 3 For an arbitrary vector κ, we do not expect the derivative at each positive root to be non zero.
Here is an example to show that more conditions are needed: with
n = 2, λ0 = 1, λ1 = 3, γ = 6, β0 = β1 = 1/12, K0 = 1/8, K1 = 1/2, Stot = 5,
we have that

F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = 3u3 − 12u2 + 15u − 6 = 3(u − 1)2 (u + 2)

has a double root at u = 1.
However, the following theorem provides a sufficient condition for
solution u = ū of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = 0.

F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = uφκ0 + Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 ) − γφκ0 .
So
∂ F̃ κ,γ,Stot
(0, u) = φκ0 + Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )′ − (γ − u)(φκ0 )′ .

Since F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, ū) = 0,

Corollary 4 For each positive numbers Stot , γ, and vector κ ∈ R+
exists ε0 > 0 such that for any Ftot , Etot satisfying Ftot = Etot /γ < ε0 Stot /γ, the number of positive
steady states of system Σ(κ, C) is greater or equal to the number of (positive) roots of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u).

Proof. Follows directly from Lemmas 1, 2, the Implicit Function Theorem and Theorem 2.
Theorem 3 For each κ, C, the system Σ(κ, C) has at most 2n positive steady states.
Proof. Let us define a polynomial P κ,C : C −→ C as:

We claim that the number of positive steady states of Σ(κ, C) is less or equal to the number of positive
roots of P κ,C (u). Recall that Z = Z̃ and the map θ is a bijection between the set Z̃ and the set of (positive)
roots of F κ,C (u). Then it is enough to show that the set of (positive) roots of F κ,C (u) is a subset of the
set of positive real roots of P κ,C (u).
In the proof of Lemma 2, we have showed that for any root u > 0 of F κ,C (u), s0 defined as in (14)
satisfies Gκ,C (s0 , u) = 0 and (15). Multiplying the equation Gκ,C (s0 , u) = 0 by (uφκ1 (u) − Etot /Ftot φκ2 (u))2
and substituting (15) into it, we get P κ,C (u) = 0, that is, u is a positive root of P κ,C (u).
Next we will show that the polynomial P κ,C (u) of degree 2n + 2 has at most 2n positive real roots, and
thus Σ(κ, C) has at most 2n positive steady states.
It is easy to see that P κ,C (u) is divisible by u; therefore, if we can find one more non positive root, we
are done. Consider the polynomial P κ,C (u)/u of degree 2n + 1. The coefficient of u2n+1 is
(λ0 * * * λn−1 )2
> 0,
LMn−1
and the constant term is

Etot

Ftot KM0
So the polynomial P κ,C (u)/u has at least one negative root, and so does P κ,C (u).
Remark 5 This upper bound holds for every κ and C.
The following is a standard result on continuity of roots; see for instance Lemma A.4.1 in [30]:
Lemma 6 Let g(z) = z n + a1 z n−1 + * * * + an be a polynomial of degree n and complex coefficients having
distinct roots
λ1 , . . . , λq ,
with multiplicities
n1 + * * * + nq = n,
respectively. Given any small enough δ > 0 there exists a ε > 0 so that, if
h(z) = z n + b1 z n−1 + * * * + bn , |ai − bi | < ε for i = 1, . . . , n,
then h has precisely ni roots in Bδ (λi ) for each i = 1, . . . , q.

Theorem 4 For each γ > 0 and κ ∈ R+
ε1 > 0 such that for all positive numbers Ftot , Etot satisfying Ftot = Etot /γ < ε1 Stot /γ, the system
Σ(κ, C) has at most n + 1 positive steady states.

Proof. Let us define a function R+ × C −→ C as follows:

As shown in the proof of Theorem 3, there is a bijection, given by the map θ, between Z̃(κ, (εStot , εStot /γ, Stot ))
(denoted as Z̃ for the rest of the proof) and a subset of the real positive roots of P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u). Since
P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) is a polynomial of degree 2n + 2, if we can show that there exists ε1 > 0 such that for any
ε ∈ (0, ε1 ), P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) has at least n + 1 roots that are not in θ(Z̃), that is, do not have pre-images in
Z̃, then we are done.
First of all, any root of P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) that is not real or positive does not have a pre-image in Z̃ under
the map θ. Since P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) is divisible by u, u = 0 is a root of P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) that is not in θ(Z̃).
In order to apply Lemma 6, we regard the function P̃ κ,γ,Stot as defined on R × C. At ε = 0:
P̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)/u = [φκ0 φκ2 (γ − u)2 + (φκ0 − Stot φκ2 )(uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )2 ]/u
= [φκ0 φκ2 (γ − u)2 + φκ0 (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot φκ2 (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )2 ]/u
= [φκ0 (γ − u)u(φκ1 − φκ2 ) + Stot u(uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(φκ2 − φκ1 )]/u
= (φκ2 − φκ1 )(uφκ0 + Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 ) − γφκ0 )
= (φκ2 − φκ1 )F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
Let us denote the distinct roots of P̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)/u as
u1 , . . . , uq ,
with multiplicities
n1 + * * * + nq = 2n + 1,
and the roots of φκ1 − φκ2 as
u1 , . . . , up , p ≤ q,
with multiplicities
m1 + * * * + mp = n, ni ≥ mi , for i = 1, . . . , p.
For each i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is real, then there are two cases (ui 6= γ as φκ1 (γ) 6= φκ2 (γ)):
1. ui > γ. We have
2. ui < γ. We have

ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) > γ(φκ1 (ui ) − φκ2 (ui )) = 0.
ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) < γ(φκ1 (ui ) − φκ2 (ui )) = 0.

In both cases, ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) and γ − ui have opposite signs, i.e.
(ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ))(γ − ui ) < 0.
Let us pick δ > 0 small enough such that the following conditions hold:
1. For all i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is not real, then Bδ (ui ) has no intersection with the real axis.
2. For all i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is real, then for any real u ∈ Bδ (ui ), the following inequality holds:
(uφκ1 (u) − γφκ2 (u))(γ − u) < 0.

By Lemma 6, there exists ε1 > 0 such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε1 ), the polynomial P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u)/u has exactly
nj roots in each Bδ (uj ), j = 1, . . . , q, denoted by ukj (ε), k = 1, . . . , nj .
We pick one such ε, and we claim
none of the roots in Bδ (ui ), i = 1, . . . , p has pre-image in Z̃.
Pp that P
If so, we are done, since there are 1 ni ≥ p1 mi = n such roots of them, together with the root u = 0,
there are at least n + 1 roots of P̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) that do not have pre-images in Z̃.
For each i = 1, . . . , p, there are two cases:
1. ui is not real. Then condition 1 guarantees that uki (ε) is not real for all k = 1, . . . , ni , and thus is not
in θ(Z̃).
2. ui is real. Suppose one of the roots uki (ε) has pre-image in Z̃, i.e. θ(x) = uki (ε) for some x ∈ Z̃ and
k = 1, . . . , ni . Since x is constructed as in the proof of Lemma 2, the s0 coordinate of x satisfies (15),
i.e.

s0 uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε)) = γ − uki (ε).
But condition 2 says that uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε)) and γ − uki (ε) have opposite signs, so s0 has

Let pick δ > 0 small enough such that the following conditions hold for all i = 2, . . . , q:
1. If ui is not real, then Bδ (ui ) has no intersection with the real axis.
2. If ui is real and positive, then for any real u ∈ Bδ (ui ), the following inequality holds:

4. Bδ (uj ) Bδ (uk ) = ∅ for all i 6= k = 2, . . . , q.

nj roots in each Bδ (uj ), j = 1, . . . , q, denoted by ukj (ε), k = 1, . . . , nj .
We pick one such ε, and if we can show that none of the roots in Bδ (ui ), i = 2, . . . , q has pre-images
in Z̃, then we are done, since the only roots that may have pre-images in Z̃ are the roots in Bδ (u1 ), and
there is n1 = 1 root in Bδ (u1 ).
For each i = 2, . . . , p, there are three cases:
1. ui is not real. Then condition 1 guarantees that uki (ε) is not real for all k = 1, . . . , ni , and thus is not
in θ(Z̃).
2. ui is real and negative. By conditions 1 and 3, uki (ε) is not in θ(Z̃) neither.
3. ui is real and positive. Suppose one of the roots uki (ε) has pre-image in Z̃, i.e. θ(x) = uki (ε) for some
x ∈ Z̃ and k = 1, . . . , ni . Since x is constructed as in the proof of Lemma 2, the s0 coordinate of x
satisfies (15), i.e.

s0 uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε)) = γ − uki (ε).
But condition 2 says that uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε)) and γ − uki (ε) have opposite signs, so s0 has

to be negative, which contradicts the fact that x ∈ R3n+3
