ABSTRACT

Many characteristics of dwarf carbon stars are broadly consistent with a binary origin, including
mass transfer from an evolved companion. While the population overall appears to have olddisc or halo kinematics, roughly 2 per cent of these stars exhibit Hα emission, which in
low-mass main-sequence stars is generally associated with rotation and relative youth. Its
presence in an older population therefore suggests either irradiation or spin-up. This study
presents time-series analyses of photometric and radial-velocity data for seven dwarf carbon
stars with Hα emission. All are shown to have photometric periods in the range 0.2–5.2 d, and
orbital periods of similar length, consistent with tidal synchronisation. It is hypothesised that
dwarf carbon stars with emission lines are the result of close-binary evolution, indicating that
low-mass, metal-weak or metal-poor stars can accrete substantial material prior to entering a
common-envelope phase.

INTRODUCTION

Binary-star evolution is responsible for a wide array of astrophysical phenomena, including blue stragglers, Type-Ia supernovae, and
gravitational waves (Maeder 1987; Webbink 1984; Abbott et al.
2016). Interactions between binary components may result in deviations from the course of typical single-star evolution, through
mass transfer or mergers, leading to changes in stellar structure and
atmospheric chemistry (Hurley et al. 2002; Temmink et al. 2020).
A prime example of how binary interactions can influence stellar
evolution is given by dwarf carbon (dC) stars. These low-mass,
main-sequence stars exhibit spectra analogous to those of evolved
carbon stars found at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB;
Dahn et al. 1977), but in advance of dredge-up processes being able
to modify surface chemistry.
The peculiar atmospheric chemistry (C/O > 1) in the prototype dC star, G77-61, is thought to originate through mass transfer
from an evolved, higher-mass companion (Dearborn et al. 1986).
In this picture, as the former primary star ascends the AGB, CNOprocessed material is dredged to its surface before stellar winds
liberate the consequently carbon-enhanced outer layers (Iben &
Renzini 1983). Enriched material is then transferred to the mainsequence companion, polluting its atmosphere and creating a dC
star, while the original primary becomes a white dwarf. The exact

physical means of mass transfer in these systems remain unknown,
but possibilities include classical processes of stellar-wind capture
and Roche-lobe overflow, and more-recent models such as wind–
Roche-lobe overflow (Abate et al. 2013). Regardless of the detailed
mechanisms, metal-poor stars are significantly more susceptible
to atmospheric pollution through external carbon enrichment processes (de Kool & Green 1995).
There is little optical evidence for white-dwarf companions to
dC stars, where only . 1 per cent of systems exhibit flux consistent
with a white dwarf at blue wavelengths (e.g. Heber et al. 1993;
Liebert et al. 1994; Green 2013). Nonetheless, recent observational
evidence supports a binary formation channel for dC stars. A radialvelocity study of 28 dC stars, each with typically 3–5 measurements
obtained over several years, suggests a dC binary fraction of at least
75 per cent (Whitehouse et al. 2018). A larger survey of 240 dC stars,
at a lower resolution, also found a high binary fraction, possibly as
large as 95 per cent, with a mean orbital period on the order of 1 yr
(Roulston et al. 2019).
The first four, well-characterised dC binaries all have orbital
periods on the order of years, as established by radial-velocity or
astrometric monitoring (Dearborn et al. 1986; Harris et al. 2018):
G77-61 (0.67 yr), LSPM 0742+4659 (1.23 yr), LP 255-12 (3.21 yr),
and LP 758-43 (11.4 yr). These systems are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries or their astrometric equivalent, with neither optical
nor ultraviolet indications of flux from their suspected evolved companions.

L. J. Whitehouse et al.

The existence of long orbital periods (& 100 d) among dC stars
is commensurate with better-studied classes of carbon-enhanced binary systems, such as CH, Ba, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars, which are all thought to follow analogous evolutionary pathways and which have orbital periods of hundreds to thousands of days (Jorissen et al. 2016; McClure et al. 1980; Lucatello
et al. 2005). In contrast, short-period binaries are not necessarily
expected, as Roche-lobe overflow tends to be unstable in the case
of mass transfer from a higher- to a lower-mass star, and the sole
population-synthesis study for dC stars verifies that short-period
systems fail to result if accretion is inefficient during a commonenvelope phase (de Kool & Green 1995).
However, in the same year that three of the long-period orbits
were published, the dC star SDSS J125017.90+252427.6 (hereafter
J1250) was reported to have a photometric period of 2.9 d, and
radial-velocity measurements folded on this period appear to provide a good orbital solution (Margon et al. 2018). This system has
two notable features: photometric variability on a period potentially
identical to the orbital period, and prominent emission in the Balmer
lines and in Ca ii H & K, all of which are photospheric (Margon
et al. 2018). Such emission features are rare among dC stars, with
only a handful known among the ∼1200 confirmed and suspected
candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Green 2013). Furthermore, a Chandra study of six emission-line dC stars detected each
of them in X-rays – a clear indication of stellar activity (Green et al.
2019). Such activity was not anticipated for dC stars, as they are
expected to be drawn from populations of older, metal-weak disc
stars as well as truly metal-poor halo stars (including the prototype
G77-61 with [Fe/H] −4; Plez & Cohen 2005) on the bases of their
kinematics (Harris et al. 1998; Plant et al. 2016; Farihi et al. 2018)
and population-synthesis modelling (de Kool & Green 1995).
Motivated by these findings, this study investigates the possibility that emission lines observed in some dC stars arise because of
unexpectedly rapid rotation, associated with tidal synchronisation
in short-period binaries, or with spin-up due to mass transfer. This
paper presents the results of radial-velocity and photometric timeseries analyses conducted for seven dC stars with Hα emission, and
finds that six stars in the sample are binaries with orbital periods in
the range 0.2–4.4 d. All seven sources show photometric variability
on periods that are either orbital, or are similarly short. The radialvelocity and photometric observations are summarised in Section 2,
the methods and period analyses are discussed in Section 3, the results for each individual target are presented in Section 4, and a
discussion follows in Section 5.

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
Target selection

The literature was searched to identify dC stars known to exhibit Hα
emission (e.g. Lowrance et al. 2003; Green 2013), with six selected
for further study based on brightness, visibility, as well as proper
motion consistent with the main sequence, and are listed in Table 1.
Four have been monitored previously for radial-velocity variations
over a several-year baseline, with a median of five observing epochs
per target (J1015, CLS 29, SBSS 1310, CBS 311; Whitehouse et al.
2018). Furthermore, the emission-line dC star J1250 is included in
this analysis, though no new data have been obtained for this target.

Radial velocities

Radial-velocity monitoring was conducted using the ISIS spectrograph on the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope at the Roque de Los
Muchachos Observatory. Some of the observations are reported in
a previous paper (Whitehouse et al. 2018), and further observing
runs have since been carried out in 2018 Aug, 2019 Feb and Apr,
and 2020 Feb. All observations prior to 2020 were carried out using only the blue arm of the spectrograph, without any dichroic,
in combination with the R1200B grating. An EEV12 detector was
employed without binning, providing wavelength coverage of approximately 5000–6000 Å and a resolving power R ≈ 6700 at the
central wavelength (1 arcsec slit). The wavelength range encompasses many strong atomic and molecular lines, including the Mg i b
triplet, Na i D doublet, and two prominent C2 Swan bands (see Table 2).
In 2020 Feb, both the blue and red arms of the ISIS spectrograph were used, with the GG495 dichroic. The blue arm was
equipped with the R600B grating to provide wavelength coverage of
3510–5340 Å, achieving a resolving power R ≈ 2700 at the central
wavelength. These data were obtained using the EEV12 detector
without binning. The red arm of the spectrograph was employed
with the R1200R grating, covering a wavelength range of 5770–
6770 Å, where a resolving power of R ≈ 7400 was achieved. These
data were obtained using the RED+ detector with no binning. Together, these more recent data cover Hα and the higher Balmer
lines.
Beginning in 2019, each star was observed a number of times
(typically two to four) during each night to probe for short-term
changes in radial velocity. Each observation consisted of at least
three separate exposures of the science target, with wavelengthcalibration frames taken immediately before and after. Individual
exposure times for the stars varied between 180 and 600 s typically,
for the brighter and fainter sources, respectively. Standard stars and
other calibration data were taken at least once per night.
All science exposures were bias subtracted, flat fielded, and
extracted using standard methods in iraf. For extraction, the 2dimensional spectral trace was established using the standard star
observation with the highest signal-to-noise (S/N) of the night and
was re-centred for the extraction of each target spectrum. Individual exposures were wavelength calibrated using the appropriate arc
frames for each target. Finally, all consecutive target exposures were
combined using inverse variance weighting, to create a single spectrum with S/N & 10 for analysis.

Photometry

Time-series photometry used in this study was sourced primarily from the public data releases of the Palomar Transient Factory
(PTF), intermediate-Palomar Transient Factory, and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) surveys (Law et al. 2009; Kulkarni 2013; Bellm
2014). The primary science goals of these projects are to monitor the
sky for transient events, using the Palomar 48-in Oschin Schmidt
Telescope with wide-field imagers, surveying the entire available
northern sky roughly every three days. The detection limit of the
survey is R ≈ 20.6 mag (Rau et al. 2009), and all data are fully reduced and calibrated by the dedicated facility pipelines (Ofek et al.
2012; Masci et al. 2019).
Data were retrieved for J0901, J1015, and CBS 311 by querying the PTF DR3 and ZTF DR5 databases using their Gaia eDR3
astrometry (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2020). For each target, a cone
search was made using a 15-arcsec radius centred on the 2015.5
Gaia positions. Only matches within 0.5 arcsec of the expected
position were selected for analysis; this is well within the typical diameter of the point spread function of the surveys. All photometric
data with poor quality flags were rejected.
Photometric monitoring of the dC star J0842 was conducted
by Kepler during K2 campaign 18, with continuous measurements
for two months at a cadence of 30 min (Howell et al. 2014). Other
sources of photometry were not used for this target, as the Kepler
data are of superior quality.
Finally, CLS 29 and SBSS 1310 were observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2015), and
are sufficiently bright and isolated that useful data were obtained.
CLS 29 was observed in Sector 22, and SBSS 1310 in Sectors 15,
16, and 22 (with an interval of 139 days between Sectors 16 and 22).
The duration of each TESS sector is approximately 25 d, with photometric observations taken every 30 min.

velocity error by around 50 per cent compared to a determination of
absolute velocity using the few available (weak) atomic lines. These
more precise but relative velocity measurements are then used to
determine the orbital parameters for each target.
To establish an absolute velocity scale for these data, the highest S/N spectrum of each target was cross-correlated against a
continuum-normalised synthetic spectrum template. These spectra were synthesised using autokur, which is a wrapper for the
Kurucz spectral synthesis codes (Kurucz 2005), with the underlying atmospheric structures based on marcs models (Gustafsson
et al. 2008). Stellar parameters were chosen to be representative of
low-mass main-sequence stars (i.e. appropriate for late-K to early-M
dwarfs), and to reflect the older kinematical ages of the dC population as a whole. Templates were generated for Teff = 3500–4500 K
in steps of 250 K, and metallicities [Fe/H] from −2 to 0 in integer
steps, with the surface gravity and microturbulence kept fixed at
log [g (cm s−2 )] = 5.0 and v t = 2.0 km s−1 , respectively. The synthetic spectra were generated at resolving powers of R = 6700 and
7900 to match the instrumental resolution achieved under standard
and best observing conditions at the telescope, respectively.
Because stellar-atmosphere models are not currently available
for cool, carbon-rich dwarf stars, the synthetic spectra were generated for stars with solar carbon abundances, at gravities and effective temperatures similar to those expected for a typical dC star.
The C2 Swan bands, which contain myriad individual transitions
and are useful for relative velocity measurements, are not present
in the solar-abundance templates, and would lead to increased
measurement errors in velocity if used as the primary source of
cross-correlation. Therefore, to minimise the measurement errors,
restricted wavelength regions of the synthetic templates – those
containing the strongest atomic lines – were selected for crosscorrelation. Using these restricted regions significantly improved
the quality of each cross-correlation (albeit while still not as precise
as the relative velocity measurements), by mitigating spectral mismatches. The wavelength regions used for the synthetic templates
are listed in Table 2.
To determine the best synthetic template to measure absolute velocities, each synthetic template was cross-correlated against
the highest S/N spectrum of each observed dC star. The template
that achieved the strongest cross-correlation function was therefore deemed as the most suitable. In general, templates at cooler
temperatures achieved a stronger cross-correlation function than
templates at higher temperatures; those with Teff 6 4000 K consistently outperformed their warmer counterparts across the whole
metallicity range. Furthermore, templates with metallicity [Fe/H]
= 0 typically performed worse when compared to lower metallicity
templates. Overall, the resolving power of the templates exhibited
no performance trend in cross-correlations. The stellar parameters
of the best performing synthetic spectral template were [Fe/H] = −1,
Teff = 3750 K, and R = 6700. This template was therefore adopted
to measure absolute velocities, as it consistently possessed strong
cross-correlation metrics with high S/N observed spectra.

Radial-velocity cross-correlation
3.2

The most precise measurements of radial-velocity changes are
achieved by cross-correlating individual spectra of a given target
against its highest S/N counterpart. Such measurements benefit
from the strong molecular carbon absorption features (e.g. C2 Swan
bands) in dC stars. To achieve the best cross-correlation possible,
all spectra were first continuum-normalised by fitting a cubic spline.
The cross-correlation was performed using the iraf fxcor package
(Tonry & Davis 1979). This cross-correlation method reduces the

Radial-velocity period determinations

The joker is software designed to determine orbital periods from
radial-velocity data, under the assumption that all variability is the
product of two-body gravitational interactions (Price-Whelan et al.
2017, 2020). For a given number of samples drawn from the prior
probability distribution function (PDF), it uses the method of rejection sampling to eliminate low-likelihood solutions, generating a
random value for each posterior sample, r j , between 0 and the maxi-

mum likelihood in the posterior distribution, L max . If the likelihood
of a specific sample, L j , does not meet the condition that r j < L j ,
then the sample is rejected. This approach guarantees at least one
surviving sample and is particularly useful where radial-velocity
data are sparse.

Because the joker analysis is performed on the more precise,
relative radial-velocity data, the systemic velocity returned from the
analysis is offset from the true value. This was corrected by applying
the absolute velocity offsets as determined by the synthetic spectral
templates, while propagating the errors in the offset measurement
(which are assumed to be Gaussian) with the systemic velocity
posterior distribution.

The orbital parameters for each target are quoted as the median
of the final posterior distribution (whether through the joker or
MCMC) and presented in Table 3. The median was selected due to
the non-Gaussian nature of some of the distributions. The uncertainties in the orbital parameters for each target are quoted as the 16 per
cent and 84 per cent confidence limit in the posterior distribution.
This analysis was completed for the six targets discussed in this
paper, as well as J1250. The radial-velocity curves corresponding
to the median orbital parameters derived through this analysis are
shown in Figure 1, with the posterior PDFs of each target displayed
in Figure A1.

To ensure that an adequate number of posterior samples survive
the joker analysis, 109 prior samples are generated for each target,
with the maximum posterior sample size set to 8192. However, the
number of posterior samples removed during the rejection sampling
algorithm in the joker is a function of the maximum likelihood
of those posterior samples. Therefore, for targets possessing more
constraining data, fewer posterior samples survive.
In the scenario where few samples survive rejection sampling,
the posterior distribution returned from the joker is typically unimodal with fewer than 100 samples. Owing to the small number
of surviving samples, in order to explore the posterior distribution
fully, these surviving samples are used as prior samples to initialise
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The pymc3 nou-turn sampler was used with four chains and a tuning length of
1000, yielding a total of 2500 posterior samples per chain (Salvatier
et al. 2016; Hoffman & Gelman 2011). This further analysis with
MCMC was necessary for the dC stars CLS 29 and SBSS 1310, as
only 10 and 74 samples survived rejection sampling, respectively.
All other targets possess sufficiently large posterior distributions
from the joker such that this additional analysis was obviated.

Absolute radial velocity [km s−1 ]

Prior PDFs were selected for orbital eccentricity, velocity semiamplitude, and systemic velocity as follows. Only circular orbits
were considered, both for simplicity and because the available
radial-velocity sampling is insufficient to robustly characterise eccentric orbits. Should a short-period solution result for any given
system, then the circular orbit assumption is retrospectively well
justified for post-common-envelope binaries (Paczynski 1976; Podsiadlowski 2001). Velocity semi-amplitudes were sampled from a
Gaussian PDF: for each target, the mean was set to zero, with the
standard deviation set to 110 km s−1 (taking the absolute value). The
adopted standard deviation is based on the expected velocity semiamplitude for a binary with a total mass of 1.1M , a 5 d period,
and 60◦ inclination. The width of the prior PDF on velocity semiamplitude is intended to avoid biasing the posterior distributions.
Finally, systemic velocities were sampled from a Gaussian distribution also centred at zero, with a standard deviation of 100 km s−1 .
Again, this prior PDF is uninformative and should not bias against
any actual velocities.

and the p4j (Huijse et al. 2018) implementation of Multi-Harmonic
Analysis of Variance (MHAOV; Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996). The
results of the LS analysis are presented in Figure 2.

The LS periodogram is a method to derive the period of oscillation, for a recurrent signal, in unevenly sampled time-series data
through the construction of a Fourier-like power spectrum (VanderPlas 2018); it is almost equivalent to performing a least-square fit of
a sine wave (cf. Zechmeister & Kürster 2009). Such a periodogram
can be relatively difficult to interpret, as the Fourier transform of any
continuous signal in the data is convolved with the window function.
It can therefore be challenging to identify which periodogram peaks
represent real signals in the time-series data. To break the degeneracy between the true and aliased peaks, an LS periodogram was
computed for the window function for each target, and the windowfunction periodogram compared to the periodogram computed from
the actual fluxes.

All peaks surviving these quality checks were then considered to be
real periodic signals in the data.
To calculate the error in the photometric period corresponding
to the best LS periodogram signal for a particular target, a random
number of data points were dropped from the dataset and replaced
by randomly sampling the original dataset. This new dataset was
then analysed as outlined above, and the process was repeated 103
times to generate a distribution of most likely photometric periods,
where the final error is quoted as the standard deviation of this
distribution. The LS periodograms for the seven targets and their
most significant frequency peaks are shown in Figure 2.

For an LS periodogram peak to be considered real, it must
be sufficiently separate in frequency from a significant peak in the
periodogram of the window function. Quantitatively, a significant
peak in the window function was defined as any peak with power
above 20 per cent of the strongest peak in the window function. The
minimum separation in frequency space between a window function
peak and an LS peak was chosen to be 0.001 d−1 . Finally, a falsealarm probability was calculated by performing a bootstrap on the
photometric data for the top five peaks that satisfied these conditions.

Multi-harmonic analysis of photometry

The MHAOV method was then used as an independent check on
the LS periodograms. In principle, this method differs from the LS
analysis in terms of the model fitted to the data, and the statistic
calculated from that fit. Whereas the LS method assumes the data
are well modelled by a sine wave, the MHAOV method instead
uses orthogonal Szegö polynomials. It should be noted that the first
harmonics of the Szegö polynomials simplify to a sine wave, and

Notes. Errors for the period determinations are non-Gaussian and discussed in detail for all stars in Section 4, with posterior distributions shown in the
Appendix. The third column lists a model binary inclination based on the adopted or suspected radial-velocity period and velocity semi-amplitude (or upper
limit), under the assumptions of 0.4 M for the dC star, and 0.6 M for a white-dwarf companion. The fourth column lists the reduced χ2 for each of the
orbital solutions fitted in Figure 1. The final column gives a positive (+) or negative (−) indication as to whether the observed photometric variability
amplitude could plausibly result from modulation due to tidal distortion (T), a heating effect from irradiation (I), or rotation (R).

thus in this work, both the LS and MHAOV method are fitting sine
waves to the photometric data.
The advantage of using MHAOV, therefore, comes from how
the goodness of fit statistic is calculated (Lachowicz et al. 2006). The
statistic used in the LS method is simply χ2 . However, because the
true data variance is not actually known, the statistic and variance
estimations cannot be independent. The MHAOV method circumvents this problem by using the Fisher analysis-of-variance statistic
instead of a χ2 , thus breaking the dependency between the statistic
and the variance. This has the benefit of suppressing the significance
of periodogram peaks that are due to aliasing in the data; therefore,
allowing for the determination of real peaks to be significantly easier than in the LS analysis. Furthermore, the MHAOV analysis is
capable of detecting periodic signals at lower S/N than the LS analysis, while also assigning real signals with a higher significance
than the LS analysis (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996). Based on these
statistical advantages, the MHAOV method was used in parallel to
the LS method, and in particular to verify the five strongest peaks
identified from the LS analysis for each target. The MHAOV analysis agreed with the strongest peak identified through the LS analysis
for all targets in this study and hence, only the LS periodograms are
shown in Figure 2. All photometric periods quoted in this study are
the most significant peak in both analyses.

RESULTS FOR INDIVIDUAL STARS

The results of both the photometric and radial-velocity analyses
are presented here in detail for each target, with a brief summary
provided in Table 3.
4.1

J0842

The dC star J0842 has an unusual spectrum compared to its siblings, as is shown in Figure 3. While the spectrum exhibits clear
CN features in the red, below roughly 7000 Å the flux is broadly
consistent with a late-K dwarf. However, there are subtle but convincing signs of C2 Swan bands in the blue, especially when compared side by side with an appropriate stellar template of solar
abundance (e.g. the late sdK stars SDSS J110140.90+385230.2 or
SDSS J142617.53+073749.2). Also noteworthy is the CaH band – a
hallmark of metal-poor, cool subdwarfs (Reid & Gizis 2005; Lépine
et al. 2007). In addition to Hα, close inspection also reveals emission
in Hβ and Hγ. Without the clear CN features, the spectrum might

easily be mistaken for that of a K dwarf, although the emission lines
would remain remarkable.
Interestingly, the source is detected with Galex in both the
far- and near-ultraviolet bandpasses. There are three and four separate detections respectively, with weighted averages of m FUV =
22.0 AB mag, m NUV = 21.4 AB mag. It is possible that these ultraviolet detections are a result of strong cool-star line emission
at these wavelengths, but there are few transitions that could be
responsible. In the near-ultraviolet Galex band, the Mg ii 2800 Å
doublet is a candidate, but this is highly unlikely. It is near the red
cutoff of the bandpass, and furthermore, the emission would have
to be three orders of magnitude brighter than the stellar continuum.
The corresponding far-ultraviolet detection cannot be due to any
common stellar emission features, as the bandpass cuts off before
Lyα. Therefore, the observed ultraviolet flux is almost certainly not
intrinsic to the dC star.
The ultraviolet fluxes appear to be consistent with a white
dwarf, and in Figure 3 the ultraviolet and optical photometry
for J0842 is approximated using models. Solar-abundance models (Castelli & Kurucz 2003) were used for the dC star, as there are
currently no atmospheric models for carbon-enhanced cool dwarfs,
while white-dwarf atmospheric models were taken from Koester
(2010). A reasonable fit to the ultraviolet-optical photometry is
achieved using a Teff = 12 000 K, hydrogen-atmosphere whitedwarf model, together with a Teff = 4000 K main-sequence stellar
template, where a modestly metal-poor model atmosphere provides
a somewhat better fit than one with solar metallicity.
If the white dwarf is at the Gaia parallax distance of d =
680 ± 50 pc, then, for the observed temperature and luminosity, evolutionary models1 suggest a surface gravity close to a canonical
value of log [g (cm s−2 )] = 8.0, with a corresponding mass and
radius of 0.61 M and 0.013 R , and cooling age of around 40 Myr
(Fontaine et al. 2001). It is noteworthy that the SDSS u-band photometry appears to be consistent with the composite stellar fluxes,
and the Gaia distance indicates clearly that this is a main-sequence
star with Mr = 8.0 AB mag.
This target was observed during K2 campaign 18. The LS
periodogram analysis yields a clearly-defined photometric period
of 0.945 ± 0.001 d with a mean semi-amplitude of ±0.014 mag
(Figure 2).
Nine radial-velocity observations were obtained over three

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Active dC stars with short orbital periods
nights in 2019, with two to four measurements per night. Additionally, five further radial-velocity measurements were taken in
2020 Feb. Perhaps surprisingly, these data do not reveal any radialvelocity variations exceeding the error bars (typically ±5 km s−1 ).
Thus, if J0842 is binary with the suspected white-dwarf companion
described above, and its orbital period is similar to the observed
photometric period of 0.95 d, then the inclination must be 6 6.1◦
(3σ) for masses of MdC = 0.4 M and MWD = 0.6 M .
4.2

J0901

This source exhibits a dC optical spectrum with no evidence for a
luminous companion, and is, therefore, a more typical example of
its class, albeit with the exception of the Hα and likely Hβ emission
features. It is detected in X-rays by Chandra (Green et al. 2019), but
Galex observations do not exist for this region of the sky. This study
is the first to address its potential binarity, and all radial-velocity
observations reported are new.
The joker radial-velocity analysis indicates that the orbital
period distribution is approximately bimodal, with one larger peak
at 2.11 d and a second, smaller peak at around 2.09 d. The median
+0.0 d and a
of the posterior distribution yields a period of 2.12−0.03
+1.5
−1
velocity semi-amplitude of 24.49−1.6 km s . A modest number of
additional radial-velocity measurements at around a phase of 0.7
would likely precisely constrain the orbital period.
The photometric analysis for J0901 was conducted on both ZTF
and TESS data. Because of the target faintness, the TESS photometry
are not useful, but the ZTF data indicate a possible photometric period of 2.12 d. However, this photometric period remains relatively
uncertain.

4.3

J1015

This source does not appear in any compendium of dC stars published to date but is flagged as having carbon lines by the SDSS spectroscopic reduction pipeline in Data Release 9. The SDSS spectrum
appears to be a composite of a dC star and a DA-type white dwarf
that contributes continuum flux and broad absorption at Hγ, Hδ,
and Hε. It is a binary suspect reported by Whitehouse et al. (2018),
based on only two radial-velocity measurements which differ by
nearly 7σ.
The white dwarf is detected clearly in Galex ultraviolet photometry, where the weighted average of two observations yield
m FUV = 17.6 AB mag, m NUV = 18.0 AB mag. The ultraviolet
colour alone suggests an effective temperature between 20 000 and
25 000 K for a typical white-dwarf surface gravity. The inclusion
of the SDSS u-band photometry and the d ≈ 480 pc Gaia parallax
distance then favours Teff closer to, but not quite 25 000 K to best
match the expected absolute ultraviolet magnitudes for a carbon–
oxygen core white dwarf. While J1015 is one of the six dC stars
detected in X-rays by Chandra (Green et al. 2019), the white dwarf
cannot be the source of hard X-rays.
Owing to the low S/N in the spectra of J1015, it was not immediately possible to cross-correlate each spectrum with the relative
velocity template. Therefore, each observed spectrum of J1015 was
re-binned to lower resolution, with each bin consisting of three
pixels. These re-binned spectra were then cross-correlated against
the relative velocity template to yield precise velocities for determining the orbital period, before being cross-correlated against the
synthetic template, to determine absolute velocities.
The joker radial-velocity analysis finds that the orbital period
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

7

is strongly peaked at 0.20 d. There are a modest number of posterior
samples discretely scattered at either side of this peak, though these
samples are very few compared to the peak. The velocity semiamplitude of J1015 is measured to be 18.5+2.7
km s−1 , and thus the
−2.5
system inclination is likely to be low.
The photometric analysis reveals a strong frequency peak corresponding to a period of 0.196 ± 0.003 d, where two smaller flanking peaks in the power spectrum are the result of windowing. Relatively large photometric errors (averaging 0.07 mag) for this source
give rise to the broadened structures in the periodogram. This photometric period is strongest in both the LS and MHAOV analyses,
and the phase-folded light-curve at this period shows an amplitude
near 2 per cent.

4.4

CLS 29

The optical spectrum of this dC star is relatively unremarkable,
except for the presence of Hα and Hβ emission. The source is
possibly marginally detected in the near-ultraviolet with Galex at
m NUV = 22.9 ± 0.6 AB mag, but too uncertain to warrant further
analysis. The TESS data yield a clear peak in the periodogram, corresponding to a period of 3.62 d. The amplitude of the photometric
variation is around 1.4 per cent.
This study is the first to report radial-velocity variations in
CLS 29. The radial-velocity analysis is highly constraining, with
only 1 in 108 posterior samples surviving. The MCMC analysis
yields a bimodal distribution in the orbital parameters, where both
peaks in the orbital period are within 1 per cent of 3.14 d. Owing to
incomplete phase coverage during the radial-velocity monitoring,
the period cannot be uniquely determined. Additional velocity measurements for phases 0.4−0.5 should break the degeneracy between
the two solutions.

4.5

J1250

This dC star is a known single-lined binary and the first shown to
have a short-period orbit (Margon et al. 2018), where both photometric and radial-velocity variations are observed. It is included
here for context and discussed later, as it belongs to the subgroup
of stars exhibiting Hα emission lines, and is detected in X-rays
(Green et al. 2019). There are Galex observations for this region
of the sky, but no detection near the location of J1250 in either
ultraviolet band, placing a rough upper limit at either wavelength
of m > 22.0 AB mag. For a white-dwarf companion at the Gaia
parallax distance, this would imply a star no brighter than around
m = 15 AB mag in the ultraviolet, and for a typical mass and radius
this would translate to Teff . 8000 K.
The publicly available photometric data from ZTF for J1250
were analysed using the LS and MHAOV analyses. The photometric
period of 2.92 d identified by Margon et al. (2018) was successfully
recovered.
While the radial-velocity measurements of J1250 taken by
Margon et al. (2018) do appear consistent with the photometric
period, no dedicated radial-velocity analysis was performed in that
study. Here, the reported radial-velocity data are analysed using the
joker, where the median posterior distribution for the orbital period
is found to be 2.56+0.13
d, and is notably 12 per cent shorter than
−0.11
the reported photometric period.

as in S-type carbon giants; this star may therefore be an example of an S-type dwarf. The most prominent feature is the MgH band near 5100 Å, while other
notable absorption lines include Na i D, the K i doublet near 7700 Å, and the Ca ii red triplet. The spectrum also shows a depression near 6800 Å due to CaH,
which is a typical sign of metal poverty in cool dwarf stars. Right: The ultraviolet through optical spectral energy distribution of J0842. The SDSS spectrum is
shown in solid grey, with photometric fluxes shown as blue and purple error bars. Two scaled 4000 K synthetic spectra are shown in dashed orange and red for
different metallicities. The addition of a 12 000 K, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf is shown in dashed black, and the resulting composite spectra are traced
in solid orange and red.

4.6

SBSS 1310

This is one of the nearest and brightest dC stars known, and among
only three or four objects within or just outside 100 pc (Harris et al.
2018). The optical spectrum is spectacular and shows emission from
higher Balmer lines as well as Ca ii H and K (Rossi et al. 2011).
There is a detection of this source in Galex in the near-ultraviolet
only, with m NUV = 20.3 AB mag. Similar to the more detailed
argument above for J0842, it is unlikely that emission from the dC
star is responsible for near-ultraviolet flux detection, and in this
case, stellar emission lines would need to be roughly 400 times
brighter than the expected continuum. Based solely on the absolute
magnitude of this ultraviolet detection, and assuming it was due to
a typical surface gravity white dwarf at the Gaia parallax distance
to this target, it would imply Teff ≈ 7500 K.
Whitehouse et al. (2018) reported several radial-velocity observations of this star that strongly indicate binarity at a significance
just above 7σ. Analysis of the previous and newer radial-velocity
data with the joker yields only 70 surviving samples. The subsequent MCMC posterior distribution for SBSS 1310 is unimodal for
all parameters, with the orbital period tightly constrained at 4.43 d
with a velocity semi-amplitude of 46.5 ± 0.84 km s−1 .
The TESS data reveal a strong periodic signal corresponding to
a photometric period of 5.26±0.01 d. Unexpectedly, the photometric
analysis on the individual, cleaned light-curves from each TESS
sector reveals a clear change in the photometric period; Sectors 15,
16, and 22, individually, yield periods of 5.17 ± 0.01, 5.24 ± 0.01,
and 5.30 ± 0.01 d, respectively. Also serendipitously, the amplitude
of the photometric variation changes significantly between Sector
16 and 22, by around a factor of five. These data are discussed in
more detail in Section 5.2.3.

4.7

CBS 311

This system is a previously known binary with a composite spectrum
(Liebert et al. 1994), consisting of the dC star and a Teff ≈ 31 000 K
DA (≡ strongest spectral lines are hydrogen) white dwarf. The region

of the sky occupied by this target lacks any Galex observations that
could further constrain the luminosity of the companion. CBS 311
is one of the dC stars detected in X-rays by Chandra (Green et al.
2019), but it should be noted again that the white dwarf cannot be the
source of the high-energy emission. This target was also imaged at
high spatial resolution using the Hubble Space Telescope, where the
binary remained unresolved to at least 25 mas (Farihi et al. 2010),
corresponding to a projected separation on the sky of roughly 10 AU
at the 440 pc Gaia DR2 parallax distance.
The dC star in this binary is fainter than suggested by the r-band
brightness due to some flux contribution from the white dwarf. This
diminishes the effective S/N of the absorption lines used for crosscorrelation when measuring relative and absolute velocities. Therefore, each spectrum of CBS 311 was re-binned to a lower resolution
by taking the mean of every 3 pixels. The radial-velocity analysis
identifies one prominent peak in the posterior distribution of the
orbital parameters, at 0.19 d with small peaks to either side, where
the velocity semi-amplitude is constrained to be 29.2+2.0
km s−1 .
−1.7
The photometric analysis was conducted on the available ZTF
data for this target. A clear periodic signal corresponding to the
strongest periodogram peak is located at 0.302 ± 0.001 d, with a
semi-amplitude near ±3 per cent.

DISCUSSION

Spectroscopic and photometric periods are closely similar for all
six systems for which both have been established, but are indistinguishable for only two (Table 3). For those two, orbital variability
is, ostensibly, a plausible mechanism for the photometric changes.
For the remaining stars (at least), the working hypothesis is that the
photometric variability must arise through rotational modulation,
with the close similarities between orbital and rotational periods
arising through tidal synchronisation.
In this section, binary light-curve simulations are presented,
in order to provide context for the observed photometric variability.

inclination.

for the observed emission-line activity, are then explored. Finally,
the origin and evolution of these binaries are discussed in a wider
context of carbon-enhanced stars.

5.1

Binary light-curve simulations

As an aid to interpreting the observed photometric variability, a
range of orbital light-curves are simulated in order to gauge the
possible effects of close-binary interaction. The goal is to distinguish
purely orbital photometric effects from the rotation of the dC star
itself. In particular, the aim is to characterise tidal-distortion and
heating (irradiation, or day–night) effects arising from a whitedwarf companion, and thereby to characterise the parameter space
where these effects may be significant.
A standard Roche model is adopted, with simple 'deep' heating, using the current version of a code originally described by
Howarth (1982). These illustrative calculations are carried out for
the Cousins R band, as a rough match to the observed photometry, with the dC component modelled as a star with TdC = 4000 K,
MdC = 0.44 M , and RdC = 0.42 R (if the lobe size allows; lobefilling otherwise), which are approximately the values expected for
a star near the bottom of the K-dwarf sequence for a metallicity
[Fe/H] = −1.0 and an age of 1 Gyr or older (Dotter et al. 2008).
The choice of metallicity has a strong influence on the inferred
mass and radius for a fixed effective temperature, where going from
solar metallicity to [Fe/H] = −2.0 changes the implied stellar mass
from roughly 0.6 to 0.3 M at 4000 K. The metallicity of dC stars
remains poorly determined, except in a single case of extreme metal
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

poverty (G77-61 with [Fe/H] = −4.0; Plez & Cohen 2005), yet the
kinematics of dC stars clearly indicates that the population includes
a large fraction of metal-poor members. The chosen conservative
decrement from solar yields Mr = 8.6 AB mag, and this compares
favourably with the stars studied here, whose absolute magnitudes
span Mr = 8.0–9.2 AB mag (see Table 3).
The adopted default white-dwarf parameters are TWD =
30 000 K, MWD = 0.60 M , RWD = 0.014 R , based on parameters for the white-dwarf companion to CBS 311 (Liebert et al.
1994), one of only two known hot, bright companions to any dC
star. The implied mass–radius ratio is fairly typical of single white
dwarfs, as well as those found binaries (although in the models the
adopted radius is of consequence only for its role in determining the
luminosity, L/L ' 0.14, which determines the magnitude of the
irradiation). A white dwarf of this nature gives rise to a significant
heating (or day–night) effect on its companion. In order to explore
the effect of fainter white dwarfs, each simulation at a given orbital period was run for a range of heating efficiencies from 100 per
cent down to 20 per cent, where the latter roughly corresponds to
TWD = 20 000 K for the same white-dwarf mass and radius.
The models incorporate a number of simplifications that are
inconsequential for the purposes of this study. The dC surface intensities are calculated using a constant, linear limb-darkening coefficient of 0.6 (roughly appropriate for the range of temperatures
found), a gravity-darkening exponent of 0.08, and emergent fluxes
(from Howarth 2011) interpolated at fixed log [g (cm s−2 )] = 5.0.
While the white dwarf is bolometrically luminous (giving rise to
heating of the dC-star atmosphere), it contributes no flux directly
to the simulated light-curves. Orbital periods are taken from the

L. J. Whitehouse et al.

range Porb = 0.2–1.0 d – the shortest measured or suggested periods known – in steps 0.1 d, with inclinations i = 10–90◦ in steps of
10◦ .
Figure 4 shows a representative sample of the simulated lightcurves, each panel holding some parameters fixed while varying
others. Notably for these parameters, the dC star fills its Roche lobe
just below the simulation range at a period of 0.1 d (R ' 0.33R ).
At 0.2 d, the tidal distortion of the star results in a photometric
semi-amplitude near ±0.15 mag, and with the characteristic doublepeaked, non-sinusoidal pattern. Adding heating at the shortest simulated period results in a single peak and semi-amplitude just over
±0.30 mag. At longer periods (i.e., wider separations), both of these
orbital-motion-induced effects diminish rapidly; their full combined
effect at 0.4 d is less than half that at 0.2 d. For periods approaching and exceeding 1.0 d, both tidal distortion and irradiation have a
negligible impact on the emergent flux.
The magnitude of these calculated effects are taken here only
as a representative guide, and they are accurate only to a degree. For
the tidal distortion, a classical Roche lobe is used for the equipotential surface, without the influence of asynchronous rotation. The
atmosphere of the irradiated star is only changed insofar as a local effective temperature modification, and without any calculation
of the actual atmospheric structure. Despite these potential shortcomings, the simulations should be sufficient to determine whether
an observed photometric variation can plausibly be attributable to
orbital motion, as opposed to stellar rotation.

5.2

Source of photometric variability

Here, the discussion pursues the question of whether the observed
photometric variability in any given system can be attributed to
orbital motion or to rotation of the dC star.

5.2.1

Rotation versus orbit

The seven dC stars listed in Table 3 exhibit photometric variability
amplitudes falling between ±0.014 and ±0.030 mag, with no apparent correlations with orbital period, or with (crudely estimated)
inclination. Each system is compared with the light-curve simulations (Fig. 4) for the appropriate orbital period (or range), and none
are consistent with ellipsoidal variations induced by tidal distortion.
There are two elements to this inference; first, the amplitudes of the
predicted changes are significantly smaller than those observed, and
secondly, the dominant photometric period of ellipsoidal variations
should be exactly half the orbital period. While ellipsoidal variations
would occur more readily in systems with shorter orbital periods,
neither J1015 nor CBS 311 (each with Porb ≈ 0.2 d) exhibit such
light-curve characteristics. As a result of having well-constrained
radial-velocity periods for six of the targets, it can be securely stated
that none of their light-curves are consistent with an origin in tidaldistortions.
Next, the observed photometric changes are compared with
those that might be induced due to irradiation from a relatively hot
and luminous white-dwarf component – the day–night, or heating,
effect. The predicted amplitudes can match or exceed the observed
ranges, and so a more detailed examination is needed. The simulations suggest CBS 311 might experience a ±0.15 mag modulation in
its light-curve due to irradiation, and the observed value is around
fives times smaller than this, and thus is unlikely. For J1015, the
companion appears to be roughly three times less luminous (see
below), and because the irradiated flux scales with luminosity, the

Orbital period [d]

and 84 per cent confidence limits. Due to the highly non-Gaussian errors in
the photometric period of J0901, the mode of the photometric period is also
shown. The solid black line represents the identity line between the orbital
and photometric periods. As there are no constraints on the orbital period
of J0842, the photometric period is plotted as a green dashed line across

name.

heating effect will commensurately decrease. In this case, the simulations indicate that a mildly double-peaked structure is expected,
with a semi-amplitude near ±0.07 mag, and thus a possibility.
There are two additional effects that would mitigate the magnitude of any orbital-induced photometric changes. First, in the
simulations, the white dwarf contributes no flux to the light-curve,
and thus in cases where the white dwarf is visible in the optical
spectrum, there will be a corresponding dilution factor from the
contribution of its flux. In CBS 311, the two stars contribute nearly
equal flux in the r band (Liebert et al. 1994), and thus the predicted
amplitude of the heating effect on the dC star will be diluted by
a factor ∼2. For J1015, the ultraviolet through optical spectra and
photometry are decently fit by the addition of a Teff = 23 500 K
DA-type white dwarf, whose flux in the r band is approximately
25 per cent of the total, and the amplitude of any heating effect will
be reduced accordingly. Secondly, for an i = 0◦ (face-on) binary,
there is no expected flux modulation from either tidal distortion or
irradiation, as both binary components are in full view for the entire
orbit. The amplitude of both these orbital effects on the light-curve
should increase to first order as sin i (Figure 4), and thus in real observations, where present, these effects will typically be modestly
decreased.
Taking into account all of these factors as the data permit, the
light-curves of both CBS 311 and J1015 become inconsistent with
irradiation for relatively low inclinations. Specifically, for i < 42◦
the observed photometric variation of CBS 311 is more consistent
with rotation, and similarly for J1015 for i < 25◦ . For the stars
J0842, J0901, CLS 29, J1250, and SBSS 1310, the only realistic
source of photometric variability is rotation. This is next considered as the primary or exclusive cause of the observed light-curve
variations in the sample of dC stars is axial rotation.

5.2.2

Tidal synchronisation

Figure 5 shows the relationship between the photometric and orbital periods for the six targets with well-constrained radial-velocity
periods (including J1250). Two systems have essentially identical
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Active dC stars with short orbital periods
photometric and radial-velocity periods, while the remaining four
have photometric periods that are modestly longer than the radialvelocity periods (further undermining the possibility that the photometric variations are orbital).
Those systems with matching photometric and radial-velocity
periods – J0901 and J1015 – are neither the shortest period systems,
nor those with the most luminous companions, as might be expected
if tidal distortion or irradiation were responsible for the photometric variability. The stars J1250, CLS 29, SBSS 1310, and CBS 311
possess photometric periods on average around 15 per cent longer
than their orbital periods, which is strictly inconsistent with orbital
motion.
The collective data on these emission-line dC stars therefore
broadly support a rotational origin for the photometric changes.
However, magnetic braking causes spin-down with age for isolated
convective stars. Assuming a crude, and probably conservative, age
estimate for dC stars of a few to several Gyr (Farihi et al. 2018),
the empirical age–rotation relationship for single M dwarfs predicts
spin periods on the order of 20–100 d (Engle & Guinan 2018) –
significantly longer than any of the photometric periods measured in
this study, implying an additional source of spin angular momentum.
Tidally induced rotational synchronisation is an appealing
mechanism for the implied spin-up and relatively rapid rotation,
particularly since the radial-velocity data are consistent with circular orbits (and rotational synchronisation is expected to take
place on shorter timescales than orbital circularisation). Theoretical timescales for synchronisation depend mainly on the ratio of
the radius of the star experiencing tidal forces (here the dC star)
to the orbital separation between the binary components. Adopting
canonical values for M-dwarf radii, along with the orbital separations determined from this study, it is found that synchronisation
timescales are a few Myr up to no more than a Gyr (Zahn 1989,
2008).
Assuming that all of the binary companions are now white
dwarfs, their cooling timescales can be estimated and provide a
window over which tidal synchronisation could have occurred. Attributing all Galex ultraviolet flux in these systems to white dwarfs
– and upper limits for non-detections – at the Gaia distances to
the dC stars, and assuming a fixed white-dwarf surface gravity of
log [g (cm s−2 )] = 8.0, cooling-age estimates and lower limits can
be derived from models (Bédard et al. 2020). The resulting cooling
ages range from approximately 10 Myr (CBS 311) to over 1 Gyr, but
in all cases are broadly consistent with the predicted synchronisation
timescale.
5.2.3

Differential rotation

Of course, for fully synchronised rotation the photometric signal
should exactly match the radial-velocity period (as assumed in the
analysis of J1250 by Margon et al. 2018). However, there are modest offsets between the orbital and photometric periods for much
of the sample, with the photometric period never shorter than the
radial-velocity period. To reconcile this result with fully synchronised equatorial rotation, the dC star must rotate differentially, with
starspots (or other surface-brightness inhomogeneities) at relatively
high latitudes; for example, solar differential rotation implies a
15 per cent longer period at latitudes of 20–35◦ than at the equator.
The plausibility of differential rotation is best illustrated by
SBSS 1310. As noted in Section 4.6, the photometric period of this
star shows modest but significant changes between TESS Sectors
15, 16, and 22 (5.17, 5.24, and 5.30 d, respectively, with σ = 0.01 d

uncertainties). The individual sector periodograms are presented in
Figure 6, together with the sector light-curves phase-folded to the
mean 5.26 d period. Evidently, the light-curve changes not only in
period, but also in shape and amplitude. The simplest interpretation of these characteristics is changes in the geometry of starspots
(resulting in the variable light-curve shape and amplitude) and in
their latitude, accompanied by differential rotation (resulting in the
variable period). Differential rotation also accommodates the difference between the radial-velocity and mean photometric periods
(4.4 d vs. 5.26 d), suggesting a star-spot latitude of &20◦ (assuming
solar-type differential rotation and equatorial synchronisation).
If SBSS 1310 is representative of its spectral sub-class, then
the targets appear to be differentially rotating, tidally synchronised
stars.
5.3

Source of stellar activity

There are two basic possibilities for the source of stellar activity
in dC stars, as manifested by Hα and similar emission features; an
intrinsic source via relatively rapid stellar rotation, and an extrinsic
source via irradiation.
In order to heat a low-mass star to sufficiently high local surface
temperatures that emission lines are excited, a white-dwarf companion must be close to the irradiated star and fairly luminous. Based
on a comprehensive study of stellar activity as traced by Hα emission in M dwarf companions to white dwarfs (Rebassa-Mansergas
et al. 2013), it was found that activity is nearly always intrinsic
for both partly and fully convective stars. Furthermore, while the
influence of magnetic braking is seen for partly convective stars
in wide binaries, those M dwarfs in short-period orbits resulting
from a common envelope all remain active. This fact alone argues
that irradiation is not the cause of stellar activity in low-mass stars
closely orbiting white dwarfs, and the study furthermore demonstrates that only white dwarfs with an irradiating flux that is at least
3× higher than the intrinsic M dwarf flux can result in emission
(Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013). None of the seven short-period
dC stars in this study approaches this level of irradiation; e.g. the
30 000 K white dwarf in CBS 311 is only 1.5× more luminous than
its companion, and thus falls drastically short of this criterion at the
surface of the dC star. Therefore, irradiation cannot be responsible
for the observed activity in dC stars.
The remaining possibility requires relatively rapid rotation to
generate a solar-type dynamo (Parker 1955), and an active chromosphere (Boro Saikia et al. 2018). The fact that dC stars with
emission lines are relatively rapid rotators is clearly evidenced by
X-ray detections in six out of six observed cases (Green et al. 2019),
including four of the stars analysed here. There are three potential
angular momentum sources for the rapid rotation observed in dC
stars: intrinsic spin of formation, spin-up owing to mass transfer,
and tidal synchronisation in a binary.
Three lines of evidence discount the idea that dC stars are
relatively young and hence, still rotating rapidly due to their youth.
One is their overall kinematical properties that suggest a mixture of
old disc and halo stars (Farihi et al. 2018), second is the indication
from population synthesis that metal-poor stars are more readily
polluted to C/O > 1 than solar abundance stars (de Kool & Green
1995), and third is through estimating the cooling ages of their
white-dwarf companions. The actual masses and temperatures of
dC stars are certainly not well constrained, and not established yet
at any level of confidence, but based on their positions on the HR Diagram they should be partly convective stars with parameters
comparable to late-type dwarfs, and because of inevitable magnetic

braking (Skumanich 1972; McQuillan et al. 2013), they require an
extrinsic origin to their current spins, assuming their total ages are
at least a few Gyr.
Thus, only mass transfer or tidal synchronisation remain as
possibilities for the observed, spin-induced stellar activity. And it
should be noted that both can occur, that is they are not mutually
exclusive (however, it is noteworthy that the latter can erase any
evidence of the former, e.g. in the case the dC was once spinning
faster than the orbital period). If some fraction of the emission-line
dC stars are the product of spin-up through mass transfer, and not the
result of tidal synchronisation in short-period binaries, the observed
rotation rate would be an indication of how much mass the system
has accreted. Therefore, measurements of the rotation rates in any
systems that are not short-period binaries would provide constraints
on the amount of mass, and angular momentum accreted, and thus
inform mass transfer models (Izzard et al. 2010; Matrozis et al.
2017).

5.4

Period distribution

The overall results indicate clearly that Hα emission in dC stars
is linked to short-period binarity. In fact, of the ten dC stars with
constrained orbital parameters, there are two distinct families: those
with Hα emission all have orbital periods of a few days or less,
those without detectable Hα emission have orbital periods of several
months or longer (Dearborn et al. 1986; Harris et al. 2018; Margon
et al. 2018).
The data at hand suggest that the orbital period distribution
of the dC star population may be bimodal, and thus consistent in
some key aspects with the (vastly) more commonly occurring Mtype dwarf companions to white dwarfs. In general, such bimodal
populations are consistent with the post-main sequence removal of
intermediate-period orbits, via a combination of common-envelope
evolution for shorter periods, and the reduction of gravitational
binding energy due to mass loss for longer periods. However, there
is a notable difference in the dC star binary population, and that
is the orbital periods on the order of years, which are absent in
the carbon-normal, M-dwarf companion population orbiting white
dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Nebot Gómez-Morán et al. 2011; Ashley
et al. 2019). It is tempting to speculate that the dC companion orbits

may differ from dM companion orbits owing to mass transfer, but
that is beyond the scope of the current study. Nevertheless it is
clear that the short-period dC binaries have experienced a common
envelope (Izzard et al. 2012; Ivanova et al. 2013). If the emissionline dC stars have evolved through a common-envelope phase, and
assuming their carbon enhancement is extrinsic, then this suggests
relatively stable mass transfer prior to the common envelope.

Extrinsically carbon-enhanced binaries possessing shortorbital periods are rare. Amongst the Ba, CH, and CEMP-s populations, which typically possess orbital periods of many months or
years (Lucatello et al. 2005; Jorissen et al. 2019), only two stars are
known to have orbital periods shorter than ten days. One of these
is the central binary in the Necklace nebula, with a 1.2 d orbital
period, and whose exact link to other carbon-enhanced populations remains to be determined (Miszalski et al. 2013). The other is
HE 0024-2523, a 0.9 M main-sequence star with a 3.4 d orbital period measured through radial-velocity monitoring (Lucatello et al.
2003), and a CH spectral class. Similar to the short-period binaries
found here, HE 0024-2523 is suspected of receiving mass transfer
from an evolved companion before evolving through a common envelope. However, there is no evidence of short-period photometric
variability or rotation in HE 0024-2523, despite decent quality TESS
data, and the star lacks emission lines.

The lack of short-orbital period Ba, CH, and CEMP-s stars
could be due to their earlier spectral classes and advanced evolutionary stages compared to dC stars. These other carbon-enhanced
binaries are typically FGK stars that have evolved onto the first ascent giant branch. In the case that evolved, carbon-enhanced stars
can potentially experience two common-envelope phases, this may
observationally select against short-period systems, as they may
have resulted in cataclysmic variables or a mergers. (Escorza et al.
2017). In contrast, the dC stars with short orbital periods found
to-date will remain detached for up to a Hubble time, until the lowmass dC star itself leaves the main sequence. It is almost certain that
dC stars far outnumber their evolved counterparts, and those with
short periods should prove fruitful in aiding mass transfer models
for all extrinsically carbon-enhanced systems.

CONCLUSIONS

This study analyses time-series radial-velocity and photometric data
for seven dC stars with Hα emission lines. Six of the dC stars
analysed here are found to possess orbital periods in the range 0.2–
4.4 d, along with photometric periods that are either identical (in
the case of J0901 and J1015), or within a few tens of per cent of the
orbital period. The seventh dC star, J0842, lacks significant radialvelocity variations but possesses a 0.945 d photometric period, and
if these periods are similar it would be difficult to detect through
ground-based radial-velocity measurements.
Binary light-curve simulations suggest that the origin of the
photometric variations observed in these emission-line dC stars is
consistent with rotation. None of the light-curves show any evidence
for a day- and night-side effect or tidal distortion, and while irradiation is physically plausible in two of the seven systems, it is unlikely
based on binary inclination and companion brightness estimates.
Thus, rotation is the most likely cause for the observed photometric
variations. The mostly sinusoidal behavior of the (best) observed
light curves is not necessarily expected for a random assortment of
starspot latitudes and stellar spin inclinations, but both the lightcurve data quality and the number of short-spin period dC stars are
insufficient to determine further constraints on the geometry and
number of starspots.
The expectations of magnetic braking are such that the dC
stars should be spinning an order of magnitude more slowly than
observed, and their ages are consistent with sufficient time to have
become tidally synchronised to their visible or unseen (and presumed to be) white-dwarf companions. Tidal synchronisation provides the most consistent picture for these short-period dC star
binaries, and provides the additional angular momentum needed for
spin-up, which in turn powers the emission lines through a solartype dynamo. However, mass transfer cannot be ruled out, but in
the sample studied here, mass transfer is only necessary for the extrinsic source of pollution, and not for spin-up. Lastly, at least a few
of the dC stars appear to be differentially rotating, as evidenced by
photometric periods that are similar to, but somewhat longer than
their orbital periods, as well as at least one system with changing
photometric period and variability amplitude.
This study more than doubles the number of dC stars with
constrained orbital periods, and increases those known to be in
short-period orbits from one to six. It appears the dC binary period distribution may be bimodal, with a post-common-envelope
population as studied here, and a wider population with periods
on the order of months to years. Interestingly, the other wellstudied, carbon-enhanced stellar populations lack a short-period,
post-common-envelope population, and it is likely the dC stars will
provide key insight into mass transfer models on the basis of these,
and future orbital period determinations.

Figure A1. The radial-velocity posterior PDFs for all targets analysed using the joker rejection sampler presented in order of right ascension; J0842, J0901,
J1015, CLS 29, J1250, SBSS 1310, and CBS 311. The orbital period, velocity semi-amplitude, and systemic velocities are presented along with the 16 per cent
and 84 per cent confidence limits for each target.
