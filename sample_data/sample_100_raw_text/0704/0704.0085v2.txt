Abstract
We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded
around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out
to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same
profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators
whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the
background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory
(CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the
low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is
at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell
pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave
field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using
the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

Introduction and Summary

In a previous work [1] we argued that string theory in the maximally supersymmetric
type IIB plane wave background with constant five-form Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux
(RR plane wave) [2] possesses a universality property. According to this property there
exists a universal sector of string configurations for which the classical space-time action
evaluated around the RR plane wave takes the same value as in flat space. The argument
leading to this property involved showing that the relevant light-cone world-sheet theory
[3, 4] has certain properties that are required to hold in order for the universal sector to
exist. By looking at the other examples of pp-waves where string theory has been studied
in light-cone gauge, this universality property was then generalised to all the exact string
solutions of pp-wave type, hereafter called exact pp-waves, with the same profile for the
dilaton.

2

The original motivation for this work was to study open string tachyon condensation
[5] in RR backgrounds. In fact, it was argued that the above universality property applied to the D-brane worldvolume actions has the following indication: For every D-brane
configuration extending along the light-cone directions x± in flat space there exists a corresponding D-brane configuration in each of the relevant pp-waves. Moreover for unstable
configurations the tachyon potential is universal. The aforementioned correspondence is
in the sense that the tachyon solutions representing such D-branes in the worldvolume
theory on an unstable D-brane configuration are universal. This also implies the same
D-brane descent relations of flat space [6] in case of the relevant D-branes in pp-waves.
The above argument is based on the classical theory in space-time and therefore understanding of the systematics of the string loop expansion in RR backgrounds seems
important in this case1 . Assuming this reliability, if correct, the above results are nontrivial at least for the following reasons: The universality of tachyon potential is a new
result for an RR background which does not follow from the analysis of [7]. Once we know
how to formulate open string field theory in an RR pp-wave, we have a prediction for the
tachyon potential. Moreover, the universal sector of D-branes contain non-BPS D-branes
which are difficult to study using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism [8, 9, 10, 11].
The open string boundary condition for the world-sheet fields that are space-time spinors
were found in [10] to be bi-local in flat background. This boundary condition should have
proper generalisations to other relevant pp-waves2 .
Although the arguments of [1], which was designed to relate the space-time theory
and the light-cone world-sheet theory, showed the existence of a universal sector of string
configurations, its precise description was not found. It was also not clear whether string
theory plays any special role as long as the universality is concerned. The purpose of
the present paper is to go beyond the "light-cone argument" of [1] and study the universality property further with a fully covariant treatment. The results of this paper are
summarised below:
1. We consider an arbitrary covariant field theory of tensorial fields in space-time and
define the universal sector of field configurations. We argue that the space-time
lagrangian density evaluated around a pp-wave background, even off-shell, with the
fluctuations restricted to the universal sector, is insensitive to the pp-wave nature

This question wa studied in [1] for the case of type IIB RR plane wave.

of the background metric and background fluxes.
2. Using the construction of bosonic non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT)
[12, 13] in an exact pp-wave given in terms of the relevant world-sheet conformal
field theory (CFT) we argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the
background gauge flux and the pp-wave nature of the background metric. Such
requirements can indeed be verified explicitly using the world-sheet CFT.
3. Using the equivalence between the low energy effective field theory (EFT) and CSFT
with all the higher massive modes integrated out, as formulated by Ghoshal and Sen
in [14], we describe a general method of identifying between the two sides the offshell pp-wave configurations with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of
the transverse coordinates. This method also includes an iterative procedure to
compute all the massive field configurations using their equations of motion.
Below we shall discuss these results in more detail following the same order.
A pp-wave [15, 16, 17] admits a covariantly constant null Killing vector corresponding
to translation of a particular coordinate v (or x− ). Generically an (N + 2)-dimensional
pp-wave can be obtained by attaching an N-dimensional euclidean space (called the transverse space) parameterised by xI (I = 1, 2, * * * , N) with a two-dimensional space parame-

terised by u (or x+ ) and v such that the only non-zero component of the covariant metric
tensor with a v index is ĝuv , which is constant. In Brinkmann coordinates [15] the pp-wave

nature of the metric is manifested in the fact that the components ĝuu (u, x) and ĝuI (u, x)
are generically non-zero, but independent of v as required by the null Killing symmetry.
The background can also contain null gauge fluxes and scalars, all independent of v. The
universal sector of field configurations is obtained by restricting the number of covariant v
indices with respect to the number of covariant u indices of a generic tensorial fluctuation
in a certain way and not letting the fluctuation vary along v. By considering an arbitrary
covariant field theory in space-time we argue that the effects of the background fluxes
and the metric components ĝuu and ĝuI are erased inside the universal sector so that the
effective metric becomes:
I
J
ds2ef f = 2dudv + G⊥
IJ (u, x)dx dx ,

4

(1.1)

where ĝIJ = G⊥
IJ (u, x) is the transverse space metric which is also independent of v.
This, however, is not true for the background scalar fields. Since the vacuum expectation
value of a scalar field can be thought to determine the effective couplings of a theory,
the universal sector should be sensitive to that value. This gives the complete covariant
description of universality (for tensorial fields) as observed in [1] in the context of lightcone gauge.
Given the above discussion, which directly concerns the space-time theory, we then
proceed to study its relevance to string theory from the world-sheet point of view. Our
discussion in the context of string theory will be restricted to bosonic strings which can
be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sectors of superstring theories. In
this framework we deal with the world-sheet sigma model CFT corresponding to an exact
pp-wave with dilaton independent of transverse coordinates [18, 19, 20, 21]. A natural
framework where the above discussion of universality can be related to the world-sheet
theory appears to be the closed string field theory (CSFT). Using the connection between
CFT and CSFT3 , we identify a set of operators in the CFT, called the universal sector
of operators, which correspond to the universal sector of field configurations. We then
argue that universality requires the correlation functions involving only such operators to
be insensitive to the background gauge flux and the pp-wave nature of the background
metric. More precisely, such correlation functions are expressed in terms of those in the
effective background (1.1) with both the gauge flux and dilaton switched off. We verify
these relations explicitly using the world-sheet theory.
Finally we study pp-waves with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse directions in CSFT. It was argued by Horowitz and Steif in [19] that certain more
restricted pp-waves which are solutions of the low energy effective field theory (EFT) are
also exact solutions in string theory to all orders in α′ expansion. By exploiting certain
special geometrical properties of the backgrounds it was argued that all the α′ corrections
to the EFT equations of motion drop off for these restricted pp-waves. This, however, is
not true for the generic pp-wave ansatz of our consideration as described at the beginning
of this paragraph. In this case one expects to receive corrections to all orders4 . Certainly
computing these corrections to arbitrarily high order seems impossible from the point of
view of sigma model perturbation theory. Nevertheless, an encouraging feature is that all
3

A CSFT is usually constructed with reference to a world-sheet CFT and it describes the space-time
theory expanded around the corresponding background.
4
It was argued in [20] that such corrections can give rise to new exact "stringy" solutions.

5

such corrections to the equation of motion are quadratic in fields. Since in the context of
CSFT α′ does not play the role of a small expansion parameter, one may wonder if such
corrections can be computed using this framework. This, however, requires us to find
the precise relation between EFT and CSFT. This problem was formulated by Ghoshal
and Sen in [14], which we refer the reader to for the details. The basic idea behind this
relationship is that after integrating out all the massive modes of CSFT by using their
equations of motion one arrives at an effective field theory with the same massless dynamical degrees of freedom as in EFT such that it is related to EFT through suitable field
redefinition. Although this field redefinition is quite complicated in general, once known,
it provides us with a map between the off-shell configurations of EFT and CSFT with
all the massive fields integrated out. We point out that a Horowitz-Steif type argument
implies that for a generic off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton
independent of transverse coordinates such field redefinitions simplify enormously to become at most quadratic in fields. Given this expectation we then proceed to formulate
a CSFT computation that will enable us to find this field redefinition and therefore the
off-shell map relating such pp-waves in EFT and CSFT. Moreover, it turns out that all
the aforementioned α′ corrections to the equation of motion are invariant under this field
redefinition and therefore can be directly obtained from the relevant CSFT computation.
This computation, however by itself, does not enable us to find the massive modes on
the CSFT side given the profiles of the massless modes of EFT. To this end we discuss
an iterative method of computing the massive modes of CSFT using their equations of
motion. Therefore the whole construction enables us to find the CSFT solution for any
exact pp-wave, given its form on the EFT side, or equivalently, given the world-sheet
sigma model CFT5 .
It would be interesting to perform the relevant CSFT computations to realise the
above procedure explicitly and find the desired α′ corrections to the equation of motion.
It would also be interesting to study the universality property by including the space-time
spinors. Although we do not have a formulation of string field theory in RR backgrounds
the world-sheet counterpart of universality can perhaps still be studied using a manifestly
supersymmetric formalism such as pure spinor formalism [23].

property of an arbitrary space-time theory has been given in sec.2. Its world-sheet coun5

A Universality in PP-Waves

In this section we shall elaborate on the universality property of a space-time theory and
give its precise statement. We begin by discussing the generic form of the relevant backgrounds. These are pp-waves which admit a covariantly constant null Killing symmetry.
The generic ansatz for an (N + 2)-dimensional pp-wave metric is given by [15, 16, 17],
I
J
ds2 = 2dudv + K(u, x)du2 + 2AI (u, x)dudxI + G⊥
IJ (u, x)dx dx .

(2.1)

We shall use μ = 0, 1, * * * , N + 1 for the (N + 2)-dimensional vector indices with I =

1, 2, * * * , N being the transverse space vector indices. The light-cone coordinates are u =
x+ = √12 (xN +1 + x0 ) and v = x− = √12 (xN +1 − x0 ). K(u, x), AI (u, x) and G⊥
IJ (u, x)

are certain arbitrary smooth functions. As mentioned earlier, all these functions are
 
∂
. In
independent of v as a requirement of the null Killing symmetry generated by: ∂v
μ

addition to the metric the background may contain gauge field fluxes which are null and
scalars, all independent of v. For example, if the second rank anti-symmetric tensor6 b̂μν
and the dilaton D̂ are switched on then the non-zero components are given as follows:
ĤuIJ = HIJ (u, x) = ∂I BJ (u, x) − ∂J BI (u, x) ,

D̂ = Φ(u, x) ,

(2.2)

where Ĥμνρ = ∂[μ b̂νρ] = ∂μ b̂νρ + ∂ν b̂ρμ + ∂ρ b̂μν is the gauge invariant flux. HIJ (u, x),
BI (u, x) and Φ(u, x) are certain arbitrary functions independent of v. b̂μν can therefore
be chosen to have the following non-zero components:
b̂uI = −BI (u, x) .

(2.3)

Notice that for arbitrary values of the functions appearing in eqs.(2.1) and (2.2) the
background is in general off-shell.
We shall now describe what we mean by a universal sector of field configurations with
a simple example. Let us consider a scalar field propagating in the background pp-wave
6
We shall denote the metric, the second rank anti-symmetric tensor gauge field, its three-form field
strength and the dilaton of the low energy effective field theory of string theory by ĝμν , b̂μν , Ĥμνρ and D̂
respectively.

where the transverse laplacian is ∂⊥
= ∂ I ∂I . Notice that all the terms in the lagrangian
density containing the functions K(u, x) and AI (u, x), which make the background non-

trivially different from flat space, also contain derivatives with respect to v. It is therefore
immediately clear that the configurations φ(u, x), independent of v, effectively see the
background to be flat. In other words, for all backgrounds in (2.1) with G⊥
IJ = δIJ ,
L(φ(u, x)) is same and is equal to that computed in flat background. Therefore in the
present example the universal sector of field configurations is given by the set of all φ(u, x).
Notice that by restricting field configurations to this sector we are mimicking the limit:
K → 0, AI → 0 and therefore universality holds even for off-shell backgrounds.

We shall now proceed to generalise the above discussion to any covariant space-time
field theory which includes fields of arbitrarily high integer spins and where all the spacetime fields are allowed to fluctuate. Let ψμν*** (v, u, x) be a tensor field of arbitrary rank
in a given theory. Denoting its background value for an off-shell pp-wave configuration
by Ψμν*** (u, x), we define the fluctuations χμν*** (v, u, x):
ψμν*** (v, u, x) = Ψμν*** (u, x) + χμν*** (v, u, x).

(2.6)

We shall now use notations ψ(v, u, x), Ψ(u, x) and χ(v, u, x) for the sets of all possible
fields ψμν*** (v, u, x), their pp-wave background profiles and the corresponding fluctuations
respectively. If L(ψ(v, u, x)) denotes the covariant lagrangian density for the present
theory, then the lagrangian density for fluctuations:
LΨ (χ(v, u, x)) = L(Ψ(u, x) + χ(v, u, x)) ,

(2.7)

will generically depend on the background configuration Ψ(u, x). But according to the
universality property there exists a restricted set of fluctuations χU S (u, x) independent of
8

v such that,
Any covariant lagrangian density evaluated on χU S (u, x) takes the same value
around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with the same transverse space and
(2.8)

same profiles for the background scalars.

i.e. if Ψ(u, x) and Ψ′ (u, x) are two arbitrary pp-wave backgrounds with same transverse
space metric G⊥
IJ (u, x) and background scalars, then,
′

LΨ (χU S (u, x)) = LΨ (χU S (u, x)) .

(2.9)

In particular, if Ψ corresponds to a flat transverse space with all the background scalars
set to zero (or a non-zero constant for the dilaton), then LΨ (χU S (u, x)) will take the same
value as in flat space Lf lat (χU S (u, x)).

We shall now specify what the universal sector χU S (u, x) is. First "tensorially reduce"
a generic element χμν*** (v, u, x) of the set χ(v, u, x) to the transverse space. It will be
(Mv ,Mu )
decomposed into a set of fields χIJK***
(v, u, x), where Mv and Mu are the numbers of
covariant v and u indices respectively. Then χU S (u, x) is given by the set of all possible
(Mv ,Mu )
fields χIJK***
(u, x), independent of v, such that Mu ≥ Mv .

(2.10)

Notice that the deformations of flat background that correspond to pp-wave backgrounds
(2.1, 2.2) themselves are contained in the universal sector. We prove the universality
theorem (2.8) or eq.(2.9) for the tensorial fields in appendix A.
Notice that while defining χU S in (2.10) we did not commit to any specific form of the
space-time action. This automatically raises the question whether the universal sector is
invariant under field redefinition or not. If we have two sets of space-time fields χ(v, u, x)
and χ̂(v, u, x) related by a field redefinition, then a generic element in χ̂(v, u, x) can be
written as,
χ̂μν*** (v, u, x) = fμν*** (χ(v, u, x)) ,

(2.11)

where the right hand side represents a generic field redefinition involving fields inside
χ(v, u, x) and their derivatives. The question is if we restrict the fields on the right hand
side to be inside the universal sector χU S (u, x) then whether the field on the left hand
9

side is necessarily inside χU S (u, x) or not. We have argued in appendix B that the answer
is indeed yes.
We shall end this section with some comments about the symmetries. Certainly the
isometries of the transverse space are preserved by the universal sector. But the Lorentz
transformation generated by Luv , which is not a symmetry of any of the pp-wave backgrounds, appears to be a symmetry of the universal sector (see also [1]) when the transverse space metric is independent of u. This transformation scales u and v equally in the
opposite way and therefore scales the functions K(u, x) and AI (u, x) while preserving the
pp-wave structure of the background. But since the universal sector is insensitive to such
components of the metric the transformation remains a symmetry within this sector7 . The
Lorentz transformation generated by LvI does not preserve the pp-wave structure, though
it takes the universal sector to itself. The transformation generated by LuI preserves the
pp-wave structure, but it takes the universal sector to outside.

Universality on World-Sheet

Our discussion in the previous section has been general and applicable to any covariant
field theory in space-time expanded around a pp-wave background. In this section we
shall study the universality property in the context of string theory from the world-sheet
point of view. In order to do so we shall consider exact pp-waves that are given by the
ansatz in (2.1, 2.2) with the further restriction that the transverse space is flat and the
background dilaton is independent of transverse directions:
G⊥
IJ (u, x) = δIJ ,

Φ = Φ(u) .

(3.1)

For the analysis in this section the transverse space will play the role of a spectator and
therefore any G⊥
IJ (u, x) which corresponds to an on-shell background can be incorporated.
We restrict it to flat space merely to simplify our presentation.
Since the statement in (2.8) concerns a space-time field theory, a natural framework
to study its relevance to the world-sheet theory is string field theory. Indeed a string
field theory is usually constructed for an on-shell background given by the corresponding
7

To see this more explicitly one notices that any term in the space-time lagrangian density evaluated
on the universal sector has equal number of u and v indices. This is simply because the effective metric
for such terms is ημν on the (u, v)-plane. This term therefore must be invariant under equal and opposite
scaling along u and v directions.

10

world-sheet sigma model CFT. Using this connection here we shall derive certain worldsheet properties that are required to hold in order for the universality theorem (2.8) to be
valid. In particular, we shall find that the correlation functions of a specific set of worldsheet operators should be given in terms of those in flat background with both the gauge
flux and dilaton switched off. We shall verify these results explicitly using world-sheet
techniques in appendices C and D.
We begin by considering the bosonic non-polynomial CSFT action S pp [12, 13] around
an on-shell pp-wave background (2.1, 2.2, 3.1),
S pp (χ) =

∞
1 X
1 n pp
{χ } ,
2
κ n=2 n!

(3.2)

where κ is the closed string coupling constant which is related to the constant part of the
background dilaton8 . {χn }pp is a certain sphere correlation function in CFTpp ⊕ CFTgh
which involves n string fields . Here CFTpp and CFTgh denote the matter conformal
field theory corresponding to the pp-wave background and the background independent

(b, c) ghost CFT respectively. Among the {χn }'s, {χ2 } is special in the following sense:
It is given by a particular inner product hχ, Qpp χi, as defined in [13], where Qpp is the

BRST charge corresponding to the pp-wave background. Therefore the matter part of
the relevant correlator involves the matter stress tensor (T pp(z), T̄ pp (z̄)). The matter part

of any other {χn } for n > 2 involves only the matter part of the string field. According
to (2.8) the string field theory action Spp (χU S ) evaluated at a string field configuration
χU S that is restricted to the universal sector must be same for all pp-waves with the
same dilaton profile in (3.1) (having the transverse space already been chosen to be flat)9 .
Below we shall derive the relevant sigma model correlators from this condition for the
cases of constant and non-constant dilaton separately.
8

We follow the notations of [13] except for the following few differences: (1) we use the notation χ for
the string field instead of Ψ, (2) we have absorbed a factor of κ inside the string field so that the coupling
constant appears only as a pre-factor in the action, (3) we are using an additional superscript pp or f lat
on various notations to explicitly indicate the background. We have also removed the subscript 0 from
the notation {* * *}0 in [13].
9
Notice that both the statement (2.8) and its proof in appendix A consider the space-time lagrangian
density while here, in the discussion of CSFT, we are considering the space-time action. This could make
a difference in case of the non-constant dilaton. But it will be explained in section 3.2 (see footnote 11)
that this does not happen when the background dilaton depends only on u, as we are considering here,
and therefore our analysis with the action goes through. I thank Ashoke Sen for emphasising this point.

11

3.1

Constant Dilaton

Since the dilaton is constant and is taken to be same for all the backgrounds under
consideration, the overall coupling dependent factor in eq.(3.2) is same. Therefore in
order for (2.8) to be true we must have,
{χnU S }pp = {χnU S }f lat .

(3.3)

In order to derive the relevant CFT correlators as discussed above, let us first see what
it means to have the string field restricted to the universal sector in terms of CFT. The
string field can be thought of as a first quantised state in CFTpp ⊕CFTgh satisfying certain

conditions (see [13] for the complete definition of the string field). This first quantised
state is expanded in terms of the basis in the relevant subspace of the matter-ghost Hilbert
space. Therefore every such basis state has a matter and a ghost operator associated with
it. The coefficients in this expansion turn out to play the role of the space-time fields.
Since the ghosts are background independent, the tensorial properties of these fields are
determined by the corresponding matter operators. Therefore the universal sector of field
configurations, defined in eq.(2.10), corresponds to restricting the matter operators to a
certain sub-sector which we call universal sector of matter operators10 . Below we shall
specify this sector explicitly. Satisfaction of eq.(3.3) for n > 2 will then imply that all
possible matter correlators involving operators only from the universal sector are universal
and same as that evaluated in flat background. As discussed above, for n = 2 there is an
extra source of background dependence through the stress tensor. However, we shall see
that eq.(3.3) is automatically satisfied for n = 2 once the aforementioned universality of
the relevant CFT correlators holds.
The world-sheet lagrangian density for the matter part takes the following form for
the relevant backgrounds:
 ̄ + ∂V ∂U
 ̄ + K(U, X)∂U ∂U
 ̄ + A− (U, X)∂U ∂X
 ̄ I + A+ (U, X)∂X I ∂U

(3.4)
where A±
I = AI ± BI and I = 1, 2, * * * , 24. For an exact background this is a conformal
field theory with central charge 26. The universal sector of matter operators OU S , which

independent.

We shall now show that the condition (3.6) is enough to guarantee the relation (3.3)
for n = 2. We first write,
Lpp = Lf lat + ∆Lpp ,

(3.7)

 ̄ + ∂V ∂U
 ̄ + ∂XI ∂X
 ̄ I is the lagrangian density corresponding to the
where, Lf lat ∼ ∂U ∂V
flat background. Therefore the stress tensor and the BRST charge also take the similar
structure:
T (z) = T f lat (z) + ∆T pp (z) ,

T̄ (z̄) = T̄ f lat (z̄) + ∆T̄ pp (z̄) ,

Qpp = Qf lat + ∆Qpp , (3.8)

where (T f lat (z), T̄ f lat (z̄)) and Qf lat denote the stress tensor components and the BRST
charge in the flat background. Notice that T f lat (z) and T̄ f lat (z̄) are contained in OU S .

This means hχU S , Qf lat χU S ipp is universal. Therefore in order for eq.(3.3) to be true for
n = 2 we need to have,
hχU S , ∆Qpp χU S ipp = 0 .

(3.9)

To see why this is right first notice that the only matter operators that appear in ∆Qpp
are ∆T pp (z) and ∆T̄ pp (z̄) as the BRST charge is linear in the energy-momentum tensor.
The next step is to argue that the operators ∆T pp (z) and ∆T̄ pp (z̄) are contained in OU S .

where K̃(ku , k) and ÃI (ku , k) are the Fourier transforms of K(u, x) and AI (u, x) respectively. Finally notice that any given term in these operators has no dependence on V and
at least one (first order derivative of) U. Then using the flat space result that a correlator
involving the elements of OU S is nonzero only when the total numbers of U's and V 's (we
mean derivatives of them) are same, we arrive at eq.(3.9).

3.2

Non-Constant Dilaton

The situation is more complicated when the dilaton varies in space-time. In this case
using the general argument of appendix A one has the following form of the space-time
action evaluated on the universal sector:
Vv
S (χU S ) = 2
κ
pp

Z

dud24 x e−2Φ(u) U(u, x) ,

(3.11)

where Vv is the infinite volume resulting from the integration over v. Φ(u) denotes the
background dilaton in (3.1) that appears in the world-sheet sigma model such that it does
not include any constant part. This constant part is absorbed into κ so that the effective
string coupling is: κef f (u) = κeΦ(u) . U(u, x) is the universal contribution, implying that11 ,
S f lat (χU S ) =

Vv
κ2

Z

dud24 x U(u, x) .

(3.12)

We shall now translate the requirement of universality as given by eqs.(3.11, 3.12) into
condition on the CFT correlators. This will be done by an induction method and therefore
we begin by considering an example below.
11

Referring the reader to the issue raised in footnote 9, we notice that considering the space-time action
instead of the lagrangian density could make a difference in the present case only if there were a term
in U which is a total derivative with respect to u. Such terms, however, are not allowed due to general
covariance. In fact, according to the general argument of appendix A, U(u, x) can involve only transverse
derivatives (see footnote 14). This is also responsible for the fact that in the present case U(u, x) does
not have any dependence on the background dilaton.

where it is understood that each of the momenta appearing in the argument of the factor f (p, k, k (i) ) has zero covariant v component. Notice also that the above equation is
schematic in the sense that depending on the vertex f can carry space-time indices. For
the two-point vertex considered above f is a scalar as the gravitons are contracted between each other. But there are terms where the gravitons are contracted with momenta.
In such cases f will carry the necessary indices. Since the vertex is computed from a CFT
correlator we conclude from the expression (3.20) that a generic matter correlator that
appears in the computation of S pp (χU S ) with a non-constant dilaton is given by,

where I is the inversion map: I(z) = 1/z. The correlator on the left side is computed
in CFTpp , where the background contains a non-constant dilaton Φ(u). The correlators
on the right side are computed in CFTf lat with the dilaton set to zero. Notice that the
right hand side can be computed in any other relevant background with Φ = 0 as the
computation is done in the universal sector. To check a simple consistency condition: if
the left hand side is computed in a background with constant dilaton Φ(u) = c, then
one sets Φ̃(k) = cδ(k) on the right side. The result turns out to be e−2c times the same
correlator computed with Φ(u) = 0, which is expected. Notice also that eq.(3.21) is
16

claimed only for the universal sector - generically the result will be complicated if we
sprinkle around "non-universal" operators inside the correlator. The derivation of the
result (3.21) using path integral has been presented in appendix D.
Notice that the above argument is based on the universality of U(u, x) in the sense of
eqs.(3.11, 3.12) and we have not explicitly addressed the potential background dependence
of the CSFT quadratic term through the energy-momentum tensor as we did in the case of
constant dilaton. In presence of a non-trivial dilaton Φ(u), the energy-momentum tensor
receives a correction [24] of the following form in addition to that in eq.(3.10) over its
flat-space expression:

Z

dl l2 Φ̃(l)eilU ,

(3.22)

This operator belongs to OU S and is independent of V . Therefore by the same argument
pp
as given below eq.(3.10), a matter correlator involving ∆Φ Tαβ
and an arbitrary number
of operators inside OU S is zero in flat space with constant dilaton. Then using eq.(3.21)
we conclude,
hχU S , ∆Φ Qpp χU S ipp
Φ(u) = 0 ,

(3.23)

where ∆Φ Qpp is the dilaton contribution to the BRST operator Qpp which is linear in
pp
∆Φ Tαβ
. This shows that there is no dependence of the CSFT action on the background
dilaton inside the universal sector that might be introduced through the BRST operator.

This is consistent with the fact that U(u, x) is independent of the background dilaton, as
claimed in footnote 11.

3.3

Generalisation to NSR Superstrings

The above discussion in bosonic string theory can be generalised to the common NS
sector of the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond (NSR) superstrings. Here we demonstrate this by
considering type II string theory. We have already discussed the bosonic sector of the
world-sheet theory. The fermionic sector of the world-sheet lagrangian density for an
exact NS-NS pp-wave takes the following form in conformal gauge,
f lat

+PIJ (U, X)ψ u ψ I ψ̄ u ψ̄ J + QIJK (U, X)(ψ u ψ I ψ̄ J ψ̄ K + ψ J ψ K ψ̄ u ψ̄ I ) ,

(3.26)

where CI (u, x), DIJ (u, x), EIJ (u, x), PIJ (u, x), QIJK (u, x) are certain functions constructed out of HIJ (u, x) and derivatives of K(u, x) and AI (u, x). a.h. in eqs.(3.25, 3.26)
are obtained by replacing: ψ → ψ̄, ∂ ̄ → ∂ and HIJ → −HIJ . In this case we consider the
space-time tensors coming from the NS-NS sector states. The space-time indices on these
fields come from both world-sheet bosons and fermions in the matter sector. Following
eq.(2.10) one finds that the universal sector of matter operators is given by,
OUIIS =

n

OB (MuB , MūB , MvB , Mv̄B )OF (MuF , MūF , MvF , Mv̄F )|M+ ≥ M−

o

, (3.27)

where the bosonic part OB (MuB , MūB , MvB , Mv̄B ) is given by the same operator as that
appears inside the curly bracket in eq.(3.5), the only differences being that the dimensionality of the transverse space is now 8, instead of 24 and a change in notation where
we have added a superscript B to various numbers Mu etc. appearing in eq.(3.5). The
fermionic part is given by,

The numbers M± appearing in eq.(3.27) are defined as follows:
M+ = M+B + M+F ,
M− = M−B + M−F ,

M+B = MuB + MūB ,
M−B = MvB + Mv̄B ,

M+F = MuF + MūF ,
M−F = MvF + Mv̄F ,

(3.29)

The general arguments leading to the conditions on the correlation functions in the bosonic
case, namely eq.(3.6) for constant dilaton and eq.(3.21) for non-constant background
dilaton, remain the same. Therefore the analogues of those those conditions are given
18

by the same equations, i.e. (3.6) and (3.21) with the universal sector of operators now
given as in eq.(3.27). For constant dilaton the world-sheet derivation of this condition has
been given in appendix C. For non-constant dilaton it goes through in the same way as
discussed in appendix D for the bosonic case as any non-triviality of this analysis involves
only the bosonic sector of the world-sheet theory.

PP-Waves in Closed String Field Theory

It was shown in [19] that there is a large class of pp-waves that are exact solutions in
string theory to all orders in α′ corrections. For such solutions HIJ in eq.(2.2) and
FIJ (u, x) = ∂I AJ (u, x) − ∂J AI (u, x) ,

(4.1)

are taken to be functions of only u and therefore are more restricted than what we have
considered in (2.1, 2.2, 3.1). With this restricted ansatz all the α′ corrections to the low
energy effective field theory (EFT) equations of motion are zero. As we shall briefly review
below, this is not true for our more general ansatz. In fact, in our case such unknown
corrections are, in principle, non-zero at arbitrary higher orders.
In this section we shall discuss a general method of identifying an off-shell pp-wave
background of EFT in CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out by their equations
of motion. The off-shell ansatz that we consider is given on the EFT side by eqs.(2.1),
(2.2) and (3.1). In general such an exact identification (certainly up to field redefinition)
of off-shell field configurations is difficult to do in practice. This is because the field redefinition between EFT and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is in general
complicated. We shall argue that for the off-shell pp-wave ansatz that we are considering
here this field redefinition is at most quadratic in fields and therefore can be found with
limited computations. In this work we shall not perform any explicit CSFT computation,
rather we shall formulate the problem in principle and indicate how the explicit construction can be done by computing a set of cubic terms in the action (3.2). Our analysis
will indicate that all the α′ corrections to the equations of motion discussed above, which
will be shown to be invariant under the relevant field redefinition, can be computed using
CSFT. We shall also outline an iterative method of computing the massive modes using
the CSFT equations of motion in terms of the functions K(u, x), AI (u, x), BI (u, x) and
Φ(u) characterising the background on the EFT side. Whenever these functions correspond to an exact CFT on the world-sheet our iterative procedure gives the corresponding
19

CSFT solution. For definiteness we shall consider the non-polynomial bosonic CSFT action (3.2) constructed around the flat space. But it should be possible to generalise the
basic method to incorporate the common NS sectors of superstrings.
Since we shall not perform any explicit CSFT computation, our construction, as indicated above, will be based on the expectation that EFT and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out are physically equivalent. The connection between these two theories is as follows: Integrating out all the massive fields in CSFT by satisfying their
equations of motion one arrives at an effective field theory involving the same massless
field content as in EFT. There could be certain additional unphysical fields which can be
eliminated away algebraically. The dynamical fields of the two theories and their off-shell
gauge transformations should be related by suitable field redefinitions. Once this field
redefinition is completely known any off-shell field configuration in one of the two theories
can be identified in the other. This field redefinition was found at the linearised level in
[14], which we refer the reader to for the detailed formulation of the above connection.
Below we first briefly review the off-shell pp-wave ansatz and the relevant equations of
motion on the EFT side and then discuss our construction in CSFT in section 4.2.

4.1

Effective Field Theory

The field content of the EFT includes the metric ĝμν = ημν + ĥμν , the dilaton D̂ and
the second rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field b̂μν whose three-form field strength is
Ĥμνρ = ∂[μ b̂νρ] . The action is given by,



(4.2)

where the proportionality constant in the action is left arbitrary as a freedom of adding a
constant piece to D̂. The action receives corrections at arbitrary higher order in α′ . The
non-zero components of the off-shell background that we are interested in are given by,
ĥuu = K(u, x) ,

ĥuI = AI (u, x) ,

b̂uI = −BI (u, x) ,

D̂ = Φ(u) .

(4.3)

The theory possesses gauge symmetries under general coordinate transformations and
anti-symmetric tensor gauge transformations. The off-shell ansatz in (4.3) is not gauge
invariant and therefore has been written by fixing some of the gauge symmetries. Some
20

amount of residual gauge symmetry is still present which preserve the above ansatz. This
has been discussed in appendix E.
All the α′ corrections in (4.2) are not identically zero for the generic ansatz (4.3). The
equations of motion reduce to the following form:
1

generically receives α′ corrections to all orders. All such corrections, collectively given by

√
√
the term C2
α′ ∂⊥ F, α′ ∂⊥ H , are quadratic in FIJ and/or HIJ , but contain arbitrary
higher powers of transverse derivatives [20, 17]. In a special case where both FIJ and HIJ
are independent of the transverse coordinates [19]:
FIJ = FIJ (u) ,

HIJ = HIJ (u) ,

(4.5)

all such corrections drop off. Notice that the last equation in (4.4) is invariant under
adding a purely u dependent function to K(u, x): K(u, x) → K(u, x) + f (u). The fact

that the equations (4.4) are at most quadratic in fields will be crucial in our following
discussion on CSFT.

4.2

Closed String Field Theory

As mentioned earlier, here we shall formulate the problem of identifying the off-shell ppwave configuration (4.3) in CSFT. We denote the set of dynamical fields of CSFT by χ =
{gμν = ημν + hμν , bμν , D, χmassive }, where χmassive is the set of (infinite number of) massive
fields. After integrating out the full set χmassive one arrives at a low energy effective field
theory containing only gμν , bμν , D and certain additional non-dynamical fields that can
be eliminated away algebraically. See [14] for the details of the procedure. The field
redefinition that relates these dynamical fields and that of EFT takes the following form:
h
hμν (v, u, x) = ĥμν (v, u, x) + fμν
(ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂) ,
b
bμν (v, u, x) = b̂μν (v, u, x) + fμν
(ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂) ,
D
∂μ D(v, u, x) = ∂μ D̂(v, u, x) + fμ (ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂) ,

21

(4.6)

where in the last equation derivative of the dilaton has been considered in order to make
the equation insensitive to a constant shift which was also left unfixed while writing
down the EFT action in (4.2). It was shown in [14] that at the linearised level the
field redefinition takes the form of the above equations with all the f -fields set to zero.
Therefore all such fields are necessarily at higher orders in the hatted fields. Notice that
we have also used the well-known fact that the dilaton always appears with derivatives in
these fields. We have argued in appendix E that for a generic off-shell pp-wave background
h
(4.3) the only non-vanishing f function is the component fuu
(ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , D̂) which takes the
following form:
h
fuu
(ĥuu = K, ĥuI = AI , b̂uI = −BI , ∂u D̂ = ∂u Φ) = K2 (AI , BI , ∂u Φ) ,

(4.7)

where K2 (AI , BI , ∂u Φ) is an undetermined scalar on the transverse space which is second
order in the fields AI , BI and Φ but may contain transverse derivatives of arbitrarily high
order. Notice that such transverse derivatives can not act on Φ. Therefore, by the similar
argument as in appendix E, the dilaton dependence is restricted only to the following
type of additive terms: ∂u Φ∂u Φ, ∂u Φ∂ I AI and ∂u Φ∂ I BI , where arbitrarily high powers of
transverse laplacian are allowed to act on ∂ I AI and/or ∂ I BI . This implies,
huu = K + K2 ,

huI = AI ,

buI = −BI ,

D=Φ,

(4.8)

where the dilaton is identified up to an additive constant. Given these equations we shall
now onwards work with the variables huu , AI , BI and Φ on the CSFT side. One would
therefore expect the CSFT equations of motion to include the first two equations in (4.4)
in the same form and the last equation in the following form:
E1 (huu , AI , ∂u Φ) + E2 (AI , BI , ∂u Φ) = 0 ,

and the linear part in (4.9) should therefore be obtained from the first term in eq.(4.11).

Indeed these parts can be shown to be obtained from the massless quadratic part of the
action (3.2) which was computed in [14]. In particular, E1 (huu , AI , ∂u Φ) in eq.(4.9) is
contributed by the following term (computed in [14]), in the quadratic lagrangian density

where in the second step we have restricted the fields inside square brackets according to
our ansatz in (4.3). Notice that the term computed is outside the universal sector as it
contains the component hvv . Generically, a higher rank equation of motion,
E∗ (universal sector) = 0 ,

(where the subscript ∗ indicates that the expression has covariant tensor indices) for the

fields inside universal sector can not carry covariant v indices. If ∗ includes covariant u

indices then there exists a non-universal field varying which the equation of motion (4.14)
is supposed to be obtained. Therefore to get such an equation of motion one needs to
compute all the terms in the action that are linear in the relevant non-universal field13 .
In the context of (4.13) the relevant non-universal field is hvv and therefore to get the full
form of the relevant equation of motion one needs to compute all the terms in the action
(3.2) (for flat background) that are linear in hvv . Fortunately, from (4.9, 4.10) it is clear
that such terms must be at most cubic in order. Since the quadratic terms have already
been computed in [14], to complete the task one needs to compute only the cubic terms
in the lagrangian density which should be given by (up to a constant pre-factor):
hvv (u, x)E2 (AI (u, x), BI (u, x), ∂u Φ(u)) .

(4.15)

From this computation one should be able to obtain all the α′ corrections to the EFT
√
√
equation of motion given by C2 ( α′ ∂⊥ F, α′ ∂⊥ H). Also notice that the presence of an
additive term ∂u Φ∂u Φ in K2 (AI , BI , ∂u Φ) can not be concluded from this computation.
Since it is a purely u dependent term, the equation of motion is insensitive to adding such
a term as explained below eq.(4.5). With this we conclude our discussion of formulating
the problem of identifying the off-shell massless pp-wave configurations of EFT in CSFT.
We shall now discuss how to compute the massive fields in CSFT once the massless
components are given in terms of the functions K(u, x), AI (u, x), BI (u, x) and Φ(u)
following eqs.(4.8). From the above discussion we have concluded:
|χN imassless = 0 ,
13

∀N >2,

(4.16)

This, however, is not true if the expression on the left hand side of (4.14) is a scalar. In fact, for
any scalar field solution T (x) that depends entirely on the transverse directions, the relevant equation
of motion can be obtained without computing any non-universal term in the action. This is why such
solutions are universal. In the context of the worldvolume theory on an unstable D-brane configuration in
a pp-wave background with constant dilaton this argument was applied in [1] to certain tachyon solutions
representing lower dimensional D-branes. Gravity solutions, on the other hand, are not generically
universal because of the requirement of computing non-universal terms in the action. Pp-waves themselves
are examples of this. Although these solutions belong to the universal sector, the solutions themselves
are not generically universal. Universality of a given pp-wave solution P implies that it can be realised
as a solution in all the pp-wave backgrounds in a given universality class (a universality class is the
set of all pp-waves for which the universality theorem (2.8) holds and therefore can be characterised by
the transverse space and the profiles for the background scalars). This in turn implies that P can be
superposed with any solution representing a pp-wave belonging to this universality class. This is not true
in general as the last equation in (4.4) is not linear. Whenever the quadratic piece drops off for a given
pp-wave, the solution is universal and can be superposed with any other pp-wave solution. Nevertheless
it is generically true that given two arbitrary pp-waves, a third one can always be found. But the sum
rule is not simple superposition, rather more complicated when the quadratic terms are non-zero.

where |χN imassless denotes the massless component of |χN i. For reasons to be clarified

shortly, let us denote the massless component in (4.12) by |χ(1) i. Then notice that the
massive part of |χ2(1) i can still be non-zero. This switches on higher massive modes through
the equation of motion (4.11). Therefore the coefficients of all such higher massive states
in |χi must be higher order in the functions appearing in eqs.(4.8). To compute such
coefficients we first expand it according to the degree of order at which those functions
appear,
|χi =

where |χ(n) i is the component of the string field whose expansion involves coefficients that
are only n-th order in these functions. For example, |χ(1) i = |χimassless in eq.(4.12) is
linear. Subtracting the string field equation in (4.17) from (4.11) we get,

where the summations in the parenthesis in the second line are constrained. The constraint

eq.(4.20) to compute |∆(2) i which can, in turn, be used in eq.(4.22) to compute |χ(2) i.
The standard way is to fix a gauge for the massive fields so that Q can be inverted to
solve eq.(4.22). Once |χ(2) i is known it can be used along with |χ(1) i in eq.(4.23) to solve
|χ(3) i. In order to establish that this iterative method continues to hold one needs to show

that to find the solution at the N-th order, namely |χ(N ) i using eq.(4.24) the knowledge
for |χ(N +1) i is not required. This can be easily verified by investigating eq.(4.24). For

Notice that this iterative method is different from a small parameter expansion. In the
latter case at every stage of the iteration an equation is solved approximately by neglecting
terms of higher order. In our method an equation at a given stage of the iteration is solved
exactly.

A Proof of Universality

Here we shall explain our argument for why the universality theorem in (2.8) holds in the
pp-wave backgrounds as described in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2). In this argument we shall be
concerned only with the tensor fields in space-time for which the universal sector is given
in eq.(2.10). In order to proceed with the argument we shall first demonstrate this with a
particular form of the space-time action, namely the low energy effective field theory action
for massless fields in bosonic string theory which has all the essential features relevant to
our discussion. Later we shall generalise the argument to an arbitrary covariant action.
Therefore we start with the action in (4.2) for the metric, the second rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field and dilaton. We first expand the fields around the background (2.1, 2.2),
ĝμν = Gμν + ĥμν ,

b̂μν = Bμν + êμν ,

D̂ = Φ + φ̂ ,

(A.1)

where Gμν , Bμν and Φ are the background fields in eqs.(2.1), (2.3) and (2.2) respectively.
Therefore Ψ(u, x) and χ(v, u, x), as defined below eq.(2.6), are the sets of these background
fields and the hatted fields that appear as fluctuations in the above equations in the present
context. The universal sector defined in eq.(2.10) is therefore given by,
χU S (u, x) =

(

ĥuu (u, x) , ĥuv (u, x) , ĥuI (u, x) , ĥIJ (u, x) ,
êuv (u, x) , êuI (u, x) , êIJ (u, x) , φ(u, x)

)

.

(A.2)

The lagrangian density in (4.2), once computed by restricting the fluctuations to the
universal sector, takes the following form:
L = e−Φ(u,x) U(u, x) ,
where U(u, x) is a sum of terms of the following generic form:
U(u, x) →

q

−G(u, x) Gμ1 ν1 Gμ2 ν2 * * * Gμn νn [* * *]μ1 ν1 μ2 ν2 ***μn νn ,
27

(A.3)

=

q

G⊥ (u, x) Gμ1 ν1 Gμ2 ν2 * * * Gμn νn [* * *]μ1 ν1 μ2 ν2 ***μn νn ,

(A.4)

where G(u, x) = det Gμν and G⊥ (u, x) = det G⊥
IJ . In general the quantity inside the
square bracket contains the following three types of objects:
1. derivatives - some of which may act on the background inverse metric pre-factors,
2. background fields in (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) and
3. fluctuations in (A.2).
To establish (2.8) or eq.(2.9) we shall now argue that U(u, x) is universal among all the

pp-wave backgrounds with the same transverse space metric G⊥
IJ (u, x) and background
dilaton Φ(u, x). It is clear from equations (A.4) that this will be true if the following
quantity is universal,
U(u, x) = Gμ1 ν1 Gμ2 ν2 * * * Gμn νn [* * *]μ1 ν1 μ2 ν2 ***μn νn .

(A.5)

In order to establish universality of U(u, x) we first tensorially reduce [* * *]μν*** to the
transverse space to get a set of tensors in the transverse space,
n

v ,Mu
[* * *]μν*** → [* * *]M
IJK***

o

,

(A.6)

where Mv and Mu are the number of covariant v and u indices in [* * *]μν*** respectively.

v ,Mu
Since none of the fields appearing in the expression of [* * *]M
IJK*** depends on v, all the Mv
number of v indices are coming purely from fields and not from derivatives. Moreover since

all the fields (both the backgrounds and fluctuations) are in the universal sector (2.10)
v ,Mu
we must have: Mu ≥ Mv on the right hand side of (A.6). But [* * *]M
IJK*** with Mu > Mv
can not appear in U(u, x) in eq.(A.5) simply because the only non-zero components of
the background inverse metric are:
Gμν → Guv , Gvv , GvI , G⊥IJ .

(A.7)

Mv = Mu ,

(A.8)

Therefore we must have:

in all terms on the right hand side of eq.(A.5). This is precisely the kind of contraction
that erases the pp-wave structure of the metric background so that effectively it becomes,
f
μ
ν
⊥
I
J
Gef
μν dx dx = 2dudv + GIJ (u, x)dx dx ,

28

(A.9)

which is simply the flat Minkowski space when G⊥
IJ (u, x) = δIJ .
The above argument shows that the functions K(u, x) and AI (u, x) in the background
metric (2.1) do not appear in U(u, x). We shall now show that the functions BI (u, x) in
the background flux (2.2) also do not appear in U(u, x). In order to do so we first notice
that the facts that [* * *]μν*** does not contain any derivative with respect to v, contains

fields only in the universal sector together with eq.(A.8) imply that every individual field
appearing in [* * *]μν*** contains equal number of covariant u and v indices. For any gauge

invariant background flux which is null, such as the one in (2.2), such components are
zero. Therefore the functions BI (u, x) do not appear in U(u, x).
Notice that the transverse derivatives14 of the background dilaton Φ(u, x) do appear
in [* * *]μν*** . Because of this and the exponential pre-factor in eq.(A.3) we need to have

the same dilaton profile for all those pp-wave backgrounds for which the universality of
the space-time action is supposed to hold.
We can now generalise the above argument to incorporate an arbitrary covariant action
in space-time. In this case any generic term in the lagrangian density, once computed on
the universal sector after expanding around a generic pp-wave background, will take the
following form:
Larbit → V ({Φ(u, x)}) U(u, x) ,

(A.10)

where {Φ(u, x)} is the set of all the scalar fields in the theory at their background values
and V ({φ}) is a multi-scalar potential depending on the term chosen and the theory.
U(u, x) takes the same form as in eq.(A.4) except that now it contains tensor fields with
arbitrarily high spins, which doe not have any effect on our argument above. Therefore
the conclusion will be that the above term is computed to be same in all the backgrounds
with the same transverse space and the same profiles {Φ(u, x)} for the background scalars.
This establishes the universality theorem in (2.8) for the tensor fields.
14

Equation (A.8) and the restriction of field configurations to the universal sector imply that all the
Mu number of covariant u indices are also purely field indices so that all the derivatives that appear in
U (u, x) are along the transverse directions.

29

B

Closure of Universal Sector under Field Redefinition

Here we shall argue that an arbitrary field redefinition takes the universal sector to itself.
Referring the reader to the discussion around eq.(2.11) we would, therefore, like to show
that,
χ̂μν*** (u, x) ≡ fμν*** (χU S (u, x)) ∈ χU S (u, x) ,

(B.1)

where χU S (u, x) is defined in (2.10). After tensorially reducing to the transverse space a
generic term in fμν*** (χU S (u, x)) takes the following form:
(N ,N ;Mu ,Mv )

u
v
fμν*** (χU S (u, x)) → fIJK***

(u, x) ,

(B.2)

where Nu (Nv ) is the number of covariant u (v) indices that are free while Mu (Mv ) is the
same that are contracted. Notice that all the (Nv + Mv ) number of covariant v indices,
irrespective of whether they are contracted or not, should be purely field indices. Since
all the fields that appear are in the universal sector, the total number of u indices coming
from such fields and possibly additional derivatives must satisfy,
Nu + Mu ≥ Nv + Mv .

(B.3)

On the other hand the total number of contracted covariant u and v indices, namely
(Mu + Mv ), should be same as the total number of contravariant u and v indices coming
from the factors of the background inverse-metric. Since the only non-zero components
of background inverse-metric are as given in (A.7) we must have,
Mv ≥ Mu .

(B.4)

Nu ≥ Nv ,

(B.5)

Equations (B.3) and (B.4) imply,

which in tern implies (B.1).

C

Correlators in Constant Dilaton

Here we shall argue that the matter correlation functions involving only the operators defined in eq.(3.5) are universal in all the exact pp-wave backgrounds with constant dilaton.
30

In particular, we shall show that eq.(3.6) is correct. The correlator on the left hand side
of eq.(3.6) can be obtained from a correlator of the following form:
h

such that Mu + Mū ≥ Mv + Mv̄ ,

eipk U (wk , w̄k )Ô(X)ipp ,
(C.1)

where Ô(X) is an arbitrary operator in the flat transverse part of the CFT. Below we
shall argue that the correlator in (C.1) is computed to be same as in flat background. In
order to do so we first separate the world-sheet lagrangian density in (3.4) into Lf lat and
∆Lpp as indicated in eq.(3.7). Then we treat Lf lat exactly and ∆Lpp as interaction. This
gives the following relation between the correlators in pp-wave and flat background:
h* * *ipp = h* * *if lat + h* * *ifc lat ,

(C.2)

where the second term on the right hand side is a correction term given by,
h* * *ifc lat =

(C.3)

∆S pp [U, X] being the part of the world-sheet action in pp-wave corresponding to the
lagrangian density ∆Lpp in eq.(3.7). This contains integrated operators involving K(U, X)
f lat
and A±
we Fourier expand such functions and finally
I (U, X). In order to compute h* * *ic
compute the correlators on the right hand side of (C.3) in flat background. For example,

the first term of the infinite expansion is proportional to,

(C.4)

±
~
where K̃(ku , ~k) and Ã±
I (ku , k) are the Fourier transforms of K(U, X) and AI (U, X) respectively. Since all the correlators are computed in flat background an U can only be
contracted with a V . The fact that none of the operators in (C.1) and in ∆S pp [U, X]

involve momenta along V implies, in turn, that all the U-derivatives15 have to be contracted with V -derivatives in order to produce a non-zero result. Since the total number
of U-derivatives appearing in (C.1) is always greater than or equal to that of V -derivatives
15

By U (V )-derivative we mean an operator of the form ∂ m U (z) (∂ m V (z)) or ∂ ̄m U (z̄) (∂ ̄m V (z̄)).

31

and the higher N-rems in (C.3) introduce increasing number of U-derivatives and no V derivatives, all the correction terms given in (C.3) are zero for the correlators in (C.1).
Therefore such correlators are computed to be same as in flat background. An equivalent
path integral argument, which is more cumbersome, can also be constructed leading to
the same conclusion. This establishes eq.(3.6).
We shall now generalise the above argument for the NS-NS sector of type II superstrings as considered in section 3.3. In particular, we shall argue that the same condition
as in eq.(3.6) holds for the operators given in eq.(3.27). In this case the relevant correlators
can be obtained from a correlator of the following form:
B

B

F

F

h[DU]M+ [DV ]M− [Dψ u ]M+ [Dψ v ]M− ÔB (X)ÔF (ψ⊥ , ψ̄⊥ )
such that M+B + M+F ≥ M−B + M−F ,

Y
k

eipk U ipp ,
(C.5)

B

where we use schematic notations: [DU]M+ represents a product of M+B number of opF
erators of the form ∂ n U(z) or ∂ ̄m U(w̄), [Dψ u ]M+ represents a product of M+F number of
F
B
operators of the form ∂ n ψ u (z) or ∂ ̄m ψ̄ u (w̄) and similarly for [DV ]M− and [Dψ v ]M− respectively. ÔF (ψ⊥ , ψ̄⊥ ) is a fermionic analogue of ÔF (X) appearing in eq.(C.1), namely
an arbitrary operator constructed out of the transverse ψ I and ψ̄ I . Just like in (C.1), all
the operators in (C.5) are understood to be inserted at different points on the complex

plane. In order to see why the correlator in C.5 should be same as that computed in
flat background when the condition on the numbers M±B and M±F , as shown in eq.(C.5),
is satisfied, we first notice that the interaction terms in the world-sheet lagrangian density now includes the fermionic sector given in eq.(3.26) in addition to the bosonic one
in eq.(3.7). The features of the fermionic interaction terms in (3.26) that are relevant
to our argument are as follows: (1) ψ v and ψ̄ v do not appear, (2) all the terms except
 ̄ I ψ J and its counterpart in a.h. involve ψ u and/or ψ̄ u and (3) all the bosonic
DIJ (U, X)∂Uψ
operators that appear in (3.26) are from the universal sector. Since we treat the flat part
in (3.25) exactly, a ψ v (ψ̄ v ) appearing in the correlator (C.5) can only be contracted with
a ψ u (ψ̄ u ) either appearing in (C.5) as an external operator or coming from the interaction terms in (3.26). Therefore when M+F = M−F , none of the fermionic interaction terms
 ̄ I ψ J and its counterpart in
contribute with the possible exceptions being DIJ (U, X)∂Uψ
a.h.. But even these terms do not contribute as can be argued in the following way: the
bosonic sector in (C.5) satisfies the condition M+B ≥ M−B . Therefore whenever a term like
 ̄ I ψ J appears in the correlation function it always increases the number of
DIJ (U, X)∂Uψ
32

U-derivatives than that of V -derivatives. The result is zero due to the fact that in flat
space this numbers should match in order to get a non-zero result.
Let us now discuss the cases when M+F 6= M−F . We begin with M+F > M−F . In this case
the result is zero, matching with the flat space result, simply because there are not enough
number of ψ v (ψ̄ v ) operators to contract with all the ψ u (ψ̄ u ) operators. When M+F < M−F

the fermionic interaction terms could become important as the extra number of ψ v (ψ u )
operators can now be contracted with these terms. But since in this case we must have

M+B > M−B , and all the bosonic operators in the fermionic interaction terms are in the
universal sector, the result is zero, again matching with the flat space result, as there
are not enough number of V -derivatives to contract all the existing U-derivatives. This
establishes that the correlators in (C.5) are same as that evaluated in flat background.

D

Correlators in Non-Constant Dilaton

The analysis in the previous section does not go through when the CFT background
contains non-constant dilaton as in this case one needs to be more careful about how
to treat the Fradkin-Tseytlin term [25] that couples the dilaton through the world-sheet
curvature. In this appendix we shall discuss this issue and establish eq.(3.21). We start
with the pre-gauge-fixed path integral,

where S pp corresponds to the lagrangian density in (3.4). Once the condition of Weyl

of any correlation function. However the effect of the Fradkin-Tseytlin term16 ,

should be independent of this choice. Here our goal is to study the effect of this term

wave background with nontrivial dilaton Φ(u). Below we first recall what happens for the
constant dilaton and then we generalise the method to incorporate non-constant dilaton
profile of our interest.
As it is well known, for constant dilaton: Φ = c, (D.5) can be computed explicitly by
choosing a particular coordinate system on the sphere. For example:

out-state at τ → ∞. These coordinate systems correspond to choosing:

(D.8)

where C∞ is a circle around the point w = 0. This gives: SF T = −2c, which is the correct

result. As expected, the result does not depend on the choice of ρ. This can be checked
in the following way: First add a variation δρ(z, z̄) on the right hand side of eq.(D.7).
Finiteness of the metric at z → ∞ requires,
lim δρ → constant .

z→∞

In the second line of (D.5) we have moved to the complex coordinate system: z = eτ +iσ .

(D.9)

Therefore it does not contribute to the residue in eq.(D.8) leaving the result unchanged.
Let us now consider the case of non-constant dilaton Φ(u) in an exact pp-wave background. In this case partially integrating the right hand side of (D.5) and Fourier transforming Φ(U) to Φ̃(k) one can write:

To compute this we first notice that S(3)
involves a line integral along ∂R, which is a
collection of circles Ci 's around the insertions included in * * * which are at finite values of

(z, z̄) and a circle C∞ around the point z = ∞ (w = 0) which can also support an insertion
from * * *. Since eikU can not be contracted with any operators in * * *, contributions will
come only from C∞ . It is then straightforward to establish the result (3.21) by evaluating
the necessary residues.
The fact that the final result does not depend on the choice of ρ follows from the same

reasoning as in the case of constant dilaton. This, however, is not as straightforward as
presented here in case of a correlation functions with non-universal operators. In that

case the contributions from S(1)

get spoiled in presence of the interactions given by ∆Lpp in eq.(3.7). From the structure
FT
of the world-sheet operator appearing in the first term in S(2)
we infer that it contributes
to the uu component of the metric beta function. In fact it corresponds to the ∂u2 Φ term
in the equation of motion in (4.4). In the above analysis we have considered the Weyl
dependence of only S F T and therefore this is the only contribution expected. Considering
the complete Weyl dependence one expects this contribution to go away due to the spaceFT
time equation of motion. S(1)
, on the other hand, receives contributions only from the
boundaries of the punctured sphere. Such effects need to be handled with more care
in a generic situation by considering the complete Weyl dependence including that of
the insertions at the punctures. However, such issues can be neglected for correlation
functions involving only the universal sector operators.

Field Redefinition and Gauge Transformation

Here we shall first find the higher order terms in the field redefinition (4.6) given by the secb
h
(ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂) and fμD (ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂)
ond rank tensor and vector fields: fμν
(ĥρσ , b̂ρσ , ∂ρ D̂), fμν
when the off-shell field configurations are restricted to the pp-wave ansatz in eq.(4.3). In
particular, by using arguments similar to that in [19] we shall show that the only non-zero

component is as given in eq.(4.7). Later we shall also discuss the gauge symmetries of
36

EFT and CSFT and how they are related to this field redefinition.
In order to find the f -fields appearing in eqs.(4.6) we first notice that all such fields
should necessarily be expressible in terms of the non-zero components in the background
pp-wave ansatz in (4.3), Christoffel connection and derivatives. The only non-zero components of the Christoffel connection are [17],
Γ̂μνρ → Γ̂vuu ,

Γ̂vuI ,

Γ̂vIJ ,

Γ̂Iuu ,

Γ̂IuJ .

(E.1)

It turns out that a covariant u index can not be contracted [19]. This is because the
background inverse metric (A.7) allows contraction only with a covariant v index and a
non-zero field with a covariant v index can not be constructed in this case. It is also not
possible to construct a field without a covariant u index. Because of this and the fact that
all the f -fields are necessarily higher order in the functions appearing in (4.3) we conclude
that any non-zero f -field (1) should have at least one covariant u index, (2) should have no
covariant v index, (3) can not have a non-zero covariant u index if it is a vector. Therefore
h
h
b
h
the only nonzero f -fields are: fuu
, fuI
and fuI
. Let us first consider fuu
. Because of the
same reasons mentioned above it must be quadratic in fields. Any higher order term

necessarily has more than two covariant u indices. Therefore the allowed expression for
h
fuu
is precisely given by K2 (AI , BI , delu Φ) as described below eq.(4.7). Using similar
h
b
reasoning one can argue that fuI
and fuI
can at most be linear in fields and therefore
must be zero.
We shall now discuss the gauge symmetries of the EFT and CSFT. Although the gauge
transformations are understood on the EFT side, they are not fully known on the CSFT
side. After integrating out all the massive modes the CSFT gauge transformations for the
massless fields take complicated form in general. But in our case, since we know the form
of the complete field redefinition, we shall find the relevant CSFT gauge transformations
fully. Once the expression for K2 (AI , BI , ∂u Φ) is computed through the CSFT computation as indicated in sec. 4.2, such gauge transformations will be completely known and it
should be possible to verify them explicitly in CSFT.

We begin by discussing the gauge symmetries on the EFT side. This theory possesses
gauge invariance under the anti-symmetric tensor gauge transformation (TGT) and general coordinate transformation (GCT). The infinitesimal form of TGT, parameterised by
ζ̂μ (u, v, x), is given by,
δζ̂ b̂μν = ∂μ ζ̂ν − ∂ν ζ̂μ ,

δζ̂ ĝμν = 0 ,
37

δζ̂ D̂ = 0 .

(E.2)

Since the only non-zero gauge invariant background flux components are ĤuIJ = ĤIJ (u, x)
(see eqs.(2.2)), the components b̂uv , b̂vI and b̂IJ should at most be pure gauge with the only
remaining non-trivial components being b̂uI (u, x). The pure gauge components are set to
zero by using the gauge freedom corresponding to the components ζ̂v and ζ̂I . Therefore
the non-trivial component of the residual gauge transformation, parameterised by: ζ̂μres =
(ζ̂u (u, x), ζ̂v = 0, ζ̂I = 0), is given by:
δζ̂res b̂Iu = ∂I ζ̂u .

(E.3)

The infinitesimal form of GCT, parameterised by ξˆμ (u, v, x), is given by,
δξ̂ ĝμν = ∂μ ξˆν + ∂ν ξˆμ − 2Γ̂ρμν ξˆρ ,
δξ̂ b̂μν = ∂μ ξˆρ b̂ρν + ∂ν ξˆρ b̂μρ + ξˆρ ∂ρ b̂μν ,
δ D̂ = ξˆρ ∂ρ D̂ ,

(E.4)

ξ̂

A part of this gauge invariance is broken by the ansatz in (4.3). The non-trivial components of the residual transformations are parameterised by: ξˆμres = (ξˆu (u, x), ξ̂v = 0, ξ̂I (u))
and can be shown to take the following form:
δξ̂res ĥuu = 2∂u ξˆu + (∂ I K − 2∂u AI )ξˆI ,
δ res ĥuI = ∂I ξˆu + ∂u ξˆI − F J ξˆJ ,
ξ̂

(E.5)

The residual gauge transformations in (E.3, E.5) should leave the equations of motion
(4.4) invariant. It is straightforward to see this for (E.3). The transformation in (E.5)
implies,

δξ̂res (∂⊥

K − 2∂ I ∂u AI )ξˆK ,
δξ̂res FIJ = ∂ K FIJ ξˆK , δξ̂res HIJ = ∂ K HIJ ξˆK ,

(E.6)

Using these transformations one can show that, as expected, the variation of the equations
of motion in (4.4) is zero. It is straightforward to see this for the first two equations. The
variation of the left hand side of the last equation in (4.4) gives,

By the same equation of motion, the expression inside the square bracket is dependent
only on u and therefore the result is zero.
38

The residual gauge invariance in (E.3, E.5) and the field redefinition (4.6, 4.7) determine the form of the gauge transformations on the CSFT side. We shall now discuss
this systematically and finally come up with certain results that need to be verified with
explicit CSFT computations, which we leave for future work. The infinitesimal gauge
transformation of the full CSFT is given by:
δ|χi = Q|Λi +

|χN −2 Λi ,
N =3 (N − 2)!

(E.8)

where |Λi is the ghost number one infinitesimal gauge transformation parameter and we
have absorbed a factor of κ in it with respect to [13]. The above equation encodes the
gauge transformation of all the higher massive fields. We are, however, interested in the
transformations of the dynamical massless components only once all the massive ones
have been integrate out by using their equations of motion. Generically this procedure
leads to a complicated form of the gauge transformation for the massless fields on the
CSFT side. It was shown in [14] that taking,

and interpreting ζ̃ and ξ ̃ to be the Fourier transforms of ζ̂ and ξˆ respectively the gauge
transformation in (E.8) reproduces the gauge transformations in (E.2, E.4) at the linearised level. It means that, as expected, the complications come from the higher order
terms in (E.8). Therefore the general form of the relevant gauge transformations can be
written as:
δζ bμν = ∂μ ζν − ∂ν ζμ + ∆(b)
μν ,
δξ bμν = Θ(b)
μν ,

(g)
δζ gμν = ∆μν
,

δζ D = ∆(D) ,

(g)
δξ gμν = ∂μ ξν + ∂ν ξμ + Θμν
,

δξ D = Θ(D) ,

(E.10)

where all the higher order terms given by ∆'s and Θ's are linear in ζμ and ξμ respectively,
but can depend on the massless fields hμν , bμν and ∂μ D to arbitrarily high order. The
gauge transformation parameters ζμ and ξμ are same as ζ̂μ and ξˆμ in (E.2, E.4) respectively
at the linearised level:
ζμ = ζ̂μ + ∆μ(ζ̂) ,

ξμ = ξˆμ + Θ(μξ̂) ,

(E.11)

where ∆μ(ζ̂) and Θ(μξ̂) contain all the higher order terms. These contributions are also linear
in the gauge transformation parameters appearing in the superscripts, but can depend
39

on the massless fields to arbitrarily high order. However, as we shall see below, for our
off-shell pp-wave ansatz the ∆'s and Θ's in eqs.(E.10) are at most quadratic and those in
eqs.(E.11) are at most linear in the massless fields.
Let us begin with TGT. The residual gauge transformation is parameterised by: ζμres =
res
res
ζ̂μres + ∆(μζ̂ ) , where ζ̂μres has been given above eq.(E.3). Since ∆(μζ̂ ) has to be linear in
ζ̂μres and at least linear in the massless fields, there is no way to construct this. Also the
field redefinition relating buI and b̂uI is trivial in this case. Therefore the first equation in
(E.10) reduces to,
δζres bIu = ∂I ζu ,

ζu = ζ̂u .

(E.12)

res
However, for GCT the residual transformation parameter: ξμres = ξˆμres +Θ(μξ̂ ) = (ξu , ξv , ξI ),
where ξˆμres is given above eq.(E.5), can take the following form:

ξu (u, x) = ξˆu (u, x) + LuI (u, x)ξˆI (u) ,

ξv = 0 ,

ξI = ξˆI ,

(E.13)

where LuI is linear in AI and/or BI but may contain arbitrarily high powers of transverse laplacian. This and the field redefinition (4.6, 4.7) determines the residual gauge
transformation completely.
δξres huu = 2∂u ξu + (∂ I K − 2∂u AI )ξI + K(A)I (∂I ξu − ∂u ξI − FI J ξJ ) + K(B)I ∂ J BI ξJ

(E.14)

where K(A)I and K(B)I are defined to be,
δA K2 = K(A)I δAI ,

δB K2 = K(B)I δBI ,

(E.15)

and therefore are linear in massless fields. This shows that the transformations in (E.14)
are at most quadratic in massless fields. Therefore to verify this in CSFT one needs to
compute the right hand side of (E.8) up to at most N = 4. However, it was pointed out in
[14] that a certain trivial symmetry of the CSFT action needs to be considered in addition
to the pure gauge transformation in (E.8) in order to realise TGT and GCT of the EFT
completely at higher order. Therefore the transformations in (E.14) may not be obtained
entirely from (E.8). It would be interesting to understand this explicitly through CSFT
computations.
