‚àö
FORMS OVER Q( 5) VIA THE JACQUET-LANGLANDS
CORRESPONDENCE
CLIFTON CUNNINGHAM AND LASSINA DEMB√âL√â
Abstract. In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke
eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of
narrow class number
‚àö one. We give some illustrative examples using the
quadratic field Q( 5). In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel
eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.

Introduction
Let F be a real quadratic field of narrow class number one and let B be the
unique (up to isomorphism) quaternion algebra over F which is ramified at
both archimedean places of F and unramified everywhere else. Let GU2 (B)
be the unitary similitude group of B ‚äï2 . This is the set of Q-rational points
of an algebraic group GB defined over Q. The group GB is an inner form of
G := ResF/Q (GSp4 ) such that GB (R) is compact modulo its centre. (These
notions are reviewed at the beginning of Section 1.)
In this paper we develop an algorithm which computes automorphic forms
on GB in the following sense: given an ideal N in OF and an integer k greater
than 2, the algorithm returns the Hecke eigensystems of all automorphic
forms f of level N and parallel weight k. More precisely, given a prime p in
OF , the algorithm returns the Hecke eigenvalues of f at p, and hence the
Euler factor Lp(f, s), for each eigenform f of level N and parallel weight k.
The algorithm is a generalization of the one developed in [D1 2005] to the
genus 2 case. Although we have only described the algorithm in the case of
a real quadratic field in this paper, it should be clear from our presentation
that it can be adapted to any totally real number field of narrow class
number one.
The Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence of the title refers to the conjectural map JL : Œ†(GB ) ‚Üí Œ†(G) from automorphic representations of GB to
automorphic representations of G, which is injective, matches L-functions
and enjoys other properties compatible with the principle of functoriality;

in particular, the image of the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence is to be
contained in the space of holomorphic automorphic representations. If we
admit this conjecture, then the algorithm above provides a way to produce
examples of cuspidal Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of genus 2 over F and
allows us to compute the L-factors of the corresponding automorphic representations for arbitrary finite primes p of F .
In fact, we are also able to use these calculations to provide evidence for
the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence itself by comparing the Euler factors
we find with those of known Hilbert-Siegel modular forms obtained by lifting.
This we do in the final section of the paper where we observe that some of
the Euler factors we compute match those of lifts of Hilbert modular forms,
for the primes we computed. Although this does not definitively establish
that these Hilbert-Siegel modular forms are indeed lifts, in principle one can
establish equality in this way, using an analogue of the Sturm bound.
The first systematic approach to Siegel modular forms from a computational viewpoint is due to Skoruppa [Sk 1992] who used Jacobi symbols to
generate spaces of such forms. His algorithm, which has been extensively
exploited by Ryan [R 2006], applies only to the case of full level structure.
More recently, Faber and van der Geer [FvdG1 2004] and [FvdG2 2004]
also produced examples of Siegel modular forms by counting points on hyperelliptic curves of genus 2; again their results are available only in the
full level structure case. The most substantial progress toward the computation of Siegel modular forms for proper level structure is by Gunnells
[Gu 2000] who extended the theory of modular symbols to the symplectic
group Sp4 /Q. However, this work does not see the cuspidal cohomology,
which is the only part of the cohomology which is relevant to arithmetic
geometric applications. To the best of our knowledge, there are no numerical examples of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms for proper level structure in
the literature, with the exception of those produced from liftings of Hilbert
modular forms.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we recall the basic
properties of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms and algebraic automorphic forms
together with the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence. In Section 2 we give
a detailed description of our algorithm. Finally,
in Section 3 we present
‚àö
numerical results for the quadratic field Q( 5).

1. Hilbert-Siegel modular forms and the Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence
Throughout this paper, F denotes a real quadratic field of narrow class
number one. The two archimedean places of F and the real embeddings of
F will both be denoted v0 and v1 . For every a ‚àà F , we write a0 (resp. a1 )
for the image of a under v0 (resp. v1 ). The ring of integers of F is denoted
by OF . For every prime ideal p in OF , the completion of F and OF at p
will be denoted by Fp and OFp , respectively.
Let B be the unique (up to isomorphism) totally definite quaternion algebra over F which is unramified at all finite primes of F . We fix a maximal
order OB of B. Also, we choose a splitting field K/F of B that is Galois over Q and such that there exists an isomorphism j : OB ‚äóZ OK ‚àº
=
M2 (OK ) ‚äï M2 (OK ), where M2 (A) denotes the ring of 2 √ó 2-matrices with
entries from a ring A. For every finite prime p in F , we fix an isomorphism
Bp ‚àº
= M2 (Fp) which restricts to an isomorphism from OB, p onto M2 (OFp ).
The algebraic group G = ResF/Q (GSp4 ) is defined as follows. For any
Q-algebra A, the set of A-rational points of G is given by

For any Q-algebra A, the conjugation on B extends in a natural way to the
matrix algebra M2 (B ‚äóQ A).

GZ (OK ), which we fix from now on. For every prime ideal p in F , the splitting of GB at p amounts to the splitting of the quaternion algebra B at p;
we refer to [D1 2005] for further details.
By the choice of the quaternion algebra B, we have GB (QÃÇ) ‚àº
= G(QÃÇ). (We
denote the finite ad√®les of Q (resp. Z) by QÃÇ (resp. ·∫ê)).
1.1. Hilbert-Siegel modular forms. We fix an integer k ‚â• 3 and, for
simplicity, we restrict ourselves to Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of parallel
weight k. The real embeddings v0 and v1 of F extend to G(Q) = GSp4 (F )
in a natural way. We denote by GSp+
4 (F ) the subgroup of elements Œ≥ with
totally positive similitude factor ŒΩG (Œ≥). We recall that the Siegel upper-half
plane of genus 2 is defined by
H2 = {Œ≥ ‚àà GL2 (C) Œ≥ t = Œ≥ and Im(Œ≥) is positive definite }.
2
We also recall that GSp+
4 (F ) acts on H2 by

A Hilbert-Siegel modular form of level N and parallel weight k is a
holomorphic function f : H22 ‚Üí C such that
‚àÄŒ≥ ‚àà Œì0 (N ),

f |k Œ≥ = f.

The space of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of parallel weight k and level N
is denoted Mk (N ). Each f ‚àà Mk (N ) admits a Fourier expansion, which by
the Koecher principle takes the form

f (œÑ ) =

where Q ‚àà M2 (F ) runs over all symmetric totally positive and semi-definite
matrices. A Hilbert-Siegel modular forms f is a cusp form if, for all Œ≥ ‚àà
GSp+
4 (F ), the constant term in the Fourier expansion of f |k Œ≥ is zero. The
space of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms is denoted Sk (N ).

1.2. The Hecke algebra. The space Sk (N ) comes equipped with a Hecke
action, which we now recall. Take u ‚àà GSp+
4 (F ) ‚à© M4 (OF ), and write the
finite disjoint union

Let p be a prime ideal in OF and let œÄp be a totally positive generator of

the beginning of Section 1.) The Hecke algebra Tk (N ) is the Z-algebra
generated by the operators T1 (p) and T2 (p), where p runs over all primes
not dividing N .
1.3. Algebraic Hilbert-Siegel autormorphic forms. We only consider
level structure of Siegel type. Namely, we define the compact open subgroup
U0 (N ) of G(QÃÇ) by
Y

The weight representation is defined as follows. Let Lk be the representation of GSp4 (C) of highest weight (k ‚àí 3, k ‚àí 3). We let Vk = Lk ‚äó Lk
and define the complex representation (œÅk , Vk ) by
œÅk : GB (R) ‚àí‚Üí GL(Vk ),
where the action on the first factor is via v0 , and the action on the second
one is via v1 .
The space of algebraic Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of weight k and
level N is given by

where f |k Œ≥(x) = f (Œ≥x)Œ≥, for all x ‚àà GB (QÃÇ)/U0 (N ). When k = 3, we let
n

IkB (N ) := f : GB (Q)\GB (QÃÇ)/U0 (N ) ‚Üí C f is constant .

For any prime p ‚à§ N , let Ãüp be a local uniformizer at p. The local Hecke algebra at p is generated by the Hecke operators T1 (p) and T2 (p) corresponding
to the double U0 (N )-cosets ‚àÜ1 (p) and ‚àÜ2 (p) of the matrices

1.4. The Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence. The Hecke modules Sk (N )
and SkB (N ) are related by the following conjecture known as the JacquetLanglands Correspondence for symplectic similitude groups.
Conjecture 1. The Hecke algebras Tk (N ) and TB
k (N ) are isomorphic and
there is a compatible isomorphism of Hecke modules
‚àº

Sk (N ) ‚àí‚Üí SkB (N ).
It is common, but perhaps not entirely accurate, to attribute this conjecture to Jacquet-Langlands. To the best of our knowledge, the correspondence in this form was first discussed by Ihara [Ih 1964] in the case F = Q. In
[Ib 1984], Ibukiyama provided some numerical evidence. On the other hand,
it is appropriate to refer to Conjecture 1 as the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence (for GSp(4)) since it is an analogue of the Jacquet-Langlands

COMPUTING HILBERT-SIEGEL MODULAR FORMS

Correspondence (for GL(2)) which relates automorphic representations of
the multiplicative group of a quaternion algebra with certain automorphic
representations of GL(2) (see [JL 1970]). Both correspondences are, in turn,
special consequences of the principle of functoriality, as expounded by Langlands. Finally, it appears that Conjecture 1 may soon be a theorem due to
the work of [So 2008] and the forthcoming book by James Arthur on automorphic representations of classical groups.
2. The Algorithm
In this section, we present the algorithm we used in order to compute
the Hecke module of (algebraic) Hilbert-Siegel modular forms. The main
assumption in this section is that the class number of the principal genus
of GB is 1. (We refer to [D3 2007] to see how one can relax this condition
on the class number.) We recall that since B is totally definite, GB satisfies Proposition 1.4 in Gross [Gr 1999]. Thus the group GB (R) is compact
modulo its centre, and Œì = GB (Z)/OF√ó is finite.
For any prime p in F , let Fp = OF /p be the residue field at p and define
the reduction map
M2 (OB, p) ‚Üí M4 (Fp)
g 7‚Üí gÃÉ,

where we use the splitting of OB,p that was fixed at the beginning of Section 1. Now, choose a totally positive generator œÄp of p and put

Œò1 (p) := Œì\ u ‚àà M2 (OB ) u≈´t = œÄp12 and rank(gÃÉ) = 2 ,

Œò2 (p) := Œì\ u ‚àà M2 (OB ) u≈´t = œÄp2 12 and rank(gÃÉ) = 1 .
We let H02 (N ) = G(·∫ê)/U0 (N ). Then the group Œì acts on H02 (N ), thus on
the space of functions f : H02 (N ) ‚Üí Vk by
‚àÄx ‚àà H02 (N ), ‚àÄŒ≥ ‚àà Œì,

f |k Œ≥(x) := f (Œ≥x)Œ≥.

Theorem 2. There is an isomorphism of Hecke modules
‚àº 
MkB (N ) ‚àí‚Üí f : H02 (N ) ‚Üí Vk f |k Œ≥ = f, Œ≥ ‚àà Œì ,

where the Hecke action on the right hand side is given by
X
f |k T1 (p) =
f |k u,
u‚ààŒò1 (p)

f |k T2 (p) =

X

u‚ààŒò2 (p)

f |k u.

Proof. The canonical map
œÜ : GB (Z)\GB (·∫ê)/U0 (N ) ‚Üí GB (Q)\GB (QÃÇ)/U0 (N )

is an injection. Making use of the fact that the class number in the principal
genus of GB is one (GB (QÃÇ) = GB (Q)GB
Z (·∫ê)), we see that œÜ is in fact a

8

bijection. Since each element f ‚àà MkB (N ) is determined by its values on a
set of coset representatives of GB (Q)\GB (QÃÇ)/U0 (N ), the map œÜ induces an
isomorphism of complex vector spaces

‚àº
MkB (N ) ‚àí‚Üí f : H02 (N ) ‚Üí Vk f |k Œ≥ = f, Œ≥ ‚àà Œì

We make this into a Hecke module isomorphism by defining the Hecke action
on the right hand side as indicated in the statement of the theorem.

In the rest of this section, we explain the main steps of the algorithm
provided by Theorem 2.
2.1. The quotientQ
H02 (N ). Keeping the notations of the previous section,
we recall that N = p|N pep . Let p be a prime dividing N and consider the


rank 4 free OFp /pep -module L = OFp /pep endowed with the symplectic
pairing h , i given by the matrix



J2 =

‚àí12 0
where 12 is the identity matrix in M2 (OFp /pep ). Let M be a rank 2
OFp /pep -submodule which is a direct factor in L. We say that M is
isotropic if hu, vi = 0 for all u, v ‚àà M . We recall that GSp4 (OFp ) acts
transitively on the set of rank 2, isotropic OFp /pep -submodules of L and
that the stabilizer of the submodule generated by e1 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T and
H02 (pep ) = GSp4 (OFp )/U0 (pep )
e2 = (0, 1, 0, 0)T is U0 (pep ). The quotient

is the set of rank 2, isotropic OFp /pep -submodules of L. Via the reduction
map √îF ‚Üí OF /N , the quotient GZ (·∫ê)/U0 (N ) can be identified with the
product
Y
H02 (N ) =
H02 (pep ).
p|N

The cardinality of H02 (N ) is extremely useful and is determined using the
following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let p be a prime in F and ep ‚â• 1 an integer. Then, the cardinality of the set H02 (pep ) is given by
#H02 (pep ) = N(p)3(ep ‚àí1) (N(p) + 1)(N(p)2 + 1).
Proof. For ep = 1, the cardinality of the Lagrange variety over the finite
field Fp = OF /p is given by (N(p) + 1)(N(p)2 + 1). Proceed by induction
on ep.

We have more to say about elements of H02 (pep ) in Subsection 2.5.

2.2. Brandt matrices. Let F = {x1 , . . . , xh } be a fundamental domain
for the action of Œì on H02 (N ) and, for each i, let Œìi be the stabilizer of xi .
Then, every element in MkB (N ) is completely determined by its values on
F. Thus, there is an isomorphism of complex spaces


Œò2 (x, y, p) := u ‚àà Œò2 (p) ‚àÉŒ≥ ‚àà Œì, ux = Œ≥y

Proposition 3. The actions of the Hecke operators Ts (p), s = 1, 2, are
given by the Brandt matrices Bs (p) = (bsij (p)), where

2.4. Computing the sets Œò1 (p) and Œò2 (p). Let us consider the quadratic

where nr is the reduced norm on B. This determines an inner form

An element of Œò1 (p) (resp. Œò2 (p)) is a unitary matrix Œ≥ ‚àà M2 (OB ) with
respect to this inner form such that the norm of each row is œÄp (resp. œÄp2
and the rank of the reduced matrix is 1). So we first start by computing

2.5. The implementation of the algorithm. The implementation of the
algorithm is similar to that of [D1 2005]. However, it is important to note
how we represent elements in H02 (N ) so that we can retrieve them easily
once stored. As in [D1 2005] we choose to work with the product
Y
H02 (pep ).
H02 (N ) =
p|N

Using Plucker's coordinates, we can view H02 (pep ) as a closed subspace of
P5 (OFp /pep ). We then represent each element in H02 (pep ) by choosing a
point x = (a0 : * * * : a5 ) = [u ‚àß v] ‚àà P5 (OFp /pep ) such that the submodule
M generated by u and v is a Lagrange submodule, and the first invertible
coordinate is scaled to 1.
Remark 1. In [LP 2002], Lansky and Pollack describe an algorithm which
computes algebraic modular forms on the same inner form of GSp4 /Q that
we use. We would like to note that there are some differences between the
two algorithms. Although [LP 2002] also uses the flag variety H02 (N ) in
order to determine the double coset space GB (Q)\GB (QÃÇ)/U0 (N ), it later
returns to the adelic setting in order to compute the Brandt matrices. In
contrast, Theorem 2 and Proposition 3 allow us to avoid that unnecessary
step by describing the Hecke action on the flag variety H02 (N ) directly. As
a result, we get an algorithm that is more efficient.

3. Numerical examples: F = Q( 5) and B = ‚àí1,F‚àí1
In this section,
we provide some numerical examples using the quadratic
‚àö
field F = Q( 5). It is proven in K. Hashimoto and T. Ibukiyama [HI 1980]
that, for the Hamilton quaternion algebra B over F , the class number of
the principal genus of GB is one. We use our algorithm to compute all the
systems of Hecke eigenvalues of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms of weight 3 and
level N that are defined over real quadratic fields, where N runs over all
prime ideals of norm less than 50. We then determine which of the forms
we obtained are possible lifts of Hilbert cusp forms by comparing the Hecke
eigenvalues for those primes.
3.1. Tables of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms of parallel weight 3. In
Table 1 we list all the systems of eigenvalues of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms of
weight 3 and level N that are defined over real quadratic fields, where N
runs over all prime ideals in F of norm less than 50. Here are the conventions
we use in the tables.

(2) The first row contains the level N , given in the format (Norm(N ), Œ±)
for some generator Œ± ‚àà F of N , and the dimensions of the relevant
spaces.
(3) The second row lists the Hecke operators that have been computed.
(4) For each eigenform f , the Hecke eigenvalues are given in a row, and
the last entry of that row indicates if the form f is a probable lift.
(5) The levels and the eigenforms are both listed up to Galois conjugation.
For an eigenform f and a given prime p ‚à§ N , let a1 (p, f ) and a2 (p, f ) be the
eigenvalues of the Hecke operators T1 (p) and T2 (p), respectively. Then the
Euler factor Lp(f, s) is given (for example, in [AS 2001, ¬ß3.4]) by
Lp(f, s) = Qp(q ‚àís )‚àí1 ,

where
Qp(x) = 1 ‚àí a1 (p, f )x + b1 (p, f )x2 ‚àí a1 (p, f )q 2k‚àí3 x3 + q 4k‚àí6 x4 ,

b1 (p, f ) = a1 (p, f )2 ‚àí a2 (p, f ) ‚àí q 2k‚àí4 ,
q = N(p).

3.2. Tables of Hilbert cusp forms of parellel weight 4. In Table 2, we
list all the Hilbert cusp forms of parallel weight 4 and level N that are defined
over real quadratic fields, with N running over all prime ideals of norm less
than 50. (They are computed by using the algorithm in [D1 2005]). We use
this data in order to determine the forms in Table 1 that are possible lifts
from GL2 .
3.3. Lifts. There are two types of lifts from GL2 to GSp4 . The first one
corresponds to the homomorphism of L-groups determined by the long root
embedding into GSp4 , and the second one by the short root embedding.
(See [LP 2002] for more details). Let f be a Hilbert cusp form of parallel
weight k and level N with Hecke eigenvalues a(p, f ), where p is a prime not
dividing N . Let œÜ be the lift of f to GSp4 via the long root, and œà the one
via the short root. Then the Hecke eigenvalues of œÜ are given by
a1 (p, œÜ) = a(p, f ) N(p)
a2 (p, œÜ) = a(p, f ) N(p)

Table 2. Hilbert eigenforms of weight 4
Remark 2. So far, our algorithm has been implemented only for congruence
subgroups of Siegel type. We intend to improve the implementation in the
near future so as to include more additional level structures such as the
Klingen type. Indeed, Ramakrishnan and Shahidi [RS 2007] recently showed
the existence of symmetric cube lifts for non-CM elliptic curves E/Q to
GSp4 /Q. And their result should hold for other totally real number fields,
with the level structures of the lifts being of Klingen type. Unfortunately,

14

those lifts cannot be seen in our
‚àö current tables. For example, there are
modular elliptic curves over Q( 5) whose conductors have norm 31, 41 and
49, but the corresponding symmetric cubic lifts do not appear in Table 1.
We would like to remedy that in our next implementation.
