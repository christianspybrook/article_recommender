NOTES ON C-FREE PROBABILITY WITH AMALGAMATION
MIHAI POPA

Abstract. As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion
of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced
by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents
several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of multilinear
function series.

1. Introduction
The paper addresses a topic related to conditionally free (or, shortly, using the
term from [2], c-free) probability. This notion was developed in the '90's (see [1],
[2]) as an extension of freeness within the framework of ∗-algebras endowed with
not one, but two states. Namely, given a family of unital algebras {A}i∈I , each Ai
endowed with two expectations φi , ψi : Ai −→ C, their c-free product is the triple
(A, φ, ψ), where:
(i) A = ı∈I Ai is the free product of the algebras Ai .
(ii) ψ = i∈I ψi and φ = (ψi ,i∈I) φi are conditional expectations given by the
relations
(a) ψ(a1 * * * an ) = 0
(b) φ(a1 * * * an ) = φε(1) (a1 ) * * * φε(n) (an )
for all aj ∈ Aε(j) , j = 1, . . . , n such that ψε(j) (aj ) = 0 and ε(1) 6= * * * =
6 ε(n).
An important result is that if the Ai are ∗-algebras and φi , ψi are states, then φ
and ψ are also states.
In [2] is constructed a c-free version of Voiculescu's R-transform, which we will
call the c R-transform, with the property that c RX+Y = c RX + c RY if X and Y are
c-free elements from the algebra A relative to φ and ψ (i.e. the relations (a) and
(b) from the definition of the c-free product hold true for the subalgebras generated
by X and Y .)
In [6], the notion of c-freeness is extended to the case when B is a subalgebra
of A and φ : A −→ B is a conditional expectation, while ψ is still C-valued. Also,
(see Theorem 3, Section 6, from [6]) the construction is discussed in an even more
general situation, when φ, ψ are operator valued function of the form P0 π(a)|H0
with π a ∗-representation of A on a Hilbert space H and P0 is the orthogonal
projection onto the Hilbert subspace H0 of H.
In [8] it was proved that for A a ∗-algebra, the analogous construction with both
φ and ψ valued in a C ∗ -subalgebra B of A still retains the positivity. The present
paper further develops this result.
The apparatus of multilinear function series is used in recent work of K. Dykema
([3] and [4]) to construct suitable analogues for the R and S-transforms in the
framework of freeness with amalgamation. We will show that this construction

is also appropriate for the c R-transform mentioned above. The techniques used
differ from the ones of [3], the Fock space type construction being substituted by
combinatorial techniques similar to [2] and [7].
The basic definitions and positivity results are stated in Section 2. Section 3
describes the construction and the basic property of the multilinear function series
c
R-transform and Section 4 treats the central limit theorem and a related positivity
result.
2. definitions and positivity results
Definition 2.1. Let Ai , i ∈ I, a family of algebras, all containing the subalgebra
B. Suppose D is a subalgebra of B and Ψi : Ai −→ D and Φi : Ai −→ B are
conditional expectations, i ∈ I. We say that the triple (A, Φ, Ψ) = i∈I (Ai , Φi , Ψi )
is the conditionally free product with amalgamation over (B,D), or shortly, the
c-free product, of the triples (Ai , Φi , Ψi )i∈I if
(1) A is the free product with amalgamation over B of the family (Ai )i∈I
(2) Ψ = i∈I Ψi and Φ = (Ψi ),i∈I Φi are determined by the relations

Ψ(a1 a2 . . . an ) =
Φ(a1 a2 . . . an ) =

Φ(a1 )Φ(a2 ) . . . Φ(an )

for any ai ∈ Aε(i) , ε(i) ∈ {1, 2}, such that ε(1) 6= ε(2) 6= * * * =
6 ε(n) and
Ψε(i) (ai ) = 0.
When D = C, this definition reduces to the one given in [6]. When both B and
D are equal to C, this definition was given in [2].
When discussing positivity, we need a ∗-structure on our algebras. We will
demand that B and D be C∗ -algebras, while Ai and A are only required to be
∗-algebras.
The following results are slightly modified versions of Lemma 6.4 and Theorem
6.5 from [8].
Lemma 2.2. Let B be a C ∗ -algebra and A1 , A2 be two ∗-algebras containing B as a
∗-subalgebra, endowed with positive conditional expectations Φj : Aj −→ B, j = 1, 2
If a1 , . . . , an ∈ A1 , an+1 , . . . , an+m ∈ A2 and A = (Ai,j ) ∈ Mn+m (B) is the matrix
with the entries

 2 i 1 j

if i, j > n
then A is positive.

Proof. The vector space E = B ⊕ ker(Φ1 ) ⊕ ker(Φ2 ) has a B-bimodule structure
given by the algebraic operations on A1 and A2 . Consider the B-sesquilinear pairing
determined by the relations:

h*, *i : E × E −→ B

hb1 , b2 i =

b∗1 b2 , for b1 , b2 ∈ B

hu1 , u2 i =

hu2 , u1 i = 0 for u1 ∈ ker(Φ1 ), and u2 ∈ ker(Φ2 ).

huj , vj i =
hb, uj i =

Φj (u∗j vj ), for uj , vj ∈ ker(Φj ), j = 1, 2

huj , bi = 0 for all b ∈ B, uj ∈ Aj

With this notation,
Ai,j = hai , aj i,
hence it suffices to show that for all a ∈ E
ha, ai ≥ 0.

Indeed, for an element a = b + u1 + u2 with b ∈ B, uj ∈ ker(Φj ), j = 1, 2, we
have:
ha, ai =

Theorem 2.3. Let B be a C ∗ -algebra and D a C ∗ -subalgebra of B. Suppose that
A1 , A2 are ∗-algebras containing B, each endowed with two positive conditional
expectations Φj : Aj −→ B, and Ψj : Aj −→ D, j = 1, 2. Consider the c-free
product (A, Φ, Ψ) = i=1,2 (Ai , Φi , Ψi ).
Then Φ and Ψ are positive.

∗

Proof. The positivity of Ψ is by now a classical result in the theory of free probability with amalgamation over a C ∗ -algebra (for example, see [9], Theorem 3.5.6).
For the positivity of Φ we have to show that Φ(a∗ a) ≥ 0 for any a ∈ A.
Any element of A can be written as

k=1

where sj,k ∈ Aε(j,k) ε(1, k) 6= ε(2, k) 6= * * * =
6 ε(n(k), k).
Writing

s(j,k)

and expanding the product, we can consider a of the form
a= d+

Definition 2.5. Let A be an algebra (respectively a ∗-algebra), B a subalgebra
(∗-subalgebra) of A and D a subalgebra (∗-subalgebra) of B. Suppose A is endowed
with the conditional expectations Ψ : A −→ D and Φ : A −→ D.
(i) The subalgebras (∗-subalgebras) (Ai )i∈I of A are said to be c-free with
respect to (Φ, Ψ) if
(a) (Ai )i∈I are free with respect to Ψ.
(b) if ai ∈ Aε(i) , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ε(1) 6= * * * =
6 ε(m) and Ψ(ai ) = 0, then
Φ(a1 * * * am ) = Φ(a1 ) * * * Φ(am ).
(ii) The elements (Xi )i∈I of A are said to be c-free with respect to (Φ, Ψ) if the
subalgebras (∗-subalgebras) generated by B and Xi are c-free with respect
to (Φ, Ψ).
We will denote by Bhξi the non-commutative algebra of polynomials in the
symbol ξ and with coefficients from B (the coefficients do not commute with the
symbol ξ). If I is a family of indices, Bh{ξi }i∈I i will denote the algebra of polynomials in the non-commuting variables {ξ}i∈I and with coefficients from B. We will
identify Bh{ξi }i∈I i with the free product with amalgamation over B of the family
{Bhξi i}i∈I .
If A is a ∗-algebra and B is with the C ∗ -algebra, Bhξi will also be considered
with a ∗-algebra structure, by taking ξ ∗ = ξ. If X is a selfadjoint element from A,
we define the conditional expectations
ΦX , ΨX : Bhξi −→ B
given by
ΦX (f (ξ))
ΨX (f (ξ))

= Φ(f (X))
= Ψ(f (X))

for any f (ξ) ∈ Bhξi.
Corollary 2.6. Suppose that A is a ∗-algebra and X and Y are c-free selfadjoint
elements of A such that the mappings ΦX and ΦY are positive. Then the mapping
ΦX+Y is also positive.

6

MIHAI POPA

Proof. Since the mappings
ΦX : Bhξ1 i −→ B

ΦY : Bhξ2 i −→ B
are positive, from Proposition 2 so is

Φx ∗(ΨX ,ΨY ) ΦY : Bhξ1 i ∗B Bhξ2 i = Bhξ1 , ξ2 i −→ B

Remark also that

iZ : Bhξi ∋ f (ξ) 7→ f (X + Y ) ∈ Bhξ1 i ∗B Bhξ2 i
is a positive B-functional.
The conclusion follows from the fact that the c-freeness of X and Y is equivalent
to
ΦX+Y = (ΦX ∗(ΨX ,ΨY ) ΦY ) ◦ iX+Y .

3. Multilinear function series and the c R-transform
Let A be a ∗-algebra containing the C ∗ -algebra B, endowed with a conditional
expectation Ψ : A −→ B. If X is a selfadjoint element of A, then the moment of
order n of X is the mapping
(n)

If B = C, then the moment-generating series of X
mX (z) =

∞
X

Ψ(X n )z n

n=0

encodes all the information about the moments of X. For B 6= C, the straightforward generalization
∞

n=0

generally fails to keep track of all the possible moments of X. A solution to this
inconvenience was proposed in [3], namely the moment-generating multilinear function series of X. Before defining this notion, we will briefly recall the construction
and several results on multilinear function series.
e equal to B if B is unital and
Let B be an algebra over a field K. We set B
to the unitization of B otherwise. For n ≥ 1, we denote by Ln (B) the set of all
K-multilinear mappings

A formal multilinear function series over B is a sequence ω = (ω0 , ω1 , . . . ), where
e and ωn ∈ Ln (B) for n ≥ 1. According to [3], the set of all multilinear
ω0 ∈ B
function series over B will de denoted by M ul[[B]].
For α, β ∈ M ul[[B]], the sum α + β and the formal product αβ are the elements
from M ul[[B]] defined by:

If β0 = 0, then the formal composition α ◦ β ∈ M ul[[B]] is defined by

where qj = p1 + * * * + pj−1 .
One can work with elements of M ul[[B]] as if they were formal power series. The
relevant properties are described in [3], Proposition 2.3 and Proposition 2.6. As in
[3], we use 1, respectively I, to denote the identity elements of M ul[[B]] relative
to multiplication, respectively composition. In other words, 1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . ) and
I = (0, idB , 0, 0, . . . ). We will also use the fact that an element α ∈ M ul[[B]] has
an inverse with respect to formal composition, denoted αh−1i , if and only if α has
the form (0, α1 , α2 , . . . ) with α1 an invertible element of L1 (B).
Definition 3.1. With the above notation, the moment-generating multilinear function series MX of X is the element of M ul[[B]] such that:
MX,0 =
MX,n (b1 , . . . , bn ) =

Ψ(X)
Ψ(Xb1 X * * * Xbn X).

Given an element α ∈ M ul[[B]], the multilinear function series Rα is defined by
the following equation (see [3], Def 6.1):

Rα = (1 + αI)

A key property of R is that for any X, Y ∈ A free over B, we have
RMX+Y = RMX + RMY .

(2)

These relations were proved earlier in the particular case B = C. One can also
describe Rα by combinatorial means, via the recurrence relation

p(k) = i(k) − i(k − 1) − 2.

Following an idea from [2], the above equation can be graphically illustrated by
the picture:
=

P

In the case of scalar c-free probability, an analogue of the Voiculescu's R-transform
is developed in [2]. In order to avoid confusions, we will denote it by c R.
The c R-transform has the property that it linearizes the c-free convolution of
pairs of compactly supported measures. In particular, if X and Y are c-free elements
from some algebra A, then
c

RX+Y = c RX + c RY .

If the ∗-algebra A is endowed with the C-valued states φ, ψ and X is a selfadjoint
element of A, then (see [2]), the coefficients {c Rm }m ≥ 0 of c RX are defined by the
recurrence:

where the second summation is done over all 1 = i(0) < i(1) < * * * < i(k) ≤ n and
p(k) = i(k) − i(k − 1) − 2.
The following analytical description of c Rβ,γ also shows that it is unique and

Before proving the theorem, remark that the right-hand side of (3) is well-defined
and unique, since 1 + Iγ is invertible with respect to the formal multiplication,
I + IβI is invertible with respect to formal composition and its inverse has 0 as
first component (see [3]). We will need the following auxiliary result:

Remark 3.5. Up to a shift in the coefficients, equation (3) is similar to the result
in the case B = C from [2], Theorem 5.1.
Let X be a selfadjoint element of A. If A is endowed with two B-valued conditional expectations Φ, Ψ, the element X will have two moment-generating multilinear function series, one with respect to Ψ, that we will denote by MX , and one
with respect to Φ, denoted X . For brevity, we will use the notation c RX for the
multilinear function series c RMX , X .

4. central limit theorem
Consider the ordered set hni = {1, 2, . . . , n} and π a partition of hni with blocks
B1 , . . . , Bm :
hni = B1 ⊔ B2 ⊔ * * * ⊔ Bm .

The blocks Bp and Bq of π are said to be crossing if there exist i < j < k < l in
hni such that i, k ∈ Bp and j, l ∈ Bq .
The partition π is said to be non-crossing if all pairs of distinct blocks of π are
not crossing. We will denote by N C2 (n) the set of all non-crossing partitions of hni
whose blocks contain exactly 2 elements and by N C≤s (n) the set of all non-crossing
partitions of hni whose blocks contain at most s elements.
Let now γ be a non-crossing partition of hni and B and C be two blocks of π. We
say that B is interior to C if there exist two indices i < j in hni such that i, j ∈ c
and B ⊂ {i + 1, . . . , j − 1}. The block B is said to be outer if it is not interior to
any other block of γ. In a non-crossing partition of hni, the block containing 1 is
always outer.
Consider now an element X of A. Let π be a partition from N C2 (n + 1) (n =
odd) and B1 = (1, k) be the block of π containing 1. We define, by recurrence, the
following expressions:
Vπ (X, b1 , . . . , bn )

= Ψ(Xb1 Vπ|{2,...,j−1} (X, b2 , . . . , bk−2 )bk−1 X)bk

Wπ (X, b1 , . . . , bn )

= Φ(Xb1 Vπ|{2,...,j−1} (X, b2 , . . . , bk−2 )bk−1 X)bk

Vπ|{k+1,...,n+1} (X, bk+1 , . . . , bn )
Wπ|{k+1,...,n+1} (X, bk+1 , . . . , bn )
Theorem 4.1. (Central Limit Theorem) Let (Xn )n≥1 be a sequence of c-free elements of A such that:
(1) all Xn have the same moment-generating multilinear function series,
with respect to Φ and M with respect to Ψ.
(2) Ψ(Xn ) = Φ(Xn ) = 0.

and the similar relations for RSN ,n , hence (i) and (ii) are proved.
For (iii) it suffices to check the relations for ν(ξb1 ξ . . . bn ξ) and μ(ξb1 ξ . . . bn ξ),
which are a trivial corollary of (i), (ii), and the recurrence formulas that define R
and c R.

Remark 4.2. For B = C, the theorem is a weaker version of Theorem 4.3 from [2].
If Ψ is C-valued, then the result is similar to Corollary 5.1 from [6]. Also, under
the assumptions that for some a, b ∈ B we have that:
lim N Ψ(X1 * * * XN ) = a

N →∞

lim N Ψ(X1 * * * XN ) = b

N →∞

the same techniques lead to a Poisson-type limit Theorem, similar to Corollary 2,
Section 5 of [6].
In the following remaining pages we will describe the positivity of the limit
functionals μ and ν in terms of Φ and Ψ. The central result is Corollary 4.4.
For simplicity, suppose that B is a unital ∗-algebra (otherwise, we can replace B
by its unitisation). Consider the symbol ξ, the ∗-algebra Bhξi of polynomials in ξ
with coefficients from B, as defined before, and consider also the linear space BξB
generated by the set {b1 ξb2 ; b1 , b2 ∈ B} with the B-bimodule structure given by
a1 b1 ξb2 a2 = (a1 b1 )ξ(b2 a2 )

for all a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 ∈ B.
Lemma 4.3. For any positive B-sesquilinear pairing h, i on BξB there exists a
positive conditional expectation
φ : Bhξi −→ B

14

such that for any b1 , b2 ∈ B

φ(ξb∗1 b2 ξ) = hb1 ξ, b2 ξi

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that B is unital (otherwise we
can replace B by its unitization).
Consider the Full Fock bimodule over BξB

(a, aj , b, bj ∈ B, j = 1, . . . , n)
Note that the B-linear operators A1 , A2 : F hξi −→ F hξi described by the relations
A1 b =
A1 (a1 ξ ⊗ * * * ⊗ an ξb) =

A2 b =
A2 (a1 ξ ⊗ * * * ⊗ an ξb) =

hξ, a1 ξia2 ξ ⊗ * * * ⊗ an ξb

are self-adjoint to each other, in the sense that
hA1 ζe1 , ζe2 i = hζe1 , A2 ζe2 i

for any ζe1 , ζe2 ∈ F hξi, therefore S = A1 + A2 is selfadjoint.
Moreover, for any a, b ∈ B,
h1, Sa∗ bS1i =
=

=

haS1, bS1i
ha(A1 + A2 )1, b(A1 + A2 )1i
haξ, bξi

and the conclusion follows by setting φ(p(ξ)) = h1, p(S)1i for all p ∈ Bhξi.



Corollary 4.4. The mappings μ and ν from Theorem 4.1 are positive if and only
if for any b ∈ B one has that Φ(Xb∗ bX) ≥ 0 and Ψ(Xb∗ bX) ≥ 0.

Proof. One implication is trivial, since, if ν and μ are positive, then
and

Ψ(Xb∗ bX) = ν(Xb∗ bX) = ν((bX)∗ bX) ≥ 0

Φ(Xb∗ bX) = μ(Xb∗ bX) = μ((bX)∗ bX) ≥ 0.
Suppose now that Φ(Xb∗ bX) ≥ 0 and Ψ(Xb∗ bX) ≥ 0 for all b ∈ B. We will use
the same argument as in [9] and [8].
Consider the set of selfadjoint symbols {ξi }i≥1 . On each B-bimodule Bξi B we
have the positive B-sesquilinear pairings h*, *iΦ and h*, *iΨ determined by

As shown in Lemma 4.3, the above B-sesquilinear pairings determine positive
conditional expectations φ1 , ψi : Ai −→ B, where Ai = Bhξi i be the ∗-algebras of
polynomials in ξ with coefficients from B, i ≥ 1.
For τ : Bhξi −→ B a conditional expectation, and λ ≥ 0, note with Dλ τ the
dilation with λ of τ , i.e.
Dλ τ (ξb1 ξ * * * bn ξ) = λn+1 τ (ξb1 ξ * * * bn ξ)
Remark that if τ is positive, then Dλ τ is also positive.
With the notations above, consider, as in Definition 2.1, the conditionally free
product (A, Φ, Ψ) = i∈I (Ai , Φi , Ψi ). The elements {ξi }i≥1 are conditionally free
in A, so Theorem 4.1 implies that:

We have that i=1 Ψξi ≥ 0 since it is the free product of states (see, for example
[9]), hence the positivity of ν.
Also, Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.6 imply that
Φξ1 +***+ξN ≥ 0
therefore μ ≥ 0.
