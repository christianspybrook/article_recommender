We investigate the dynamic evolution and thermodynamic process of a driven quantum system
immersed in a finite-temperature heat bath. A Born–Markovian quantum master equation is formally derived for the time-dependent system with discrete energy levels. This quantum master
equation can be applied to situations with a broad range of driving speeds and bath temperatures
and thus be used to study the finite-time quantum thermodynamics even when nonadiabatic transition and dissipation coexist. The dissipative Landau–Zener model is analyzed as an example. The
population evolution and transition probability of the model reveal the importance of the competition between driving and dissipation beyond the adiabatic regime. Moreover, local maximums of
irreversible entropy production occur at intermediate sweep velocity and finite temperature, which
the low-dissipation model cannot describe.

INTRODUCTION

The open quantum system with a time-dependent
Hamiltonian simultaneously incorporates coherent driving and unavoidable environment noise, and can therefore describe a broad range of physical systems controlled
by outside agents. Related problems include quantum
transport [1], adiabatic quantum computation [2–5], optimal quantum control [6], and dissipative many-body
systems [7–10]. In particular, the recent development
of quantum thermodynamics has advanced research on
time-dependent open systems [11–13].
Although efforts have long been made to develop an
appropriate description of dissipative quantum dynamics
with driving [14], no method is suitable for all the situations. Slowly driven and periodically driven systems
are the two cases studied most, and formalisms based on
the adiabatic master equation [15, 16] and Floquet's theory [17–20] have been widely employed. Moreover, various numerical methods have been proposed for this issue,
such as quasiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI)
[21], influence functional formalism [22], short-iterative
Lanczos method [23], hierarchical equations of motion
[24], quantum trajectories [25], and variational method
[26, 27].
However, a general master equation is still needed.
This is especially so when the dissipation and nonadiabatic transition are comparable, a case that usually
occurs for dissipative systems with energy-level avoided
crossings. Assuming that the driving changes slowly relative to the bath correlation time, a Markovian master
equation has been proposed and applied to the dissipative Landau–Zener (LZ) model [28]. However, this assumption is unnecessary, and the validity of the master
equation is not constrained by the adiabatic condition, as
was pointed out in Ref. [29] with an elaborate discussion

of the definitions and relations of different dynamic time
scales.
In this article, we derive a time-dependent quantum
master equation (TDQME) for systems with discrete
energy levels. Adopting Nakajima–Zwanzig projective
method [30] in the adiabatic frame of reference, this master equation is justified beyond the adiabatic approximation. The advantage of this approach is that the nonadiabatic transition and the dissipation are completely decoupled in the equation; thus, the magnitudes and time
scales of these two crucial factors can be separately considered, which offers great convenience in understanding and even controlling driven dissipative quantum systems. The time evolution and transition probability of
the dissipative LZ model are calculated for demonstration. These results indicate our method can be used beyond the adiabatic condition and verify the conclusions
drawn in Ref. [29].
Furthermore, we can straightforwardly evaluate the average values of thermodynamic quantities, such as heat,
work, and entropy, in nonequilibrium processes. The dependence of the irreversible entropy production on the
total evolution time determines the trade-off relation between the efficiency and output power of a heat engine
[31–33], which is generally linear in the low-dissipation
regime [34–36]. Beyond the low-dissipation regime, we
reveal that the irreversible entropy production changes
nonmonotonically with the sweep velocity and temperature in the context of the dissipative LZ model. Therefore, equipped with the TDQME, one can extend the optimal control of the finite-time quantum thermodynamic
processes [37] to the wider parameter regime with profound physical phenomena.
The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. Section II formally derives the TDQME. Section III presents
the example of the dissipative LZ system and the calculation of the dynamics and LZ probability of the system.
Section IV investigates the finite-time thermodynamics
of the dissipative LZ problem. Section V briefly summa-

In deriving the master equation for a time-independent
system, we usually carry out a secular approximation according to the system eigenvalues by dropping the fast
oscillatory terms. The resulting dissipation rate γ(Eij )
is then a function of the energy level difference Eij between the two related eigenstates |ii and |ji [30]. This
approach is often generalized to the time-dependent open
quantum system by substituting the time-independent
Eij in γ(Eij ) with the instantaneous eigenvalue difference Eij (t). This naive approach requires that the system
Hamiltonian changes slowly. The meaning of the word
"slowly" here is twofolds: 1) the adiabatic theorem [38]
is satisfied such that all the nonadiabatic transitions can
be neglected and 2) the system changes slowly relative to
the bath correlation time such that the dissipative rate
changes following the instantaneous eigenvalues. Working in the adiabatic frame of reference is a convenient
way of deriving a quantum master equation that is justified for an arbitrary driving protocol and a wide range
of driving speeds.

A.

Adiabatic frame of reference

Generally, a time-dependent open system is described
by the Hamiltonian
H(t) = HS (t) + HB + V,

(1)

where HS (t) is the system Hamiltonian, HB is the heat
bath Hamiltonian, and V describes the system–bath interaction. We assume that the interaction V is weak and
all the time-dependent terms are taken into account by
HS (t). The system Hamiltonian can be diagonalized as
HS (t) =

X

En (t)|n(t)ihn(t)|,

(2)

n

where |n(t)i is the instantaneous eigenvector, and En (t)
is the corresponding eigenvalue. Under the adiabatic approximation, the unitary evolution of a time-dependent
system with Hamiltonian HS (t) and initial state |n(t0 )i
is described as
|ψn (t)i = eiηn (t)+iξn (t) |n(t)i,

(3)

where we define the dynamic and adiabatic phase factors

En (τ )dτ,

ηn (t) = −

ξn (t) = i

(5)

The unitarity of U (t) can be easily proved from the orthogonal completeness of |ψn (t)i. U (t) maps the timedependent state |ψn (t)i to the instantaneous eigenstate
|n(t0 )i of time t0 , which can be arbitrarily chosen for convenience. We also incorporate the transformation of the
heat bath in U (t); the transformed total Hamiltonian is
then given by
H̃(t) = U † (t)H(t)U (t) − iU † (t)

d
U (t)
dt

≡ H̃S (t) + Ṽ (t).
Here, the transformed system Hamiltonian reads
X
H̃S (t) =
αnm (t)|n(t0 )ihm(t0 )|,

(7)

(8)

n6=m

where
αnm (t) = −ie−iφnm (t) hn(t)|ṁ(t)i,

(9)

and φnm (t) ≡ φn (t) − φm (t), φn (t) ≡ ηn (t) + ξn (t). It
is seen from Eq. (8) that H̃S (t) only includes the nonadiabatic transitions; i.e., the transitions between the different instantaneous eigenstates. Moreover, the nonadiabatic transition coefficient αnm (t) is proportional to
hn(t)|ṁ(t)i, whose magnitude usually increases with the
driving speed. Therefore, H̃S (t) can be neglected when
the adiabatic theorem is satisfied. Otherwise, we should
consider its contribution to the dissipative dynamics of
the driven open quantum system.
The transformed system–bath interaction is written as
Ṽ (t) = U † (t)V U (t),

(10)

which is now time dependent. We should keep all the
rotating wave and counter-rotating wave terms in the
system–bath coupling V to ensure the secular approximation is carried out correctly in the adiabatic frame of
reference.

B.

Nakajima–Zwanzig projective approach

We follow the standard Nakajima–Zwanzig projective
operator method [30] to derive the TDQME, such that
the nonadiabatic transition and dissipation can be considered in the same framework. In the adiabatic frame of
reference defined above, the quantum Liouville equation
reads
d
ρ̃(t) = −i[H̃(t), ρ̃(t)] ≡ L(t)[ρ̃(t)].
dt

(11)

3
Here, ρ̃(t) is the density operator of the total system
in the adiabatic frame and relates to the operator ρ(t)
in the original frame according to ρ̃(t) = U † (t)ρ(t)U (t).
The Liouville superoperator L(t) can be decomposed into
two parts L = L0 + LI , where
L0 [ρ̃(t)] = −i[H̃S (t), ρ̃(t)],

(12)

LI [ρ̃(t)] = −i[Ṽ (t), ρ̃(t)].

(13)

Then, L0 describes the nonadiabatic evolution while LI
describes the system–bath interaction that should be
treated perturbatively.
The projective operator P is defined as
P ρ̃(t) = TrB [ρ̃(t)] ⊗ ρB ≡ ρ̃S (t) ⊗ ρB .

(14)

We see that P maps ρ̃(t) to a direct product of
the reduced-density operator of the system ρ̃S (t) and
that of the heat bath ρB . As the system–bath coupling is weak, it is reasonable to assume that the
heat bath is always in thermal equilibrium; i.e., ρB =
exp(−βHB )/Tr[exp(−βHB )]. The orthogonal projective
operator Q is defined by
Qρ̃(t) = ρ̃(t) − P ρ̃(t).
2

(15)
2

P and Q satisfy the relations P = P, Q = Q and PQ =
QP = 0. We also assume that the expectation value of
odd orders of Ṽ (t) is zero, which can be written with
superoperators as PLI (t1 )LI (t2 ) * * * LI (t2n+1 )P = 0.
The quantum Liouville equation can be decomposed
into two coupled equations by applying P and Q to
Eq. (11):
d
P ρ̃(t) = PL(t)P ρ̃(t) + PL(t)Qρ̃(t),
dt
d
Qρ̃(t) = QL(t)P ρ̃(t) + QL(t)Qρ̃(t).

(22)

Furthermore, we adopt the Markovian approximation
by substituting the integral variable s → t − s in Eq. (20)
and Eq. (22), and assume ρ̃(t−s) ≈ ρ̃(t) considering that
the system density operator changes slightly within the
time scale of the bath correlation time τB . We thus have

K(t, s) ≈ PLI (t)T← e

As seen from the dissipative LZ model below, Eq. (23)
is proportional to the bath correlation function, which
quickly decays within the short time scale τB . Therefore,
R̃(s) contributes to Eq. (23) mainly during 0 . s . τB ,
such that we can safely approximate R̃(s) ≈ 1, which is
equivalent to assuming that

Formally integrating Eq. (17), we obtain
Z t
Qρ̃(t) = G(t, t0 )Qρ̃(t0 ) +
dsG(t, s)QL(s)P ρ̃(s), (18)
where Green's function G (t, s) is defined as
Z t
tG(t, s) = T← exp[
dτ QL(τ )],

state ρ̃(t0 ) = ρ̃S (t0 ) ⊗ ρB , such that Qρ̃(t0 ) = 0. Using
PLI (t)P = 0 and L0 (t)Q = QL0 (t), we only keep the
master equation to the second order of LI and approximately write

(21)

In deriving Eq. (20), we also adopt the Born approximation by assuming the initial state is a direct product

(26)

This condition is generally easy to be satisfied, even if
the adiabatic condition [38] is no longer justified.
Combining Eqs. (20,23,26) and tracing over the bath
degrees of freedom, we finally obtain the general form of
the TDQME:
d
ρ̃S (t) = L0 [ρ̃S (t)] + LB [ρ̃S (t)],
dt

(27)

where L0 is defined by Eq. (12) and LB is expressed as
Z
LB [ρ̃S (t)] = −

t−t0

dsTrB [Ṽ (t), [Ṽ (t − s), ρ̃S (t) ⊗ ρB ]].
0

(28)
The reduced density operator of the system can be
obtained by solving Eq. (27) and then transforming back into the original frame using ρS (t) =
TrB [U (t)ρ̃S (t)U † (t)]. The transformation U (t) takes the
responsibility of the adiabatic evolution. If there is no
nonadiabatic transition or dissipation, U (t) adiabatically
rotates the system following the instantaneous eigenstates.

4
It is noted that, as indicated in Ref. [29], the TDQME
in the weak system–bath coupling case is actually not
constrained by the condition (26) and can be applied to
a situation with larger nonadiabatic transitions. Putting
it briefly, the violation of (26) implies that the nonadiabatic transition is strong, such that the LB is negligible
regardless of how it is derived. We will illustrate this
point in the following section taking the example of the
dissipative LZ problem.

TDQME for a linearly driven two-level system

The linearly driven two-level system interacting with a
bosonic bath is an ideal model with which to demonstrate
how to apply the TDQME, as it is both simple enough yet
contains almost all the essential ingredients of dissipative
open systems. This model is also a good playground
in which to study finite-time quantum thermodynamics.
If we focus on the physics with avoided crossing point,
this model becomes the well-known LZ model with the

where ak is the bosonic annihilation operator of the bath
harmonic mode with frequency ωk while gk is the coupling strength. For simplicity, we consider only the case
that the bath is transversely coupled with the two-level
system via operator σx in the main text. The longitudinal σz -coupling case is briefly discussed in Appendix A.
The linear combination of these two kinds of coupling
was discussed in Ref. [41].
Applying the unitary transformation defined in (6), we
obtain

The effect of a finite Berry's phase on the dissipative dynamics is another interesting problem [39, 40] but is not

However, the convergence of the Matsubara expansion is
much slower at low temperature.

B.

Time evolution

The two most important and competitive ingredients of
the dissipative LZ system, namely the LZ transition and
dissipation, are now separately described in Eq. (27) by
the unitary evolution L0 [ρ̃S (t)] and non-unitary evolution
LB [ρ̃S (t)], respectively. The unraveling of the dynamic
processes allows us to clarify how the LZ transition and
dissipation contribute on different time scales.

Figure 2. Strength of the nonadiabatic transition |αeg (t)|,
relaxation rate Γ+ (t), and dephasing rate Γz (t) as functions
of the evolution time t. Different sweep velocities are chosen in
the (a) slow (v/2 = 0.1), (b) intermediate (v/2 = 1), and (c)
fast (v/2 = 10) regimes. The nonadiabatic transition |αeg (t)|
(black dashed line) is a Lorentzian peak with width 2τLZ and
maximum v/(2). The relaxation rate Γ+ (t) has a dip around
t = 0, and its magnitude decreases with temperature (T / =
25 for the orange solid line and T / = 1 for the blue solid
line). The dephasing rate Γz (t) (dot-dashed lines) appears
on the same time scale as |αeg (t)|, but its magnitude is much
smaller. Here, we set γ = 0.001 and ωc = 10.

We plot |αeg (t)|, Γ+ (t) and Γz (t) as functions of the
rescaled time t/τLZ in Fig. 2 for different sweep velocities v/2 = 0.1, 1 and 10, at both high temperature
T = 25 and low temperature T = . Both Γ+ (t) and
Γz (t) decrease with temperature, while |αeg (t)| is independent of temperature. Consistent with our discussion
in Sec. IIIA, the Lorentzian line shape of |αeg (t)| lies
at the avoided crossing point t = 0, where there is a
sharp decline of Γ+ (t). The height of |αeg (t)| linearly
increases with the sweep velocity. Entering the nonadiabatic regime v/2 > 1, the LZ transition overwhelms
the dissipation. The relaxation rate Γ+ (t) has two maximums located around t ≈ ±2τLZ , beyond which Γ+ (t)
exponentially decreases to zero on a time scale of about

6
2ωc /v. The curves of Γ− (t) are similar to but lower than
those of Γ+ (t) and are not presented here.
In the adiabatic regime (v/2 . 1), Γ+ (t) is almost a
symmetric function of t as shown in Fig. 2(a). This is
because when τLZ  τB , we can approximately rewrite
Eq. (42) as
Γ+ (t) ≈ cos2 θt J [2Ee (t)] {n [2Ee (t)] + 1} ,
2

Γ− (t) ≈ cos θt J [2Ee (t)] n [2Ee (t)] ,

(46)
(47)

where n(ω) = 1/[exp(βω) − 1] and the expressions on
the right are obvious even functions of time. Equations (46,47) are usually directly employed in the adiabatic master equation [33, 42], but they are no longer
justified if v rises into the nonadiabatic regime and should
be derived on the basis of Eq. (42). As shown in Fig. 2(c)
with v/2 = 10, two peaks of Γ+ (t) becomes asymmetric
and Γ+ (t) slightly oscillates on top of an exponential decay when t ? 2τLZ at T = 25. In this nonadiabatic case,
Γ+ (t) becomes negative for a short time as soon as t > 0.
The appearance of negative Γ+ (t) means the relaxation
turns into pumping. However, this anomaly does not
have a notable effect as it only lasts for an instant, and
the LZ transition is overwhelming simultaneously.
The dephasing rate Γz (t) is approximately proportional to sin2 θt and contributes along with |αeg (t)| in
the time domain. The effect of this term is to reduce
the coherence between the states |e(t0 )i and |g(t0 )i, or
equivalently that between the diabatic basis | ↑i and | ↓i
as we set the initial evolution time t0  0 in the following calculation. The energy-level shift S± (t) is not shown
here, considering its effect on the dynamics is negligible
if the system–bath coupling is weak.
The time evolution of the populations Pζ (t) =
hζ|ρS (t)|ζi (ζ =↑, ↓) are shown in Fig. 3. The sweep velocities of the subplots in each row are v/2 = 0.1, 1, and
10 from top to bottom. The left (right) panel shows the
high (low) temperature cases with T / = 25 (T / = 1).
The time evolution starts at t0 = −40τLZ with the initial
state |ψ(t0 )i = | ↑i and ends at tf = 40τLZ . Outside this
period, the dynamics becomes trivial because everything
decays to zero as shown in Fig. 2. We also plot two sets of
curves for comparison; i.e., P↑(↓),L0 =0 represents the population calculated by manually closing the nonadiabatic
transitions L0 [ρ̃S (t)] = 0 while P↑(↓),LB =0 represents the
population in the original LZ problem without dissipation (LB [ρ̃S (t)] = 0).
As shown in Fig. 3(a)(d) with v/2 = 0.1 in the
adiabatic regime, P↑(↓) (t) coincides well with the curve
P↑(↓),L0 =0 (t), because the dissipation LB [ρ̃S (t)] dominates the time evolution and the LZ transition can be neglected. When the bath temperature is high [as T / = 25
in Fig. 3(a)], the thermal excitation prevents | ↑i from
completely transferring into | ↓i, and P↓ (tf ) is thus
smaller than 1, which is different from the original unitary LZ problem. However, if the temperature is low as
T / = 1, the heat bath cools the system to a new ground
state after passing the avoided crossing point, whose ef-

fect coincides with the adiabatic evolution. Thus, all the
three sets of curves overlap in Fig. 3(d).
The effects of nonadiabatic LZ transition emerge when
the sweep velocity gradually increases to v/2 = 1. As
shown in Fig. 3(b)(e), P↑(↓) (t > 0) is slightly higher
(lower) than P↑(↓),L0 =0 (t > 0) because the LZ transition prefers to reserve more population in the initial state
| ↑i. A fast oscillation with small amplitude appears
on P↑(↓) (t > 0); this is the typical signature of the LZ
dynamics. If we further increase the sweep velocity to
v/2 = 10, the dynamics of the dissipative LZ model
are similar to those of the original LZ model because
of the relatively weak dissipation. The small disparity
between P↑(↓) (t > 0) and P↑(↓),LB =0 (t > 0) in Fig. 3(d)
when T / = 25 is evidence of thermal excitation, which is
barely noticeable in the low-temperature case [Fig. 3(f)].
We emphasize that the dissipative LZ system generally cannot finally relax to the instantaneous thermal
−HS (t)/T
equilibrium state ρeq
/Tr[e−HS (t)/T ], beS (t) ≡ e
cause the dissipation vanishes when the time-dependent
energy gap is much larger than the bath cut-off frequency
ωc . As a result, the system will evolve into a steady
state with an effective temperature higher than that of
the heat bath. If we ignore the coherence, we can define a time-dependent effective temperature of the system as Teff (t) = 2Ee (t)/ ln[P↓ (t)/P↑ (t)], which increases
with the growing v. Teff (tf ) even becomes negative when
v/2 = 10, implying the populations are inverted; i.e.,
P↓ (tf ) < P↑ (tf ).

problem and is defined by

If we initially prepare the two-level system in the state
| ↑i at t0 → −∞ and then let the system unitarily evolve
to tf → ∞ governed by linear driving HS (t), PLZ (v) is
the probability of finally finding the system in state | ↓i;
PLZ (v) has the well-known expression [43, 44] as

It is not only interesting but also of practical importance to study how the dissipation interferes with the
LZ transition; indeed, the open-system version of LZ
probability has received broad and long-lasting interest
[21, 41, 45–50]. In the case of the open system, we can
analogously define the LZ probability P (v) by replacing the unitary evolution in Eq. (48) by the dissipative
dynamics described by the TDQME with initial state
ρS (t0 ) = | ↑ih↑ |; i.e.,
P (v) = h↓ |ρS (tf )| ↓i.

Figure 3. Time evolution of diabatic-state populations of the dissipative LZ model. The initial state is chosen as | ↑i. The
evolution starts at t0 = −40τLZ and ends at tf = 40τLZ . From top to bottom, the two subplots in each row correspond to
v/2 = 0.1, 1, and 10; the left (right) panel is the high (low) temperature case with T / = 25 (T / = 1). The populations
P↑,↓ (t) calculated using the TDQME are plotted with solid lines. For comparison, we also plot the populations evolutions in
the cases without the nonadiabatic transition (L0 = 0) and without the dissipation (LB = 0). Other parameters are the same
as those in Fig. 2.

We calculate P (v) with tf = −t0 ≈ 100τLZ , such that
the time evolution is long enough to cover all the nonadiabatic and dissipative processes. In Fig. 4, we plot
both P (v) at various temperatures and PLZ (v) with respect to the logarithmic value of v. Except for the lowtemperature cases of T / < 1, in the adiabatic regime,
P (v) decreases with increasing v. As we mentioned in the
last subsection, the relaxation is active only on a time
scale inverse to v; thus, the system decouples with the
heat bath at an earlier time as v increases before it is in
equilibrium, and greater populations remain in | ↑i. As
the sweep velocity further increases entering the region
v/2 ∼ 1, the gradually enhanced LZ transition starts to
compete with dissipation and eventually dominates the
evolution. Therefore, a local minimum of P (v) appears
around v/2 ∼ 1 and then P (v) quickly decreases with v
increasing into the LZ regime (v/2  1). The residual
effect of the heat bath in the regime 1 . v/2 . 10 is
reflected by the small disparities of P (v) above PLZ (v).
We note that the nonmonotonicity of the LZ probabil-

ity is more apparent in the case of longitudinal system–
bath coupling than in the case of transverse coupling discussed here, where the relaxation plays a more important
role (see Appendix A). Our results obtained using the
TDQME method are well consistent with those calculated using the QUAPI [41].

IV.

FINITE-TIME THERMODYNAMICS

The above calculation suggests that the TDQME is
a useful tool with which to explore the finite-time thermodynamics of quantum systems with discrete energy
levels. In the framework of quantum thermodynamics,
the internal energy U (t) = Tr [ρS (t)HS (t)] and von Neumann entropy S(t) = −Tr[ρS (t) ln ρS (t)] are functions of
the system state at the present time. However, the input
work W (t) and the absorbed heat Q(t) depend on the

and the temperature is low (T / = 0.1 and 1). When the
sweep velocity is high (v/2 ? 10), the nonadiabatic transition dominates the evolution; hence, P (v) at different temperatures approaches but is a little higher than PLZ (v). Such
small disparities are the results of dissipation and finally vanish at extremely high v. The nonmonotonic behavior of P (v)
appears around v/2 = 1 and T / ? 1, when the nonadiabatic
transition and dissipation are comparable in strength. Other
parameters are the same as those in Fig. 2.

and the heat can be obtained using the first law of thermodynamics as Q(t) = ∆U (t) − W (t), where ∆U (t) =
U (t) − U (t0 ) is the internal energy increase.
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that the
entropy does not decrease in a closed system. Accordingly, the total entropy production, usually termed as
irreversible entropy production ∆Sirr (t), is always nonnegative and can be decomposed as
∆Sirr (t) = ∆S(t) − ∆Se (t) ≥ 0.

(52)

Here, ∆S(t) = S(t) − S(t0 ) and ∆Se (t) ≡ Q(t)/T is the
entropy decrease of the heat bath due to the output heat
current. In finite-time processes, the system is generally
in a nonequilibrium state, and the irreversible entropy
production ∆Sirr (t) serves to characterize the deviation
of the system away from equilibrium [51, 52].
It is usually believed that the leading order of ∆Sirr (t)
is inversely proportional to the total evolution time under the low-dissipation assumption ( i.e., ∆Sirr (tf ) ∝
1/(tf − t0 ) [31]), which has been confirmed both theoretically [33, 35] and experimentally [36] in systems
without energy level avoided crossing. The validity of
the low-dissipation assumption requires there should be

no retard of equilibrium, which readily occurs in fastdriving processes. To explore the behavior of ∆Sirr (t) in
a broader region, we start with the calculation of ∆S(t)
and ∆Se (t) in the dissipative LZ model. We initialize the system in a thermal equilibrium state ρS (t0 ) =
e−βHS (t0 ) /Tr[e−βHS (t0 ) ], and then let the system evolve
from t0 = −40τLZ to tf = 40τLZ , when the system finally
approaches a nonequilibrium steady state.
In the high-sweep-velocity region (v/2 ? 10), the LZ
system evolves in an almost unitary way under the slight
effect of the heat bath. As a result, ∆S(tf ) and ∆Se (tf )
quickly approach zero with increasing v, as shown in
Fig. 5(a) and (c). Even when the temperature is much
higher than  (e.g., T / = 100), the LZ transition is still
hundreds of times larger in magnitude than the dissipation during t ∈ [−τLZ , τLZ ]; hence, the dissipation can be
safely neglected. Meanwhile, when the sweep velocity is
low (e.g., v/2 > 1), the LZ transition becomes negligible, such that the system tends to adiabatically follow its
instantaneous eigenstates while exchanging heat with the
bath. A lower sweep velocity means that more population remains in the initial adiabatic basis, and the change
in system entropy ∆S(tf ) decreases accordingly. In the
intermediate region 1 > v/2 > 10, the LZ transition and
the adiabatic following compete with each other, which
largely disturbs the population distribution and results
in local maximums of ∆S(tf ).
Local maximums of ∆S(tf ) also appear when we
change temperature and fix the sweep velocity [Fig. 5(b)].
In the low-temperature limit as T / approaching 1, the
dissipation is too weak to substantially affect the unitary
evolution, and ∆S(tf ) thus decreases to a small value.
At high-temperature limit as T / → 100, the critical issue of small ∆S(tf ) rises from the fact that the entropy
of a binary distribution changes less when the entropy is
greater. Consequently, no matter how much the initial
state populations are changed by the subsequent dynamics, ∆S(tf ) is bounded by ln 2 − S(t0 ), which is small for
a high-temperature initial equilibrium state.
The entropy flow ∆Se (tf ) as functions of the sweep velocity and temperature is presented in Fig. 5(c) and (d),
respectively. At the high sweep velocity limit or high
temperature limit, ∆Se (tf ) is extremely small for a reason similar to that for ∆S(tf ). We note that ∆Se (tf )
is small at the high T limit also because ∆Se (tf ) equals
the heat absorption rescaled by 1/T . Furthermore, the
heat absorption is positively relates to the variation rate
of the population difference between two instantaneous
eigenstates, which is greatly suppressed at high T . More
sophisticated behavior of ∆Se (tf ) appears at low temperature (T / > 10) in the intermediate sweep velocity
region, which is consistent with the nonmonotonic region
of P (v) in Fig. 4, where the LZ transition is maximally
affected by dissipation.
The irreversible entropy production ∆Sirr (tf ) is plotted as functions of v and T in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. Its behavior can be understood by combining the
above results, which are not repeated here. As shown

Figure 6. Irreversible entropy production ∆Sirr (tf ) as functions of (a) v and (b) T . The low-dissipation regime has low sweep
velocities and high temperatures, where ∆Sirr (tf ) changes linearly with v. Other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 5.

in Fig. 6(a), ∆Sirr (tf ) linearly increases with v only in
the region of low v (v/2 < 1) and high T (T / > 50),
beyond which ∆Sirr (tf ) has a nonmonotonic dependence
on v. Being linearly proportional to v is equivalent to
being inversely proportional to tf − t0 in the current situation, which indicates the low-dissipation regime. An
important aspect of the TDQME is that regardless of
the low-dissipation assumption, we can now quantitatively determine under what conditions ∆Sirr (tf ) reaches
a maximum or minimum, which lies at the heart of designing highly efficient thermodynamic cycles. It is worth
noticing that the energy-level avoided crossing can induce
more profound dynamic and thermal phenomena, which
should be considered for optimization problems in finitetime thermodynamics.

V.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We formally derived a Born–Markovian quantum master equation for the time-dependent open system in the
adiabatic basis representation based on the Nakajima–
Zwanzig projective operator method. Our formalism can
be applied to an arbitrary driving protocol with a broad
range of driving speeds and is justified even beyond the
adiabatic regime. Several authors have pointed out that
the nonadiabatic transition and dissipation hardly dominate the system dynamics simultaneously; thus, the adiabatic condition is not a necessary requirement in our
approach. This idea is explicitly implemented in our
formalism by separating the Liouville operator into the
nonadiabatic transition and the dissipation terms. Tak-

10
ing the dissipative LZ system as an example, we show
that when the system is driven quickly, the nonadiabatic transition overwhelms the dissipation. When the
sweep velocity is decreasing, the nonadiabatic transition
decreases in magnitude; meanwhile, it separates from the
dissipation in the time domain. The validity of our approach was checked by calculating the LZ probabilities
with finite-temperature heat bathes and comparing with
previously obtained numerical results.
The competition between the time-dependent dissipation and nonadiabatic transition plays an essential role
in determining the thermodynamic properties of finitetime processes, which is clearly revealed by the dissipative LZ system. Our calculation shows that in the case
of a system linearly passing through the avoided crossing
point, the entropy, heat, and irreversible entropy change
nonmonotonically with the sweep velocity and bath temperature. The low-dissipation regime only appears at
high temperature and for slow driving, which is consistent with the usual understanding. However, our TDMQE is applicable in situations with parameters beyond
the low-dissipation regime and can be used for the problems such as the optimization of the performance of the
quantum Carnot cycle [53], and the distributions of the
work and heat in stochastic quantum thermodynamics
[42, 54–58].

Equation (A2) is the same as Equation (39) for σ̃x (t)
except that cos θt and sin θt are interchanged. As a result, the relaxation only occurs within the time window
t ≤ |τLZ | in the longitudinal coupling case, while pure
dephasing occurs outside the time window. Comparing
with the dissipative rates in Fig. 2, the relaxation in the
transverse coupling case effectively exists for longer time
than that in the longitudinal coupling case, resulting in
more apparent dissipative effects.
We plot the LZ probability of the longitudinal system–
bath coupling case in Fig. 7. There are two main differences from the transverse coupling case: the local minimums of P (v) have smaller values and are at lower v in
the low-sweep-velocity regime and P (v) converges more
quickly to PLZ (v) when v/2 & 1. The simple explanation is that in the longitudinal coupling case, there
is relaxation when the energy gap is small at about 2.
Thus, in the regime of low sweep velocity, the bath intends to relax the two-level system with more evenly distributed populations on the instantaneous eigenstates at
finite temperature, and P (v) is therefore smaller than
that in the transverse coupling case. In the high-sweepvelocity regime, as the nonadiabatic transition and relaxation occur in the same time window and the former
overwhelms the later, the effect of the heat bath is totally washed out regardless of temperature. Our results
are consistent with the QUAPI results in Ref. [21, 41].
