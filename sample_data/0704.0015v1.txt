Abstract: The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to
manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these integrals and then uses
them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point
amplitudes involving two and four Ramond states.

1. Introduction
The quantisation of the ten-dimensional superstring using pure spinors as world-sheet
ghosts [1] has overcome many difficulties encountered in the Green-Schwarz (GS) and
Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) formalisms. Most notably, by maintaining manifest spacetime supersymmetry, the pure spinor formalism has yielded super-Poincaré covariant multiloop amplitudes, leading to new insights into perturbative finiteness of superstring theory
[2, 3].
Counting fermionic zero modes is a powerful technique in the computation of loop
amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism and has for example been used to show that
at least four external states are needed for a non-vanishing massless loop amplitude [2].
Furthermore, the structure of massless four-point amplitudes is relatively simple because all

–1–

fermionic worldsheet variables contribute only through their zero modes. In the expressions
derived for the one-loop [2] and two-loop [4] amplitudes, supersymmetry was kept manifest
by expressing the kinematic factors as integrals over pure spinor superspace [5] involving
three pure spinors λ and five fermionic superspace coordinates θ,
K1-loop = (λA)(λγ m W )(λγ n W )Fmn ,
K2-loop = (λγ mnpqr λ)(λγ s W )Fmn Fpq Frs ,

(1.1)

where the pure spinor superspace integration is denoted by h. . . i, and Aα (x, θ), W α (x, θ)
and Fmn (x, θ) are the superfields of ten-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.
The kinematic factors in (1.1) have been explicitly evaluated for Neveu-Schwarz states
at two loops [6] and one loop [7], and were found to match the amplitudes derived in
the RNS formalism [8]. This provided important consistency checks in establishing the
validity of the pure spinor amplitude prescriptions. (Related one-loop calculations had
been reported in [9].)
In this paper, it will be shown how to compute the kinematic factors in (1.1) when
the superfields are allowed to contribute fermionic fields, as is relevant for the scattering
of fermionic closed string states as well as Ramond/Ramond bosons. It turns out that
the calculation of fermionic amplitudes presents no additional difficulties, making (1.1)
a good practical starting point for the computation of four-point loop amplitudes in a
unified fashion. This practical aspect of the supersymmetric pure spinor amplitudes was
also emphasised in [10], where the tree-level amplitudes were used to construct the fermion
and Ramond/Ramond form contributions to the four-point effective action of the type II
theories.
This paper is organised as follows. In section 2, different methods to compute pure
spinor superspace integrals are explored. These methods are then applied to the explicit
evaluation of the kinematic factors of massless four-point amplitudes at the one-loop level
in section 3, and at the two-loop level in section 4. In both these sections, the bosonic calculations are briefly reviewed before separately considering the cases of two and four Ramond
states. Particular attention will be paid to the constraints imposed by simple exchange
symmetries. An appendix contains algorithms which were used to reduce intermediate
expressions encountered in the amplitude calculations to a canonical form.

2. Zero mode integration
The calculation of scattering amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism leads to integrals over
zero modes of the fermionic worldsheet variables λ and θ. Both θ and λ are 16-component
Weyl spinors, the λ are commuting and the θ anticommuting, and λ is subject to the pure
spinor constraint (λγ m λ) = 0. The amplitude prescriptions [1, 2] require three zero modes
of λ and five zero modes of θ to be present, and a Lorentz covariant object
T̄ αβγ,δ1 ...δ5 ≡ λα λβ λγ θ δ1 . . . θ δ5 = T̄ (αβγ),[δ1 ...δ5 ]

(2.1)

was constructed such that the Yang-Mills antighost vertex operator
V = (λγ m θ)(λγ n θ)(λγ p θ)(θγmnp θ)

–2–

has

V = 1.

(2.2)

In this section, different methods of computing such "pure superspace integrals" are explored. As an example, a typical correlator encountered in the two-loop calculations of
section 4 is considered:
2 3 4
F (ki , ui ) = ka2 km
kp kr (λγ mnpq[r λ)(λγ s] u1 )(θγn ab θ)(θγb u2 )(θγq u3 )(θγs u4 )

(2.3)

Here, ki and ui are the momenta and spinor wavefunctions of the four external particles.
2.1 Symmetry considerations and tensorial formulae
One systematic approach to evaluate the zero mode integrals is to find expressions for all
tensors that can be formed from (2.1). By Fierz transformations, one can always write the
product of two θ spinors as (θγ [3] θ), where γ [k] denotes the antisymmetrised product of k
gamma matrices. Due to the pure spinor constraint, the only bilinear in λ is (λγ [5] λ), and
it is thus sufficient to consider the three cases
(λγ [5] λ)(λ{γ [1] or γ [3] or γ [5] }θ)(θγ [3] θ)(θγ [3] θ) .

(2.4)

Lorentz invariance then implies that it must be possible to express these tensors as sums of
suitably symmetrised products of metric tensors, resulting in a parity-even expression, plus
a parity-odd part made up from terms which in addition contain an epsilon tensor. The
parity-even parts may be constructed [6] starting from the most general ansatz compatible
with the symmetries of the correlator and then using spinor identities along with the
normalisation (2.2) to determine all coefficients in the ansatz. Duality properties of the
spinor bilinears can be used to determine the parity-odd part [7]. An extensive (and almost
exhaustive) list of correlators is found in [11], including the (λγ [1] θ) and (λγ [3] θ) cases of
the above list:

(Here, the brackets (f gh ↔ jkl) denote symmetrisation under simultaneous interchange of
f gh with ijk, with weight one.) The remaining correlator with the (λγ [5] θ) factor can be
derived in the same way, using an ansatz consisting of six parity-even structures. Taking
a trace between the two γ [5] factors and noting that
ηar (λγ mnpqr λ)(λγ abcde θ) . . . = −4 (λγ mnpq[b λ)(λγ cde] θ) . . . ,
one finds a relation to (2.6). This is sufficient to determine all coefficients in the ansatz,

One may find it surprising that the derivation of these tensorial expressions only made
use of properties of (pure) spinors, and of the normalisation condition (2.2). However, it
can be seen from representation theory that the correlator (2.1) is uniquely characterised,
up to normalisation, by its symmetry. To see this, note that [12] the spinor products λ3
and θ 5 transform in
λ(α λβ λγ) :
θ [δ1 . . . θ δ5 ] :

Sym3 S + = [00003] ⊕ [10001]

(2.8)

Alt5 S + = [00030] ⊕ [11010] .

(Here, λ and θ are taken to be in the S + irrep of SO(1,9), with Dynkin label [00001].) The
tensor product of these contains only one copy of the trivial representation. This applies
to any spinors λ, which means that the pure spinor property cannot be essential to the
derivation of the tensorial identities. The use of the pure spinor constraint merely allows
for simpler derivations of the same identities.
As an illustration of this approach, consider the correlator of eq. (2.3). Leaving the
2 k 3 k 4 F̃ , the task is to compute
momenta aside for the moment by setting F = ka2 km
p r
F̃ = (λγ mnpq[r λ)(λγ s] u1 )(θγn ab θ)(θγb u2 )(θγq u3 )(θγs u4 ) .

one obtains a combination of the fundamental correlators listed in (2.5), (2.6) and (2.7).
A reliable evaluation of the numerous index symmetrisations is made possible by the use of
a computer algebra program. In doing these calculations with Mathematica, an essential
tool is the GAMMA package [13], expanding the products of gamma matrices in a γ [k] basis.

2.2 A spinorial formula
While the derivation of tensorial identities for correlators of the form (2.4) is relatively
straightforward and elegant, it may be a tedious task to transform the expressions encountered in amplitude calculations to match this pattern. As seen in the example calculated
above, this is particularly true if additional spinors are involved, making it necessary to apply Fierz transformations. It is therefore desirable to use a covariant correlator expression
with open spinor indices. Such an expression was given in [1, 2]:
i

(2.15)
T̄ αβγ,δ1 ...δ5 = N −1 (γ m )αδ1 (γ n )βδ2 (γ p )γδ3 (γmnp )δ4 δ5
(αβγ)[δ1 ...δ5 ]

where N is a normalisation constant and the brackets ()[] denote (anti-)symmetrisation
with weight one. (Note that the right hand side is automatically gamma-matrix traceless:
any gamma-trace
(γ r )αβ × (γ m )α[δ1 | (γ n )β|δ2 | (γ p )γ|δ3 (γmnp )δ4 δ5 ] = −(γ mnr )[δ1 δ2 (γmnp )δ3 δ4 (γ p )δ5 ]γ = 0

vanishes due to the double-trace identity (γab θ)α (θγ abc θ) = 0, which follows from the
fact that the tensor product (Alt3 S + ) ⊗ S − does not contain a vector representation and
therefore the vector (ψγab θ)(θγ abc θ) has to vanish for all spinors ψ, and can also be shown
by applying a Fierz transformation.) This prescription was originally motivated [2] by the
fermionic expansion of the Yang-Mills antighost vertex operator V ,
V = Tαβγ,δ1 ...δ5 λα λβ λγ θ δ1 . . . θ δ5
with



–5–

(2.16)

where T is related to T̄ by a parity transformation, up to the overall constant N . (Seeing
that T̄ is uniquely determined by its symmetries, any covariant expression will be proportional to T̄ , after symmetrisation of the spinor indices, and this is merely the simplest
choice.)
Equation (2.15) immediately yields an algorithm to convert any correlator into traces
of gamma matrices or, if additional spinors are involved, bilinears in those spinors. It
is, however, already very tiresome to determine the normalisation constant N by hand.
The main advantage of this approach is that it clearly lends itself to implementation on
a computer algebra system, which can easily carry out the spinor index symmetrisations,
simplify the gamma products (again using the GAMMA package), and compute the traces.
For example,
h

N hV i = (γ m )αδ1 (γ n )βδ2 (γ p )γδ3 (γmnp )δ4 δ5

= 5160960 .
The correct normalisation is therefore obtained by setting N = 5160960.
Returning to the example correlator (2.3), one finds that the calculation is by far
simpler than with the previous method. After carrying out the symmetrisations (αβγ)[δi ],
one obtains
N F̃ =

which, in contrast to (2.10), contains no epsilon terms as there are not enough free indices
present. Note that this intermediate result contains terms with with u1 paired with u3
or u4 , so it is not possible to directly compare to eqs. (2.9) and (2.13). However, after
2 k 3 k 4 and decomposing the result in the basis B . . . B ,
contracting with the momenta ka2 km

in agreement with (2.14).
The algorithm just outlined will be the method of choice for all correlator calculations
in the later sections of this paper and can easily be applied to a wider range of problems.
The only limitation is that the larger the number of gamma matrices and open indices
of the correlator, the slower the computer evaluation will be. For example, the correlator
considered in eq. (5.2) of [11],

can still be verified with this method but this already requires substantial runtime.
2.3 Component-based approach
A third method to evaluate the zero mode integrals consists of choosing a gamma matrix
representation, expanding the integrand as a polynomial in spinor components, and then
applying (2.15) to the individual monomials. This procedure seems particularly appealing
if at some stage of the calculation one works with a matrix representation anyhow, in
order to reduce the results to a canonical form (e.g. as outlined in appendix A). An
efficient decomposition algorithm (of k4 u1 u2 u3 u4 scalars, say) only needs a few non-zero
momentum and spinor wavefunction components to distinguish all independent scalars, and
therefore k and u can be replaced by sparse vectors. Furthermore, a trivial observation
allows for a much quicker numeric evaluation of correlator components than a naive use
of (2.15): In view of (2.16), one can equivalently compute the components of the paritytransformed expression V̄ = (λ̄γ m θ̄)(λ̄γ n θ̄)(λ̄γ p θ̄)(θ̄γmnp θ̄), where λ̄ and θ̄ are spinors of
chirality opposite to that of λ, θ. In the representation given in appendix B, V̄ coincides
with V |λ→λ̄,θ→θ̄ , and
V = 192 λ9 λ9 λ9 θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 θ 9 + * * * + 480 λ1 λ2 λ3 θ 1 θ 9 θ 10 θ 13 θ 15 + . . .

(100352 terms)

The monomials in the fermionic expansion of V̄ then correspond to the arguments of
non-zero correlators, and the coefficients of those monomials are, up to normalisation and
symmetry factors, the correlator values.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the complexity of typical correlators (e.g. the one
given in (2.3)) makes it difficult to carry out the expansion in fermionic components in
any straightforward way and limits this method to special applications. For example, the
coefficients in (2.18) can be checked relatively easily by choosing particular index values,
such as
(λγ p γ 12 θ)(λγ q γ 21 θ)(λγ r γ 34 θ)(θγ 0 γ 0 γpqr γ 43 θ)
= 12 λ1 λ1 λ1 θ 1 θ 9 θ 10 θ 11 θ 12 + * * * + 12 λ16 λ16 λ16 θ 5 θ 6 θ 7 θ 8 θ 16 =

.

(For fixed values of pqr, one gets no more than about 105 monomials of the form λ3 θ 5 ).
This approach may thus still be helpful in situations where the result has been narrowed
down to a simple ansatz.

With this solution at hand, one has all ingredients to evaluate the kinematic factor (3.2)
for the three cases of zero, two, or four fermionic states.
3.1 Review: four bosons
The kinematic factor involving four bosons was considered in [7] and this calculation will
now be reviewed briefly. First, note that the outcome is not fixed by symmetry: The result
must be gauge invariant [2] and therefore expressible in terms of the field strengths F1 . . . F4 .
The cyclic symmetrisation in (3.2) yields expressions symmetric in F2 , F3 , F4 , and acting
on scalars constructed from the Fi only, the (234) symmetrisation is equivalent to complete
symmetrisation in all labels (1234). Thus the result must be a linear combination of the
two gauge invariant symmetric F 4 scalars, namely the single trace Tr(F(1 F2 F3 F4) ) and
double trace Tr(F(1 F2 ) Tr(F3 F4) ), leaving one relative coefficient to be determined.
Since all four states are of the same kind, one may first evaluate the correlator for one
labelling and then carry out the cyclic symmetrisation:

3.2 Four fermions
The four-fermion kinematic factor could be evaluated in the same way as in the four-boson
case by summing up all terms XABCD , A + B + C + D = 5, now with A, B, C even
and D odd. Note however that this time, the outcome is fixed by symmetry: The cyclic
symmetrisation in (3.2) leads to a completely antisymmetric dependence on u2 , u3 , u4 .
Acting on scalars of the form k2 u1 u2 u3 u4 , antisymmetrising over [234] is equivalent to
antisymmetrising over [1234], and there is only one completely antisymmetric k2 u1 u2 u3 u4
scalar. Without further calculation, one can infer that the kinematic factor is proportional
to that scalar,

3.3 Two bosons, two fermions
In evaluating (3.2) for two bosons and two fermions, the cyclic symmetrisations affect
whether the W and F superfields contribute bosons or fermions. Only the label of the Aα
superfield stays unaffected, and one has to choose whether it should contribute a boson
or a fermion. Since its fermionic expansion starts with the bosonic polarisation vector,
A1,α ∼ (/
ζ 1 θ)α , the calculation can be simplified by choosing a labelling where particle 1 is
a fermion. (Of course, the final result must be independent of this choice.) The assignment
of the other three labels is then irrelevant and will be chosen as f1 f2 b3 b4 . Writing out
the cyclic permutations, two of the three terms are essentially the same because they are
related by interchange of the labels 3 and 4. This interchange can be carried out after
computing the correlator, an operation which will be denoted by π34 . The kinematic factor
is then

While one expects the final result to be symmetric under exchange of 3 and 4, this is only
the case for the second line of this expression (note that the exchange of the two W(odd)
factors gives a sign from interchange of odd numbers of θ). The first line, on the other
hand, is manifestly antisymmetric and should therefore give zero. Even then, unlike in the
four-fermion calculation, the result is not fixed by symmetry. There are five independent
kF1 F2 u3 u4 scalars (see appendix A, eq. (A.6)), denoted by C1 . . . C5 , and there are two
independent combinations of these scalars with the required [12](34) symmetry.
Expanding the superfields and collecting terms with θ 5 , the first line yields a combination of terms XABCD with A, B, D odd and C even. There is only one θ 5 combination

(4.2)

The kinematic factors K12 , K13 , K14 are accompanied by the basic antisymmetric biholomorphic 1-form ∆, which is related to a canonical basis ω1 , ω2 of holomorphic differentials
via ∆ij = ∆(zi , zj ) = ω1 (zi )ω2 (zj ) − ω2 (zi )ω1 (zj ). The superfields Wiα and Fi,mn are the
spinor and vector field strengths of the i-th external state, as in section 3. One encounters
superspace integrals of the form
Y (abcd) = (λγ mnpqr λ)(λγ s Wa )Fb,mn Fc,pq Fd,rs .

(4.3)

The symmetries of the λ3 combination [4] in this correlator include the obvious symmetry
under mn ↔ pq, and also (λγ [mnpqr λ)(λγ s] )α = 0 (this holds for pure spinors λ and can be
seen by dualising, and holds for unconstrained spinors λ as part of a λ3 θ 5 scalar, as seen
from the representation content (2.8)), and allow one to shuffle the F factors:
Y (abcd) = Y (acbd) ,

Y (abcd) + Y (acdb) + Y (adbc) = 0 .

(4.4)

This applies also after expanding the superfields in powers of θ: Using the notation
D

YABCD (abcd) = (λγ mnpqr λ)(λγ s Wa(A) )Fb,mn Fc,pq

one obtains the identities

YABCD (abcd) = (−)BC+BD+1 YACDB (acdb) + (−)BD+CD+1 YADBC (adbc) ,
where the signs arise from the exchange of fermions.

4.1 Review: four bosons
The case of four Neveu-Schwarz states was considered in [6] and will be briefly reviewed
here. As all three kinematic factors K12 , K13 and K14 are equivalent, it is sufficient to
consider K12 in detail. With all external states being identical, the symmetrisations of
(4.1) can be carried out at the end of the calculation:
4B

− 4 W[3 F4] F[1 F2]

4B

= (1 − π12 )(1 − π34 )(1 + π13 π24 ) W1 F2 F3 F4

4B

Expanding the superfields, the Neveu-Schwarz states come from terms of the form YABCD ≡
YABCD (1234) with A odd and B, C, D even. Using the shuffling identities (4.5) to simplify,
one obtains
W1 F2 F3 F4

4B

It is worth noting at this point that, on the sixteen-dimensional space of Lorentz scalars
built from the four field strengths Fi and two momenta, the symmetriser S4B has rank four.
The correlators were computed in [6], using the method outlined in section 2.1. Two are
zero, Y5000 = Y1400 = 0, and the remaining ones are

In reducing those two contributions to a set of independent scalars, one finds that they
both are not just sums of (k * k)F 4 terms but also contain terms of the form k * F terms.
The latter are projected out by the symmetriser S4B , and the result is

4.2 Four fermions
The calculation involving four Ramond states is very similar to the bosonic one. Focussing
on the K12 part, the symmetrisations in (4.1) can again be rewritten as action of symmetrisation operators on the correlator of superfields with one particular labelling:
4F
K12
= (1 − π12 )(1 − π34 )(1 + π13 π24 ) W1 F2 F3 F4

= 4(1 − π12 ) W1 F2 F3 F4

4F

4F

The last step follows from the fact that all k4 u4 scalars (see appendix A.2) are invariant
under π13 π24 and have π12 = π34 . This time, on expanding the superfields, one collects the
terms YABCD with A even and B, C, D odd. After using (4.4) to simplify,
W1 F2 F3 F4

4F

= Y2111 + Y0311 + Y0131 + Y0113


+ Y0311 ,

S4F = 4(1 − π12 )(1 − π23 )(1 + π24 ) .

This symmetriser has rank three, and the result is again not determined by symmetry.
Two correlators have to be computed:
2 3 4
Y2111 = (−2)ka1 km
kp kr (λγ mnpq[r λ)(λγ s] γ ab θ)(θγb u1 )(θγn u2 )(θγq u3 )(θγs u4 )

Y0311 = (− 32 )ka2 km
kp kr (λγ mnpq[r λ)(λγ s] u1 )(θγn ab θ)(θγb u2 )(θγq u3 )(θγs u4 )

With four fermions present, the method of section 2.2 is preferred as it does not involve rearranging the fermions using Fierz identities. The first correlator was covered as an example
in that section, and the second one can be evaluated in the same fashion. Expressed in the
basis listed in (A.5), the results are
Y2111 =

5. Discussion
In this paper, different methods were discussed to efficiently evaluate the superspace integrals appearing in multiloop amplitudes derived in the pure spinor formalism. Extending
previous calculations [6, 7] restricted to Neveu-Schwarz states, it was then shown how
the treatment of Ramond states poses no additional difficulties. It was seen that simple
exchange symmmetries completely determine the kinematic factor of the one-loop fourfermion amplitude, and are sufficient to derive the two-boson/two-fermion two-loop kinematic factor starting from symmetry properties of the corresponding pure spinor integral.
While the bosonic calculations of [6, 7] have, in conjunction with supersymmetry,
already established the equivalence of the massless four-point amplitudes derived in the
pure spinor and RNS formalisms, it would be interesting to make contact between the
results of sections 4.2 / 4.3 and two-loop amplitudes involving Ramond states as computed
in the RNS formalism (see for example [18]).
The assistance of a computer algebra system seems indispensible in explicitly evaluating pure spinor superspace integrals. To avoid excessive use of custom-made algorithms,
it would be desirable to implement these calculations in a wider computational framework
particular adapted to field theory calculations [19].
The methods outlined in this paper should be easily applicable to future higher-loop
amplitude expressions derived from the pure spinor formalism, and, it is hoped, to other
superspace integrals.

A. Reduction to kinematic bases
In calculating scattering amplitudes one encounters kinematic factors which are Lorentz
invariant polynomials in the momenta, polarisations and/or spinor wavefunctions of the
scattered particles. It can be a non-trivial task to simplify such expressions, taking into
P
account the on-shell identities i ki = 0, ki2 = 0, ki * ζi = 0, k/i ui = 0, and, in the case of
fermions, re-arrangements stemming from Fierz identities.
More generally, one would like to know how many independent combinations of some
given fields (subject to on-shell identitites) there are, and how to reduce an arbitrary expression with respect to some chosen basis. This appendix outlines methods to address these
problems, with an emphasis on algorithms which can easily be transferred to a computer
algebra system. These methods are not limited to dealing with pure spinor calculations
but the scope will be restricted to amplitudes of four massless vector or spinor particles in
ten dimensions.
A.1 Four bosons
It is not difficult to reduce polynomials in the momenta and polarisations to a canonical
P
form. The momentum conservation constraint
i ki = 0 is solved by eliminating one
2
momentum (for example k4 ), all ki are set to zero, and one of the two remaining quadratic
combinations of momenta is eliminated (for example s23 → −s12 − s13 , where sij ≡ ki * kk ).
Then all products ki * ζi are set to zero, and one extra k * ζ product is replaced (when
eliminating k4 , the replacement is k3 * ζ4 → (−k1 − k2 ) * ζ4 ). The remaining monomials are
then independent. (This is at least the case with the low powers of momenta encountered
in the calculations of sections 3 and 4, where there are enough spatial directions for all
momenta/polarisations to be linearly independent.)
The implementation of these reduction rules on a computer is straightforward. The
easiest way to obtain scalars which are also invariant under the gauge symmetry ki → ζi
[a b]
is to start with expressions constructed from the field strengths Fiab = 2ki ζi . For the
one-loop calculations of section 3.1, the relevant basis consists of gauge invariant scalars
containing only the four field strengths F1 . . . F4 . One finds six independent combinations,
Tr(F1 F2 F3 F4 )

Tr(F1 F2 ) Tr(F3 F4 )

Tr(F1 F2 F4 F3 )

Tr(F1 F3 ) Tr(F2 F4 )

Tr(F1 F3 F2 F4 )

Tr(F1 F4 ) Tr(F2 F3 )

In the two-loop calculations of section 4.1, all monomials have two more momenta. There
are sixteen independent gauge invariant scalars of the form kkF1 F2 F3 F4 , and twelve of
them may be constructed from the previous basis by multiplication with s12 and s13 :
A1 = s12 Tr(F1 F2 F3 F4 ), A2 = s13 Tr(F1 F2 F3 F4 ), etc. One choice for the additional four is
A13 = k3 * F1 * F2 * k3 Tr(F3 F4 )

A14 = k4 * F1 * F3 * k2 Tr(F2 F4 )

A15 = k3 * F1 * F4 * k2 Tr(F2 F3 )

A16 = k4 * F2 * F3 * k4 Tr(F1 F4 ) .

As an example application of the computer algorithms, one may check that the symmetrisation operator of section 4.1,
S4B = (1 − π12 )(1 − π34 )(1 + π13 π24 )(1 + π23 )(1 − π24 ) ,
acts as
S4B A1 = 8A1 + 4A2 − 4A3 + 4A4 + 8A5 + 16A6
...

S4B A16 = −6A1 + 6A3 − 6A5 − 12A6 + 32 A7 + 3A8 + 23 A9 + 3A10 + 23 A11 + 3A12
and has rank four.
A.2 Four fermions
In dealing with the spinor wavefunctions ui one has to face two issues: Fierz identities, and
the Dirac equation. Fierz identities not only allow one to change the order of the spinors
but also give rise to relations between different expressions in one spinor order. The Dirac
equation often simplifies terms with momenta contracted into (ui γ [n] uj ) bilinears.
In this section it is shown how to construct bases for terms of the form (k2 or k4 ) ×
u1 u2 u3 u4 . A significant simplification comes from noting that the Dirac equation allows
one to rewrite (ui γ [n] uj ) bilinears into terms with lower n if more than one momentum is
contracted into the γ [n] . A good first step is therefore to disregard the momenta temporarily
and find all independent scalars and two-index tensors built from u1 , . . . , u4 . From the
SO(10) representation content,
(S + )⊗4 = 2 * 1 + 6 *

+ 3 * f + (tensors with rank > 2) ,

one expects two scalars and nine 2-tensors. The scalars are easily found by considering, as
in [20],
T1 (1234) = (u1 γ a u2 )(u3 γa u4 ) ,
T3 (1234) = (u1 γ abc u2 )(u3 γabc u4 ) .
and similarly for the other two inequivalent orders of the four spinors. (Note there is no T5
because of self-duality of the γ [5] .) From Fierz transformations, one learns that all T3 terms
can be reduced to T1 by T3 (1234) = −12T1 (1234) − 24T1 (1324) and permutations, and the
identity (γa )(αβ (γ a )γ)δ = 0 implies that T1 (1234) + T1 (1324) + T1 (1423) = 0, leaving for
example T1 (1234) and T1 (1324) as independent scalars.
Generalising this approach to two-index tensors, it turns out that it is sufficient to
start with
T11 (1234) = (u1 γ m u2 )(u3 γ n u4 ) ,
T31 (1234) = (u1 γ a γ m γ n u2 )(u3 γa u4 ) ,
T33 (1234) = (u1 γ ab γ m u2 )(u3 γab γ n u4 ) ,

– 18 –

and permutations of the spinor labels. It would be very tiresome to systematically apply
a variety of Fierz transformations by hand and to find an independent set. Fortunately,
by choosing a gamma matrix representation (such as the one listed in appendix B) and
reducing all expressions to polynomials in the independent spinor components u1i , . . . , u16
i ,
this problem can be solved with computer help. As expected, one finds that the Tij (abcd)
span a nine-dimensional space, and a basis can be chosen as
T11 (1234), T11 (1324), T11 (1423), T11 (3412), T11 (2413), T11 (2314),
T31 (1234), T31 (1324), T31 (2314) . (A.1)
A typical relation reducing the other Tij (abcd) to this basis is
T31 (3412) = 2T11 (1234) − 2T11 (3412) + T31 (1324) + T31 (3412) + 2ηmn T1 (1234) .

(A.2)

Having solved the first step, it is now easy to include the two or four momenta, taking
the Dirac equation into account. Consider first the case of two momenta. Starting from
the two-tensors in (A.1), one gets the three independent scalars
(u1 k/3 u2 )(u3 k/1 u4 ) ,

(u1 k/2 u3 )(u2 k/1 u4 ) ,

(u1 k/2 u4 )(u2 k/1 u3 ) .

In addition, there are four products of the two independent scalars T1 (1234) and T1 (1324)
with the two independent momentum invariants s12 and s13 . By contracting (A.2) with
momenta, one can show that
s12 T1 (1324) − s13 T1 (1234)

= −(u1 k/3 u2 )(u3 k/1 u4 ) + (u1 k/2 u3 )(u2 k/1 u4 ) − (u1 k/2 u4 )(u2 k/1 u3 ) , (A.3)

and this relation can be used to eliminate s12 T1 (1324). (It will become clear later that
there are no independent other relations like this one.) There are thus six independent
k2 u1 * * * u4 scalars:
(u1 k/3 u2 )(u3 k/1 u4 )

s12 T1 (1234)

(u1 k/2 u3 )(u2 k/1 u4 )

s13 T1 (1234)

(u1 k/2 u4 )(u2 k/1 u3 )

s13 T1 (1324)

(A.4)

Note that there is only one completely antisymmetric combination of those, given by the
right hand side of (A.3). Similarly, in the case of four momenta, one finds ten independent
k4 u1 * * * u4 scalars:
B1 = s12 (u1 k/3 u2 )(u3 k/1 u4 )

B2 = s13 (u1 k/3 u2 )(u3 k/1 u4 )

B3 = s12 (u1 k/2 u3 )(u2 k/1 u4 )

B4 = s13 (u1 k/2 u3 )(u2 k/1 u4 )

B5 = s12 (u1 k/2 u4 )(u2 k/1 u3 )

B6 = s13 (u1 k/2 u4 )(u2 k/1 u3 )

B7 =
B9 =

s212 T1 (1234)
s213 T1 (1234)

B8 = s12 s13 T1 (1234)
B10 = s213 T1 (1324)

(A.5)

Working in a gamma matrix representation, it is again simple to construct a computer
algorithm which reduces any given k2 u1 * * * u4 or k4 u1 * * * u4 scalar into polynomials of the
spinor and momentum components. The Dirac equation can then be solved by breaking
up the sixteen-component spinors ui into eight-dimensional chiral spinors usi and uci , as in
eq. (B.1). One obtains polynomials in the momentum components kia and the independent
spinor components (uci )1...8 . However, a great disadvantage of this procedure is that it
breaks manifest Lorentz invariance. For example, one encounters expressions which contain
subsets of terms proportional to the square of a single momentum and are therefore equal
to zero, but it is difficult to recognise this with a simple algorithm. The easiest solution
P
is to choose several sets of particular vectors ki satisfying ki2 = 0 and i ki = 0 and to
evaluate all expressions on these vectors. (By choosing integer arithmetic, one easily avoids
issues of numerical accuracy.) Substituting these sets of momentum vectors in the bases
(A.4) and (A.5) gives full rank six and ten respectively, showing they are indeed linearly
independent.
Equipped with a computer algorithm for these basis decompositions, one finds that
the symmetriser S4F of section 4.2,
S4F = 4(1 − π12 )(1 − π23 )(1 + π24 ) ,
acts on the B1 . . . B10 basis as
S4F B1 = 8B1 + 4B4 + 4B5 + 4B6 ,
...

S4F B10 = −8B1 − 16B2 + 8B3 + 16B4 − 8B5 − 16B6 + 8B7 + 24B8 + 24B9 + 16B10
and has rank three.
A.3 Two bosons, two fermions
The combined methods of the last two sections can easily be extended to the mixed case
of two bosons and two fermions. In the one-loop calculation of section 3.3, one encounters
scalars of the form ku1 u2 F3 F4 . A basis of such objects is given by
3 4
C1 = (u1 γ a u2 )ka3 Fbc
Fbc

C2 = (u1 γ a u2 )Fab

There are two combinations antisymmetric in [12] and symmetric in (34):
−C1 + 4C2 + C4

and

C2 + C3 .

Finally, there are ten independent scalars of the form k3 u1 u2 F3 F4 (relevant to the two-loop
calculation of section 4.3), and they can all be obtained by multiplication of C1 . . . C5 with
the two momentum invariants s12 and s13 .

a = 1...8,
(γ a )αβ =

as given in appendix 5.B of [20]. The matrices Γa satisfy the SO(1,9) Clifford algebra
relations,
{Γa , Γb } = 2η ab 132 ,
η ab = (+ − − * * * −) ,
and bilinears of chiral spinors (with, say, positive chirality) are constructed as
(uΓ[a1 ...ak ] v) = (uγ [a1 ...ak ] v) = uα (γ [a1 )αβ (γ a2 )βγ . . . (γ ak ] )γδ v δ .
This representation is particularly suitable for the calculations outlined in appendix A
because it allows a simple decomposition of SO(1,9) spinors into SO(8) spinors due to its
block structure:


Therefore, the Dirac equation for a chiral 16-component spinor u,
(γ a )αβ ∂a uα = 0 ,

can be solved by splitting u into two chiral eight-component spinors of SO(8),
