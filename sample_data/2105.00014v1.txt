Abstract
We consider the decay of the false vacuum, realised within a quantum quench into
an anti-confining regime of the Ising spin chain with a magnetic field opposite to the
initial magnetisation. Although the effective linear potential between the domain walls
is repulsive, the time evolution of correlations still shows a suppression of the light cone
and a reduction of vacuum decay. The suppressed decay is a lattice effect, and can be
assigned to emergent Bloch oscillations.

Introduction

Quantum quenches, i.e., sudden changes in a system's Hamiltonian [1,2] provide a paradigmatic
protocol to study non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and relaxation in by now routinely engineered closed quantum systems [3‚Äì10]. In global, translationally invariant quantum quenches,
the initial state has a finite uniform energy density with respect to the post-quench Hamiltonian, and the system is therefore in a highly excited state. This highly excited configuration
acts as a source of quasi-particle excitations, which may collide and thermalize with time. Indeed, within a semi-classical picture [1], these quasi-particle excitations drive equilibration by
spreading correlation and entanglement across the system.
In a large class of systems, including various spin chains with short-range interactions, or
interacting bosonic or fermionic systems, quasi-particles have an upper bound on their velocity [11], leading typically to a distinctive light-cone pattern in time dependent correlation
functions [1, 2, 12‚Äì17]. This behavior is, however, not completely generic: confining forces, as a
remarkable exception, can suppress the light-cone spreading of correlations [18]. The prediction
of dynamical confinement has indeed been confirmed recently in numerous systems and settings
exhibiting confinement [19‚Äì28].
Dynamical confinement [18] has originally been observed in the ferromagnetic phase (g < 1)

Dynamical confinement occurs while initializing the system in its g0 < 1 positive (spontaneous)
magnetisation ground state with m = hœÉiz i > 0 and h0 = 0, and then quenching to a Hamiltonian with some g < 1 and h > 0. In this case, the quench gives rise to oppositely moving
domain walls (kink-antikink pairs), with a 'bubble' of negative magnetisation ‚àím stretched
between them (see Fig. 1.1). With the magnetic field being turned on in the opposite direction,
these bubbles are filled with the 'false vacuum', and cost therefore a potential energy that is
proportional to the distance between domain walls. The corresponding confining force [29] inhibits the propagation of particles to large distances, and prevents thermalisation of the system
within all time scales accessible to numerical simulations.
It is intriguing to ask what happens if we switch on a field h < 0. In this case, the initial
state becomes the 'false vacuum', and the interior of the bubble is filled with the 'true vacuum'.
Therefore, the external field promotes the expansion of bubbles, and generates a repulsive force
between the domain walls, as illustrated in Fig. 1.1. In quantum field theory, this corresponds to
a scenario proposed by Coleman, known as the decay of the false vacuum [30,31]: the expansion
of the bubbles should rapidly accelerate to a maximal velocity, and the true vacuum should
fill the entire space. Coleman's scenario would thus imply in our case that the bubbles should
extend to the whole spin chain, which should rapidly relax to an equilibrium or steady state
around the true vacuum.
Here we show that Coleman's scenario is violated in the Ising spin chain. The dynamics of
spin-spin correlation function clearly indicate that bubbles do not expand infinitely. Rather, the
repulsive force leads to an oscillatory motion of the domain walls, known as Bloch oscillations.
These findings are corroborated by recent numerical studies of the order parameter statistics
in the quantum Ising spin chain [32].

2.1

Dynamics in the anti-confining regime
Quench setup and subsequent time evolution

As discussed in the introduction, we consider quantum quenches in the ferromagnetic phase.
For simplicity, we start the quench from a fully aligned, positively polarised state, i.e. from the
ground state with g0 = 0 and h0 = 0. We then quench to a finite transverse field, g < 1, and
an "anti-confining" longitudinal field h < 0. Turning on a finite g0 ‚Üí g > 0 creates a gas of
domain wall excitations, which then move in the presence of the field h < 0.
The time evolution is numerically simulated using the infinite volume time evolving block
decimation (iTEBD) method [33], which we also use to compute the time evolution of the
connected two-point equal time spin correlation function
Cz (l, t) ‚â° hœÉ0z (t)œÉlz (t)ic = hœÉ0z (t)œÉlz (t)i ‚àí hœÉ0z (t)i hœÉlz (t)i .

(2.1)

As shown in Fig. 2.1, at a first sight, the time evolution of Cz (l, t) is remarkably similar for
an anti-confining field, h < 0, to the one obtained in the dynamical confinement region, h > 0,
studied in [18]: in both cases, the light-cone propagation of correlations is suppressed, and
oscillations are observed.
Closer examination of the simulation results discerns, however, some important differences
between the two cases. While correlations have an oscillatory behavior in both cases, the
corresponding frequencies and amplitudes are quite different. As discussed in Ref. [18], in the
confining case h > 0 the frequencies of oscillations scale with h2/3 and correspond to bound

states of domain walls called"mesons". In contrast, for the anti-confining case the characteristic
frequency scales with h, as shown explicitly by the quench spectroscopy discussed in Subsection
2.4.

2.2

Bloch oscillations

As already stated, oscillations observed for h < 0 can be interpreted as Bloch oscillations.
They are related to the lattice structure of the model, and can be easily understood within
a semi-classical picture. Consider first a pure transverse field quench with h = 0 and g >
0. The post-quench state then consists of independent kink-antikink pairs with momenta k
andp‚àík. These kinks behave as non-interacting fermions with a dispersion relation, (k) =
2J 1 + g 2 ‚àí 2g cos k, and propagate with the group velocity
v(k) =

‚àÇ(k)
,
‚àÇk

(2.2)

limited by the maximum velocity, vmax = 2J g. The initial density of kinks can be determined
following Refs. [15, 34]. Kink-antikink pairs of momentum ¬±k are created with a pair creation
amplitude, K(k) = tan ‚àÜk /2, with

Bloch oscillations arise due to the finite longitudinal field, h < 0, ignored so far. To a
first approximation, we can neglect the correction to the dispersion relation (k), and treat the
4

dynamics of the bubbles as that of a two-particle system, a kink and an antikink interacting
via a repulsive potential

(2.6)
where r is the distance between the kinks, and œá the coefficient given by the energy gain of

flipping the magnetisation into the external field's direction: œá = 2m|h| = 2|h| (1 ‚àí g 2 ) . The
semi-classical equation of motion of the kinks is then written as

with the factors 2 and 1/2 related to having two mobile kinks. The second equation yields
immediately k(t) = k0 + 12 œát , and can be used to determine the kink-antikink distance as
4
[ (k0 + œá t/2) ‚àí  (k0 )] + r0 ,
(2.8)
œá
with r0 initial size of the bubble (typically of the order of the lattice spacing), and ¬±k0 the
initial momenta of the kinks. Due to the periodicity of (k), the kink velocity reverses sign when
the momentum k passes the boundary of the Brillouin zone at k = ¬±œÄ, where the kinks turn
back. As a result, kinks return to their original position and collide again after a period T (k0 )
when the bubble re-collapses (r(T (k0 )) ‚âà 0). This happens when k0 + œá T (k0 )/2 = 2œÄ ‚àí k0 .
At this point, the kink and the antikink are reflected, and start off again with the whole cycle
repeating as illustrated in Fig. 2.3, causing the bubbles oscillate in time.
In contrast to the idealised single-bubble dynamics shown in Fig. 2.3, the observed oscillations shown on the left of Fig. 2.1 result from a large number of bubbles, each having different
initial momenta and initial sizes. Nevertheless, these Bloch oscillations still have a characteristic time. As obvious from Fig. 2.2, (and can be indeed verified by direct calculation, for an
initial state with g0 = 0) the kink density is highest around momenta corresponding to vmax ,
which determines the front line of the bubbles, and thus the overall frequency of oscillations
via the condition, 12 œá TB = 2k0 ‚âà œÄ for small g-s, yielding
r(t) =

TB
The presence of a distribution of domain wall momenta leads, however, to a gradual decay
of oscillations due to the dependence of the oscillation period and phase on the initial kink
momentum. Bubble collisions have a similar, degrading effect on coherent oscillations.
We close this subsection with two interesting observations regarding oscillation decay and
collisions:
œâ‚âà

‚Ä¢ Kink-antikink pairs collide once during every oscillation period. They could, in principle,
annihilate into mesons then; however our numerics shows no such effect in the accessible
time frame, which is consistent with recent findings [35] that the inelastic scattering is
very ineffective.
These collisions also give rise to a time delay due to the interaction between kinks. In
the case of zero longitudinal field, h = 0, however, the kink-antikink scattering amplitude
is simply ‚àí1, and there is no time delay. Therefore any time delay introduced by kink
collisions is of order h, which we can neglect in the simple semi-classical picture used here.
‚Ä¢ Collisions between different bubbles lead to interactions between bubbles, leading to corrections to the simple motion described above. This effect can be neglected if the average
spacing between bubbles is larger than their maximum allowed size, which leads to the
condition œÅbubble ‚àí1  2(œÄ)/œá. This requires the longitudinal field to be larger than some
minimum value, which can be computed as a function of g and turns out to be much
smaller than the fields used in our simulations, where the smallest field was |h| = 0.05.

Verifying average bubble size and scaling

One piece of evidence for the suggested scenario is that it predicts an average bubble size that
agrees reasonably well with the spatial extension of the correlations. This is demonstrated in
Figure 2.1, where the red lines depict the estimate for the average bubble size

since, in this latter case, kink momenta oscillate between k0 and 0. Note that these estimates depend both on g and h, and give a very good estimate for the spatial extension of the
correlations shown in Figure 2.1.
Another tell-tale signal of Bloch oscillations is that their spatial extension is predicted to
scale as ‚àº 1/h, while their frequency is proportional to h. This is manifest in the numerically
computed time evolution, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.4, where the space-time bubble contour is
extracted from the data at h = ‚àí0.1 and then superimposed on the time evolution obtained
for other h values, with time and space rescaled accordingly. Note that the actual distance
and time scales vary by a factor of 4, while the correlation profiles remain almost identical
when plotted in terms of the scaled variables, |h|t and |h|l. This scaling works remarkably well
for the first few oscillations. Later differences can be attributed to deviations from our simple
semi-classical picture such as the presence of localised spin excitations with frequencies much
higher than the Bloch oscillations of the bubble walls, as well as distortions due to bubble
collisions and the contributions from the periodic kink collisions when bubbles shrink to their
minimal size.

Quench spectroscopy

'Quench spectroscopy', presented in Fig. 2.5, i.e. the Fourier analysis of the time evolution
after the quench provides a further tool to assess Bloch oscillations. For small values of |h|, we

|h|.
only observe frequency peaks corresponding to mesonic bound states. The energy gap of these
mesonic excitations is always larger than twice the kink gap, grows with increasing |h|, and can
also be computed theoretically using a semi-classical method [18, 36]. For small quench fields,
we do not observe Bloch oscillations. This is not unexpected, since the bubbles are large, and
collide with each other before their oscillation could be observed.
For larger field values, however, mesons are harder to create, and bubble collisions become
less frequent. We therefore expect and indeed find that mesonic contributions to the frequency
spectrum become less and less pronounced with growing |h|, while at the same time another set
of regularly spaced frequency peaks emerges well below the threshold of mesonic excitations.
Due to the dependence of their period on the initial kink momentum k0 , the Bloch oscillations do not in general have a well-defined frequency. Nevertheless, as explained above, we
still expect to see a strong feature at the characteristic frequency, œâ = œá. Furthermore, since
Bloch oscillations are non-harmonic, the frequency spectrum is expected to contain a regular
sequence of higher harmonics. Indeed, such a series of peaks is seen to coincide with the red
lines in Fig. 2.5, with the distance between them equal to œá. Note that the simulation can
only capture higher harmonics, mostly due to the finite time window of the numerical simulations, but also due to low-frequency background which results from the quench time evolution
containing frequencies corresponding to all differences between energy levels of the post-quench
Hamiltonian.

Conclusions

As we demonstrated in this work within the transverse field Ising model, light-cone time evolution and the decay of the false vacuum can be absent in one-dimensional systems even in
a deconfined quench regime, where the formation of bubbles would be energetically favorable.
Rather, quite unexpectedly, we observe in this regime spatially confined correlations, oscillating
in time. We identify these as Bloch oscillations. These appear due to the underlying lattice
and the periodicity of the quasiparticles' dispersion relation in the momentum variable. Our
observations are in agreement with recent results obtained in kinetically constrained Rydberg
spin systems [37]. However, while in Ref. [37] a special constraint (fine-tuning) was needed
to generate Bloch oscillations, here they emerge quite generically, without any constraint in
a regime where quasi-particle excitations would naively be expected to speed up and spread
correlations over the system.
Our results are relevant for experimental realisations of the tunneling decay of the false
vacuum such as put forward in Ref. [38]. We predict that in discrete spin chains, the dynamics
after bubble nucleation lead to Bloch oscillations in general, in stark contrast to expectations
from continuum quantum field theories. Our results also demonstrate that simple spin chains
provide an experimental realisation of Bloch oscillations, which can clearly be identified from the
scaling of the space-time dependent spin-spin correlation functions with the applied longitudinal
field.
