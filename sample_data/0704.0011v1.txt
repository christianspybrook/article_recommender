HILBERT-SIEGEL MODULAR FORMS OVER Q( 5)
CLIFTON CUNNINGHAM AND LASSINA DEMBÉLÉ
Abstract. In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke
eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of
narrow class number
√ one. We give some illustrative examples using the
quadratic field Q( 5). In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel
eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.

Introduction
Let F be a real quadratic field of narrow class number one and let B be the
unique (up to isomorphism) quaternion algebra over F which is ramified at
both archimedean places of F and unramified everywhere else. Let GU2 (B)
be the unitary similitude group of B ⊕2 . This is the set of Q-rational points
of an algebraic group GB defined over Q. The group GB is an inner form of
G := ResF/Q (GSp4 ) such that GB (R) is compact modulo its centre.
In this paper we develop an algorithm which computes automorphic forms
on GB in the following sense: given an ideal N in OF and an integer k greater
than 3, the algorithm returns the Hecke eigensystems of all automorphic
forms f of level N and parallel weight k. More precisely, given a prime p in
OF , the algorithm returns the Hecke eigenvalues of f at p, and hence the
Euler factor Lp(f, s), for each eigenform f of level N and parallel weight k.
The algorithm is a generalization of the one developed in [D1 2005] to the
genus 2 case. Although we have only described the algorithm in the case of
a real quadratic field in this paper, it should be clear from our presentation
that it can be adapted to any totally real number field of narrow class
number one. And so, it can be seen as a slight improvement of Lansky and
Pollack [LP 2002].
The Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence predicts the existence of a transfer map JL : Π(GB ) → Π(G) from automorphic representations of GB to
automorphic representations on G, which is injective, matches L-functions
and enjoys other properties compatible with the principle of functoriality;
in particular, the image of the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence is to be

contained in the space of holomorphic automorphic representations. If we
admit this conjecture, then the algorithm above provides a way to produce
examples of cuspidal Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of genus 2 over F and
allows us to compute the L-factors of the corresponding automorphic representations for arbitrary finite primes p of F .
In order to support the claim that we are in fact computing HilbertSiegel modular forms, we must compare the Euler factors we find with those
of known Hilbert-Siegel modular forms. This we do in the final section of the
paper where we observe that, in certain cases, the Euler factors we compute
match those of lifts of Hilbert modular forms, for the primes we computed.
The first systematic approach to Siegel modular forms from a computational viewpoint is due to Skoruppa [S 1992] who used Jacobi symbols
to generate spaces of such forms. His algorithm, which has been extensively exploited by Ryan [R 2006], works only for the full level structure.
More recently, Faber and van der Geer [FvdG1 2004] and [FvdG2 2004] also
produced examples of Siegel modular forms by counting points on hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, but again their results are available only in the
full level structure case. The most substantial progress toward the computation of Siegel modular forms for proper level structure is by Gunnells
[Gu 2000] who extended the theory of modular symbols to the symplectic
group Sp4 /Q. However, this work does not see the cuspidal cohomology
which is relevant to us. To the best of our knowledge, there are no numerical examples of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms for proper level structure in
the literature, with the exception of those produced from liftings of Hilbert
modular forms.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we recall the basic
properties of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms and algebraic automorphic forms
together with the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence. In Section 2 we give
a detailed description of our algorithm. Finally,
in Section 3 we present
√
numerical results for the quadratic field Q( 5).

1. Hilbert-Siegel modular forms and the Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence
Throughout this paper, F denotes a real quadratic field of narrow class
number one. The two archimedean places of F and the real embeddings of
F will both be denoted v0 and v1 . For every a ∈ F , we write a0 (resp. a1 )

for the image of a under v0 (resp. v1 ). The ring of integers of F is denoted
by OF . For every prime ideal p in OF , the completion of F and OF at p
will be denoted by Fp and OFp , respectively.
Let B be the unique (up to isomorphism) totally definite quaternion algebra over F which is unramified at all finite primes of F . We fix a maximal
order OB of B. Also, we choose a splitting field K/F of B that is Galois over Q and such that there exists an isomorphism j : OB ⊗Z OK ∼
=
M2 (OK ) ⊕ M2 (OK ), where M2 (A) denotes the ring of 2 × 2-matrices with
entries from a ring A. For every finite prime p in F , we fix an isomorphism
Bp ∼
= M2 (Fp) which restricts to an isomorphism from OB, p onto M2 (OFp ).
We denote the finite adèles of Q (resp. Z) by Q̂ (resp. Ẑ), and for any
Q-algebra (resp. Z-algebra) A, we set Â := A ⊗Q Q̂ (resp. Â := A ⊗Z Ẑ).
Recall that the algebraic group G = ResF/Q (GSp4 ) is defined as follows.
For any Q-algebra A, the set of A-rational points is given by

Now, for any Q-algebra A, the conjugation on B extends in a natural way
to the matrix algebra M2 (B ⊗Q A). The algebraic group GB /Q is defined

The group GB /Q is an inner form of G/Q such that GB (R) is compact
modulo its center. By the choice of the quaternion algebra B, we have
GB (Q̂) ∼
= G(Q̂). Also, combining the isomorphism j with conjugation by a
permutation matrix, we obtain an isomorphism GB (OK ) ∼
= G(OK ), which
we fix from now on.

1.1. Hilbert-Siegel modular forms. We fix an integer k ≥ 3 and, for
simplicity, we restrict ourselves to Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of parallel
weight k. The real embeddings v0 and v1 of F extend to G(Q) = GSp4 (F )
in a natural way. We denote by GSp+
4 (F ) the subgroup of elements γ

A Hilbert-Siegel modular form of level N and parallel weight k is a
holomorphic function f : H22 → C such that
∀γ ∈ Γ0 (N ),

f |k γ = f.

The space of Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of parallel weight k and level N
is denoted Mk (N ). Each f ∈ Mk (N ) admits a Fourier expansion, which by
the Koecher principle takes the form

f (τ ) =
aQ e2πiTr(Qτ ) ,

where Q ∈ M2 (F ) runs over all symmetric totally positive and semi-definite
matrices. A Hilbert-Siegel modular forms f is a cusp form if, for all γ ∈
GSp+
4 (F ), the first coefficient in the Fourier expansion of f |k γ is zero. The
space of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms is denoted Sk (N ).
1.2. The Hecke algebra. The space Sk (N ) comes equipped with a Hecke
action, which we now recall. Take u ∈ GSp+

finite disjoint union

respectively. The Hecke algebra Tk (N ) is the Z-algebra generated by the
operators T1 (p) and T2 (p), where p runs over all primes not dividing N .
1.3. Algebraic Hilbert-Siegel autormorphic forms. We only consider
level structure of Siegel type. Namely, we define the compact open subgroup

The weight representation is defined as follows. Let Lk be the representation of GSp4 (C) of highest weight (k − 3, k − 3). We let Vk = Lk ⊗ Lk
and define the complex representation (ρk , Vk ) by
ρk : GB (R) −→ GL(Vk ),
where the action on the first factor is via v0 , and the action on the second
one is via v1 .
The space of algebraic Hilbert-Siegel modular forms of weight k and
level N is given by

MkB (N ) := f : GB (Q̂)/U0 (N ) → Vk ∀γ ∈ GB (Q), f |k γ = f ,

For any prime p ∤ N , let ̟p be a local uniformizer at p. The local Hecke algebra at p is generated by the Hecke operators T1 (p) and T2 (p) corresponding
to the double U0 (N )-cosets ∆1 (p) and ∆2 (p) of the matrices

T2 (p) for all primes p ∤ N .

1.4. The Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence. The Hecke modules Sk (N )
and SkB (N ) are related by the following conjecture known as the JacquetLanglands Correspondence for symplectic groups.
Conjecture 1 (Jacquet-Langlands). The Hecke algebras Tk (N ) and TB
k (N )
are isomorphic and there is a compatible isomorphism of Hecke modules
∼

JL : SkB (N ) −→ Sk (N ).
The Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence is a special case of the Langlands
transfer map between autormorphic forms on the inner forms of a group and
the group itself. To the best of our knowledge, the correspondence in this
form was first discussed by Ihara [Ih 1964] in the case F = Q, and by
Ibukiyama [Ib 1984] who provided some numerical evidences. The authors
intend to investigate some cases of the conjecture using theta series. The
Fundamental Lemma should be the main ingredient in giving a full proof of
the conjecture, although this would not be a straightforward exercise. We
were told by several people that the result would be a consequence of some
work in progress by James Arthur.
2. The Algorithm
In this section, we present the algorithm we used in order to compute
the Hecke module of (algebraic) Hilbert-Siegel modular forms. The main
assumption in this section is that the class number of the principal genus
of GB is 1. (This is not a very strong restriction and we refer to [D3 2007]
to see how one could relax it). We recall that since B is totally definite,
GB satisfies Proposition 1.4 in Gross [Gr 1999]. Thus the group GB (R) is
compact modulo its centre, and Γ = GB (Z)/OF× is finite.

For any prime p in F , let Fp = OF /p be the residue field at p and define
the reduction map
M2 (OB, p) → M4 (Fp)
g 7→ g̃.

Now, choose a totally positive generator πp of p and put

Θ1 (p) := Γ\ u ∈ M2 (OB ) uūt = πp12 and rank(g̃) = 2 ,

Θ2 (p) := Γ\ u ∈ M2 (OB ) uūt = πp2 12 and rank(g̃) = 1 .

We let H02 (N ) = G(Ẑ)/U0 (N ). Then the group Γ acts on H02 (N ), thus on
the space of functions f : H02 (N ) → Vk by
∀x ∈ H02 (N ), ∀γ ∈ Γ,

f |k γ(x) := f (γx)γ.

The following theorem is our main result.

Theorem 2. There is an isomorphism of Hecke modules
∼ 
MkB (N ) −→ f : H02 (N ) → Vk f |k γ = f, γ ∈ Γ ,

where the Hecke action on the right hand side is given by
X
f |k T1 (p) =
f |k u,
u∈Θ1 (p)

f |k T2 (p) =

X

u∈Θ2 (p)

f |k u.

Proof. We first observe that the sets Θ1 (p) and Θ2 (p) give global cosets
representatives for the double cosets ∆1 (p) and ∆2 (p) respectively. Since
the class number of the principal genus of GB is one, the rest of the theorem
follows using a similar argument as in [D1 2005, Proposition 3.1]. (See also
[D3 2007] for additional details).

It is not hard to see that Theorem 2 provides us with a description of the
Hecke action on the zero-dimensional flag scheme H02 (N ) defined on OF /N
that lends itself better to computation than the classical approach to Brandt
matrices in terms of ideal classes or lattices. In the rest of this section, we
explain the main steps of our algorithm.
2.1. The quotientQ
H02 (N ). Keeping the notations of the previous section,
we recall that N = p|N pep . Let p be a prime dividing N and consider the

where 12 is the identity matrix in M2 (OFp /pep ). Let M be a rank 2
OFp /pep -submodule which is a direct factor in L. We say that M is symplectic if hu, vi = 0 for all u, v ∈ M . We recall that GSp4 (OFp ) acts

8


transitively on the set of symplectic OFp /pep -submodules of rank 2 and
that the stabilizer of the submodule generated by e1 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T and
e2 = (0, 1, 0, 0)T is U0 (pep ). The quotient H02 (pep ) = GSp4 (OFp )/U0 (pep )
is the set of OFp /pep -rational points of the Lagrange scheme defined over
OFp /pep . Via the reduction map ÔF → OF /N , the quotient G(Ẑ)/U0 (N )
can be identified with the product
Y
H02 (N ) =
H02 (pep ).
p|N

The cardinality of H02 (N ) is extremely useful and is determined using the
following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let p be a prime in F and ep ≥ 1 an integer. Then, the cardinality of the set H02 (pep ) is given by
#H02 (pep ) = N(p)3(ep −1) (N(p) + 1)(N(p)2 + 1).
Proof. For ep = 1, the cardinality of the Lagrange variety over the finite
field Fp = OF /p is given by (N(p) + 1)(N(p)2 + 1). Proceed by induction on
ep.

2.2. Brandt matrices. Let F = {x1 , . . . , xh } be a fundamental domain
for the action of Γ on H02 (N ) and, for each i, let Γi be the stabilizer of xi .
It is well known that there is an isomorphism of complex spaces
MkB (N ) →
f

where VkΓi is the subspace of Γi -invariants in Vk . For any x, y ∈ H02 (N ), we
let

Θ1 (x, y, p) := u ∈ Θ1 (p) ∃γ ∈ Γ, ux = γy ,

Θ2 (x, y, p) := u ∈ Θ2 (p) ∃γ ∈ Γ, ux = γy
Proposition 3. The actions of the Hecke operators Ts (p), s = 1, 2, are
given by the Brandt matrices Bs (p) = (bsij (p)), where
Γ

2.5. Computing the sets Θ1 (p) and Θ2 (p). Let us consider the quadratic
form on the vector space V = B 2 given by
V → F
(a, b) 7→ ||(a, b)|| := nr(a) + nr(b),

where nr is the reduced norm on B. This determines an inner form
V ×V → F
(u, v) 7→ hu, vi.

An element of Θ1 (p) (resp. Θ2 (p)) is a unitary matrix γ ∈ M2 (OB ) with
respect to this inner form such that the norm of each row is πp (resp. πp2
and the rank of the reduced matrix is 1). So we first start by computing

to Θ1 (p) (resp. Θ2 (p)) when its reduction mod p has the appropriate rank.
We list all these matrices up to equivalence and stop when we reach the
right cardinality.
2.6. The implementation of the algorithm. The implementation of the
algorithm is similar to that of [D1 2005]. However, it is important to note
how we represent elements in H02 (N ) so that we can retrieve them easily
once stored. As in [D1 2005] we choose to work with the product
Y
H02 (N ) =
H02 (pep ).
p|N

Using Plucker's coordinates, we can view H02 (pep ) as a closed subspace of
P5 (OFp /pep ). We then represent each element in H02 (pep ) by choosing a
point x = (a0 : * * * : a5 ) = [u ∧ v] ∈ P5 (OFp /pep ) such that the submodule
M generated by u and v is a Lagrange submodule, and the first invertible
coordinate is scaled to 1.

In this section,
we provide some numerical examples using the quadratic

field F = Q( 5). It is proven in K. Hashimoto and T. Ibukiyama [HI 1980]
that, for the Hamilton quaternion algebra B over F , the class number of

the principal genus of GB is one. We use our algorithm to compute all the
systems of Hecke eigenvalues of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms of weight 3 and
level N that are defined over real quadratic fields, where N runs over all
prime ideals of norm less than 50. We then determine which of the forms
we obtained are possible lifts of Hilbert cusp forms by comparing the Hecke
eigenvalues for those primes.
3.1. Tables of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms of parallel weight 3. In
Table 1 below, we list all the systems of eigenvalues of Hilbert-Siegel cusp
forms of weight 3 and level N that are defined over real quadratic fields,
where N runs over all prime ideals in F of norm less than 50. Here are the
conventions we use in the tables.
(1) For a quadratic field K of discriminant D, we let ωD be a generator
of the ring of integers OK of K.
(2) The first row contains the level N , given in the format (Norm(N ), α)
for some generator α ∈ F of N , and the dimensions of the relevant
spaces.
(3) The second row lists the Hecke operators that have been computed.
(4) For each eigenform f , the Hecke eigenvalues are given in a row, and
the last entry of that row indicates if the form f is a probable lift.
(5) The levels and the eigenforms are both listed up to Galois conjugation.
For an eigenform f and a given prime p ∤ N , let a1 (p, f ) and a2 (p, f ) be the
eigenvalues of the Hecke operators T1 (p) and T2 (p), respectively. Then the
Euler factor Lp(f, s) is given by
Lp(f, s) = Qp(q −s )−1 ,
where
Qp(x) = 1 − a1 (p, f )x + b1 (p, f )x2 − a1 (p, f )q 2k−3 x3 + q 4k−6 x4 ,

b1 (p, f ) = a1 (p, f )2 − a2 (p, f ) − q 2k−4 ,
q = N(p).

3.2. Tables of Hilbert cusp forms of parellel weight 4. In
we list all the Hilbert cusp forms of parallel weight 4 and level N
defined over real quadratic fields, with N running over all prime
norm less than 50. We use this data in order to determine the

parallel weight k and level N with Hecke eigenvalues a(p, f ), where p is a

Table 2. Hilbert eigenforms of weight 4
prime not dividing N . Let φ be the lift of f to GSp4 via the long root, and
ψ the one via the short root. Then the Hecke eigenvalues of φ are given by

The second lift ψ is the so-called symmetric cube lifting.
Recently, Ramakrishnan and Shahidi [RS 2007] showed the existence of
symmetric cube liftings for non-CM elliptic curves E/Q to GSp4 /Q. This
result should hold for other totally real number fields, and we expect the
levels of those lifts to be of Klingen type. But all the lifts in Table 1 are
via√the long root embedding. Since there are modular elliptic curves over
Q( 5) whose conductors have norm 31, 41 and 49, there are probably more
lifts than appear in Table 1.
