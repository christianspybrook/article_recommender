We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Γ-point
in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in
this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band
in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 ⇒ +, 1 and
−, 1 ⇒ 0, at a magnetic field B0 ≃ 30T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electronphonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect
circularly polarized lattice modes.

In metals and semiconductors the spectra of phonons
are renormalized by their interaction with electrons.
Some of the best known examples include the Kohn
anomaly [1] in the phonon dispersion, which originates
from the excitation/de-excitation of electrons across the
Fermi level upon the propagation of a phonon through
the bulk of a metal and a shift in the longitudinal optical phonon frequency in heavily doped polar semiconductors [2]. However, despite the transparency of theoretical
models the observation of such effects is often obscured
by the difficulty to change the electron density in a material, whereas in semiconductor structures containing twodimensional (2D) electrons the density of which can be
varied, the influence of the latter on the phonon modes is
weak due to a negligibly small volume fraction occupied
by the electron gas. In this context, a unique opportunity
arises in graphene-based field-effect transistors [3], where
the density of carriers in an atomically thin film (monolayer [4, 5, 6] or a bilayer [7]) can be continuously varied
from 1013 cm−2 p-type to 1013 cm−2 n-type. Several Raman experiments have already been reported [8, 9] where
the variation of carrier density in graphene changes the
optical phonon frequency, in agreement with theoretical
expectations [10, 11, 12].
When graphene is exposed to a quantizing magnetic
field, its electronic spectrum quenches into discrete Landau levels (LLs) [13]. Then, the optical phonon energy in
graphene may coincide with the energy of one of the interLL transitions, a condition known as magnetophonon resonance [14, 15]. In this Letter, we propose a theory for
the magnetophonon resonance in graphene. We show
that in-plane optical phonons in graphene (E2g mode),
identified as the G-band in the recently reported Raman
spectra [8, 9, 16, 17, 18] acquire a rich fine structure when
a magnetic field makes their energy equal to the energy of
one of the valley-antisymmetric interband magnetoexcitons [19]. Most saliently, the difference between circular
polarization of various inter-LL transitions [20, 21] makes
the magnetophonon resonance distinguishable for lattice
modes of different circular polarization, which makes the

number of split lines in the acquired fine structure dependent on the electronic filling factor, ν.
The in-plane optical phonons in graphene [relative displacement u = (ux , uy ) of sublattices A and B] have
the energy ω ≈ 0.2eV at the Γ-point (in the center of
the Brillouin zone). These phonons and their coupling to
electrons can be described using the Hamiltonian [10, 11],

where bμ,q are annihilation (creation) operators of a
phonon with polarisation eμ,q , M is the mass of a carbon atom, and Nuc is the number of unit cells. Here and
below, we use units ~ ≡ 1. Also, we shall utilize a double
degeneracy of the E2g mode at the Γ-point (at q = 0) and
describe the in-plane optical phonon in terms of a degenerate pair of circularly polarized modes, u = ux + iuy
and u = ux − iuy . The constant g in Eq. (1) characterizes the electron-phonon coupling [22]. This coupling
has the form of the only invariant linear in u permitted
by the symmetry group of the honeycomb crystal. It is
constructed using Pauli matrices σ = (σx , σy ) acting in
the space of sublattice components of the Bloch functions, [φK+ A , φK+ B ] and [φK− B , φK− A ] which describe
electron states in the valleys K± (two opposite corners of
the hexagonal Brillouin zone) and obey the Hamiltonian,
in terms of the electron charge e [23],
Hel = ξvσ * p,

p = − i∇ − eA, ∂x Ay − ∂y Ax = B.

Here, ξ = ± distinguishes between K± , and momentum
p is calculated with respect to the center of the corresponding valley. This Hamiltonian represents the dominant term of the next-neighbor tight-binding model of
graphene [24, 25, 26], and the electron-phonon coupling
in Eq. (1) takes into account the change in the A − B
hopping elements due to the sublattice displacement [27].

A generic form of the phonon-magnetoexciton anti±
crossing and formation of coupled modes, ωA
(n) in undoped graphene (i.e., ν = 0) is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).
Such an anticrossing and mode mixing can manifest itself in Raman spectroscopy: in a fine structure acquired
by the G-line (earlier attributed [8, 9, 16, 17, 18] to the
in-plane optical phonon at the Γ-point, E2g mode) at
the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. The effect is
the strongest for the resonance Ωn=0 ≈ ω̃0 between the
phonon and magnetoexciton based upon −, 1 ⇒ 0 and
0 ⇒ +, 1 transitions. When approaching the resonance
(by sweeping a magnetic field), the phonon line becomes
accompanied by a weak satellite moving towards it and
increasing its intensity. Exactly at the magnetophonon

resonance, where both the upper mode [ω̃A
(n)] and the
−
lower mode [ω̃A (n)] consist of an equal-weight superposition of the phonon
√ and the resonant exciton, with

√ in graphenep
appear as two lines. For Ωn=0 = 2v/λB ≈ 36 B[T]
meV (see [23]) and ω̃0 ≃ 200 meV, this resonance occurs
in an experimentally accessible field range, B0 ≃ 30 T.
For the filling factor ν = 0, the central LL (n = 0) is
always half-filled. Then, coupling and, therefore, splitting of the - and -polarized modes coincide, g = g ,
thus, giving rise to a pair of peaks at the energies
ω̃ ± = ω̃0 ± g sketched in part I in Fig. 2(b). For
the magnetic field value B0 ≃ 30 T and g ≃ 0.2eV [12],
we estimate this splitting as 2gA ∼ 8meV (∼ 64cm−1 ),
which largely exceeds the G-band width observed in Refs.
[8, 9, 16, 17, 18].
Doping of graphene changes the strength of the coupling constants g and g , as shown in Fig. 2(c). This
is because a higher (lower) occupancy of the n = 0 LL

The strongest effect of the phonon coupling to electron modes occurs when the frequency of the former
coincides with the frequency Ωn of one of the magnetoexcitons ψA,as (n). In such a case, the sum on the
right-hand-side of the eigenvalue equation (4) is dominated by the resonance term and may be approximated

reduces (enhances) the oscillator strength of the polarized transition due to the availability of filled and empty
states in the involved LLs, whereas the same change in
the electron density has the opposite effect on g . As
a result, for an arbitrary filling factor −2 < ν < 2,
we predict that, in the vicinity of magnetophonon resonance, the phonon mode (and, therefore, G-band in Raman spectrum) should split into four lines [part II in Fig.
±
2(b)], with ω̃
= ω̃ ±g for -polarized and ω̃ ± = ω̃ ±g
for -polarized phonons. In the quantum Hall state at
filling factor ν = 2, the transition −, 1 ⇒ 0 becomes successively blocked and no longer affects the frequency of a
-polarized phonon, whereas the transition 0 ⇒ +, 1 acquires the maximum strength, thus, increasing the coupling parameter g . This leads to the magnetophonon
resonance fine structure consisting of three peaks, with
an even larger splitting between side lines, as sketched in
part III in Fig. 2(b). Interestingly, this may enable one
to directly observe lattice modes with a definite circular polarization. A further increase of the electron filling
factor reduces the side-line splitting which should completely disappear at ν = 6, after the transition 0 ⇒ +, 1
becomes blocked by a complete filling of the +, 1 LL [Fig.
2(c)]. The same arguments hold for p-doped graphene,
though in this case the roles of - and -polarized modes
are interchanged.
Magnetophonon resonances with other possible interLL transitions n ⇒
√ 1 occur at much lower magnetic
√ n+
fields, Bn = B0 /( n+ n + 1)2 . For example, a resonant
phonon coupling with the magnetoexciton ψA;as (1) is expected to occur at B1 ≈ 5T. Its description remains qualitatively similar, though for n > 0 the mode splitting is
less pronounced because of the B-field dependence of the
coupling constants in Eq. (3). One finds that g = g
for |ν| < 2(2n − 1). At ν = 2(2n − 1), filling of the nth LL starts changing, which reduces splitting of the polarized mode and gives rise to the four-peak structure.
At ν = 2(2n + 1), where the +, n LL becomes completely
filled, splitting of the -polarized phonon vanishes, thus,
resulting in the three-peak fine structure [part III in Fig.
2(b)] that would persist up to ν = 2(2n + 3). This is
because the splitting of the -polarized modes remains
constant up to the filling factor ν = 2(2n + 1), above
which population of the +, (n + 1) LL starts to suppress
the value of g , until the latter vanishes at ν = 2(2n + 3)
[see Fig. 2(d)].
In conclusion, we have predicted the existence, with a
peculiar form, of the fine structure of the in-plane (E2g )
optical phonon in graphene when the latter is in resonance with one of the inter-LL transitions in this material. The effect is expected to be most pronounced
when the phonon is resonantly coupled to the 0 ⇒ +, 1
and −, 1 ⇒ 0 transitions, which requires a magnetic field
B0 ≃ 30T. We describe a possible manifestation of the
magnetophonon resonance in the Raman spectrum Gband in graphene (earlier attributed [8, 9, 16, 17, 18]

to such a phonon at the Γ-point) and its filling factor
dependence. The predicted mode splitting may be used
to measure directly the strength of the electron-phonon
coupling, and also to distinguish between circularly (leftand right- hand) polarized lattice modes.
