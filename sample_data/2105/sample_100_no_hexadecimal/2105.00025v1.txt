Abstract: Quantum phase transitions, which are driven by quantum fluctuations, mark a frontier
between distinct quantum phases of matter. However, our understanding and control of such
phenomena is still limited. Here we report an atomic scale control of quantum phase transition
between two different topological quantum classes of a well-defined π-conjugated polymer
controlled by their length. We reveal that a pseudo Jahn-Teller effect is the driving mechanism of
the phase transition, being activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, our
theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long-time coherent fluctuations at finite
temperature between the two quantum phases of the polymer near the phase transition. This work
may pave new ways to achieve atomic scale control of quantum phase transitions, in particular in
organic matter.

Main Text: In general, a phase transition represents a transformation process between two states
of matter with distinct internal order involving long-range fluctuations across the entire system.
Classical phase transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations, being well understood within the
frame of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory (1).
However, at zero temperature, where no thermal fluctuations occur, a quantum phase transition
(QPT) (2) may happen, being driven by quantum fluctuations imposed by the principle of
uncertainty, whenever a non-thermal parameter like pressure, magnetic field or chemical
composition is modified (3, 4). Such quantum phase transitions are the subject of an intensive
research nowadays in order to shed light into the fundamental mechanisms behind them, and due
to their relevance in complex phenomena in solid state physics (5-7).
Typically, continuous QPTs take place in the proximity of the so-called avoided level crossing
(see Fig. 1), whenever the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest excited state
diminishes and becomes comparable to the quantum energy fluctuation. In principle, under such
circumstances, only the quantum fluctuations may cause the phase transition into a new phase of
matter at zero Kelvin (in the absence of any thermal fluctuation) (8, 9). Importantly, near the
critical point at finite but very low temperature both thermal and quantum fluctuations are equally
important, giving rise to the so-called quantum criticality phenomenon. The quantum critical state
cannot be described within the conventional quasiparticle picture of the Fermi liquid theory (10,
11). This exotic quantum state plays significant role in our understanding of e.g. high temperature
superconductivity (12-15), ferroelectricity (16, 17) or strange metals featuring non-Fermi liquid
behavior (12). From this perspective, control and understanding of QPT represent one of the
biggest challenges of contemporary science due to their complexity and the inherent quantum
character (18). As a result, it is commonly perceived that a detailed knowledge may allow to design
new quantum materials with unforeseen properties.
In condensed matter physics, a lot of the attention has been paid to QPT between phases featuring
strongly correlated states of matter with complex spin and charge pattern frequently manifested by
spin and charge density waves (CDW) (19, 20). However, it is precisely the presence of strongly
correlated phases, which makes it significantly more difficult to gain a deeper understanding of
the phase transition mechanism itself. Therefore, there is a quest to search for novel materials,
where QPT takes place between two phases of matter with only moderated correlation, since such
systems could be well described within mean field approximations. In addition, there is a growing
interest in controlling the proximity to the quantum critical point by harnessing designer
parameters with great precision, in order to enable the direct observation of the quantum phase
transition.
In one-dimensional π-conjugated polymers, the Peierls instability (21) results in an alternation of
bond lengths between carbon atoms accompanied by variation of corresponding bond charges,
which gives rise to the π-conjugation (22, 23). The π-conjugation can also be viewed as CDW
phase driven by a Fermi surface nesting and complex interplay between electronic and lattice
degree of freedom (24, 25). Remarkably, even very simple polymers such as polyacetylene may
feature distinct quantum topological phases as demonstrated by the celebrated SSH model (26),

2

where one hallmark of the non-trivial topology of the electronic structure is the presence of in-gap
energy edge states.
Recent progress in the field of on-surface synthesis (27, 28) supported by high-resolution imaging
by scanning probe microscopy (29, 30) has brought a new chemical strategy to synthesize organic
hydrocarbon materials with atomistic control (31) and inspect their inherent electronic, magnetic
and topological properties (32-35). Following these on-surface synthetic protocols, in a recent
study, we demonstrated that distinct π-conjugation resonance forms and corresponding topological
phases can be tuned in acene-bridged π-conjugated polymers by a proper choice of acene units,
i.e. the monomer constituents of the polymer (36). The change of quantum class from
topologically trivial to non-trivial polymers was accompanied not only by significant reduction of
the electronic band gap, but also by a rearrangement of π-bonds and the emergence of zero-energy
edge states as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the electronic band structure (37).
In this work, we reveal that the length of a 1D polymer can act as a non-thermal parameter to
trigger a topological quantum phase transition. To exemplify experimentally this strategy, we
employ pentacene bridged polymers (36) as archetypes. Such polymers belong to the topologically
non-trivial quantum phase in the limit of infinite length. We carried out a systematic study of the
evolution of the π-conjugation resonance form and level crossing of frontier orbitals (see schematic
view in Fig. 1) accompanied by the emergence of the edge states upon increasing of polymer length
by means of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), complemented by theoretical simulations. Our
results reveal that the topological phase transition is driven by the length of the polymer. Such
findings are rationalized by a multi-orbital pseudo Jahn-Teller effect (38) triggered by the length
dependent vibronic coupling between frontier occupied and unoccupied orbitals. In addition, our
density functional theory (DFT) molecular dynamics simulations indicate the presence of longtime coherent fluctuations at finite temperature between the two distinct π-conjugated/topological
phases of the polymers situated near the topological phase transition.
Pentacene polymers (36, 39) were grown by deposition of precursor 4BrPn (6,13bis(dibromomethylene)-6,13-dihydropentacene) on Au(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum
conditions and subsequent annealing of the surface at 500K. This promotes homocoupling of the
4BrPn molecules leading to the formation of the pentacene polymers. In order to control the final
length of our polymers, we intentionally varied the initial coverages of the precursor molecules.
For coverages below 15%, finite polymers could be found (see fig. S1 for representative scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) images of 4%, 12% and 15% coverage, and the resulting polymers
obtained after annealing). Following this protocol, we were able to produce a broad variety of
pristine defect-free polymers with lengths ranging from 2 monomers up to ~50 monomers.
In a recent previous study (36), we investigated very long pentacene polymers (in range of 50-100
nm) grown on Au(111) showing the appearance of in-gap edge states as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of their electronic band structure. Herein, there is a question: if the length of a
polymer could influence its topological quantum class. To explore such hypothesis, we employed
the modified synthetic protocol, discovering the absence of in-gap edge states for chains shorter
than 26 monomers. Such finding indicates that there is a critical length for the pentacene chains to
3

exhibit the non-trivial topology. Figs. 2A-B display simultaneously acquired high-resolution
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and STM images taken with CO-tip (29) of two different defectfree chains made of 24 and 26 monomers, respectively. We have deliberately chosen these two
chains of a given length, for which a visible change in the electronic structure takes place. If we
take a look to low bias STM image near the Fermi level (STM images at ~3 meV shown in Figs.
2A-B), we observe that the chain made of 26 monomers (and longer) features the in-gap edge
states, while the chain of 24 monomers (and shorter) does not. The in-gap edge state is also
presented in dI/dV spectrum acquired at the end of the non-trivial chains as a conductance peak
around the Fermi energy (see fig. S2).
Fig. 2C represents selected dI/dV spectra of defect free polymers of different lengths with welldefined increase in the conductance corresponding to HOMO/LUMO orbitals, which determines
the electronic band gap of the polymer. A systematic evolution of the HOMO/LUMO bandgap as
function of their length is shown in Fig. 2D. As it can be seen, the bandgap of the 1D polymer
varies continuously from ~1.2 eV for a dimer chain down to ~350meV (-150 meV for the HOMO
energy and 200 meV for the LUMO) for the decamer. For longer polymers the value remains
constant. However, the saturation of the bandgap does not seem to be directly related with the
trivial/non-trivial transition of the polymers, since the QPT happens somewhere between 24 and
26 monomers. Fig. 2E also shows representative dI/dV maps obtained at the HOMO/LUMO
energies of the chains for different topological phases. Interestingly, the features observed for the
HOMO orbital of trivial polymers are found in the LUMO orbital of the non-trivial chains and vice
versa. Nonetheless, this behavior has been observed when comparing the CB/VB of anthracene vs
pentacene polymers in previous works (36) and it is responsible for the change of Zak phase (40)
and thus of the topological quantum class of the polymer. It is appropriated to note that Fig. 2D
directly represents an avoided level crossing scheme associated with continuous quantum phase
transition. This points out that the HOMO/LUMO crossing level plays a decisive role in the
topological phase transition, as we will elaborate below.
The change of topological state of these polymers is also accompanied by a variation of the
inherent π-conjugation, i.e. the resonance forms, going from ethynylene-aromatic (topologically
trivial in acene polymers) to cumulene-quinoid (topologically non-trivial in pentacene polymers).
Such a change in the character of the π-conjugation, considered as well as transition between two
distinct CDW phases, can be directly observed in high-resolution AFM images obtained with CO
functionalized tips. In Fig. 2F, we present two high-resolution AFM images of central part of trivial
and non-trivial chains respectively, together with a profile along the line marked in red and blue.
The presence of a protrusion in the bridging unit is associated with the triple bond of the ethynylene
link of the topologically trivial chains (see red line profile in Fig. 2F). While the bright protrusions
and corresponding peaks in the red line profile can be observed throughout the trivial polymer, the
non-trivial chain shows a disappearance of the protrusions and a decay in intensity of the peaks as
we get closer to the central part of the chain (see blue line profile in Fig. 2F). This variation
demonstrates an ethynylene to cumulene-like transition along the topologically non-trivial
polymer.
In order to improve the experimental capabilities of controlling the phase transition in π-conjugated
polymers, we have developed a novel protocol employing atomic manipulation. Such strategy
4

consists of two step process; hydrogenation of the pentacene polymers to afterwards selectively
remove those extra hydrogen atoms from the desired part of the chain using the STM tip.
An exposure of pentacene polymers to atomic hydrogen in UHV chamber leads to highly selective
adsorption of two hydrogens atoms on one of the benzene rings close to the central one (see Figs.
3A-B and details of hydrogenation process in Methods). Fig. 3B shows an experimental and
theoretical AFM image of the hydrogen defects with excellent agreement between both images.
Notably, such highly site-selective adsorption is dictated by the formation of a new π-resonance
form with two Clar's sextets, with higher stabilization of the chemical structure. Therefore, the
hydrogenation process increases substantially the electronic band gap (~1.8 eV see fig. S3) of the
polymer establishing an ideal template for an artificial formation of large segments of pristine
pentacene polymers of different lengths.
The hydrogen pair defects can be removed in a controlled way by placing the STM tip on top of
one of them (a red dot in Fig. 3C) and performing a distance versus voltage curve, ramping the
voltage from 1.5 V up to 2.5-3.0 V, while keeping a constant current (~10 pA). In the plot in Fig.
3C we can observe a sudden jump around 2.5 V pointing to a successful removal of the extra
hydrogen atoms (see fig. S4 for snapshots of a hydrogen removal process). Following this protocol,
we can selectively engineer regions of the pristine pentacene polymer with a desired topological
phase, which depends on the length of such region. As an example, in Fig. 3D we show an AFM
image of a long fully hydrogenated pentacene polymer before our manipulation experiment. The
AFM image from Fig. 3E displays the chain after multiple manipulations (extra-hydrogen
removals) where a trivial chain consisting of 16 monomers (left part of the chain) and a non-trivial
chain made of 31 monomers (right part of the chain) have been created. The low bias STM image
of the modified polymer shown in Fig. 3E reveals the existence of the edge state in the non-trivial
part in opposition to the trivial chain. At the same time, dI/dV maps acquired at the HOMO and
LUMO energies (-150 meV and 200 meV respectively) prove once again the inversion of the
orbitals between the trivial and non-trivial polymers (see two bottom panels of Fig. 3E).
Importantly, the artificially formed pentacene polymers exhibit the same behavior as the finite
pristine chains previously described.
To summarize the experimental observations, the quantum topological phase transition is
accompanied by the avoided level crossing of frontier HOMO/LUMO orbitals and the
transformation of π-conjugation resonance form, as shown schematically on Fig. 1. Polymers
found in topologically non-trivial phase feature zero-energy edge states due to the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Moreover, we also observe a significant renormalization of the electronic band
gap for very short chains, while from a certain polymer length the energy band gap remains almost
constant even in the phase transition, see Fig. 2D.
To get more insight into the underlying mechanism, we carried out total energy DFT calculations
(41, 42) of free-standing pentacene-bridged polymers of various lengths. Fig. 4A displays
evolution of the frontier's orbitals of polymers of different length forming the conduction and
valence band in the limit of an infinite polymer. The red and blue color denotes bonding ψb and
antibonding ψa character of given frontier orbital on the triple bond of the bridging unit, see Fig.
5

1. The phase transition occurs between polymers of 10 and 11 units and it is marked by the
emergence of in-gap edge states (see black dots in Fig. 4A) and unification of the bonding (red)
and antibonding (blue) character of empty and occupied states, respectively.
The spin restricted DFT calculations capture most of the experimental observations including (i)
the presence of the phase transition accompanied by the avoided level crossing of frontier orbitals,
see Fig. 4A; (ii) the transformation of the π-conjugation at a certain critical length (Fig. 4A), and
(iii) the presence of the in-gap energy edge states as hallmarks of the topologically non-trivial
phase, see fig. S5. In addition, calculated dI/dV images (43) of single particle frontier
HOMO/LUMO orbitals are in excellent agreement with the experimental evidence as shown on
Fig. 2E. The only discrepancy we note is a shorter theoretical polymer length (~11 units) as
compared to the experimental results in which the phase transition takes place. Such deviation
could be attributed to limited precision of single particle DFT calculations as the precise position
of the transition depends on employed exchange-correlation functional and/or absence of metallic
substrate in our simulations. Despite this minor deficiency, we consider that the DFT calculations
provide a reliable qualitative description of the underlying phase transition mechanism.
Interestingly, the frontier electronic orbitals involved in the avoided level crossing have an
opposite bonding/antibonding character on the triple bond, see Figs. 1 and 4B. Therefore, the level
crossing is directly related to the debilitation and elongation of the triple bond observed during the
phase transition driven by the occupancy of anti/bonding frontier orbitals. This suggests that
phonon softening could be responsible for the phase transition. Often spontaneous symmetry
breaking in molecular systems with nondegenerate electronic states is caused by pseudo JahnTeller mechanism (38) driven by vibronic coupling of low-lying excited states to vibrational modes
of particular symmetry to establish a new ground state at zero temperature. In next, we will show
that indeed the pseudo Jahn-Teller is the driving mechanism of the phase transition in the
pentacene polymers.
The total vibronic coupling tot
corresponding to a given soft phonon mode Q, which is a source
Q
of the phonon softening of the system, consist of sum of individual vibronic couplings i,j
between
Q
i,j frontier orbitals written as:
ij

γQ ~

⟨ψi | ∂H⁄∂Q |ψj ⟩
Ej − Ei

(1)

, where ψi , ψj , Ei , Ej are wavefunctions and eigen energies of i-th occupied and j-th unoccupied
electronic states, respectively. Numerator ⟨ψi | ∂H⁄∂Q |ψj ⟩ represents off diagonal vibronic
coupling constant (38) between the occupied and unoccupied electronic states mediated by
vibrational mode Q. The presence of the energy difference Ej − Ei in denominator in eq. 1 has two
important consequences: (i) only low-energy excitation electronic states have significant
contribution to the vibronic coupling; and (ii) a diminishing band gap enhances the vibronic
coupling. The second consequence is often considered as a decisive factor in most of the
spontaneous symmetry breaking processes. However, this argument cannot be fully adopted in our

6

system as the experimental band gap remains almost constant near the critical point, as shown in
Fig. 2D.
Thus, our findings indicate that the numerator in eq. 1 plays a decisive role in the phase transition.
To understand the role of such term, we carried out an analysis of a pentacene dimer to identify a
suitable coupling between vibrational modes and frontier orbitals involved in the pseudo JahnTeller (38, 44). Our calculations show that two highest occupied frontier orbitals (HOMO-1 and
HOMO) have an opposite bonding ψb and antibonding ψa character on the triple bond of the
bridging unit, respectively, and the same holds for the two lowest frontier unoccupied orbitals
(LUMO and LUMO+1), as shown in Fig. 4B.
Moreover, we found that an in-plane stretching vibrational mode Q of the triple bond in the
bridging unit (see inset of Fig. 4C) has a suitable symmetry that allows significant vibronic
coupling between the frontier electronic orbitals with the same bonding ψ b or antibonding ψa
symmetry. On the other hand, the term diminishes for two frontier orbitals of the opposite
symmetry. Namely, in the case of the dimer chain shown in Fig. 4B we found that the vibronic
coupling mediated by the stretching vibrational mode Q between orbitals of the same symmetry is
γQb,b = γQa,a =0.73 eV/Å while for orbitals of different symmetries vanishes γQa,b ~10−3 . Tables
S1-S3 summarize calculated vibronic coupling between occupied and unoccupied frontier orbitals
for dimer, trimer and pentamer chain, whose total sum increases with the length of the chain. Thus,
the longer polymer is, also the number of electronics states belonging to emerging valence and
conduction bands (see Fig. 4A), as well as the number of the stretching vibrational modes Q of the
bridge unit (see figs. S6-7) linearly increase. Consequently, the vibronic coupling steadily
increases with the chain's longitude as shown on Fig. 4C till it reaches a critical value and the
system undergoes a phase transition.
The phase transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial is accompanied by the crossing of the
HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals of distinct bonding character. This level crossing causes that
the set of orbitals forming the valence band has the same antibonding character on the triple bond,
while the conduction band is entirely formed by wavefunctions with the same bonding character,
see Figs. 4A-B and figs. S5,8-9. Consequently, the vibronic coupling via the stretching mode
vanishes. As the occupied orbitals of the valence band have antibonding symmetry, the character
of the triple bond debilitates which causes the π-conjugation transformation from ethynylenearomatic to cumulene-quinoid character accompanied by the topological transition. Our analysis
shows that systems with conduction and valence bands composed by a mixture of wavefunctions
of different symmetries are more prone to vibronic instabilities. We believe that this paradigm
could be extended to other π-conjugated systems such as acenes or graphene nanoribbons (45).
Fig. S5 displays real-space wavefunctions of the pentacene polymer made of 15 units, which is
found in topologically non-trivial phase featuring the in-gap edge states. Interestingly, we observe
that the exchange bonding ψ b and antibonding ψ a g orbitals take place mostly in the central part
of the polymer, while at the edges the frontier orbitals preserve their original electronic character
of short topologically trivial polymers. This finding matches well to experimental data acquired
on topologically non-trivial polymers (see fig. S10) revealing a conservation of triple bond
7

character on bridge units seen in high-resolution AFM images and reverse contrast of dI/dV maps
of HOMO/LUMO frontier orbitals at the ends of the polymers with respect to its central part (see
Fig. 3E).
The extension of QPT to finite temperatures gives rise to the quantum criticality phenomenon,
which is subject of an intensive research due to its exotic state of matter. There is a question if the
quantum criticality may emerge also in the pentacene bridged polymer. Therefore, it would be
interesting to see how the polymers of the critical lengths behave at elevated temperatures. Thus,
we carried out QM/MM MD simulations (42, 46) of polymers made of 15 units (QM region) on
the Au(111) substrate (MD region) at temperature of 100 Kelvin (for details see materials and
methods). Interestingly, we observe cyclic reappearance of the in-gap edge states ψe (black)
accompanied by level crossing of bonding ψa (red) and antibonding ψb (blue) frontier orbitals in
energy, as shown in Fig. 4D and supplementary video S1. This indicates continuous fluctuation of
the polymer between two topological phases at finite temperature. Such fluctuations are driven by
presence of a new stable vibrational mode with time oscillation period of ~1ps. This vibrational
mode has a character of a breathing mode continuously varying the total length of the polymer.
On the contrary, the level crossing and cyclic reappearance of the edge state is completely absent
in MD simulations of a topologically trivial chain made of 5 units, see fig. S11. Despite we are
aware of the limitations of the correct description of the electronic structure using the DFT method,
we consider that the coherent evolvement on time scale of at least tens of picoseconds between the
two topological phases may indicate the existence of the quantum criticality in π-conjugated
polymers located near the topological phase transition.
We believe that these findings will motivate further research with appropriated experimental
techniques. Unfortunately, such quantum coherent evolvement cannot be directly inspected by
low-temperature microscopy, which operation at elevated temperatures causes significant loss of
the spatial and energy resolution. Instead, for example conductance measurements through single
chains (47, 48) near the quantum phase transition could explore the possible critical behavior the
conductivity of the polymers at finite temperature.
We anticipate that our results could give rise to fluctuating quasi-metallic entangled phase within
the polymer. We envision our observations will stimulate more elaborated studies of the electronic
structure of π-conjugated polymers and the role of the size dimensions of such polymers regarding
topological quantum classes and emergence of complex quantum ground states in the quantum
criticality regime.
In addition, our new recipe based on extra hydrogenation and atomic manipulation provides
avenues to engineer polymer segments with different topological phases, or two separated
segments of the same topology, whereby to study quantum phenomena emerging from trivial/nontrivial interfaces, as well as the interaction of two topologically protected edge states and their
protection from disorder or external stimuli.

Fig. 1 Schematic view of the topological quantum phase transition in π-conjugated
pentacene bridged polymers with their length. The phase transition is driven by avoid level
crossing of two frontier HOMO/LUMO orbitals with distinct bonding (ψb ) and antibonding (ψa )
character of π-orbitals located on two carbon atoms forming the bridge. This exchange of two
frontier bonding ψb and antibonding ψa orbitals in the avoid level crossing debilitates the triple
bond in the bridge causing transformation of the π-resonant form of the polymer and emergence
of the topologically nontrivial quantum phase in-gap edge states.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Methods
All the experiments were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum chamber hosting a low
temperature (4.2 K) STM/AFM (Createc). Bias voltage is applied to the sample. Base pressure was
~5.0 E-10 mbar.
STM/AFM images were acquired with a Pt/Ir tip mounted on a qPlus sensor (resonant
frequency of ~30 kHz; stiffness of ~1,800 N m–1), cut and sharpened by focused ion beam. The
high resolution nc-AFM images were obtained at constant-heigh, operating the qPlus sensor in the
frequency modulation mode using a constant amplitude oscillation of 50 pm. The metal tip apex
was prepared by gentle indentation (~ 1 nm) on the clean Au(111) substrate and functionalized
with a CO molecule dosed at low-temperature.
Conductance dI/dV spectra and maps were taken using a lock-in technique, with an ac voltage
(frequency: 700-800 Hz, amplitude: 1-10 mV rms) added to the dc sample bias. dI/dV maps were
recorded in constant current mode.
The data were processed using the WSxM software (49). All images and spectroscopy plots
presented corresponds to raw data with only slope and gaussian corrections.
Au(111) substrate was prepared by standard Ar+ sputtering at energies from 1.0 to 1.5 kV and
annealing at 800 K afterwards.
The 4BrPn molecules were deposited from a tantalum crucible at ~450 K on the fresh cleaned
Au(111) crystal held at RT.
Hydrogenation of the pentacene polymers was achieved by placing the sample out from the
cryostat and increasing the molecular hydrogen partial pressure of the STM chamber while keeping
the ion gauge filament on. The molecular hydrogen in the residual gas was then cracked by the
filament and adsorbed by our polymers. Control experiments where the polymer-decorated sample
was left out with the ion gauge off showed no hydrogenation of the chains even after long periods
of time.
Theoretical Methods
Our QM/MM simulations were performed using Fireball/Amber method, (46) that combines
interface force field (50) for the Au surface with Fireball local orbital DFT (42) for the molecule.
Fireball calculations used the BLYP exchange-correlation functional (51, 52) with D3 corrections
(53) and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, with a basis set of optimized numerical atomic-like
orbitals with cut off radii H (s=5.42 a.u.) and C (s,p=5.95 a.u.) (54). The QM/MM MD simulation
for the 5, 15 and 20 chains were performed at 100K with a langevin thermostat for 10 ps with a
time step of 0.5 fs. Vibronic couplings were calculated using formalism for calculations of nonadiabatic couplings in numerical local basis set described in (44) using Fireball code.
For all free-standing finite and infinite chains, DFT calculations were done using Fireball
code with parameters described above. We also obtained very similar results using FHI-AIMS
(41), where the geometry optimizations and electronic structure analyses were performed using
B3LYP (55) exchange–correlation functional. Systems were allowed to relax until the remaining
atomic forces reached below 10-2 eV Å-1. To sample the Brillouin zone, for the infinite system
with a periodic boundary condition, a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 18 × 1 × 1 was used and for the
finite systems, one k-point at the Gamma point. Theoretical dI/dV maps were calculated from
electronic structure obtained from the DFT Fireball (42) program package and with Probe Particle
Scanning Probe Microscopy (PP-SPM) code for an s-like orbital tip (43, 56). The AFM simulations
16

of the hydrogenated pentacene were performed by PP-SPM code using a DFT-relaxed atomic
structure
