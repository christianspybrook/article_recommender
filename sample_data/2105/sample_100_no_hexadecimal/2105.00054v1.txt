Abstract
Employing a generalized definition of Pratt [28] and Arrow's [2, 3] probability premium,
we introduce a new concept of attitude towards probability. We illustrate in a problem
of risk sharing that whether attitude towards probability is a first-order or second-order
phenomenon has important economic applications. By developing a local approximation
to the probability premium, we show that the canonical rank-dependent utility model usually exhibits attitude towards probability of first order, whereas under the dual theory with
smooth probability weighting functions attitude towards probability is a second-order trait.

Introduction

Under expected utility (EU), there exist various intimately related measures to evaluate the
degree of risk aversion of a decision-maker (DM). These measures include the risk premium,
the probability premium and the local index of absolute risk aversion, originally developed
independently by Pratt [28] and Arrow [2, 3] a little more than 50 years ago.1 Since then they
have played highly versatile and important roles in the theoretical and experimental analysis
of risky choices under EU and have seen widespread applications across many fields.
Among these measures and despite its appealing nature, the probability premium has for
a long time been by far the least popular. Only in recent years it starts receiving increased
attention (Jindapon [17], Liu and Meyer [18], Eeckhoudt and Laeven [10], and Liu and Neilson
[20]). The probability premium, which contrary to the risk premium has been developed only
for a binary symmetric zero-mean risk, may be given a simple interpretation: it answers the
question of by how much the probability of the adverse payoff in a binary zero-mean risk needs to
be reduced-and the probability of the prosperous payoff needs to be increased accordingly-,
to make the DM indifferent between bearing and not bearing the risk.
In this paper, we start by generalizing Pratt's [28] definition of the probability premium
such that it becomes applicable also to mean-preserving risk changes with probability mass less
than unity, while maintaining its simple interpretation.2 Next, we employ this general definition
of the probability premium to introduce a new concept of attitude towards probability. We say
that a DM displays attitude towards probability of order 1 and order 2 if, for risk changes with
small probability mass, the associated probability premium is linear in the probability mass
and proportional to the square of the probability mass, respectively. These orders of attitude
towards probability can be seen to represent the "probability counterparts" of the well-known
orders of attitude towards risk introduced by Segal and Spivak [37].
We show that whether attitude towards probability is a first- or second-order phenomenon
has important economic applications. We illustrate in particular the implications of firstand second-order probability aversion in a problem of risk sharing. We reveal that a first-order
probability averse DM facing a risk with a small loss probability may opt for risk sharing among
individuals even when the other individuals' loss probability is larger than the individual's own
loss probability. By contrast, a second-order probability averse individual facing the same risk
engages only in actuarially fair risk sharing. Our results on risk sharing can be viewed as
dual to the well-known Mossin's [25] Theorem on the sub-optimality of full insurance in the
presence of a positive safety loading. In Mossin's Theorem there is a trade-off between the
degree of risk aversion and a positive safety loading in the "payoff plane". In our result, there

is a trade-off between the degree of probability aversion and actuarially unfair loss probabilities
in the "probability plane".
Measures of risk aversion have also received much attention outside EU. In particular, in
the dual theory (DT; Yaari [42]) and under rank-dependent utility (RDU; Quiggin [31]), a rich
literature has proposed several measures of risk aversion and has established the associated
results on comparative risk aversion; see Yaari [41, 42], Chew, Karni and Safra [5], Roëll [32],
Chateauneuf, Cohen and Meilijson [4], Ryan [35] and Eeckhoudt and Laeven [12]. This does,
however, not apply to the probability premium, which has almost never been considered in
non-EU.3 As a contribution of independent interest, we provide a local approximation to the
probability premium under RDU and establish the corresponding global results. As is wellknown, RDU encompasses EU and DT as special cases and is the main building block of
(cumulative) prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman [38]).4
We exploit our local approximation to the probability premium to show that RDU and EU
DMs usually exhibit first-order attitude towards probability, whereas a DT DM with smooth
probability weighting function displays second-order probability attitude. Our results apply to
quite general utility and probability weighting functions under RDU. In particular, we allow
for inverse s-shaped probability weighting functions such as those in Prelec [30] and Wu and
Gonzalez [43], which are relevant for descriptive purposes (Abdellaoui [1]). That is, we allow
for violations of e.g., global risk aversion.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide our generalized definition of the
probability premium. In Section 3 we introduce first- and second-order probability aversion.
Section 4 applies first- and second-order probability aversion to explore a risk sharing problem.
In Section 5 we develop our local approximation to the probability premium under RDU,
analyze the degree of probability aversion under RDU, and establish the corresponding global
results. Proofs are relegated to Appendix A. Appendix B generalizes the definition of the
probability premium and our local approximation results to cover non-binary risks.

Probability Premium

We start by considering a risk C yielding outcomes −ε2 and ε2 with probabilities p0 and 1 − p0 ,

respectively, as represented in Figure 1:5,6

To our best knowledge, the only exception is the note by Eeckhoudt and Laeven [10] providing graphical
illustrations.

Henceforth, in all figures, values alongside the arrows represent probabilities, while values at the end of the
arrows represent outcomes.

We assume 0 < p0 < 1 and ε2 > 0.

We obtain D from C by moving a probability ε1 from both states of C to a new intermediate
state with outcome 0. Of course, D is a mean-preserving contraction of C (in the sense of
Rothschild and Stiglitz [34]), and is thus viewed as an improvement by any (strongly) riskaverse DM.8
We can adapt the probability of the occurrence of the unfavorable state in C from p0 to
p0 − μ, and adapt the probability of the occurrence of the favorable state in C from 1 − p0 to

1 − p0 + μ accordingly, such that the DM becomes indifferent between the resulting risk C(μ)
represented in Figure 3 and the risk D of Figure 2.
7

We assume 0 < ε1 < min{p0 , 1 − p0 }.
Conventionally, risk aversion is often defined as a preference for a sure wealth level to a risky wealth position
with the same expectation. This definition of risk aversion is sometimes referred to as "weak risk aversion". A
stronger definition of risk aversion consists in requiring a preference for mean-preserving contractions (Rothschild
and Stiglitz [34]) of payoff distributions, also when the resulting payoff distribution is non-degenerate. Yet
another, more elementary, definition of risk aversion requires that preferences are payoff (or outcome) convex
(Yaari [40]). Under EU, all three definitions agree, but this is no longer the case in non-EU; see e.g., Chew and
Mao [6], Cohen [7], Nau [27] and Machina [23]. We will henceforth adopt the second definition of risk aversion
that draws upon Rothschild and Stiglitz [34].

(Of course, C(0) ≡ C.) Naturally the difference, μ, between the initial probability of the

unfavorable state, p0 , and the adapted probability of the unfavorable state, p0 − μ, represents
the probability premium corresponding to the risk change from C to D. The probability

premium may be positive or negative depending on whether the DM is risk averse or risk
seeking.
From the perspective of income inequality, the transformation from C to D may be interpreted to reduce the proportion of rich and poor people, and to increase the proportion of
middle class people. The probability premium may then be interpreted as the increase in the
proportion of rich people (and reduction of the proportion of poor people accordingly) in C
that makes it equivalent to D.
We note that μ occurs as a natural generalization of Pratt's [28] probability premium to the
situation of risk changes with probability mass less than unity. Indeed, this becomes readily
apparent upon omitting the common components of C(μ) and D, yielding C(μ) \ (C(μ) ∩ D)
and D \ (C(μ) ∩ D) represented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

definition.9

We show in Section 5.4 that our definition of the probability premium satisfies

our definition of the probability premium is a natural generalization of Pratt's

the appropriate comparative risk aversion results under RDU, including EU and DT special
cases. Appendix B further generalizes the definition of the probability premium to apply to
non-binary risks.

First- and Second-Order Probability Aversion

Employing the probability premium thus defined, we state the following definition.
Definition 3.1 A DM is first-order probability averse (seeking) at the point (w0 , p0 ) if
∂μ
∂ε1

ε1 =0+

> (<) 0,

(3.1)

and is second-order probability averse (seeking) at (w0 , p0 ) if
∂μ
∂ε1

ε1 =0

= 0,

∂μ2
∂ε21

and

ε1 =0+

> (<) 0.

(3.2)

In other words, we say that a DM's attitude towards probability is of order 1 if his probability premium μ(ε1 ) is not of smaller order than ε1 , i.e., μ(ε1 ) is not o(ε1 ). Similarly, a DM's
attitude towards probability is of order 2 if his probability premium is of smaller order than ε1
but not of smaller order than ε21 , i.e., μ(ε1 ) is o(ε1 ) but not o(ε21 ).
The (strict) signs of the partial derivatives in (3.1) and (3.2), determining whether attitude
towards probability is of order 1 or of order 2, have important economic applications; see
Section 4 where these concepts are applied to analyze risk sharing.
We state the following theorem, which is instrumental to our results that follow. Recall C,
D and C(*) defined in Figures 1–3.
Theorem 3.2 Let m > 0. A second-order probability-averse DM prefers C(mε1 ) to D for
sufficiently small ε1 . If m > 0 is small enough, a first-order probability-averse DM prefers D
to C(mε1 ) for sufficiently small ε1 .
Theorem 3.2 reveals that a first-order probability averter facing risk C may reject to replace
it by the actuarially more favorable risk C(mε1 ) and opt for the mean-preserving contraction
D instead, even when the probability mass associated with the contraction is very small.
9

While the comparison between C and D is a comparison between two risks (like in Ross [33], Machina and
Schmeidler [26] and Pratt [29]), Figures 4 and 5 show that it is essentially a Pratt-Arrow-comparison between
a risk and a fixed wealth level with the same probability mass, which we now allow to be less than unity.

6

The orders of probability aversion can be viewed as the probability equivalents of the
orders of risk aversion. Indeed, in important work, Segal and Spivak [37] introduce firstand second-order risk aversion. They consider the risk premium of Pratt [28] and Arrow
[2, 3] and analyze its limiting behavior for a zero-mean risk with payoff tending to zero. If
the risk premium behaves proportionally to the size of the (squared) payoff of the risk, the
DM exhibits first- (second-)order risk aversion. Whether attitude towards risk is a first- or
second-order phenomenon, is shown to have important implications for insurance coverage and
portfolio choice. Indeed, a first-order risk-averse DM may buy full insurance coverage even if
the insurance premium carries a positive safety loading, contrary to a second-order risk-averse
DM, who only prefers actuarially fair full insurance coverage. Likewise, under first-order risk
aversion, an investor may choose not to invest in a risky asset despite its mean being positive,
contrary to under second-order risk aversion.
The two measures given by the risk premium and-our generalization of-the probability
premium both evaluate how to counteract the effect of a mean-preserving contraction. That
is, both measures capture the intensity of the aversion to mean-preserving spreads. The orders
of probability aversion introduced in this paper describe how to counteract a mean-preserving
contraction marginally through the probability lens, i.e., by a shift in probabilities, while the
orders of risk aversion describe how a mean-preserving contraction can be off-set marginally
by a change in outcome.

Risk Sharing

This section presents an application of first- and second-order probability aversion to a simple
risk sharing problem. It reveals that a first-order probability-averse individual facing a risk
with a small loss probability may prefer to share his risk in a pool of individuals instead of
bearing the risk himself, even when the other individuals' loss probability is larger than the
probability of occurrence of the individual's own loss. By contrast, a second-order probabilityaverse individual facing this risk only prefers to engage in actuarially fair risk sharing.
This result may be viewed as a dual version of Mossin's [25] Theorem.10 Indeed, this
well-known and seminal result entails that a second-order risk-averse individual only prefers
actuarially fair full insurance, and opts for a partial insurance contract if the insurance premium
carries a positive safety loading. A first-order risk-averse individual, however, may prefer full
insurance even in the presence of a small positive safety loading.
In Mossin's Theorem the trade-off between risk aversion and a positive safety loading occurs
in the "payoff plane". In our result, the trade-off between probability aversion and actuarially
unfair loss probabilities occurs in the "probability plane".
10

We refer to Segal and Spivak [37] and Machina [23] for an insightful exposition of Mossin's Theorem, as well
as to the textbook treatment in Eeckhoudt, Gollier and Schlesinger [8], Chapter 3.

Actuarially Unfavorable Risk Sharing

Consider an individual who faces a risk A of losing ` > 0 with probability ε1 > 0:
Figure 6: Risk A

Throughout this section, ε1 is considered to be "small". Of course, any risk-averse individual
prefers to replace A by the risk B, which is a mean-preserving contraction of A:
Figure 7: Risk B

Risk B can be interpreted as the result of a risk sharing contract between two individuals both
facing a mutually exclusive risk of losing ` with probability ε1 . The two individuals form a
pool and share the possible loss-` with probability of occurrence 2ε1 -equally, each bearing
`/2.
Because ε1 is assumed to be small, the same situation occurs up to the leading order in ε1
when the risks of the two individuals are independent instead of mutually exclusive. Indeed,
under independence, equal risk sharing leads to an allotted risk

More generally, any risk-averse DM prefers to replace A by the risk B (n) :

where n ≥ 2. Indeed, while B is a mean-preserving contraction of A, B (n) is a mean-preserving

contraction of both A and B. The preference of B (n) to A can be interpreted as a preference
for risk sharing among individuals facing risks with the same binary loss distribution, i.e.,
actuarially fair risk sharing.
Theorem 3.2 now implies that, for sufficiently small m > 0, a first-order probability-averse
individual even prefers to replace the risk A∗ represented in Figure 9:

which is more favorable when compared to A, by the previous risk sharing contract yielding
B (n) , n ≥ 2, in Figure 8. The preference of B (n) to A∗ can be given the interpretation of a
preference for risk sharing among individuals even when other individuals' losses are slightly
more likely to occur than the individual's own loss.11
By contrast, a second-order probability-averse individual prefers A∗ to B whenever m > 0.
In fact, under second-order probability aversion, A∗ is even preferred to B (n) as soon as m > 0.
That is, when other individuals' losses are more likely to occur than the individual's own loss,
there is no longer a preference for risk sharing. A second-order probability-averse individual
will only engage in risk sharing when other individuals' losses have at most the same probability
of occurrence as the individual's own loss.12
11

Indeed, the probability of a loss in risk B (n) , which is nε1 , is larger than n times the probability of a loss in
risk A∗ , which is (1 − m) ε1 , that is, nε1 > n (1 − m) ε1 .
12
Formally, this follows from the fact that under second-order probability aversion the probability premium
that achieves indifference between A(μ) and B (n) is of order O(ε21 ), while the probability shift from A to A∗ is
of order O(ε1 ).

9

Summarizing, we have shown that under first-order probability aversion a preference for risk
sharing exists even when other individuals' losses have slightly larger probability of occurrence;
under second-order probability aversion there is merely a preference for actuarially fair risk
sharing.

4.2

A Graphical Representation

We now provide a graphical representation of the risk sharing problem. Figure 10 displays
preferences over changes in probabilities and is an appropriate modification of a MarschakMachina triangle ([24], [21]), better suited for our purposes. It can be viewed as the dual
counterpart of a classic Hirshleifer-Yaari diagram ([15, 16], [39, 40]) that displays preferences
over changes in outcomes.

A point (q, p) in Figure 10 represents a risk for which outcome −` occurs with probability

p, outcome −`/2 occurs with probability q, and outcome 0 occurs with probability 1 − p − q.
That is, the point (q, p) represents the risk given in Figure 11:

Of course, the point (0, p0 ) indicated by A in Figure 10 represents the situation of no risk
sharing, whereas the point (2ε1 , p0 − ε1 ) indicated by B represents risk sharing.13 The solid

chord AB in Figure 10 represents an iso-expected value line. It can be viewed as the DM's
initial "budget line" when sharing risk.
We also illustrate in Figure 10 the indifference curves of a first-order probability averter
(dashed) and a second-order probability averter (dashed-dotted) that touch the no risk sharing
point (0, p0 ). Such an indifference curve describes the set of points (q, p) that make the DM
equally well off as the no risk sharing situation.
To determine these indifference curves without imposing additional assumptions on the
preference functional, we proceed as follows, exploiting geometric "self-similarity".14 For given
p0 , ε1 and arbitrary q̄, with 0 < q̄ < 2ε1 , we find p∗∗ , with 0 < p∗∗ < p∗ := p0 + μ∗ (ε1 ), such
that

The exposition and analysis have so far focused on the situation in which p0 ≡ ε1 , hence p0 is small just
like ε1 . We now consider the more general case in which we allow for arbitrary p0 (with 0 < p0 < 1 and
0 < ε1 ≤ min{p0 , 1 − p0 }). That is, A and B in Figure 10 are the analogs of risks A and B in Figures 6 and 7,
but p0 is no longer restricted to equal ε1 .
14
If the functional form of the preference representation were known, one could easily compute its total
differential, by taking the partial derivatives with respect to q and p, and equate it to zero. The slope of the
indifference curve would then be given by minus the ratio of the representation's partial derivatives with respect
to q and p.

11

See Figure 12, where this procedure of constructing the indifference curve by geometric selfsimilarity is illustrated for the first-order risk averter. (The analogous figure for the secondorder risk averter is similar.)

Notes: Starting from the given values of p0 and ε1 , we determine p∗ and the associated probability premium
μ∗ (ε1 ) such that p∗ − μ∗ (ε1 ) = p0 , and consider the blue solid triangle. Note that, by the definition of the
probability premium μ∗ (ε1 ), the DM is indifferent between the points (0, p0 ) and (2ε1 , p∗ − ε1 ). Next, for

the arbitrarily given value of q̄, we determine p∗∗ and the associated probability premium μ∗∗ 12 q̄ such that

p∗∗ − μ∗∗ 12 q̄ = p∗ − μ∗ (ε1 ) = p0 . The DM is now indifferent between the points (0, p0 ), (q̄, p∗∗ − 12 q̄) and
(2ε1 , p∗ − ε1 ). See the blue dotted triangle, which is geometrically self-similar to the blue solid triangle.

From Eqn. (4.1), one readily verifies that the slope of the indifference curve in A, i.e., at
(0, p0 ), is given by
∂p(q̄)
∂ q̄

q̄=0+

.

Hence, when the DM exhibits attitude towards probability of order 2, the indifference curve
is tangent to the iso-expected value line at (0, p0 ); see the dashed-dotted curve in Figure 10.
However, when the DM's attitude towards probability is of order 1, the indifference curve at
(0, p0 ) is not tangent to, but departs faster from, the iso-expected value line; see the dashed
curve in Figure 10.
The DM seeks to move the indifference curve southwestward (as indicated by the arrow),
towards the origin where he is better off, but is subject to the budget restriction. Therefore,
when the choice menu consists of A and B, both the first- and second-order risk averter prefer
B; see Figure 13.

12

2ε1

Now imagine a change in the budget line from AB to A∗ B; see Figure 14. Of course, the
risk A∗ is more favorable than the risk A. In this new situation, risk A∗ corresponds to no risk
sharing whereas risk B corresponds to risk sharing with an individual who has a larger loss
probability. Figure 14 now reveals that a first-order probability averter may still prefer the risk
sharing contract (2ε1 , p0 − ε1 ) as long as A∗ does not become too favorable.
Figure 14: Actuarially Unfavorable Risk Sharing

2ε1

Indeed, after moving his indifference curve (dashed) southwestward as far as possible in the new
13

situation, it lies below the new budget line, except at the point (2ε1 , p0 − ε1 ). By contrast, the
second-order probability averter will always opt to bear the risk himself instead of engaging in
actuarially unfavorable risk sharing. Indeed, after moving his indifference curve southwestward
towards the origin, his indifference curve (dashed-dotted) lies below the new budget line except
in A∗ .
Thus, even when others have more unfavorable loss probabilities than the individual himself,
first-order probability aversion may induce a preference for risk sharing when facing a risk with
a small loss probability. By contrast, a second-order probability averter facing the same risk
does not engage in actuarially unfavorable risk sharing.

4.3

Risk Sharing Conclusion

Of course, when the probability mass associated with the unfavorable outcome of the risk to be
shared is sufficiently large, and the discrepancy between the individual's own loss probability
and that of the other individual(s) is not too large, both a first- and a second-order risk averter
benefit from actuarially unfavorable risk sharing. The analysis in the section therefore quite
naturally restricts attention to the case of small loss probabilities, which are also practically
most relevant.
Our analysis reveals that in this setting a first-order probability averter may immediately
start to share his risk whenever the opportunity arises, even when the individual's own loss
probability is smaller than that of the other individual(s) (as long as the discrepancy between
the individual's own loss probability and that of the other individual(s) does not become too
large). By contrast, a second-order probability averter only engages in actuarially fair risk
sharing.

Rank-Dependent Utility

In this section, we analyze the probability premium and attitude towards probability under
Yaari's [42] dual theory of choice under risk (DT) and, more generally and behaviorally more
relevant, under the rank-dependent utility model (RDU; Quiggin [31]).
Under DT, a risk with cumulative distribution function F is evaluated according to
Z
x dh (F (x)) ,

(5.1)

where, here and in the sequel, the integral runs over the support of F .15 The probability
weighting (distortion) function h maps the unit interval onto itself, satisfies h(0) = 0 and
h(1) = 1, and is supposed to be non-decreasing. For n-state risks with payoffs x1 ≤ * * * ≤ xn
15

Formally, (5.1) is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

14

and associated probabilities p1 , . . . , pn , (5.1) can be expressed as

The DT evaluation occurs as a special case of the RDU model which evaluates a risk with
cumulative distribution function F by the preference functional
Z
U (x) dh (F (x)) .

(5.2)

The utility function U is unique up to positive affine transformations and is supposed to be
non-decreasing, and h is as above.16 Henceforth, unless otherwise stated, we assume U and
h to be twice continuously differentiable with U 0 > 0 and h0 > 0. Of course, the EU model
occurs as a special case when h is the identity, while the DT model arises when U is affine.17

Local Approximation to the Probability Premium

Note that h̄(0) = 0, h̄(1) = 1, that h̄ is non-decreasing, and that h̄00 > 0 is equivalent to h00 < 0. The condition
h00 < 0, jointly with U 00 < 0, means that the RDU DM is "strongly risk averse" in the sense of aversion to any
mean-preserving increase in risk à la Rothschild and Stiglitz [34] (Chew, Karni and Safra [5] and Roëll [32]).

The terms associated with the low and high wealth level states partially cancel. Those terms that cancel
are suppressed.

which reduces to
0 = h(p0 − ε1 ) − 2h(p0 − μ) + h(p0 + ε1 ).

(5.3)

Eqn. (5.3) does not in general admit an explicit solution. As in the local risk aversion
approach of Pratt [28] and Arrow [2, 3], a very insightful dissection of the probability premium
can be obtained by considering "small risks". The resulting local approximation disentangles
the complex interplay between the probability distribution of the risk change and the DM's
preferences that the probability premium depends on. Throughout, our designation "small"
in "small risks" will refer to risks that have small (unconditional) probabilities under DT and
both small payoffs (i.e., outcomes) and small (unconditional) probabilities under RDU.
Indeed, from (5.3), a first-order Taylor series expansion of h(p0 − μ) around p0 , and a

second-order Taylor series expansion of h(p0 ± ε1 ) around p0 , yield
0 ' ε21 h00 (p0 ) + 2μh0 (p0 ),
hence

1 h00 (p0 )
μ ' − ε21 0
.
2 h (p0 )

(5.4)

Next, we consider the probability premium under RDU, obtained as the solution to
(h(p0 + ε1 ) − h(p0 − ε1 )) U (w0 )
= (h(p0 − μ) − h(p0 − ε1 )) U (w0 − ε2 ) + (h(p0 + ε1 ) − h(p0 − μ)) U (w0 + ε2 ).

(5.5)

Just like under DT, we approximate the solution to (5.5) by suitable Taylor series expansions.
We first invoke a second-order Taylor series expansion of U (w0 ± ε2 ) around w0 to obtain
1 U 00 (w0 )
2h(p0 − μ) ' h(p0 − ε1 ) + h(p0 + ε1 ) + (h(p0 + ε1 ) − h(p0 − ε1 )) ε1 0
.
2 U (w0 )
Next, a first-order Taylor series expansion of h(p0 − μ) around p0 , and a second-order Taylor
series expansion of h(p0 ± ε1 ) around p0 , yields

1
U 00 (w0 ) 1 2 h00 (p0 )
μ ' − ε1 ε2 0
− ε1 0
.
2
U (w0 )
2 h (p0 )

(5.6)

Eqn. (5.6) reveals that the interplay between the ratios of second and first derivatives of the
utility function and probability weighting function are central in dictating the local approximation to the probability premium. As we will see in Section 5.4, the local indexes
h00 (p0 )
h0 (p0 )

U 00 (w0 )
U 0 (w0 )

and

are the appropriate measures of the intensity of risk aversion under RDU also from a

global perspective.

16

5.2

Maxiance and Variance

To fully appreciate the local approximations (5.4) and (5.6) to the probability premium under
the DT and RDU models, we introduce the maxiance or second dual moment about the mean.
Of course, for a risk ε̃ with cumulative distribution function F , the first (primal and dual)
moment can be expressed as

Z
m := E [ε̃] =

x dF (x),

(5.7)

whereas the second primal moment about the mean, or variance, is given by
h
i Z
m2 := E (ε̃ − m)2 = (x − m)2 dF (x).

(5.8)

The second dual moment about the mean, or maxiance, is defined by
i
h

m̄2 := E max ε̃(1) , ε̃(2) − E [ε̃] ,

(5.9)

where ε̃(1) and ε̃(2) are two independent copies of ε̃.
The maxiance represents the expectation of the largest among two independent draws of
the risk ε̃ beyond the mean. It can be expressed as
Z
m̄2 =

(x − m) d (F (x))2 .

(5.10)

Comparing (5.8) and (5.10) shows that the maxiance is a measure of risk in the "probability
plane", contrary to the variance, which is a measure of risk in the "payoff plane".
For a zero-mean risk, one may verify that
i
h

E min ε̃(1) , ε̃(2) = −m̄2 .

(5.11)

Arguably the miniance in (5.11), i.e., the worst among two independent draws of ε̃, is a more
natural measure of "risk", but from (5.11) we observe that for zero-mean risks the miniance
coincides with the maxiance up to a change of sign.
Dual moments play the same role in inverse (or dual) stochastic dominance as primal
moments in stochastic dominance; see Muliere and Scarsini [26] and Eeckhoudt, Laeven and
Schlesinger [11]. We also note that the first and second primal moments are generated by linear
and quadratic utility functions in EU, while the first and second dual moments correspond to
linear and quadratic probability weighting functions in DT. We refer to Eeckhoudt and Laeven
[12] and the references therein for further details about the maxiance.
Employing the variance and the maxiance we can re-write (5.6) as follows:
m2

− 0
U (w0 )



17

(5.12)

where m2 and m̄2 are the unconditional variance and maxiance of the risk ε̃12 describing the
mean-preserving spread from D to C. Unconditionally, the risk ε̃12 assumes the values ±ε2

each with probability ε1 ; see Figure 15 which shows that C is obtained from D by attaching
the binary zero-mean risk ε̃12 taking the values ±ε2 to the intermediate branch of D.

Furthermore, Py denotes the 1-norm (or absolute-value norm or L1 -norm) of the payoffs of
ε̃12 .19
Note that, when ε1 = 21 , the first term in (5.12) agrees with Pratt's [28] local approximation
to the probability premium in the EU model.20 Furthermore, the second term in (5.12) can be
recognized as the local approximation to the probability premium in the DT model; see (5.4).
Thus, the local approximation to the probability premium under the RDU model occurs as the
(suitably scaled) sum of the EU and DT probability premia, where the variance and maxiance
are on equal footing.
In Appendix B, we show that the local approximation to the RDU probability premium in
(5.12) also generalizes naturally to non-binary risks. Appendix B focuses on the RDU model of
which both the EU and DT models are special cases. We note that both the local approximation
in (5.12) and the results in Appendix B are novel already when restricted to the EU model.
Indeed, Pratt [28] only considers the EU model with p0 = ε1 = 12 .

5.3

Attitude Towards Probability

Under the standing assumption that U and h are twice continuously differentiable with U 0 > 0
and h0 > 0, we state the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1 A DT DM has attitude towards probability of second order at the points where
19

One readily verifies that for ε̃12 , unconditionally, m2 = 2ε1 ε22 , m̄2 = 2ε21 ε2 , and Py = 2ε2 .
We note that in Pratt [28], the probability premium is originally defined as the ex post difference between the
probability of the favorable outcome and the probability of the unfavorable outcome, i.e., 2μ. Pratt's convention
is not followed in the recent literature, where the probability premium is the ex post shift in the probability from
the unfavorable outcome to the favorable outcome, i.e., μ; see e.g., Liu and Neilson [20].
20

18

h00 6= 0. An EU and RDU DM has attitude towards probability of first order at the points where

U 00 6= 0 (for almost every ε2 ).

Now consider the DT model and suppose that the probability weighting function h : [0, 1] →

[0, 1] is non-decreasing and not differentiable at p0 , but has left and right derivatives h0− (p0 )
and h0+ (p0 ), with h0− (p0 ) 6= h0+ (p0 ). Then we state the following result.
Theorem 5.2 A DT DM has attitude towards probability of first order at the points where the
probability weighting function is not differentiable but has left and right derivatives.
An example of such a probability weighting function is given by
(
h(p) =

p
1−p0 ,

1,

0 ≤ p ≤ 1 − p0 ;

1 − p0 < p ≤ 1.

(5.13)

In financial risk management, this probability weighting function gives rise to that AverageValue-at-Risk (AV@R).
We thus find that RDU and EU maximizers usually exhibit first-order probability aversion, while DT DMs with smooth probability weighting function are second-order probability
averters. From Segal and Spivak [37] we already know that RDU and DT maximizers usually
exhibit first-order risk aversion, while EU DMs with smooth utility function are risk averse of
order 2. That is, under the RDU model, both probability aversion and risk aversion are usually
first-order phenomena.
We note also that expected value maximization-popular in operations research (e.g., in
optimal stopping)-, law-invariant comonotonic coherent risk measures-popular in financial
risk management (e.g., Föllmer and Schied [14], Chapter 4)-, and linear (or affine) utility
models-popular in economics especially for small stakes-, usually induce second-order probability aversion.

5.4

Comparative Risk Aversion

In this subsection, we show that the local approximation to the RDU probability premium can
be naturally linked to global results on comparative risk aversion under RDU. Note first that
(5.12) reveals that, for small zero-mean risks, the probability premium μ is affine in the primal
and dual local indexes of absolute risk aversion

Next, note that the definition of the probability premium in Section 2, Figure 3, applies irrespective of whether ε1 and ε2 are "small" or "large".21
21

Only 0 < ε1 ≤ min{p0 , 1 − p0 } and ε2 > 0 are required.

19

Theorem 5.3 Consider two RDU maximizers with utility function Ui and probability weighting
function hi , i = 1, 2. Let μi (p0 , w0 , ε1 , ε2 ) be their respective probability premia, which occur
as the solutions to (5.5). Then the following statements are equivalent.
U 00 (x)

for all x ∈ R and all p ∈ (0, 1).

1

for all w0 ∈ R, all ε2 > 0, and all 0 < ε1 ≤

The statements apply mutatis mutandis when the domain of the utility functions is only a
subset of R.
From Pratt [28], Yaari [41] and Eeckhoudt and Laeven [12], statement (i) is known to be
equivalent to U2 and h2 being concavifications of U1 and h1 , i.e., there exist functions φ and ψ
with φ0 > 0, φ00 ≤ 0, ψ 0 > 0, ψ 00 ≤ 0, ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 1 such that
U2 (x) := φ (U1 (x))

and

h2 (p) := ψ (h1 (p)) ,

for all x ∈ R and all p ∈ [0, 1].

Theorem 5.3 generalizes Pratt's results on the probability premium in two directions: to risk

changes with probability mass less than unity and, more significantly, to RDU. Furthermore,
as the DT model occurs as a special case of the RDU model, it is also covered by the results
in Theorem 5.3. The generality of the results in Theorem 5.3, and in particular the joint
presence of both the utility function and the probability weighting function, makes its proof
more complex than that in Pratt [28]. The proof of Theorem 5.3 is in Appendix A and relies
on analyzing the total differential of the RDU functional.
Global results on comparative risk aversion under RDU are already in Yaari [41], Chew,
Karni and Safra [5], and Roëll [32]. As D is a mean-preserving contraction of C, these existing
global results may in principle be invoked to imply (i)⇒(ii), although none of the existing results
under RDU refers to the probability premium. The implication (ii)⇒(i) is new. It establishes
the formal connection between a local approach to the probability premium and global risk
aversion within RDU. An analog of Theorem 5.3 for the risk premium is in Eeckhoudt and
Laeven [12].

5.5

Comparison to the Risk Premium

As an alternative to the construction of the probability premium in Section 2, Figure 3, we
could have adapted the outcome of the intermediate state of D from 0 to −λ such that the
DM becomes indifferent between C and D(λ); see Figure 16.

(Of course, D(0) ≡ D.) This would naturally gives rise to the risk premium λ associated to

the risk change from C to D; see Eeckhoudt and Laeven [12]. One easily verifies that the risk
premium of Pratt [28] and Arrow [2, 3] occurs as a special case in the comparison between
C and D(λ) when p0 = ε1 =

1
2.

Then, one compares a risk to a sure loss equal to the risk

premium.
Eeckhoudt and Laeven [12] develop a local approximation to the risk premium λ. Their
approximation takes the form

where Pr is the total unconditional probability mass associated to ε̃12 .22 Just like in (5.12), the
local approximations to the EU and DT risk premia follow as special cases by setting h(p) ≡ p
for EU and U (x) ≡ x for DT.

Upon comparing (5.12) and (5.14), we obtain the following link between the risk and prob-

ability premia:
μPy = λPr.

(5.15)

Observe that the units of measurement on both sides of (5.15) agree, as μ and Pr are dimensionless.

Conclusion

For many years, and despite its appeal, the probability premium of Pratt [28] has been overshadowed by its more prevalent siblings given by the risk premium and the local index of
absolute risk aversion.
22

Observe that, for ε̃12 , Pr = 2ε1 .

21

In this paper, we have generalized Pratt's construction of the probability premium and have
used it to introduce and analyze attitudes towards probability. By developing a local approximation to the probability premium under rank-dependent utility as a by-product of significant
interest in its own right, we have shown that rank-dependent and expected utility maximizers
usually display attitude towards probability of order 1, whereas dual theory maximizers-as
well as expected value maximizers, investors using law-invariant comonotonic coherent risk
measures, and economic agents using affine utility models-typically exhibit attitude towards
probability of order 2.
We have illustrated the relevance of first- and second-order probability aversion in a problem
of risk sharing. Our results reveal that for a first-order risk averter facing a risk with a small
loss probability there are immediately significant benefits to risk sharing opportunities. He may
therefore opt for risk sharing even when actuarially unfavorable. By contrast, for a secondorder risk averter the initial benefits of risk sharing opportunities are negligible. A second-order
risk averter likes actuarially fair risk sharing. However, when facing a risk with a small loss
probability, he always avoids actuarially unfavorable risk sharing. That is, only first-order
probability averters like to engage in risk sharing if the probability of the occurrence of other
individuals' losses is more unfavorable than that of the individual's own loss, when faced with
a risk with a small loss probability.
We hope that our approach and results contribute to a widespread analysis and use of the
appealing concept of the probability premium.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem 3.2. Consider the probability premium μ(ε1 ), which makes the DM
indifferent in the comparison between C(μ) (Figure 3) and D (Figure 2). In addition, consider
the probability premium μ(ε1 , m), obtained as the solution that makes the DM indifferent in
the comparison between the risk C(μ, m):

which proves the stated result.

Proof of Theorem 5.1. From our local approximation to the probability premium under
DT, we have

1 h00 (p0 )
μ = − ε21 0

2 h (p0 )

which readily yields the first stated result. Next, from our local approximation to the probability premium under RDU, we have

which yields the second stated result.

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Recall the indifference relation that defines the DT probability
premium:
0 = (h(p0 − μ) − h(p0 − ε1 )) (−1) + (h(p0 + ε1 ) − h(p0 − μ)) (1) ,
hence
0 = h(p0 − ε1 ) − 2h(p0 − μ) + h(p0 + ε1 ).
Then, upon differentiating both sides and taking the limit for ε1 ↓ 0, we obtain

Proof of Theorem 5.3. We first note that, due to Pratt [28], Yaari [41] and Eeckhoudt and
Laeven [12], statement (i) is equivalent to
(iii)

U2 (y)−U2 (x)
U2 (w)−U2 (v)

U1 (y)−U1 (x)

and

h2 (s)−h2 (r)
h2 (q)−h2 (p)

≤

h1 (s)−h1 (r)
h1 (q)−h1 (p)

for all v < w ≤ x < y and all

Next, we will prove that the equivalent statements (i) and (iii) imply statement (ii). Consider Eqn. (5.5) and fix an arbitrary ε2 > 0. Clearly, if ε1 → 0 in (5.5), then μi → 0. Define

24

the function
Wi (μi , ε1 ) := (hi (p0 + ε1 ) − hi (p0 − ε1 )) Ui (w0 )
− ((hi (p0 − μi ) − hi (p0 − ε1 )) Ui (w0 − ε2 )
+ (hi (p0 + ε1 ) − hi (p0 − μi )) Ui (w0 + ε2 )) ,

i = 1, 2,

and consider its total differential
dWi =

∂Wi
∂Wi
dμi +
dε1 .
∂μi
∂ε1

It takes the form
dWi = −h0i (p0 − μi ) (Ui (w0 + ε2 ) − Ui (w0 − ε2 )) dμi


+ h0i (p0 − ε1 ) (Ui (w0 ) − Ui (w0 − ε2 )) − h0i (p0 + ε1 ) (Ui (w0 + ε2 ) − Ui (w0 )) dε1 .

We equate the total differential to zero. We thus obtain
dμi
Ui (w0 ) − Ui (w0 − ε2 ) h0i (p0 − ε1 )
Ui (w0 + ε2 ) − Ui (w0 ) h0i (p0 + ε1 )
=
−

dε1
Ui (w0 + ε2 ) − Ui (w0 − ε2 ) h0i (p0 − μi ) Ui (w0 + ε2 ) − Ui (w0 − ε2 ) h0i (p0 − μi )
Using statements (i) and (iii) we will show that, for RDU DM i = 2, the first two fractions on
the right-hand side of (A.1) are larger than or equal to the corresponding fractions for RDU
DM i = 1, while the last two fractions are weakly smaller for DM i = 2 than for DM i = 1.
(All four fractions are positive for i = 1, 2.)
Indeed, first invoking statement (i), we obtain, as in Pratt [28], Eqn. (20),
U10 (x)
U20 (x)
≤
(≥)
,
U20 (w)
U10 (w)

for w < (>)x,

(A.2)

and we note that the utility function Ui can be replaced by the probability weighting function
hi in (A.2), with the variables w and x restricted to (0, 1). Next, statement (iii) yields
U2 (y) − U2 (x)
U2 (w) − U2 (v)
U1 (y) − U1 (x)
U1 (w) − U1 (v)
+
≤
+
,
U2 (w) − U2 (v) U2 (w) − U2 (v)
U1 (w) − U1 (v) U1 (w) − U1 (v)

for v < w ≤ x < y.

In particular, when w = x this reduces to
U2 (y) − U2 (v)
U1 (y) − U1 (v)
≤
,
U2 (w) − U2 (v)
U1 (w) − U1 (v)
whence

for v < w < y,

U2 (w) − U2 (v)
U1 (w) − U1 (v)
≥
,
U2 (y) − U2 (v)
U1 (y) − U1 (v)

(A.3)

and

U2 (y) − U2 (w)
U1 (y) − U1 (w)
≤
.
U2 (y) − U2 (v)
U1 (y) − U1 (v)

(A.4)

Invoking the inequalities in Eqn. (A.2) (with Ui replaced by hi upon restricting the corresponding domains to (0, 1)) and Eqns. (A.3) and (A.4), we find from (A.1) that
dμ2
dμ1
≥

dε1

(A.5)

hence (ii).
We have thus shown that statement (i) implies statement (ii). It remains to show that (ii)
also implies (i), or, equivalently, that not (i) implies not (ii). To this end, it suffices to note
that if statement (i) fails to hold on some interval (of x or p), then, due to the arbitrariness of
w0 , p0 , ε2 > 0 and ε1 with 0 < ε1 ≤ {p0 , 1 − p0 } < 1, one can always find feasible w0 , p0 , ε2

and ε1 such that (A.5) holds on some interval with the inequality sign strict and reversed, and
as a consequence statement (ii) fails to hold. This completes the proof.

Generalization to n-State Risks

assigning a probability of

to the payoffs xi , i = 1, . . . , n, with x1 ≤ * * * ≤ xn , where

The increments between the xi 's may equal zero; the risk would then feature

unequal state probabilities. We denote by n1 the number of states with negative payoff and let
n2 = n − n1 . Note the generality of this setting.
P
We suppose that ni=1 xi = 0, so the risk has mean equal to zero. We also suppose that
P
|xi | < ε2 for some ε2 > 0, so ni=1 x2i = O(ε22 ).
One easily verifies that the first and second primal and dual moments are given by

Note that m2 = O(ε22 ) and that m̄2 = O(ε21 ).
In this general setting, we define the probability premium of the zero-mean n-state risk as
the (uniform) reduction in the probabilities of the unfavorable (i.e., negative payoff) states,
inducing a (uniform) increase in the probabilities of the favorable states accordingly, such that
the DM is indifferent between bearing and not bearing the risk. Note that this definition of

the probability premium applies irrespective of whether ε1 and ε2 are "small" or "large".
Formally, the RDU probability premium, μ, thus solves
