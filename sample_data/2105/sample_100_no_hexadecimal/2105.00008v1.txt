Variants of the black hole information paradox are studied in Type IIB string theory
setups that realize four-dimensional gravity coupled to a bath. The setups are string theory
versions of doubly-holographic Karch/Randall brane worlds, with black holes coupled to nongravitating and gravitating baths. The 10d versions are based on fully backreacted solutions
for configurations of D3, D5 and NS5 branes, and admit dual descriptions as N = 4 SYM on
a half space and 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFTs. Island contributions to the entanglement entropy
of black hole radiation regions are identified through Ryu/Takayanagi surfaces and lead to
Page curves. Analogs of the critical angles found in the Karch/Randall models are identified
in 10d, as critical parameters in the brane configurations and dual field theories.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

A recent advance in the understanding of black holes are the computations [1, 2] of the time evolution of the entanglement entropy between a holographic black hole system and an external bath

to which the black hole is coupled. A crucial ingredient in these computations are entanglement
islands – contributions to the entanglement entropy (EE) from regions that are disconnected and
can be far away from the bath [3–7]. These contributions become dominant at late times and lead
to a Page curve for the time evolution of the entropy, in line with expectations based on unitarity.
The discussions so far are largely based on bottom-up models and on low-dimensional theories
where the features of gravity are qualitatively different. The special case of a Karch/Randall model
with a tensionless end-of-the-world brane, discussed in [8], can be embedded into Type IIB as an
orbifold of AdS5 × S 5 . But that case is somewhat peculiar in that the 4d graviton has a mass that
can not be separated from the UV cut-off in the 4d gravitational description.
The aim of the present work is to demonstrate in a UV-complete string theory setting the
emergence of entanglement islands and Page curves for black holes in four-dimensional theories of
gravity in which the graviton mass can be controlled, including theories with massless gravitons.
Starting point are the discussions of islands and Page curves in general 5d Karch/Randall models
[8–12], which can be used to model gravitating systems coupled to non-gravitating and gravitating
baths. These models have the appealing feature that the quantum extremal surfaces [13, 14]
exhibiting island contributions are entirely geometrized, due to the doubly-holographic nature of
these models [15, 16]. This allows for the identification of entanglement islands through classical
Ryu/Takayanagi surfaces [17]. We will uplift the discussions in these bottom-up models to Type
IIB string theory, to provide UV completions and concrete holographically dual QFTs.
The string theory constructions are based on holographic duals for 4d boundary CFTs and for
3d SCFTs engineered by configurations of D3, D5 and NS5 branes [18–20]. Holographic duals for
large classes of such theories were constructed in [21–24], and they provide natural string theory
realizations of the Karch/Randall models with non-gravitating and gravitating baths. We will
study quantum extremal/minimal surfaces in these solutions and identify quantities that exhibit
Page curve behavior. The key findings of [8, 11], such as the existence of critical brane angles
separating different phases of minimal surfaces, will find string theory realizations. We will also
identify 10d versions of the "left/right EE" that was found to exhibit Page curve behavior in the
5d models with gravitating bath, where the usual notion of geometric EE becomes subtle.
In the following we will first review relevant aspects of the discussion in the Karch/Randall
models to set the stage and then summarize the main results of this paper.
Islands and Page curves in Karch/Randall models: The Karch/Randall models for 4d
gravity coupled to a non-gravitating bath are based on a part of AdS5 cut off by an end-of-the-world
(ETW) brane extending along an AdS4 slice (fig. 1(a)). The conformal boundary is cut off at the
point where it is intersected by the ETW brane, so that these models are holographically dual to
boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs). The advantage of these setups from the entanglement
islands perspective is that they have 3 holographically related descriptions:
(a) Einstein gravity on (asymptotically) AdS5 + ETW brane
(b) a 4d CFT with UV cut-off + gravity on (asymptotically) AdS4 , coupled via transparent
boundary conditions at the boundary of AdS4 to a 4d CFT on half of R1,3
(c) a non-gravitational 4d CFT on half of R1,3 coupled to 3d boundary degrees of freedom
These descriptions can be understood to arise from applying AdS/CFT twice: description (b) is
obtained by converting the 3d boundary degrees of freedom in (c) to a gravitational theory on
AdS4 , and description (a) geometrizes the entire BCFT.
Description (b) is the one of interest for the black hole information paradox. To pose the
paradox, the AdS4 slices are replaced by AdS4 black holes. This realizes a black hole on the ETW
brane and on the remaining half of the conformal boundary of AdS5 , which serves as bath. It can be

FIG. 1. Left: Karch/Randall model for non-gravitating bath. The figure shows part of AdS5 with the ETW
brane cutting off the shaded region. The dashed curve is the black hole horizon and R is the radiation region
(blue). The green curve ending on the horizon represents the HM surface; the green curve extending from
the boundary of R to the ETW brane is the island surface. I is the island (red). Right: For a gravitating
bath a second ETW brane is introduced, leaving only a 3-dimensional part of the conformal boundary.

interpreted as coupling the gravity system on the ETW brane to a bath at the same temperature
as the black hole. To quantify the entropy of the radiation one picks a region far in the bath
system and computes its EE. One type of surface relevant for computing the EE holographically
are Hartman-Maldacena (HM) surfaces [25], which connect the boundary of the radiation region to
the corresponding point in the thermofield double. Due to the stretching of the space behind the
horizon the area of these surfaces grows in time, suggesting an unbounded growth of the entropy
which is a version of the information paradox [4]. The paradox is resolved by the existence of "island
minimal surfaces" that stretch from the bath into the gravity system (fig. 1(a)). The part of the
ETW brane near the black hole that is captured by the surface constitutes the island contribution.
Its computation is entirely geometrized through the existence of the 5d bulk. The area of the island
surfaces is constant in time, which limits the growth of the entropy and leads to Page curves. As
emphasized in [8], the graviton is generically massive in models with a non-gravitating bath.
A gravitating bath can be realized by introducing a second ETW brane as bath (fig. 1(b))
[11]. This modifies description (b) to now comprise two CFTs coupled to gravity on distinct AdS4
spaces, and coupled to each other at the conformal boundaries. Description (c) is reduced to a 3d
CFT. Since both ETW branes have dynamical gravity, a conventional geometric EE can not be
defined on the second ETW brane. If one allows the end points of minimal surfaces on both ETW
branes to be chosen dynamically, the surfaces can settle on the horizon and lead to a flat entropy
curve, in line with the general arguments of [26]. The quantity that was found to exhibit Page
curve behavior in [11] instead corresponds to minimal surfaces anchored at the remaining point of
the conformal boundary of AdS5 , and was interpreted as EE between defect degrees of freedom
represented by the left and right ETW branes. The form of the entropy curve was found to have
interesting dependence on the ETW brane angles, as will be discussed in more detail below.
Islands and Page curves in Type IIB: In this work we will study 10d string theory versions
of the Karch/Randall models and show that the qualitative features captured by the bottom-up
models are realized in a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. We will discuss black holes
coupled to non-gravitating and to gravitating baths, realized through 10d black hole solutions
based on the AdS4 × S 2 × S 2 × Σ solutions of Type IIB constructed in [21–24].
We start the discussion with non-gravitating baths. The solutions constructed in [21–23] can
be used to describe semi-infinite D3-branes terminating on a system of D5 and NS5 branes with
additional D3-branes suspended between the 5-branes. The brane configurations engineer N = 4
SYM on a half space, corresponding to the semi-infinite D3-branes, coupled to a 3d SCFT on
the boundary, corresponding to the D3-branes suspended between the D5 and NS5 branes. The
structure of the supergravity solutions and brane setups is illustrated in fig. 2. At each point of Σ
there is an AdS4 and two 2-spheres, with independently varying radii. The region x → ∞ where

FIG. 2. Left: Geometry of AdS4 ×S 2 ×S 2 ×Σ solutions with Σ = {x+iy ∈ C| 0 ≤ y ≤ π2 } for non-gravitating
baths. On each boundary component an S 2 collapses, so the 10d geometry is closed. D5/NS5 brane sources
are located on the y = 0/y = π2 boundaries. The limit x → −∞ is a regular point of the internal space.
For x → ∞ the solutions approach locally AdS5 × S 5 ; this region corresponds to the conformal boundary in
fig. 1(a). The ETW brane in fig. 1(a) can be seen as effective description for the remaining 10d geometry.
Right: Associated configuration of D5, NS5 and D3 branes, with D3-branes suspended between 5-branes and

the geometry becomes AdS5 × S 5 is modeled in the Karch/Randall models in fig. 1(a) by the
AdS5 region far away from the ETW brane. The ETW brane itself can be understood as effective
description for the remaining part of the 10d solution, i.e. the region around the 5-brane sources
in fig. 2. We will modify these solutions by introducing black holes on the AdS4 spaces, which
leads to non-supersymmetric solutions of Type IIB that are asymptotic to the supersymmetric seed
solutions and describe the dual QFTs at finite temperature.
The radiation region R will be defined in the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 region at x → ∞ in fig. 2,
while the "physical black hole" corresponds to the region around the 5-brane sources. The surfaces
computing the entanglement entropy of the radiation region wrap both S 2 's and are anchored in
the AdS5 × S 5 region at a fixed value of the AdS4 radial coordinate. For the non-gravitating baths
we construct the HM surfaces explicitly at the time t = 0 when their area is smallest. The minimal
surfaces can be described by specifying the AdS4 radial coordinate r as function of the coordinates
on the Riemann surface x and y. The surfaces extend along the Riemann surface Σ, and either drop
into the horizon in AdS4 along a curve xh (y) (HM surfaces), or extend all the way to x → −∞,
where they can close off smoothly before reaching the horizon in AdS4 (island surfaces).
The extremality condition is a non-linear PDE on Σ. The boundary conditions will be derived
from regularity of the induced metric on the minimal surface, which will give a string theory
justification for the use of Neumann boundary conditions at the ETW brane in the Karch/Randall
models (other boundary conditions in 5d were discussed in [27]). Solutions to the PDE are obtained
numerically. The class of AdS4 ×S 2 ×S 2 ×Σ solutions is very broad, reflecting the breadth of brane
configurations that can be realized with D3, D5 and NS5 branes. We will choose representative
solutions with N5 D5-branes at (x, y) = (0, 0), N5 NS5-branes at (x, y) = (0, π2 ) and 2N5 K semiinfinite D3-branes. Studying more general solutions will be left for the future.
The 8d minimal surfaces can be visualized as 2d surfaces in the 3d space spanned by Σ and
the AdS4 radial direction r, with the horizon at some finite rh . The conformal boundary of AdS4
at r → ∞ corresponds to the defect in fig. 1(a). A sample of island and HM surfaces is shown in
figs. 5, 6. The island surfaces show distinct behavior near the 5-brane sources, which is discussed
in sec. III C. The area differences between island surfaces and HM surfaces at t = 0 are shown in
fig. 7. The results show that for radiation regions starting far in the bath (small r), the HM surface
dominates at t = 0. The area of the HM surface grows in time and sets the initial growth of the
entropy, but the entropy growth is bounded by the constant area of the island surface. This evades
an information paradox and shows that the entropy follows a Page curve.

FIG. 3. Left: AdS4 × S 2 × S 2 × Σ solutions for gravitating baths. The AdS5 × S 5 region is closed off; the
limits x → ±∞ both lead to regular points in the internal space. This leaves the 3d conformal boundary of
AdS4 , corresponding to the remaining point of the conformal boundary in fig. 1(b). Right: The associated
brane configurations have no semi-infinite D3-branes, only D3-branes suspended between 5-branes.

Critical angle: The analysis of [11] found a critical value for the tension/angle of the ETW
brane (θ in fig. 1), where the behavior of the island surfaces changes qualitatively. The critical
angle θc can be defined as follows: At zero temperature, for an island surface anchored at a fixed
point in the bath system, one can ask for the end point on the ETW brane as function of θ. For
θ > θc this is a finite point. As θc is approached, the end point on the ETW brane diverges towards
the Poincaré horizon and below θc there are no more island minimal surfaces.
Remarkably, a similar phenomenon can be identified in 10d. The angle θ in 5d is set by the
tension of the ETW brane, which can be understood as a measure for the number of degrees of
freedom represented by the ETW brane. The relevant parameters in the 10d solutions considered
here are the radius of the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 region, which is set by the number of semi-infinite
D3-branes, and the number of D5 and NS5 branes on which the D3-branes terminate. The latter
determines the 3d SCFT that N = 4 SYM is coupled to at the boundary of the half space. One
may expect that the brane angle in 5d captures the ratio of the number of D3-branes suspended
between 5-branes and the number of semi-infinite D3-branes. This is indeed the case: For island
surfaces at zero temperature, with fixed anchor point in the AdS5 × S 5 region, the end point at
x = −∞ is shown as function of N5 /K, which controls the ratio of suspended and semi-infinite
D3-branes, in fig. 8. The results indicate that there is a critical ratio at which the end point at
x = −∞ runs off towards the Poincaré horizon. For black hole solutions with finite temperature
this behavior is regulated (fig. 9), and island surfaces can be found beyond the critical ratio.
Gravitating baths: For the description of a gravitating bath the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 region
in fig. 2 is closed off. This corresponds to removing the semi-infinite D3-branes from the brane
setup, leaving only D3-branes suspended between D5 and NS5 branes (fig. 3). This is captured
in the 5d Karch/Randall models by the introduction of a second ETW brane. The 10d solutions
are holographic duals for 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFTs [24] and have massless 4d gravitons. Closing off
the AdS5 × S 5 region removes the part in which the radiation region was defined, and a minimal
surface stretching from x = −∞ to x = +∞ now has to satisfy Neumann boundary conditions
on both ends. This allows it to settle onto the black hole horizon and leads to a constant entropy
identical to the thermal entropy of the bath, in line with the general arguments of [26, 28].
One can instead consider minimal surfaces splitting the internal space, which are expected to
compute non-geometric entanglement entropies (whose holographic interpretation was initiated in
[29, 30]). In the Karch/Randall models a "left/right EE", represented by surfaces ending on the
point where the two ETW branes meet in fig. 1(b), was found to exhibit Page curve behavior,
and was interpreted as an internal entanglement entropy in [11]. The Type IIB solutions realize
the dual of the defect as full 10d geometry, making them an ideal setting for studies of minimal
surfaces separating degrees of freedom according to their representation in the internal space.

We consider surfaces wrapping the spatial part of AdS4 , both S 2 's, and a curve in Σ which
depends on the AdS4 radial coordinate. The surfaces are anchored at the conformal boundary of
AdS4 along a curve x(y) in Σ which separates the 5-brane sources and defines a split into black hole
system and bath. Such surfaces may be expected to compute EEs associated with decompositions
of the quiver diagram in the UV description of the dual 3d SCFT. One again has to consider HM
surfaces, extending through the horizon in AdS4 into the thermofield double, and island surfaces
which close off in one of the x → ±∞ regions before reaching the horizon in AdS4 . These are
10d versions of the surfaces in fig. 1(b). The class of AdS4 × S 2 × S 2 × Σ solutions that could be
considered is again broad, and we focus on simple representatives. We include two groups of D5branes and two groups of NS5 branes, placed symmetrically at x = ±δ on the boundary components
of Σ. The separation of the 5-brane sources determines how the D3-branes in the associated brane
configuration are suspended between the 5-branes. Comparing to the Karch/Randall models in
fig. 1(b), these particular 10d solutions correspond to two equal ETW brane angles.
Some 10d island surfaces are shown in fig. 10. The corresponding HM surface is described by
x = 0 and a time-dependent embedding in the AdS4 part of the geometry. The difference in areas
between island and HM surfaces at t = 0 is shown in fig. 11(b). We find that for δ above a "Page
value" δP the HM surface initially dominates at t = 0. The entropy growth indicated by the HM
surfaces is bounded by the constant area of the island surfaces, leading again to Page curves, shown
in fig. 12(b). A second distinguished value for δ can be seen in fig. 11(a): at a critical value δc
the cap-off point of the island surface at x = −∞ diverges towards the conformal boundary of
AdS4 , and no island minimal surfaces are found for δ < δc . The numerical results suggest that δc
is slightly smaller than δP , though we leave the possibility that the difference could be a numerical
artifact. In the small (and possibly empty) range δc < δ < δP the island surfaces are found to
dominate already at t = 0, leading to a flat entropy curve. These results bear striking resemblance
with critical and Page angles found in the Karch/Randall models in [11], suggesting that the ETW
brane angles capture aspects of how the 5-brane sources are distributed on Σ in 10d.
In the regime where no island minimal surfaces were found in the 5d Karch/Randall models in
[11], "tiny island" limiting surfaces, which degenerate to an infinitesimal segment at the defect in
fig. 1(b), were found to dominate and limit the entropy growth indicated by the HM surface. In
10d we find that similar tiny island surfaces connecting the x = 0 locus to x = ±∞ arise for δ < δc .
Outline: The main part is organized as follows. The 10d supergravity solutions are introduced
in sec. II. In sec. III the ansatz for extremal surfaces is discussed along with the extremality and
boundary conditions and the behavior near the 5-branes. The method for constructing minimal
surfaces is summarized in sec. IV. Island surfaces and Page curves are discussed for non-gravitating
baths in sec. V and for gravitating baths in sec. VI. We close with a brief outlook in sec. VII.

TYPE IIB SUPERGRAVITY SOLUTIONS

The general local form of the AdS4 ×S 2 ×S 2 ×Σ solutions that will be used here was constructed
in [21, 22]. For the study of minimal surfaces we will only need the geometry, which is a warped
product of AdS4 and two 2-spheres, S12 and S22 , over a Riemann surface Σ. For the solutions of
interest here Σ can be taken as a strip,
Σ = {z ∈ C | 0 ≤ Im(z) ≤ π/2} .

(1)

On each of the boundary components of the strip one of the S 2 's closes off smoothly, so that the
10d geometry has no boundary. Depending on the nature of the points at infinity, solutions for
different types of field theories can be constructed: Janus solutions, dual to interface CFTs, can be

7
realized if the points Re(z) → ±∞ both correspond to asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 regions. Solutions
with one asymptotic region closed off were constructed in [23] and are dual to BCFTs. Duals for
3d SCFTs were constructed in [24] by closing both asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 regions.
The solutions are generally parametrized by two harmonic functions h1 , h2 on Σ. The Einsteinframe metric takes the form
ds2 = f42 ds24 + f12 ds2S 2 + f22 ds2S 2 + 4ρ2 |dz|2 ,

The expressions for the fluxes and dilaton will not be needed here; they can be found in [21–24].
Based on this local form broad classes of supergravity solutions can be constructed which
describe D3-branes intersecting, ending on, or suspended between D5 and NS5 branes. For the
realization of Karch/Randall models with gravitating and non-gravitating baths we will employ
representative solutions dual to BCFTs and 3d SCFTs, noting that more general solutions could
be considered. The form of the harmonic functions h1 , h2 is

The solutions describe semi-infinite D3-branes ending on D5-branes and NS5-branes which have
additional D3-branes suspended between them. The number of semi-infinite D3-branes is controlled
by K; for K = 0 the solutions describe D3-branes suspended between D5 and NS5 branes. Groups
of D5/NS5 branes are represented by the poles of ∂h1 /∂h2 on the boundary of Σ. The specific
brane configuration can be characterized in terms of linking numbers, which are encoded in the
distribution of the 5-brane sources on Σ [23, 24]. For K 6= 0 an AdS5 × S 5 region emerges at
Re(z) → +∞, with Re(z) becoming the radial coordinate of AdS5 in AdS4 slicing and Im(z)
becoming an angular coordinate on S 5 . For K = 0 the limit Re(z) → ∞ leads to a regular point
in the internal space. The limit Re(z) → −∞ leads to a regular point in both cases.
We discuss the concrete solutions that will be used below first and briefly comment on the more
general picture and dual field theories afterwards. The solutions we will study for non-gravitating
baths are dual to N = 4 SYM on a half space coupled to 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] theories on the boundary.

as in figs. 2, 3. The numbers of D3-branes on the right are controlled by δ through ∆ = 12 + π2 arctan e2δ .

(fig. 1(a)): the asymptotic region at Re(z) → ∞ corresponds to the AdS5 part, while the region with

involves 2N5 K semi-infinite D3-branes ending on a combination of N5 D5-branes and N5 NS5branes (fig. 4(a)). N5 K D3-branes end on the D5 branes and N5 K D3-branes end on the NS5branes, and there are in addition N52 /2 D3-branes suspended between the D5 and NS5 branes.

These solutions describe N52 /2 D3-branes suspended between two groups of D5-branes and two
groups of NS5-branes, with N5 /2 5-branes in each group. There are no semi-infinite D3-branes
and the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 region at Re(z) → ∞ is closed off. The limits Re(z) → ±∞ both
correspond to regular points in the internal space. The 5-brane groups are represented in the
supergravity solutions by sources with N5 /2 D5 and N5 /2 NS5-branes, respectively, at z = ±δ and
z = ±δ + iπ/2. The parameter δ determines how the D3-branes terminate on the D5 and NS5
branes (fig. 4(b)). For δ = 0 the numbers of D3-branes terminating on each group of 5-branes are
equal. Comparing to the 5d Karch/Randall models, the closing off of the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5
region corresponds to the introduction of the second ETW brane in fig. 1(b). The entire 10d
solution corresponds to the remaining wedge of AdS5 in fig. 1(b).
The solutions (6) and (7) are invariant under S-duality (exchange of h1 and h2 ) combined with
z → iπ
2 − z, reflecting that the associated brane configurations are invariant under S-duality (in
fig. 4(a) up to Hanany-Witten transitions). This will be useful below. From now on we set α0 = 1.
Solutions with more general arrangements of 5-brane sources (poles in ∂h1/2 ) and no asymptotic
AdS5 × S 5 region describe configurations of D3-branes suspended between D5 and NS5 branes that
can be characterized by two Young tableaux ρ and σ, which determine how precisely the D3-branes
terminate on the 5-branes. The general relation between the distribution of the 5-brane sources on
the boundary of Σ and the Young tableaux ρ and σ can be found in [24]. The brane configurations
engineer 3d N = 4 quiver gauge theories, and the supergravity solutions are dual to their IR fixed
points. For solutions with AdS5 × S 5 region and semi-infinite D3-branes the dual field theory is
N = 4 SYM on a half space coupled to a 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFT on the boundary [23]. The free
energies obtained holographically were matched to field theory computations using supersymmetric
localization for the former in [31, 32] and for the latter in [33].

Finite temperature

For each AdS4 × S 2 × S 2 × Σ solution one may replace AdS4 by a finite temperature black hole
and still obtain a solution to the Type IIB supergravity field equations: To verify the field equations
one only needs that the 4d space is Einstein with negative curvature. This is true for the AdS4
black hole metrics we will use, so that replacing AdS4 by a black hole yields non-supersymmetric
solutions which asymptotically approach the supersymmetric seed solution. From a more general
perspective, the AdS4 × S 2 × S 2 × Σ solutions are in the class for which [34] conjecture that a
consistent truncation exists. Having a consistent truncation to 4d gauged supergravity would allow
to uplift more general 4d solutions to 10d, but this is not needed for our purposes here.
To introduce finite temperature, we replace the AdS4 metric in (2) by the AdS4 black hole
metric

b(r) = 1 − e3(rh −r) .

From the CFT perspective replacing AdS4 by a planar black hole corresponds to adding a finite
temperature for N = 4 SYM on AdS4 for solutions with an AdS5 × S 5 region. The black hole
solutions without AdS5 × S 5 region are dual to 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFTs at finite temperature.

EXTREMAL SURFACES

In this section we discuss the embedding ansatz for the surfaces that will be used for the
entanglement entropy computations, the extremality and boundary conditions, and the behavior
near the 5-brane sources.
A.

Island surfaces

The surfaces of interest are 8d minimal surfaces in the 10d geometry (2) that wrap both S 2 's,
(part of) the Riemann surface Σ, and a part of the AdS4 black hole geometry. For the AdS4 black
hole we choose coordinates (8), such that the 10d metric is given by (2) with
ds24 =


dr2
+ e2r −b(r)dt2 + ds2R2 .
b(r)

(11)

The surfaces can be described by specifying the AdS4 radial coordinate r for any given point of Σ.
On Σ we introduce real coordinates
z = x + iy ,

(12)

10
with x ∈ R and 0 ≤ y ≤ π2 . The embeddings are thus described by a single embedding function
r = r(x, y) .

(13)

The induced metric on the surface reads
ds2γ = e2r f42 ds2R2 + f12 ds2S 2 + f22 ds2S 2 + 4ρ2 (dx2 + dy 2 ) +

(19)

The dependence on r itself drops out for zero temperature, i.e. when b(r) = 1. If r(x, y) is a
solution to the extremality condition at zero temperature then so is r(x, y) + c with a constant c,
with different asymptotic values at x → ±∞; this reflects the defect conformal symmetry.

B.

Boundary conditions

We now discuss the boundary conditions for surfaces extending along Σ, starting with the two
boundary components of the strip at y = 0 and y = π2 . Near y = 0 the sphere S12 , collapses, with
f12 ∼ 4y 2 ρ2 so that the background has no conical singularity in the space parametrized by y and
S12 . The induced metric (14) near y = 0 consequently takes the form


f2
ds2γ ≈ e2r f42 ds2R2 + f22 ds2S 2 + 4ρ2 dx2 + dy 2 + y 2 ds2S 2 + 4 (dx ∂x r + dy∂y r)2 .

(20)

The contribution proportional to (∂y r)2 dy 2 threatens to introduce a conical singularity in the
(y, S12 ) part of the induced metric on the surface. A smooth metric is obtained with the Neumann

11
boundary condition ∂y r|y=0 = 0. The reasoning for the second boundary component, where S22
collapses, is analogous. We conclude
∂y r(x, y)

y=0

=0,

∂y r(x, y)

y= π2

(21)

For x → −∞ the space closes off smoothly; the limit corresponds to a single regular point on
the boundary of Σ. For the surface to be smooth, limx→−∞ r(x, y) should be independent of y.
The asymptotic behavior of the metric functions, with coordinate v = 2ex and v → 0, is given by
(see (3.15) of [24])
f42 ≈ L2 ,

f12 ≈ 4 sin2 y ρ2 ,

f22 ≈ 4 cos2 y ρ2 ,

4ρ2 ≈ L2 v 2 .

The induced metric on the minimal surface becomes (noting that ∂y r → 0)

The part in the round bracket is the line element for S 5 , and a smooth R8 with no conical singularity
is obtained if
lim e−x ∂x r(x, y) = 0 .

(24)

x→−∞

The conditions (21) and (24) are the 10d analog of the Neumann boundary conditions imposed at
the ETW brane in the 5d Karch/Randall models.
The nature of the limit x → +∞ is different for the solutions in (6) for a non-gravitating bath,
where an AdS5 × S 5 region emerges in this limit, compared to the solution (7) for a gravitating
bath. For the latter the limits x → ±∞ both lead to regular boundary points, and the boundary
condition at x → +∞ is given by (24) with x → −x. For the former, with the emerging AdS5 × S 5
region, a Dirichlet condition anchoring the surface is imposed instead. The general form is
lim r(x, y) = r0 (y) .

(25)

x→+∞

The form of r0 (y) can be determined by considering global AdS5 × S 5 , corresponding to h1 =
cosh z + c.c. and h2 = −i sinh z + c.c. In that case |h1 h2 /W | = 2 cosh2 (x), which is independent
of y. As a result one can find extremal surfaces with no dependence on y, which is an angular
coordinate on S 5 . For more general solutions the boundary condition in the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5
region at x → ∞ therefore is that r(x, y) should become independent of y and satisfy a Dirichlet
condition with r0 (y) = rR . In summary,
lim r(x, y) = rR

x→+∞

for (6),

(26)

Near-pole behavior

At zero temperature the minimal surfaces will show distinct behavior near the 5-brane sources,
and cap off there.1 In this section we will discuss this behavior analytically, using the form of
the supergravity solutions near the 5-brane sources. At finite temperature the behavior near the
5-brane sources will be regulated by the horizon.
1

This differs from the behavior of the spherical entangling surface centered on the defect studied in [33], which has
a simple universal embedding which is insensitive to the 5-brane sources.

12
To discuss the behavior near a pole at z = z0 it is convenient to introduce coordinates centered
on the pole, z = z0 + Reiφ for z0 on the real line and z = z0 − Reiφ for Im(z0 ) = π/2. The
combinations that appear in the area functional (17) behave at zero temperature as follows,
f = |h1 h2 W | ≈ f0 sin2 (φ)(− ln R) ,

g=

1 h1 h2
≈ −R2 ln R ,
2 W

(27)

where f0 is a constant which depends on the solution under consideration. The value of f0 will not
be relevant, since the extremality condition (18) is invariant under constant rescalings of f .
To discuss the near-pole behavior it is convenient to drop the overall factor in the extremality
condition (18) and use the condition in the form


1 + g(∇r)2
1
.
(28)
0 = 2 − ∇ (g∇r) + g∇r * ∇ ln
2
f2
The two non-trivial terms on the right hand side are generically of the same order, noting that
∇ ln(. . .) = O(1/R). A scaling analysis suggests to take ∇r = O(1/(R ln R)) and make an ansatz
r(R, φ) = r0 ln(− ln R) +

r1 (φ)
+ ...
ln R

(29)

where the ellipsis denotes regular and subleading terms. The leading non-trivial order in the
extremality condition (28) then is its finite part. The near-pole solution without divergences in φ
is given by r0 = −1 and r1 constant. In summary, the behavior of the embedding near a 5-brane
source at z = z0 is given by
r(z, z̄) = − ln(− ln |z − z0 |) + . . . .

(30)

Since limz→z0 r(z, z̄) = −∞, the minimal surface drops into the Poincaré horizon at the source.
At the point z0 the background geometry is singular, as appropriate for a solution near a 5-brane
source, and we do not impose additional regularity conditions for the minimal surface.
D.

HM surfaces

We will focus on the non-gravitating bath solutions (6) for the discussion of HM surfaces; those
for the gravitating bath solutions will be discussed in sec. VI. We use the tortoise coordinate u
defined in (9) and parametrize the embedding at t = 0 in terms of x(u, y) instead of r(x, y). The
minimal surfaces range in u from the value enforced by the Dirichlet boundary condition (26)
through the horizon into the thermofield double. We focus on surfaces anchored at the same point
rR in the thermofield double, which are symmetric with respect to reflection across u = 0 at t = 0.
So we can restrict to u ≥ 0 to find the embeddings. From that perspective the HM surfaces end
on the horizon at u = 0 along a curve xh (y) which is determined by the extremality condition.
The induced metric with the tortoise coordinate u and the parametrization x(u, y) becomes

For the boundary conditions we start with the boundaries of Σ at y = 0 and y = π2 . Having no

x(u, y) = ∞ .

(34)

On the other end the surface should intersect the horizon and end from the one-sided perspective
at u = 0. The symmetry under reflection across u = 0 leads to the Neumann condition
∂u x(u, y)|u=0 = 0 .

(35)

This condition also ensures that boundary terms in the variation of the area at u = 0 vanish.
IV.

SOLVING FOR MINIMAL SURFACES

To summarize, the extremality conditions are non-linear second-order PDEs on the strip Σ =
{x + iy|x ∈ R, 0 ≤ y ≤ π2 }, with Neumann boundary conditions at y = 0 and y = π2 . The domain
and boundary conditions in the x direction depend on the background solution and type of surface
under consideration. The solutions are expected to be smooth, except for the locations on the two
boundary components at y ∈ {0, π2 } where the D5/NS5 sources are in (6) and (7).
To solve these PDEs numerically we start with a trial surface satisfying the boundary conditions
and let it dynamically settle on a minimal area configuration. To this end an auxiliary external
time parameter τ is introduced, and the embedding, say for island surfaces, is described by a
τ -dependent function r(x, y, τ ). The τ -evolution for r(x, y, τ ) is chosen as
∂τ r(x, y, τ ) = −L−1
γ

δLγ
,
δr(x, y, τ )

(36)

where Lγ is the volume element of the surface in (17). This exerts a force on the embedding in the
direction in which the area decreases. The right hand side is given by (18) with r(x, y) replaced
by r(x, y, τ ).
To numerically implement the relaxation the embedding function r(x, y, τ ) is discretized in x
and y, and eq. (36) is replaced by a set of ODEs for the values of r at the lattice points, rij (τ ).
We use x̃ = tanh(x) to obtain a finite domain and a rectangular lattice with equidistant points.
The derivatives are discretized using second-order finite differences and the boundary conditions are
implemented such that they are compatible with the second-order accuracy of the finite differences.2
The resulting set of ODEs is integrated numerically using Mathematica.
Asymptotically the evolution of the rij (τ ) is expected to settle on an equilibrium configuration
? , which is a discretized solution to the extremality condition for the minimal surface. Letting
rij
the evolution (36) run for a large time τmax fl 1 will yield an approximation to this equilibrium
configuration. The quality of the final configuration rij (τmax ) can be assessed from the residuals

For Neumann boundary conditions the lattice is extended by one row beyond the actual domain. The Neumann
boundary conditions in the y direction, (21), apply for regular points of ∂Σ, not at the locations of the 5-brane
sources. This has to be taken into account in the discretization.

14

FIG. 5. Island surfaces from top left to bottom right anchored at rR ∈ {5, 3, 2.1, 1}. The horizon is at
rh = 0 and N5 /K = 2. The AdS5 × S 5 region emerges at tanh x = 1, the 5-brane sources are at tanh x = 0
and tanh x = −1 is a regular point in the internal space. For smaller rR (smaller radiation region) the
surfaces stay closer to the horizon. Near the 5-brane sources the surfaces reach to the horizon for all rR .

We typically use a lattice with O(100) nodes in the x̃ and y directions, though coarser lattices
already capture the qualitative form of the surfaces well. For the surfaces and data shown below
the residuals have decreased to O(10−6 ) or less. A limitation of this method is that it is unlikely to
capture extremal surfaces for which the area functional does not take a local minimum (i.e. saddle
points). However, the interest here is primarily in actual minimal surfaces.
Due to the symmetry of the D5/NS5 brane sources in the supergravity solutions (6) and (7)
under S-duality combined with z → iπ/2−z, the Einstein-frame metric is invariant under y → π2 −y.
For the minimal surfaces discussed here the boundary conditions respect this symmetry, so that
the surfaces themselves are symmetric. The PDEs thus only have to be solved on the half of the
strip Σ with 0 ≤ y ≤ π4 , with a Neumann boundary condition at y = π4 to enforce the symmetry.

V.

ISLANDS WITH NON-GRAVITATING BATHS

In this section we discuss minimal surfaces, island contributions and the emergence of Page
curves in the 10d solutions for non-gravitating baths, given in (6). The general structure of the
supergravity solutions is illustrated in fig. 2, and we have D5 and NS5-brane sources, respectively,
at (x, y) = (0, 0) and (x, y) = (0, π/2). The 8d minimal surfaces can be visualized as 2d surfaces in
the 3d space spanned by the x and y coordinates parametrizing Σ and the AdS4 radial direction.
They are obtained using the relaxation method of sec. IV. We will start with a discussion of general
features, before moving on to comparing the areas of island and HM surfaces.

15

FIG. 6. HM surfaces at t = 0 for rR = 1 (left) and rR = 2.1 (right), with rh = 0 and N5 /K = 2. The plots
show the tortoise radial coordinate u, in which the horizon is intersected orthogonally. The further the HM
surfaces are anchored from the horizon at rh = 0, the further they reach towards negative x.
A.

Island vs. HM surfaces

A sample of island surfaces with varying anchor points rR = limx→∞ r(x, y) in the AdS5 × S 5
region, for supergravity solutions (6), with temperature rh = 0 and N5 /K = 2, is shown in fig. 5.
Simultaneous rescalings of N5 and K lead to an overall rescaling of the metric functions in (2), so
the form of the minimal surfaces only depends on the ratio N5 /K. The ratio N5 /K controls the
ratio of the number of D3-branes suspended between the 5-branes and the number of semi-infinite
D3-branes. For N5 /K = 2 these numbers are equal (fig. 4(a)). For surfaces with large rR , anchored
far from the horizon, the impact of the 5-brane sources is clearly visible in fig. 5, in line with the
behavior discussed in sec. III C. The relaxation method works with the zero temperature case as
well (see fig. 8(b)). As the anchor point rR is decreased, moving towards the horizon, the entire
surface moves towards the horizon and the near-pole behavior becomes less pronounced.
For the surfaces in fig. 5 a discretization with (200, 100) points in (tanh x, y) was used, and
the residuals (37) at τ = 103 are reduced to O(10−10 ). The quality of the solutions can also
be investigated using the undiscretized extremality condition (18): From a discretized solution
one can construct a twice differentiable interpolating function r̃(x, y). The interpolation should
not necessarily be expected to capture the true solution accurately away from the lattice points,
especially near the D5/NS5 sources where the true solution is not smooth. Evaluating (18) on the
interpolation nevertheless only produces small errors near the poles, which decrease further with
increased lattice resolution, suggesting that they are benign and not systematic.
Examples of t = 0 HM surfaces for N5 /K = 2 are shown in fig. 6. For radiation regions that
start far in the bath system, the surfaces are anchored close to the horizon at tanh x = 1, i.e. with
rR close to rh . These surfaces drop into the horizon along a curve xh (y) which is located well
before reaching the D5/NS5 sources at x = 0.3 Upon moderately increasing rR , the surfaces reach
further towards smaller values of x. The curve xh (y) starts to bulge out towards negative values
in the interior of Σ, i.e. for y 6= {0, π/2}, while the boundary values xh (0) and xh (π/2) remain at
larger values and stay shy of reaching the 5-brane sources at x = 0. The behavior upon further
increasing rR depends on N5 /K, and will be discussed below.
With the surfaces in hand we can compare the areas between island and t = 0 HM surfaces
anchored at the same rR and discuss the time evolution of the entropy. The areas have the usual
divergences associated with entanglement entropies in 4d. Rather than isolating the divergences

If the initial trial surface reaches beyond the 5-brane sources, the relaxation transitions it into the x > 0 region.

FIG. 7. Area difference ∆S = Sisland − SHM as function of the anchor point rR in the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5
region. The defect is at r = ∞, the horizon at rh = 0. For ∆S > 0 the HM surface dominates at t = 0. The
radius of the AdS5 × S 5 region is controlled by N5 K, the number of defect degrees of freedom by N52 . The
color-coded dots are, from top to bottom, for N5 /K ∈ {1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4} with K = 1.

separately for island and HM surfaces, we directly compute the finite area difference between
island and HM surfaces anchored at the same rR . For numerical stability it is desirable to take the
difference at the level of the integrands, at least in the region of large x. Since the HM surface is
obtained with a different parametrization, we transform the HM surface described by xHM (r, y) to
a parametrization in terms of rHM (x, y), by inverting xHM (r, y) with respect to the first argument.
The derivatives of rHM can be expressed in terms of xHM ,
∂x rHM (x, y) =

1
∂r xHM (r, y)

r=rHM (x,y)

,

∂y r(x, y) = −

∂y xHM (r, y)
∂r xHM (r, y)

r=rHM (x,y)

.

(38)

This is used to replace the derivatives in the area functional (17) before replacing rHM (x, y) itself
by the inverse of xHM , to avoid taking derivatives of the inverted function and improve numerical
stability. The area integrands obtained this way are numerically smooth, and are used to compute
the area differences with a cut-off tanh x ≤ 1 − . The dependence on the cut-off is very mild, with
percent level variation between  = 10−2 and  = 10−3 , and the latter is used for the plots.
The results are shown in fig. 7. They show that the island surface has larger area than the t = 0
HM surface when rR is not too far from the horizon rh . This leads to Page curves: The radiation
region is identified far from the location where the gravity and bath systems meet (r = ∞), as the
part of the AdS5 × S 5 region at x → ∞ with AdS4 radial coordinate r ≤ rR , with rR close to rh .
The results in fig. 7 show that for these regions the area of the HM surface at t = 0 is smaller than
the area of the island surface. The area of the HM surface grows with time, but the entropy is
bounded by the constant area of the island surface, leading to a Page curve.
The results in fig. 7 show that the area difference between the island and t = 0 HM surfaces
is larger for larger N5 /K. One may compare this to expectations based on the Karch/Randall
models: Larger N5 /K corresponds to a BCFT with more 3d defect degrees of freedom relative to
4d bulk degrees of freedom, which in the 5d models amounts to larger tension of the ETW brane.
Larger tension bends the ETW brane towards the conformal boundary of AdS5 in fig. 1 (i.e. smaller
θ; a tensionless brane has θ = π/2). From this 5d perspective one would expect the island surface
to have larger area relative to the t = 0 HM surface for smaller θ, since the ETW brane is further
from the bath. This is the 5d version of the area difference being larger for larger N5 /K in 10d.
The curves in fig. 7 further show transition points r̂R at which the areas of the island and
HM surfaces are equal at t = 0, suggesting constant entropies for rR > r̂R . Near the end points

from a minimum to a saddle point, which the relaxation could transition over towards the island
surface. One may also suspect that HM surfaces extending to negative x also on the boundary of
Σ become relevant (those would reach to the horizon along a curve xh (y) and in a disconnected
region around the 5-brane sources, and can not be parametrized globally by x(u, y)). The value of

HM surfaces become relevant the entropy curve may remain non-trivial. In either case, the entropy
is bounded by the area of the island surfaces, which we find explicitly for small and large rR .
B.

Critical brane setups

The ratio N5 /K plays a prominent role also at zero temperature. A sample of island minimal
surfaces for different values of N5 /K at zero temperature is shown in fig. 8(b). For fixed anchor
point in the asymptotic AdS5 × S 5 region, the point where the surfaces close off at x → −∞ moves
towards the Poincaré horizon as N5 /K is increased. This is shown more quantitatively in fig. 8(a),
which shows the difference between rR = limx→+∞ r(x, y) and rL = limx→−∞ r(x, y) as function
of N5 /K. For small N5 /K the difference rR − rL grows linearly, but for larger N5 /K it starts to
grow rapidly (faster than exponential). The plot suggests the existence of a critical value,

(37) are reduced to at most O(10−7 ). Increasing N5 /K beyond the critical value appears to lead
to irreducible residuals (37), which remain finite and keep driving the anchors rL and rR further
apart with increasing runtime in τ , rather than settling on an equilibrium configuration. This is
consistent with rR − rL diverging when N5 /K approaches (39), and there being no island minimal
surfaces beyond the critical value at zero temperature.

These results line up well with the observations in the Karch/Randall models: As noted before,
the angle θ of the ETW brane in 5d is expected to be an effective description for the number of
defect degrees of freedom relative to the number of 4d degrees of freedom, which in this particular
example of a 10d solution is determined by the ratio N5 /K. The discussion in [11] found that, as
the angle is decreased, the point where the island minimal surface with fixed anchor on the bath
brane hits the ETW brane moves towards the infrared, and diverges towards the Poincaré horizon
at a critical angle. This is consistent with the behavior of the 10d solutions considered here if 1/θ
is identified with N5 /K. It would be interesting to investigate more general 10d solutions, e.g. with
multiple 5-brane sources, in which one may expect a more complicated phase structure.
At finite temperature the runaway behavior of the cap-off point rL at the critical N5 /K is
regulated by the black hole horizon, and island surfaces can be found beyond the critical N5 /K.
The behavior can again be diagnosed by the difference rR − rL . At zero temperature and below the
critical N5 /K this difference is finite and independent of rR , with its value growing rapidly towards
the critical N5 /K. At finite temperature and below the critical value of N5 /K, the difference rR −rL
is not constant, but it approaches a constant for large rR . This behavior can be seen in fig. 9 as
the curves that saturate towards a constant. The constant is set by the zero temperature value of
rR − rL . As N5 /K approaches the critical value, the point where the growth of rR − rL saturates
increases rapidly. The results are consistent with rR − rL staying linear without bound for N5 /K
beyond the critical value. The end point rL appears stuck below a critical value, similar to the
behavior found in the 5d models in [11].

VI.

ISLANDS WITH GRAVITATING BATHS

We now turn to the gravitating bath solutions (7), in which the AdS5 × S 5 region at x → ∞ is
reduced to a regular point of the internal space (fig. 3). These solutions have massless 4d gravitons
(theR 4d Newton constant is related to the free energy of the dual 3d SCFTs and proportional
to Σ h1 h2 W ). Without the AdS5 × S 5 region there is no natural place to geometrically define
radiation regions (compatible with diffeomorphism invariance) at x = ∞, or to anchor minimal
surfaces. Minimal surfaces stretching from x = −∞ to x = +∞ instead satisfy Neumann boundary
conditions on both ends, as discussed in sec. III B, and are found to settle onto the horizon. This
leads to a flat entropy curve, in line with the arguments of [26] for gravitating baths.
As suggested in [26, 28], a Page curve may still arise for other quantities in situations with
gravitating baths. An alternative is to consider surfaces that divide the internal space, which may
be expected to compute non-geometric EE's. Though the general interpretation of such surfaces

FIG. 10. Island surfaces in gravitating bath solutions, from left to right for δ ∈ {0.5, 0.4, 0.3}. The vertical
axis shows the tortoise AdS4 radial coordinate u. The surfaces are anchored at the conformal boundary of
AdS4 (u → ∞) on the curve x(y) = 0 in Σ. The plots only cover the x ≤ 0 part of Σ. Near the 5-brane
sources the surface caps off close to the horizon. The cap-off point at x = −∞ increases as δ decreases.

may not be entirely understood, one can view some of them in the current context as limiting cases
of surfaces computing geometric EE's, as suggested in [11] (an earlier example where geometric
EE's turn non-geometric in the IR can be found in [35]). The proposal of [11] can be made precise
in 10d: Consider brane configurations where D3-branes suspended between 5-branes are kept
finite in extent, to realize N = 4 SYM on an interval. One may compute conventional geometric
EE's on that interval. Though holographic duals for N = 4 SYM on an interval are not explicitly
known, these geometric EE's would be represented by conventional Ryu/Takayanagi surfaces in the
putative holographic duals. As IR fixed points one obtains 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFTs, with holographic
duals of the form discussed here. At the IR fixed point the geometric EE's on the interval become
non-geometric EE's, and the Ryu/Takayanagi surfaces become minimal surfaces in the internal
space. We thus expect at least certain minimal surfaces separating regions in the internal space to
compute non-geometric EE's. In lower-dimensional examples such EE's are discussed in [36].
There are numerous ways to separate regions in the internal space in the 10d Type IIB solutions.
One may for example divide one of the S 2 's, which should be related to a split of the Hilbert space
based on the R-symmetry [30]. The surfaces which arise from geometric EE's as outlined above
are expected to split the Riemann surface Σ instead, where they can separate the 5-brane sources.
As shown in [37], minimal surfaces dividing the internal space end, when reaching the conformal
boundary of the AdS part, on an extremal sub-surface in the internal space. Boundary conditions
can be imposed to fix the subleading behavior as the conformal boundary in the AdS part is
approached, instead of the leading behavior (e.g. for surfaces splitting the S 5 in AdS5 × S 5 the
slipping mode away from the equator). In the solutions (7) there is a natural candidate extremal
surface in Σ: due to the reflection symmetry of the solution under x → −x, the locus x(y) = 0 is
extremal in Σ and can serve as an anchor point for 8d minimal surfaces wrapping the spatial part
of AdS4 , both S 2 's and a curve in Σ which depends on the AdS4 radial coordinate u.
A symmetric HM surface which is anchored at x(y) = 0 also in the thermofield double is given
by x(u, y) = 0. This entire surface is extremal thanks to the reflection symmetry in x → −x. More
general surfaces may be obtained by specifying non-trivial subleading behavior in the AdS4 radial
coordinate as the x = 0 locus is approached.4 We only impose that the surface be anchored at
x(y) = 0 for u → ∞ and in the thermofield double, and then let the relaxation method settle on a
surface. This procedure selects the x(u, y) = 0 HM surface at t = 0. Since x(y) = 0 is an extremal
curve in Σ, finding the HM surfaces for t 6= 0 reduces to a problem within the AdS4 part of the
geometry, which is identical to the discussion in appendix A of [11].
For the island surfaces we impose that they are similarly anchored for u → ∞ along the x(y) = 0
4

Admissible choices for the fall-off behavior near the boundary of AdS4 can be determined by linearizing the
extremality condition around the x(u, y) = 0 surface and performing a mode expansion in the y direction.

curve. They should reach one of the x = ±∞ regions with the Neumann boundary condition (24)
for some value uL > 0, which is determined dynamically. Since the supergravity solution is invariant
under x → −x the surfaces ending at x = +∞ and x = −∞ are symmetry-related, and we only
construct the ones ending at x = −∞ explicitly.
A sample of island surfaces for different values of the 5-brane source locations δ on Σ is shown
in fig. 10 (the plots show only half the range of x). For larger δ the surfaces more rapidly approach
the horizon and then stay close to it. This behavior is captured more quantitatively in fig. 11(a),
which shows the end point at x = −∞ in the tortoise coordinate u as function of δ. The cap-off
points uL show an exponential fall-off towards large δ, which is shown as the fitted dashed line.
Towards small δ the cap-off points start to grow more rapidly. The data is consistent with uL
diverging towards the conformal boundary for a critical value
δc ≈ 0.28 .

(40)

In line with this interpretation, the relaxation method does not settle on equilibrium minimal
surfaces below δc . Instead, the trial surfaces keep approaching the conformal boundary of AdS4 at
generic points of Σ, while staying close to the horizon at the 5-brane sources (in line with behavior
derived in sec. III C). This will be discussed further below.
The area differences between the island and t = 0 HM surfaces are computed similarly to the
non-gravitating bath case. To implement the subtraction at the integrand level, the embedding
for the island surface, uisland (x, y), has to be inverted with respect to the first argument to match
the parametrization of the HM surface. The embeddings are not invertible on the entire domain,
so the subtraction is implemented at the integrand level in a patch around x = 0 and at the
integral level for the remaining parts. The resulting area differences are shown in fig. 11(b), as
colored curves for different choices of cut-off on the AdS4 radial coordinate. The cut-off on the
radial coordinate is imposed in Fefferman-Graham gauge, e−u ≥ , with  varied between 0.005
and 0.05. The curves are indistinguishable for generic values of δ. They only spread in a narrow
region around δc , where the island surfaces approach the conformal boundary of AdS4 and residual
cut-off dependence can be seen. The residual cut-off dependence is smooth, and is fitted for each
δ to obtain an extrapolation to zero cut-off. The result is shown as dashed black curve.
The area differences in fig. 11 show that generically for large δ the HM surface at t = 0 has
smaller area than the island surface. The area of the HM surface grows in time, and when it equals

that of the island surface the island surface becomes dominant, leading to a Page curve. The curves
in fig. 11 suggest a second distinguished value for δ, a "Page value" δP where ∆S at t = 0 vanishes.
The value of δP obtained from the numerical data,
δP ≈ 0.29 ,

(41)

is close to but slightly larger than the critical δc in (40). Since the difference between δc and δP is
small and the island surfaces become numerically challenging for δ ≈ δc , as evidenced in the spread
of the curves in fig. 11, the possibility remains that the true area difference may be non-negative
for all δ > δc . In the (possibly empty) range δc < δ < δP , the island surface dominates already at
t = 0 and leads to a flat entropy curve. Regardless of the relation between δc and δP , for δ > δc the
entropy growth indicated by the HM surface is limited by island surfaces whose area is constant.
As noted before, finding time-dependent HM surfaces reduces to a problem within the AdS4
part of the geometry, since x = 0 is an extremal curve in Σ. Up to an overall factor, the area as
function of time can then be determined as in appendix A of [11], to which we refer for details
on that part of the computation. The overall factor arises from the parts of the internal space
wrapped by the 8d minimal surfaces in the 10d solutions. It can be determined by integrating the
area functional in (32) evaluated on the x = 0 embedding over y. This leads to the factor

It will be convenient to discuss the time-dependent entropy curves normalized to this factor, so
that the area of the HM surface is universal. The area differences between island and HM surfaces
at t = 0 normalized to C are shown in fig. 12(a) as function of 1/δ. The normalized area differences
are monotonically increasing with δ. The time-dependent entropy curves, up to factors of C and the
10d Newton constant, are shown in fig. 12(b). To obtain the curves a time-independent divergent
part has been minimally subtracted, and a factor 2 has been included to account for the parts of
the surfaces in the thermofield double. Fig 12(b) shows the transition from the HM surface to the
island surfaces for various δ. The Page time, at which the transition occurs, increases monotonically
with δ: though the t = 0 area differences in fig. 11(b) are not monotonic, the Page time depends
also on the growth rate of the HM surface, which decreases with δ. The Page time vanishes at δP .
The 10d results are remarkably consistent with the phase structure found in 5d Karch/Randall
models if the inverse brane angle θ in 5d is seen as effective description for the brane stack separation

22
δ on Σ: the analysis of [11] identified critical angles and Page angles, with a phase structure of
minimal surfaces that, with the aforementioned identification, qualitatively matches the results
found here (compare e.g. fig. 5 of [11] to fig. 12(a)). The symmetry of the 10d solutions (7) under
x → −x suggests that they give rise to Karch/Randall models with two equal ETW brane angles.
The range δ < δc , where no island minimal surfaces are found, corresponds to the regime
above the critical ETW brane angle in 5d. The dominant contribution in 5d was identified as
"tiny islands", which arise as limiting surfaces that connect the defect to one of the ETW branes
infinitesimally close to the conformal boundary. In 10d the behavior of the island surfaces for
δ → δc and of the trial island surfaces below δc , summarized around (40), both indicate that
similar tiny island limiting surfaces arise for δ < δc . The evolution of trial island surfaces for δ < δc
indicates that the 10d tiny islands approach the conformal boundary of AdS4 almost everywhere
on Σ, except for narrow throats around the 5-brane sources where they reach to the horizon. In 5d
the tiny islands were further motivated in [11] through a deformation in which the ETW branes
are separated and the tiny islands arise as limits of extremal surfaces computing geometric EE's.
This deformation has a clear analog in 10d, as keeping some D3 branes finite in extent to describe
N = 4 SYM on an interval. It would be interesting to study this deformation also in 10d, which
would require as a first step the corresponding supergravity solutions.

VII.

OUTLOOK

The results presented here demonstrate in a UV-complete string theory setting the emergence of
entanglement islands and Page curves for black holes in four-dimensional theories of gravity. The
gravity theories certainly differ from the one we experience in nature. But they have dynamical
gravitons, with a mass that can be controlled, and show versions of the information paradox whose
resolution can be analyzed via AdS/CFT using a variety of methods. We close with some brief
thoughts on avenues for future exploration:
The discussions were based on representative Type IIB supergravity solutions that realize 5d
Karch/Randall braneworlds with non-gravitating and gravitating baths in 10d. These solutions
are members of a broad class of solutions corresponding to more general configurations of D3,
D5 and NS5 branes. It would be interesting to study further examples. The brane angles that
play a crucial role in the phenomenology of the Karch/Randall models were given analogs in the
representative 10d solutions, where the entanglement entropies exhibit a similar phase structure.
One may suspect more complicated phase structures to emerge for more general 10d solutions.
It would be desirable to understand the time evolution of the entanglement entropies from the
perspective of the dual QFTs. The (critical) parameters in the supergravity solutions translate in
a precise way to brane configurations and in turn to parameters in N = 4 SYM on a half space
and 3d Tρσ [SU (N )] SCFTs. This should provide a concrete starting point for investigating the
resolution of information paradoxes through entanglement islands in 4d using QFT methods.
A key holographic aspect appears to be a better understanding of minimal surfaces in the
internal space. These are apparently quantities which exhibit Page curve behavior in systems with
a gravitating bath, both in the 5d Karch/Randall models and in the string theory versions. Yet the
holographic understanding of these surfaces and their associated field theory quantities leaves much
to be desired. The 10d setups, with the full internal space present, should be a viable starting
point for more detailed investigations of Page curve behavior in surfaces bisecting the internal
space. The surfaces studied in sec. VI are natural candidates for computing EEs associated with
decompositions of the quiver diagram in the UV description of the dual 3d SCFTs.
