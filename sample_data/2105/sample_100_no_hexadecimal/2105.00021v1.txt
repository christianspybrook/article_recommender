Abstract: The construction of conformal blocks for the analysis of multipoint correlation functions
with N > 4 local field insertions is an important open problem in higher dimensional conformal
field theory. This is the first in a series of papers in which we address this challenge, following and
extending our short announcement in [1]. According to Dolan and Osborn, conformal blocks can be
determined from the set of differential eigenvalue equations that they satisfy. We construct a complete
set of commuting differential operators that characterize multipoint conformal blocks for any number
N of points in any dimension and for any choice of OPE channel through the relation with Gaudin
integrable models we uncovered in [1]. For 5-point conformal blocks, there exist five such operators
which are worked out smoothly in the dimension d.

Introduction and Summary of Results

In the last few decades conformal field theories have steadily gained importance, first in d = 2 and
then for d > 2. They provide a powerful source of new paradigms that advance our understanding
of quantum field theory deep in the quantum regime which is inaccessible to perturbation theory.

–1–

Through the AdS/CFT correspondence conformal field theories have even begun to teach us about
some of the deepest mysteries of quantum gravity.
In a conformal field theory, Poincare symmetry is enhanced to conformal symmetry. This symmetry
enhancement turns out to be highly constraining, even in d < 2, where the conformal group is finite
dimensional and only contains d + 1 generators outside of the Poincare group. These few additional
generators provide enormous control over the operator product expansion (OPE) of local fields and
in fact fix these products up to some numerical OPE coefficients. The latter determine all higher
correlations, at least in principle. In practice, however, higher correlations with more than N = 3 field
insertions possess an intricate dependence on the insertion points of the local fields and their simplicity
only becomes visible after expanding correlators in a basis of conformal blocks. The latter are very
much like plane waves in ordinary Fourier analysis, i.e. conformal blocks (or rather the closely related
conformal partial waves) are to conformal symmetry what plane waves are to the translation group.
Once the basis of conformal blocks is known, one can expand the correlation function. Conformal
symmetry then implies that the coefficients are simply products of the coefficients that appear in the
OPE.
All this is of course well known since the early days of conformal field theory, see [2–4]. But the
pioneers of conformal field theory were only able to write down integral formulas for conformal blocks
[5, 6]. These so-called shadow integrals are very much like Feynman integrals. In particular, it is a
considerable challenge to relate shadow integrals to some known special functions, to read off their
properties and to find relations between them, at least for d > 2 where the integrations cannot be
performed directly. There has been little progress on this problem until Dolan and Osborn shifted
attention from the integrals to the differential equations that these integrals satisfy [7, 8]. Once they
had constructed their so-called Casimir differential operators they were able to extract a wealth of
information on 4-point blocks, see also [9–11]. This work has been the decisive input for the modern
conformal bootstrap program (see [12] for a review and many references to the original literature)
and its spectacular applications to the d = 3 Ising model, in particular [13–16]. More recently, it was
observed that the Casimir differential operators studied by Dolan and Osborn could be identified with
the Hamiltonians of an integrable 2-particle quantum mechanics system of Calogero-Sutherland type
[17]. The observation was later explained in the context of harmonic analysis for the conformal group
[18–21]. Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonians and their eigenfunctions have actually been studied in
mathematics for several decades where it has become instrumental in developing the modern theory of
multivariate hypergeometric functions. After the relation with conformal blocks was noticed it became

–2–

clear that most of the results on 4-point blocks had been known long before the work in conformal
field theory, mostly from the early work on Calogero-Sutherland models by Heckman and Opdam [22],
see [23].
In principle it is possible to probe a conformal field theory by studying the entire set of 4-point
functions for the infinite number of (spinning) conformal primary fields. And even though the theory
of spinning conformal blocks is reasonably well developed by now, see e.g. [24–27], working with an
infinite number of correlation functions seems impossible at least in the absence of any additional
algebraic structure. In practice, it may appear more promising to study higher correlations of a small
set of fundamental fields of the theory. The 8-point function of a fundamental scalar field, for example,
already contains as much dynamical information as an infinite set of spinning 4-point functions. Given
that it took more than 30 years to develop a theory of 4-point blocks, it may seem like a daunting
task to actually extend this theory to multi-point blocks, though there has been significant activity
in this direction lately, see e.g. [28–41]. The embedding of 4-point blocks into harmonic analysis
of the conformal group and the profound relations with integrable quantum mechanical models may
be viewed as a strong hint towards the appropriate mathematical tools for the study of multi-point
blocks. And in fact, as we have announced in [1], the relation to integrable models is not restricted to
the case of 4-point blocks. As we have outlined, multi-point blocks for any number N of local fields
can be characterized as joint eigenfunctions of a complete set of commuting differential operators. The
latter were argued to arise as Hamiltonians of Gaudin integrable models.
Our goal in this paper and its sequels is to substantiate our claims and to develop them into a full
theory of multi-point blocks. In this paper we perform the first step of this program and explain
in detail the relation between multi-point conformal blocks and Gaudin integrable systems. We will
actually go further than [1] which only sketched the construction of differential operators for the socalled comb channel conformal blocks [28]. The results described in this work apply to any channel, i.e.
they provide a complete set of commuting differential operators for whatever channel one is interested
in, including e.g. the snowflake channel that has also received some attention lately, [34, 36]. As we
shall explain below, in any given channel, the differential operators split into two groups: the DolanOsborn-like Casimir differential operators that measure the weight and spin of intermediate fields,
and the novel vertex differential operators that measure a choice of tensor structure in the operator
product of intermediate (spinning) fields. In a second paper of this series we will address such internal
vertices for the comb channel of 3- and 4-dimensional conformal field theories. These vertices give rise
to a single vertex differential operator, see [1] for an example, that we will identify as the Hamiltonian

–3–

of an elliptic Calogero-Moser system for some complex crystallographic reflection group, first obtained
in [42]. Extensions to vertices with more than one degree of freedom, which are relevant e.g. for the
snowflake channel in 4D, as well as a theory of solutions for single and multi-variable vertices will be
addressed in the future.
The main results of this work are the following. We construct the Casimir and vertex differential
operators that are simultaneously diagonalized by conformal blocks. Commutativity of this set of
operators is established by realizing it as a limit of the Gaudin integrable model. The connection to
the Gaudin model seems to be necessary for the full proof, although some parts of the proof can be
established by elementary arguments. Further, we provide evidence that independent Casimir and
vertex operators are equal in number to independent cross ratios and can thus be used to completely
characterize conformal blocks. This is done by exhibiting a number of relations between the operators,
leaving us with an explicit commuting system with no apparent further dependencies. Finally, we construct the five commuting Casimir and vertex operators for 5-point functions explicitly as differential
operators in the five cross ratios.
For the remainder of this introduction we will give a more precise summary of the main results and
place them in the context of conformal field theory.
Summary of Results In this work we consider correlation functions of N local scalar primary fields
φi with conformal weights denoted by ∆i ,
GN (xi , ∆i ) := h0|φ1 (x1 ) * * * φN (xN )|0i .

(1.1)

The fields are inserted at points xi , i = 1, . . . , N , of d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd . Scalar primary
fields are characterized by their commutation relations with the generators of the conformal algebra
which take the form
[Tα , φi (xi )] = Tα(i) φi (xi ),

(1.2)

where Tα are the usual first order differential operators and α runs through the set of conformal
generators.
Prerequisites and notation. Conformal correlation functions are symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two fields. On the other hand, the way we compute them is not. In fact, N -point
correlation functions are evaluated by a repeated use of operator product expansions (OPEs) and the
precise sequence of performing these expansions determines what is known as an OPE channel. These
N
channels can be represented as (plane) tree diagrams COPE
with enumerated leaves. Figure 1 shows

one such example for the 10-point function. Given a fixed enumeration of the external scalar fields,
the number of OPE channels is (2N − 5)!!. Each of these channels is associated with a system of
conformal blocks that provide a Fourier-like expansion of the correlation function. After stripping
off some appropriate prefactors Ω(xi |∆i ), the conformal blocks depend only on conformally invariant
cross ratios. It is well known that one can form

of such independent cross ratios from a set of N points xi ∈ Rd . Note that this number is independent
of the OPE channel. The conformal blocks we want to expand our correlation functions in must
depend on the same number of labels. For example, in the case of a 4-point function in d > 1 one has
two cross ratios. The associated blocks are famously labeled by the conformal weight ∆ and the spin l
of the field that is exchanged in the intermediate channel. Since the latter transforms in a symmetric
traceless tensor representation of the rotation subgroup, a single number l is sufficient to characterize
the spin.
When dealing with higher correlation functions, it is easy to see that the quantum numbers of fields
exchanged in the intermediate channels are not sufficient. The precise number of such intermediate
field labels does depend on the channel topology, at least for N > 5, but it is always strictly smaller
than the number ncr of cross ratios. As an example let us consider N = 5. In this case there exist 15
OPE channels but they all possess the same topology. In Figure 2 we have displayed one of the fifteen
OPE channels. All other 14 channels are related to this one by a permutation of the leaves, modulo

symmetries of the bare OPE diagram that has been stripped of its leaves. As one can readily see,
the OPE evaluation involves two intermediate fields. Since these appear in the operator product of
scalar fields, they are symmetric traceless tensors and hence characterized by two quantum numbers
each. The intermediate fields thus carry four quantum numbers in total. We think of these as being
attached to the (internal) links of the OPE diagram. But in order to fully characterize the relevant
blocks we need five quantum numbers and so we are short by one. As we shall show below, this
remaining quantum number is attached to the central vertex of the 5-point OPE diagram. Note that
two legs of this central vertex are associated with a symmetric traceless tensor while only one is scalar.
For d ≥ 3, such 3-point functions are not determined by conformal symmetry. They require the
choice of a so-called tensor structure. For a very particular basis in the space of tensor structures it
becomes possible to assign a fifth quantum number to the choice of tensor structure, one that can be
measured simultaneously with the four independent eigenvalues of the Casimir operators. Measuring
a complete set of quantum numbers simultaneously through a sufficiently large set of commuting
differential operators is the main goal of this work. We want to do so in any d, for any number N of
external points and for all OPE channels. Quantum numbers are measured by acting with differential
operators in the cross ratios. The latter divide into two families. First, differential operators that
measure the quantum numbers of intermediate fields are associated with the links of the OPE diagram
and are referred to as Casimir differential operators, since they are straightforward generalizations of
the Casimir differential operators constructed for N = 4 by Dolan and Osborn. Second, differential
operators that measure choices of tensor structure, the first example of which was introduced recently
in [1], are referred to as vertex differential operators. Let us note that for scalar blocks, the choice of
tensor structures and hence the vertex differential operators are relevant as soon as multiple non-scalar
exchanges are involved. These types of blocks have only been considered very recently in the paper
[41] by Poland and Prilepina and in a certain limit in [43].
Before we can describe our results on both types of differential operators we need to set up some

–6–

notation. Given an OPE channel we enumerate internal lines by Latin indices r = 1, . . . , N − 3 and
vertices by Greek indices ρ = 1, . . . , N − 2. There are no rules on how to enumerate these two sets
of objects. OPE diagrams are (plane) trees and hence by cutting any internal line with label r we
separate the diagram into two disconnected pieces. Hence, r is associated with a partition of the
external fields into two disjoint sets,
N = {1, . . . , N } = Ir,1 ∪* Ir,2 .

(1.4)

Similarly, any vertex ρ gives rise to a partition of N into three disjoint sets
N = Iρ,1 ∪* Iρ,2 ∪* Iρ,3 .

(1.5)

Given any subset I ⊂ N we can define the following set of first order differential operators in the
insertion points xi ,
Tα(I) =

X
i∈I

Tα(i) .

(1.6)

Let us note that for two disjoint sets I1 , I2 ⊂ N we have

The number rd = [(d + 2)/2] denotes the rank of the conformal Lie algebra. In even dimensions d, the
symmetric invariant tensor κp of order p = 2rd = d + 2 actually possesses a square root of order p = rd
that also commutes with all generators of the conformal algebra. This so-called Pfaffian differential
operator has the same form as in (1.8), but with a symmetric invariant tensor κp of order p = d/2 + 1,

When d = 4k + 2, the symmetric invariants of order p = d/2 + 1 are twofold degenerate and we should
use two different symbols for these two invariants of order d/2 + 1. In order not to clutter notation

–7–

too much, we decided to ignore this distinction. In other words, we will consider κd/2+1 as a pair of
symmetric invariants when d = 4k + 2.
In our formulas for the differential operators we have placed a subscript |G to stress that they are
defined as operators acting on correlations functions, i.e. on functions G that satisfy the conformal
Ward identities
Tα(N ) GN (xi , ∆i ) = 0 .

(1.11)

In our construction of the differential operators we have favored the set Ir,1 over Ir,2 . But from the
conformal Ward identities we can conclude that
Tα(Ir,1 ) GN (xi , ∆i ) = −Tα(Ir,2 ) GN (xi , ∆i ) .
Though some caution is needed when we apply this relation to the evaluation of the Casimir differential
operator, see Subsection 2.1 for details, it is not difficult to see that all differential operators of even
order come out the same if we pick Ir,2 rather than Ir,1 . There is only one family for which the set
matters, namely for the Pfaffian operators when d is a multiple of four. In that case the operator
flips sign when we change the set. Of course, overall factors are a matter of convention and hence of
no concern. Therefore, we shall drop the reference to the set we use in the construction of Casimir

differential operators, writing Drp instead of Dr,1

An important point to note is that the Casimir differential operators need not be independent. To
illustrate this, consider the case N = 4 for d > 2. Since all external fields are assumed to be scalar,
the single intermediate field is a symmetric traceless tensor and is hence characterized by two numbers
only, its weight ∆ and spin l. These can be measured by the Casimir differential operators D2 and D4 .
But starting from d = 4, the conformal algebra possesses Casimir elements of higher order which are
independent in general, but become dependent on the lower order ones when evaluated on symmetric
traceless tensors. More generally, the number of independent Casimir differential operators at a given
internal line r is given by
N
dr (COPE
, d) = d(Ir,1 , d),

where d(I, d) = min(|I|, N − |I|, rd ),

(1.12)

and |I| denotes the order of the set I.1 We shall refer to the number d(I, d) as the depth of the index
set I and to dr as the depth of the link r. Note that dr = d(Ir,1 , d) = d(Ir,2 , d) is independent of which
of the two index sets we choose to compute it with. By summing the depths of all internal links, we

Let us note that the total number of Casimir differential operators does depend on the topology of
the OPE channel, not just on the number N of points. In the case of N = 6 and d ≥ 4, for example,
N =6

Vertex differential operators. What we have described so far is nothing new, and can be established by
elementary means. But as we have explained, starting from N = 5 the Casimir differential operators
do not suffice to resolve all quantum numbers of the conformal blocks, i.e. ncdo is strictly smaller
that ncr for all OPE channels. Our main task is to construct additional differential operators that
can measure the choice of tensor structures at the vertices independently of the weights and spins
of the intermediate fields, i.e. we need to find a complete set of vertex differential operators that
commute with the Casimir differential operators and among themselves. In this work we describe how
to accomplish this task, for any number N of external scalar fields and any OPE topology. One central
claim is that these vertex differential operators take the form

where ν = 1, . . . , p−1 and p = 2, 4, . . . , 2rd = d+1 when d is odd. For even d, we let p run through even
integers until we reach d and add a set of Pfaffian vertex operators Pf νρ,12 , ν = 1, 2, . . . d/2 which are
constructed with a symmetric invariant tensor κp of order p = d/2 + 1. Let us note that the definition
of all these vertex differential operators also makes sense for ν = 0 and ν = p. The corresponding
objects coincide with Casimir differential operators for the links that enter the first and second leg
of the vertex. This is why we have excluded them from our list. The remaining operators still allow
us to reconstruct the Casimir operators for the link that enters the third leg. Therefore, there is one
linear relation for each value that p can assume, i.e. we have rd linear relations in total. One may use
these relations to eliminate e.g. the operator with ν = p/2.

Let us note that the definition of the vertex operators Dρ,ij
depends on the choice of labeling of

the subsets Iρ,j forming the partition N = Iρ,1 ∪* Iρ,2 ∪* Iρ,3 associated with the vertex ρ, which is
arbitrary. However, the algebra generated by the vertex operators Dρp,ν is in fact independent of this
choice: more precisely, the vertex operators constructed from another choice of labeling of the Iρ,j 's

The number of vertex differential operators at a given vertex is now easy to count. Taking into account
that one additional linear relation among the operators listed in eq. (1.14), one finds

4 (d − 1)

(1.15)

The first key result of this work is that these vertex differential operators commute among themselves
and with the Casimir differential operators. Commutation between Casimir and vertex differential
operators is obvious. Similarly, it is easy to show that two vertex operators commute if they are
associated with different vertices ρ 6= ρ0 . The deepest part of our claim concerns the fact that also
vertex operators associated with the same vertex commute. It does not seem straightforward to
prove this statement by elementary manipulations. Below we shall use an indirect strategy in which
we identify these vertex differential operators with Hamiltonians of some Gaudin integrable system
defined on a 3-punctured sphere. For the latter, commutativity has already been established.
Of course the vertex differential operators we listed may not all be independent, as for the Casimir
operators, see discussion above. In order to count the number of independent vertex differential
operators, we shall employ the depth function d(I, d) we introduced in eq. (1.12). For a given vertex

needed to characterize the vertex ρ. This is the second key result of this work. It will allow us in
particular to determine the precise order of each independent vertex differential operator.
While Gaudin models for the 3-punctured sphere only enter the discussion as a convenient tool to
construct commuting vertex differential operators at the individual vertices, the relation between
conformal blocks and Gaudin models turns out to reach much further. In fact, is is possible to embed
the whole set of Casimir and vertex differential operators for arbitrary scalar N -point functions into
Gaudin models on the N -punctured sphere. The latter contains N additional complex parameters that
are not present in correlation functions. In the Gaudin integrable model these parameters correspond
to the poles of the Lax matrix and they enter all Gaudin Hamiltonians. By considering different
limiting configurations of these parameters is is possible to recover the full set of Casimir and vertex
differential operators for scalar N -point functions in all the OPE channels. This construction not
only embeds our differential operators into a unique Gaudin integrable model, but also shows that
operators in different channels are related by a smooth deformation.
Let us finally outline the content of the following sections. Section 2 is mostly devoted to the study
of the individual vertices. After a brief discussion of commutativity for Casimir differential operators
and also vertex differential operators assigned to different vertices, we shall zoom into the individual
vertices for most of Section 2. In Section 2.2 we construct the vertex differential operators in terms of
the commuting Hamiltonians of a 3-site Gaudin integrable system. Section 2.3 addresses the relations

– 11 –

between these operators for restricted vertices. The main purpose of Section 3 is to embed the whole set
of Casimir and vertex differential operators for arbitrary scalar N -point functions into Gaudin models
on the N -punctured sphere. In Section 4 we discuss one concrete example, namely we construct all
five differential operators that characterize the blocks of a scalar 5-point function in any d ≥ 3. Two
of these operators are of order two while the other three are of fourth order. The paper concludes with
a summary, outlook to further results and a list of interesting open problems to be addressed.

The Vertex Integrable System

The aim of this section is to address the key new element in the construction of multi-point conformal
blocks for d ≥ 3: the vertices themselves. In the first subsection we shall show that the construction
of commuting differential operators for scalar N -point blocks can be reduced by rather elementary
arguments to the construction of commuting differential operators for 3-point functions of spinning
fields. Recall that the dependence on spin degrees of freedom can be encoded in auxiliary variables
from which one is often able to construct non-trivial cross ratios,2 even in the case of a 3-point function.
Constructing sufficiently many commuting vertex differential operators that act on such cross ratios of
the 3-point function requires more powerful technology from integrability which we shall turn to in the
second subsection. There we construct commuting differential operators for vertices from the Gaudin
integrable model for the 3-punctured sphere. The basic construction provides nv (d) of such commuting
operators and hence sufficiently many even for the most generic vertices. For special vertices, such as
those appearing in the comb channel with external scalars, there exist linear relations between these
operators. These are the subject of the third subsection.

for every pair (r, p), (r0 , q) of Casimir operators and any choice (ρ, q, ν) of a vertex operator, including
the Pfaffian Casimir and vertex operators that appear at order p, q = d/2 + 1 when the dimension d is
even. Note that the individual vertex differential operators also depend on the choice a ∈ {12, 23, 13}
of a pair of legs. In addition, we shall also establish that vertex operators associated with different

(2.2)

and all triples (p, ν, a) and (q, μ, b). This leaves only the commutativity of operators attached to the
same vertex which is deferred to the next subsection.
The properties (2.1) and (2.2) are in fact elementary. They require global conformal invariance, the
tree structure of OPE diagrams and the commutativity property (1.7). To begin with, let us recall
that we associated two disjoint sets Ir,1 and Ir,2 to every link. As we pointed out before, the Casimir
(Ir,1 )

differential operators (1.8) do not depend on whether we used the generators Tα

(Ir,2 )

or Tα

to

construct them. Let us briefly discuss the details of the proof. Note that we think of D as an operator
acting on correlation functions G. This is signaled by the subscript |G in the definition of the Casimir
differential operators. In evaluating products of first order differential operators, one can only apply
the Ward identity (1.11) to the rightmost operator, which acts directly on the correlation function,
and not on some derivative thereof. But once we have converted the rightmost operators T (Ir,1 ) into
−T (Ir,2 ) , they will commute with all operators to their left, such that we can freely move them all the
way to the left and proceed to apply the Ward identity to the next set of first order operators, and so
on. If we finally take into account that the invariants κ of the conformal Lie algebra are symmetric,
we arrive at an expression for the Casimir differential operators in terms of T (Ir,2 ) .
A similar analysis can be carried out for vertex operators, see also Subsection 2.2. Without loss of
generality we can assume that we have constructed our vertex operators in terms of the generators
T (Iρ,1 ) and T (Iρ,2 ) and want to switch to constructing them from T (Iρ,1 ) and T (Iρ,3 ) instead. To do so
we make use of the invariance condition

(2.3)

that follows from relations (1.5) and (1.11). After we apply this to the rightmost operator in the
vertex differential operator, we use the commutativity property (1.7) to move the generators T (Iρ,1 )
and T (Iρ,3 ) to the left of T (Iρ,2 ) . We continue this replacement process until all the generators T (Iρ,2 )
are removed and using symmetry of the tensor κ we find

(2.4)

along with a similar relation for the Pfaffian vertex operators for p = d/2 + 1 and d even. Since the
last term in this sum with μ = p − ν is just a Casimir operator, we have managed to express all vertex

– 13 –

differential operators that are constructed from the generators associated with Iρ,1 and Iρ,2 as a linear
combination of the vertex operators associated with the pair Iρ,1 and Iρ,3 and a Casimir operator.
This is the main input in proving the commutativity statements (2.1) and (2.2).
Let us start with a pair of links r, r0 . Each of these links divides the set of external points into the two
disjoint sets Ir,1 , Ir,2 and Ir0 ,1 , Ir0 ,2 respectively. Since the OPE diagram is a tree, it is always possible
to find a pair i, j = 1, 2 such that Ir,i ∩ Ir,j = ∅. For this choice
p
[ Drp , Drq0 ] = [ Dr,i
, Drq0 ,j ] = 0

(2.5)

because of the commutativity property (1.7). This proves our first claim. Note that the same arguments also apply to the case in which r = r0 and also if one or both operators are Pfaffian, i.e. if d is
even and p, q = d/2 + 1.

vertex automatically divides the diagram into three branches.

Let us now extend this argument to include vertex differential operators. In order to prove that the
Casimir operators associated to a link r commute with the vertex operators associated to any vertex
ρ we recall that any choice of a vertex ρ on an OPE diagram divides the diagram into the three
distinct branches that are glued to the vertex, and we denote these by Iρ,j as in Figure 4. A quick
glance at Figure 4 suffices to conclude that given r and ρ it is possible to find a pair i ∈ 1, 2 and
j ∈ 1, 2, 3 such that Ir,i ⊂ Iρ,j , since the link r must be in one of the three branches. It follows that
Ir,i ∩ (Iρ,j1 ∪ Iρ,j2 ) = ∅ for j1 6= j 6= j2 . Commutativity of Casimir and vertex differential operators
then follows since we can construct the Casimir differential operators in terms of the generators for
Ir,i while using the generators for Iρ,j1 and Iρ,j2 for the vertex differential operators.
Let us finally consider any two distinct vertices ρ and ρ0 on an OPE diagram. As we highlight in
Figure 5, any configuration of two vertices divides the diagram into five parts: four external branches

Iρ,j , Iρ0 ,j , j = 1, 2, attached to only one vertex, and the central part C of the diagram that is attached
to both vertices ρ and ρ0 . Following what we just claimed with focus on one vertex, we can use diagonal
conformal symmetry to rewrite the operators around ρ and ρ0 to depend on disjoint sets of legs Iρ,j ,
Iρ0 ,j with j = 1, 2. Since generators associated to these sets commute (1.7), it follows automatically
that operators constructed around different vertices must commute as well.
This implies that to prove commutativity of our set of operators, we can just focus on operators that
live around one single vertex. To prove the commutativity of these vertex operators we will now make
use of the integrability technology that is provided by Gaudin models.
2.2

The vertex system and Gaudin models

In this section, we will explain how the operators (1.14) associated with a vertex ρ in the OPE
diagram naturally arise from a specific Gaudin model, which in particular will provide us with a proof
of their commutativity. Let us start by reviewing briefly how Gaudin models are defined [44, 45].
They are integrable systems naturally constructed from a choice of a simple Lie algebra g. Having in
mind applications of these systems to conformal field theories, we will choose g to be the conformal
Lie algebra so(d + 1, 1) of the Euclidean space Rd , with basis Tα as in the previous section. The
Gaudin model depends in general on M complex numbers wj , called its sites, to which are attached
M independent representations of the algebra g. To obtain the vertex system we address in this
section, we restrict our attention here to the case M = 3 and associate with these three sites the
representations of g corresponding to the three fields attached to the vertex ρ. More precisely, using
the notation defined in Section 1 and in particular the partition N = Iρ,1 ∪* Iρ,2 ∪* Iρ,3 constructed
from the vertex ρ, we will attach to the three sites wj , j = 1, 2, 3, of the Gaudin model the generators

– 15 –

(Iρ,j )

Tα

which define representations of g in terms of first-order differential operators in the insertion

points xi .
A key ingredient in the construction of the Gaudin model is its so-called Lax matrix, whose components
in the basis T α are defined here as
Lρα (z) =

3
(I )
X
Tα ρ,j
,
z − wj
j=1

(2.6)

where z is an auxiliary complex variable called the spectral parameter. In the above equation, we
have denoted the Lax matrix as Lρα (z) to emphasize that this is the matrix corresponding to the
vertex ρ. For any elementary symmetric invariant tensor κp of degree p on g, there is a corresponding
z-dependent Gaudin Hamiltonian of the form
Hρ(p) (z) = κpα1 ***αp Lρα1 (z) * * * Lραp (z) + . . . ,

(2.7)

where . . . represent quantum corrections, involving a smaller number of components of the Lax matrix
Lρα and their derivatives with respect to z. These corrections are chosen specifically to ensure that the
Gaudin Hamiltonians commute for all values of the spectral parameter and all degrees:
 (p)

Hρ (z), Hρ(q) (w) = 0,

∀ z, w ∈ C,

∀ p, q .

(2.8)

The existence of such commuting Hamiltonians was first proven in [46], using some previously established results [47] on the so-called Feigin-Frenkel center of affine algebras at the critical level. The
explicit expression for the quantum corrections was obtained in [48, 49] for Lie algebras of type A
and in [50] for types B, C, D, which is the case we are concerned with here (indeed, g = so(d + 1, 1)
is of type B for d odd and of type D for d even). We refer to [51] for a summary of these results.
The properties of the Feigin-Frenkel center were further studied in the recent work [52], the results of
(p)

which imply that the quantum corrections in Hρ (z) are sums of terms of the form
τ α1 ***αq ∂zr1 −1 Lρα1 (z) * * * ∂zrq −1 Lραq (z),

(2.9)

where q < p, τ α1 ***αq is a completely symmetric invariant tensor of degree q on g and r1 , * * * , rq are
positive integers such that r1 + * * * + rq = p. For what follows, it will be useful to consider the leading
part of the Hamiltonian (2.7) alone, without quantum corrections, which we will denote as
bρ(p) (z) = κα1 ***αp Lρα (z) * * * Lρα (z) .
H

(2.10)

Let us finally note that the quantum corrections are absent for both the quadratic Hamiltonian Hρ (z)
(d/2+1)

and the Pfaffian Hamiltonian Hρ

(z) that exists for d even, such that these two Hamiltonians

coincide with their leading parts.

To make the link with the vertex operators defined in Section 1, we will make a specific choice of the
parameters wj of the Gaudin model. More precisely, we set
w1 = 0,

coincide with the Casimir operators of the fields at the branches Iρ,1 and Iρ,2 of the vertex. The
(d/2+1)

same equation also holds for the Pfaffian operators Hρ

(z).

p,ν
Our goal in this section is to prove the commutativity of the vertex operators Dρ,12
using known

results on Gaudin models. This would follow automatically from the commutativity (2.8) of the
(p)

p,ν
. But we have
Gaudin Hamiltonians Hρ (z) if these Hamiltonians contained the operators Dρ,12

bρ(p) (z) of the
already proven above that the latter are naturally extracted from the leading parts H
Gaudin Hamiltonians, without the quantum corrections. These quantum corrections are in general
crucial for the commutativity of the Hamiltonians. However, we shall prove below that the quantum
corrections of the specific Gaudin model considered here can always be expressed in terms of lowerdegree Hamiltonians, and can thus be discarded without breaking the commutativity property. In this
(p)

bρ (z) pairwise commute for all values of the spectral parameter
case, the non-corrected Hamiltonians H
p,ν
and all degrees, thus demonstrating the desired commutativity of the vertex operators Dρ,12
.

Let us then analyze these quantum corrections. Recall that they are composed of terms of the form
(2.9). Reinserting the expression (2.12) of the Lax matrix for the present choice of parameters wj in
this equation, we find that the quantum corrections contain only terms of the form
ρ,2 )
τ α1 ***αq Tα(I1 ρ,1 ) * * * Tα(Iν ρ,1 ) Tα(Iν+1
* * * Tα(Iq ρ,2 ) ,

– 17 –

(2.14)

with prefactors composed of powers of z and z − 1, and where τ α1 ***αq is a completely symmetric
invariant tensor on g of degree q < p, as in eq. (2.9). In particular, τ α1 ***αq decomposes as a product
of elementary symmetric invariant tensors κk , symmetrized over the indices αi , with k ≤ q < p. The
correction in the above equation can thus be re-expressed as an algebraic combination of lower-degree
k,ν
bρ(k) (z),
vertex operators Dρ,12
. Since these are the coefficients of the non-corrected Hamiltonian H

recursion on the degrees shows that the quantum corrections can indeed be expressed in terms of
lower-degree Hamiltonians, as anticipated.
Let us end this subsection with a brief discussion on the role played by the choice of labeling of
the branches Iρ,1 , Iρ,2 and Iρ,3 attached to the vertex ρ. As mentioned in Section 1, this choice is
p,ν
arbitrary but enters the definition (1.14) of the vertex operators Dρ,12
, which in this case contain
(Iρ,1 )

only the generators Tα

(Iρ,2 )

and Tα

. In the context of the 3-sites Gaudin model considered in this

subsection, this is related to the choice of positions wj of the sites made in eq. (2.11). In particular,
(Iρ,3 )

the absence of generators Tα

in the Gaudin Hamiltonians H(p) (z) is due to the fact that we sent the

site w3 to infinity. One could have made another choice of labeling and constructed vertex operators
(Iρ,3 )

p,ν
Dρ,23
from the generators Tα

(Iρ,2 )

and Tα

, for instance. The corresponding choice of positions of

the sites would then be related to the initial one by the Möbius transformation that exchanges 0 and
∞ and fixes 1, i.e. the inversion z 7→ z1 . More precisely, under such a transformation of the spectral
parameter, the Lax matrix of the Gaudin model behaves as a 1-form on the Riemann sphere and
satisfies

Hamiltonians (2.17). Indeed, one can use the Ward identities only for generators on the right. In order
to do so, one thus has to commute generators to bring them to the right, replace them through the
Ward identities and commute them back to their original place. Although this procedure can in general
create non-trivial corrections, it can in fact be done freely in the case at hand: indeed, commuting

and Tα

appropriate Möbius transformations that permute the sites 0, 1 and ∞ of our 3-site Gaudin model.
2.3

Restricted vertices and relations between vertex operators

In the previous subsection we have shown that all of the operators listed in eq. (1.14) commute with
each other. As we have pointed out before, we did not include operators with ν = 0 and ν = p in the
list since these coincide with Casimir differential operators,

Dρ,12
= Drp2 .

(2.18)

Here ri denotes the link that is attached to the ith leg of the vertex ρ, i.e. for which Iri ,j = Iρ,i with
either j = 1 or j = 2. The remaining p − 1 operators satisfy one more linear relation since
p  
X

ν=0

ν

Dρp,ν = Drp3 .

(2.19)

Let us note that this relation also applies to the Pfaffian vertex operators that exist for p = d/2 + 1
when d is even. We have used this relation to drop one of the vertex differential operators. Once these
obvious relations are taken care of, the total number of commuting vertex differential operators is given
by eq. (1.15) and matches precisely the maximal number of cross ratios that can be associated to a
single (generic) vertex, see upper bound of eq. (1.16) in the introduction. But restricted vertices carry
fewer variables, so their corresponding differential operators (constructed in the previous section) must
obey further relations. It is the main goal of this subsection to discuss these relations. We will also
check that, once these are taken into account, the number of remaining vertex differential operators
matches the number (1.16) of cross ratios at restricted vertices.
(I)

Our arguments are based on an important auxiliary result concerning the differential operators Tα

that are associated to some subset I ⊂ N of order |I| ≤ N/2. To present this requires a bit of

– 19 –

preparation. Up to this point there was no need to spell out the precise form of the symmetric
invariant tensors κp that we used to construct our differential operators. Now we need to be a bit
more specific. As is well known, such tensors can be realized as symmetrized traces,

αp )
1 ***αp
= str (T α1 * * * T αp ) .
κα

T

(2.20)

Here T α denote the generators of the conformal Lie algebra and (. . . ) signal symmetrization with
respect to the indices. In the following we shall use the symbol str to denote this symmetrized
trace. The trace can be taken in any faithful representation. The simplest of such choices is to
use the fundamental representation. In order to construct the associated symmetric invariants more
explicitly, we shall replace the index α that enumerates the basis of the conformal algebra by a pair
α = [AB] where A, B run through A, B = 0, 1, . . . , d + 1 with T [AB] = −T [BA] . In the fundamental
representation, the matrix elements of these generators take the form
[AB] C
D

Tf

= η AC δ BD − η BC δ AD ,

where ηAB is the Minkowski metric with signature (d + 1, 1) and η AB is its inverse. This makes it now
easy to compute κp explicitly. The only issue arises in even d. In this case the symmetrized traces
in the fundamental representation do not generate all the invariants. In order to obtain the missing
invariant, one has to include the trace in a chiral representation. The standard construction employs
the spinor representation in which generators T [AB] are represented as
Ts[AB]

σ
τ

=

1 A B σ
[γ , γ ] τ ,
4

where γ A are the d + 2-dimensional γ matrices and the matrix indices are σ, τ = 1, . . . , 2d/2+1 . One
can then project to a chiral spinor representation with the help of γc ∼ γ 0 * * * γ d+1 .
Let us now introduce the symbol T (I) to denote the following Lie-algebra valued differential operators
T (I) = T α * Tα(I) =

1 [AB]
(I)
T
* T[AB] .
2

Upon evaluation in some finite-dimensional representation, such as the fundamental or the spinor
representation, these become matrix valued differential operators. With this notation we write our set
(1.14) as




...T (Iρ,1}) |T (Iρ,2 ){z
Dρ,12
= strf |T (Iρ,1 ){z

(2.21)
|G

when d is odd and the parameters p and ν assume the values p = 2, 4, . . . , d + 1 and ν = 1, . . . , p − 1,
as usual. For even dimension d, on the other hand, we use the symmetrized trace in the fundamental

– 20 –

representation for p = 2, 4, . . . , d and construct the missing Pfaffian vertex differential operators as



where we take the trace in the spinor representation and include the factor γc in the argument.
In finding relations between the vertex differential operators for restricted vertices we actually work
with the total symbols of the differential operators rather than the operators themselves. This means
(i)

that we replace the partial derivatives ∂μ with commuting coordinates piμ . The associated matrices
of functions of xμi and piμ will be denoted by T̄ (I) . As before we shall add a subscript f, s to denote
the matrices in the fundamental and the spinor representation. After passing to the total symbol the
entries of the matrices commute and we can drop the symmetrization prescription when taking traces.
As a result, the total symbols of the vertex differential operators are simply traces of powers of the
matrices T̄ (I) .
We are now ready to state the main result needed to elucidate the relations between vertex differential
(I)

operators. It concerns the matrix elements of the nth power of the matrices T̄f,s for the fundamental

and the spinor representations. In both cases, these matrix elements are functions of xμi and piμ with

i ∈ I. Our main claim is that these matrix elements can be expressed in terms of lower order ones
of the same form whenever n > 2dI , where dI = d(I, d) is the integer defined in eq. (1.12). More

with the index set I. If the index set I has depth dI = 1, for example, i.e.

if the T̄ (I) describe

the action of the conformal algebra on a single scalar primary, then starting from n = 3 all matrix
elements can be expressed in terms of lower order ones. In the case of the spinor representation one

which now applies for n > dI and involves a summation over m that ends at dI = d(I, d), see definition
(1.12). So if dI = 1, for example, the matrix elements of the square are expressible in terms of the
(I)

matrix elements of T̄s . We verify both statements (2.23) and (2.24) in Appendix C using embedding
space formalism, see Appendix B.

We are now prepared to discuss relations between vertex differential operators. Let us consider a
vertex ρ inside our OPE diagram. As we have explained before, ρ splits the set N into three subsets
Iρ,i with i = 1, 2, 3. Each of these sets determines an integer di = d(Iρ,i , d). Let us suppose that we
construct the vertex differential operators using T (Iρ,i ) for i = 1, 2 as in eq. (2.21). If one of the integers
d1 or d2 is smaller than rd we immediately obtain relations among the vertex differential operators.
In fact, when applied to the matrices T̄ (Iρ ,1) , our claim (2.23) implies that all operators we obtain
when ν > 2d1 can be expressed in terms of Casimir and vertex differential operators of lower order.
The same is true when p − ν > 2d2 , as follows again from eq. (2.23), but this time applied to T̄ (Iρ ,2) .
Consequently, for any p ≥ 2d1 , 2d2 , we can restrict the range of the index ν to be p − 2d2 ≤ ν ≤ 2d1 ,
with ν = 0, p excluded as before.
But this does not yet include the full set of relations that appears whenever d3 is smaller than min(d1 +
d2 , rd ). One of the simplest examples of this occurs in the 6-point snowflake channel in d > 3, see
Figure 6, where two symmetric traceless tensor operators on two branches are combined at the central
vertex ρ to form another symmetric traceless tensor on the third branch.

allow a mixed symmetry tensor of depth d = 4 to appear in d ≥ 7, but diagonal conformal symmetry constrains
this to match with the symmetric traceless tensor produced on the third branch.

To take restrictions from the third branch I3 into account, it is sufficient to use the total symbol of
eq. (2.3) and impose once more our dependence statement (2.23) for product matrices, this time for
T (Iρ,3 ) . This tells us that the matrix elements of powers

with n > 2d3 can be written in terms of lower order terms. In order to convert this observation into
relations among the vertex differential operators of order p, we can multiply the expression (2.25) with

some appropriate powers of T̄ (Iρ,i ) , i = 1, 2, and consider the matrix elements of the products

for n > 2d3 , any allowed value of p > n and ν = 0, . . . , p − n. By binomial expansion, we can write
the expression (2.26) as a linear combination of our basic vertex differential operators. After taking
relations on the branches Iρ,1 and Iρ,2 into account, we obtain an additional nontrivial relation from the
B
third branch Iρ,3 . For example, in the cases where n is odd, contracting (2.25) with T (Iρ,2 ) A leads
to a relation between vertex and Casimir operators of order n + 1 and further lower order operators.
This effectively reduces the amount of vertex operators at order p by up to p − 2d3 − 1, though the
actual number can be lower in case there are less than p − 2d3 − 1 vertex operators at order p left after
imposing the constraints from the first two branches. If we are interested in counting the number of
vertex operators at a given even order p, the procedure we just outlined is summarized in the following
counting formula

where Θ0 is the Heaviside step function with Θ0 (0) = 0, the factor (p−2) gives the maximal amount of
vertex operators at order p, the factor (p − 2di − 1) corresponds to the number of relations introduced
for every di < p/2, and the maximum enforces the number to be 0 if there are more than (p − 2)
relations in total.
Our description of relations between vertex differential operators exploited the auxiliary statement
(2.23) and did not include the Pfaffian vertex differential operators. It is clear, however, that precisely
the same reasoning also applies to the latter using eq. (2.24) instead of eq. (2.23). The counting
formula (2.27) gets also slightly modified for this Pfaffian case

Note that the arguments we have outlined here exhibit relations between vertex operators, but we have
not shown that these relations are complete, i.e. that the remaining vertex differential operators are
in fact independent. A priori, it could in fact happen that the exceeding relations we get from here,
or additional relations obtained from a different reasoning, could provide additional dependencies.
We checked however that summing the counting formulas (2.27) and (2.28) for all allowed orders p
in a given dimension d, gives rise to a number of vertex differential operators equal to the number
of cross ratios (1.16) associated with every allowed vertex. This provides strong evidence in favor

– 23 –

of the independence of our vertex differential operators. In some particularly relevant cases in lower
dimensions we can also prove independence.
Example: The N = 6 snowflake channel for d = 7. Let us see how all of this works in the example of a
snowflake channel in d = 7, presented in Figure 6. We enumerate the internal links by r = 1, 2, 3. The
associated index sets Ir,i are I1,1 = {1, 2}, I2,1 = {3, 4}, . . . . Here we have two symmetric traceless
tensors associated with r = 1, 2. In a more general OPE diagram these could produce a mixed
symmetry tensor with maximal depth d = rd = 4, but in the snowflake diagram the field on the third
link must also be a symmetric traceless tensor of depth d(I3 , d = 7) = 2. Our prescription tells us to
consider operators (2.21) up to p = 8. Eliminating powers of T1 = T (12) and T2 = T (34) higher than
4, it immediately follows that there are no vertex operators of order 8

Here and in the following steps we are using notation for which stroked terms are dependent on lower
order operators. Let us also recall that the operators with ν = p/2 have been omitted to account for
the relation between the vertex and Casimir differential operators for the third leg. The reduction of
T3 = T (56) to a symmetric traceless tensor implies the existence of p − 2d3 − 1 relations between p

OPE channels and limits of Gaudin models

At this point we have defined a set of differential operators associated with the intermediate fields and
the individual vertices of a given OPE diagram with N external fields. The new vertex operators were
constructed in Subsection 2.2 from a Gaudin model with three sites, which was crucial in proving their
commutativity. Our construction of the vertex operators has been local in its focus on a particular
building block, namely a single vertex that is associated to a local element of the OPE diagram.
The purpose of this section is to adopt a more global perspective by showing that the whole set of
Casimir and vertex differential operators for any N -point OPE channel can be obtained by taking an
appropriate limit of an N -site Gaudin model. The N -site Gaudin model itself makes no reference to
the choice of OPE channel. The latter enters only through the choice of limit. We will therefore refer
to these limits as OPE limits of the N -site Gaudin model. These OPE limits are generalizations of the
so-called bending flow and caterpillar limits that have been considered in the mathematical literature,
see e.g. [53–55]. The same limit of a 4-site Gaudin model - which may be identified with the elliptic
Inozemtsev model [56] - has also appeared in the physics literature recently [57]. Eberhardt, Komatsu
and Mizera have shown that the limit theory coincides with the hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland model,
which is known to describe the Casimir equations of 4-point conformal blocks.
3.1

N sites Gaudin model and OPE limits

Let us first define the Gaudin model that we will use in this section. Since this construction is similar
to the one of the 3-sites Gaudin model considered in Section 2.2, we refer to that section for details and
references. As before, we consider a Gaudin model based on the conformal Lie algebra g = so(d + 1, 1)
but now with N sites, whose positions w1 , * * * , wN ∈ C are for the moment arbitrary. We naturally
associate these sites with the N external fields in the correlation function under consideration and
more precisely attach to each site i ∈ {1, * * * , N } the representation of g defined by the generators
(i)

Tα , which describe the action of the conformal transformations on the scalar field φi (xi ) in terms of
first-order differential operators. Then we define the (components of the) Lax matrix of the model as
Lα (z, wi ) =

N
(i)
X
Tα
.
z − wi
i=1

(3.1)

The associated Gaudin Hamiltonians H(p) (z, wi ) of degree p are given by the same equation (2.7)
that we used for the 3-site case. Recall that κp denotes the conformally invariant symmetric tensor of
degree p and . . . represent quantum corrections. The latter have the same form as in the 3-site case,
see eq. (2.9). It is well known that these N -site Gaudin Hamiltonians commute, just as their three

– 25 –

site analogues, i.e. they satisfy eq. (2.8). At the same time, it is easy to verify that they are invariant
under diagonal conformal transformations,

(3.2)

(i)

Tα are the diagonal conformal generators that also appear in the Ward identities

(1.11). This means that Gaudin Hamiltonians descend to correlation functions G.
The Hamiltonian H(p) (z, wi ) of the N -site Gaudin model depends on the N complex parameters wi
that specify the poles of the Lax matrix. These parameters have no a priori interpretation in the
context of correlation functions. Note that we can always apply Möbius transformations on the zvariable to fix three of the wi . This is what allowed us in the previous section to set the parameters
of the 3-site Gaudin model to the specific values (2.11), in which case the Lax matrix (2.12) and
its corresponding differential operators contain no extra parameters. Our main claim is that we can
reconstruct the entire set of 3-site Lax matrices Lρα (z), as well as the associated vertex Hamiltonians
(p)

Hρ (z), one set for each vertex ρ, from the N -site Lax matrix and the associated Gaudin Hamiltonians
H(p) (z) = H(p) (z, wi ) by taking appropriate scaled limits of the complex parameters wi .
In order to make a precise statement, we need a bit of preparation. The limits we are about to discuss
must depend on the choice of the OPE channel. So let us assume we are given such a channel C. In
order to define the limits we pick an (arbitrary) external edge in the diagram, which will serve as a
reference point and which, up to reordering, we can suppose to have label N . As this edge is external,
it is attached to a unique vertex, which we will denote by ρ∗ . Such a choice of reference vertex defines
a so-called rooted tree representation of the diagram. We then draw the OPE diagram on a plane,
with the vertex ρ∗ situated at the top and with each vertex having two downward edges attached.
Such a representation on a plane forces us to make a choice of which edges are pointing towards the
left and which edges are pointing towards the right: this choice is arbitrary, and gives rise to what is
called a plane (or ordered) representation of the underlying rooted tree. We give an example of such
a plane rooted tree representation for an 8-point OPE diagram in Figure 7 below.

Figure 7. Plane rooted tree representation of an OPE diagram with 8 external fields.

Recall from Section 1 that each vertex ρ of the OPE diagram defines a partition N = Iρ,1 ∪* Iρ,2 ∪* Iρ,3 ,
with the sets Iρ,j formed by the labels of the external fields attached to the three branches of the
vertex. Although the choice of labeling of these branches was arbitrary in Section 1, we will now fix it
using the plane rooted tree representation of the diagram picked above: choose the branch Iρ,1 to be
the one pointing to the bottom left and the branch Iρ,2 to be the one pointing to the bottom right.
By construction, the last branch Iρ,3 then always points to the top and contains the reference point
N.
Each vertex ρ in the diagram is thereby associated with a sequence sρ = (sρ1 , sρ2 , . . . , sρnρ ) of elements
sρa ∈ {1, 2}. This sequence sρ encodes the path from ρ∗ to ρ. It tells us whether we have to move to
the left (for sρa = 1) or right (for sρa = 2) every time we reach a new vertex until we arrive at ρ after
nρ steps. We shall also refer to the length nρ of the sequence as the depth of the vertex and to sρ as
the binary sequence of ρ. Note that the top vertex ρ∗ has depth nρ∗ = 0. Let us point out that the
notion of depth used in this section refers to the distance from the root ρ∗ and is very different from
the depth d introduced in eq. (1.12) of the introduction.
In order to construct the limit of the Gaudin model that we are interested in, we will need to assign
a polynomial gρ ($) to each vertex ρ. If sρ is the binary sequence associated with the vertex ρ, the
polynomial gρ is defined as
gρ ($) =

nρ
X

$a−1 δsρa ,2 .

(3.3)

a=1

Obviously the top vertex ρ∗ is assigned to gρ∗ ($) = 0. The vertices of depth nρ = 1 are associated
with gρ1 ($) = 0 or gρ2 ($) = 1, depending on whether they are reached from ρ∗ by going down to the
left (ρ1 ) or to the right (ρ2 ).

– 27 –

Similarly, we can assign polynomials fi ($) to each external edge 1 ≤ i < N at the bottom of the plane
rooted tree. Once again, we can encode the path from ρ∗ down to the edge i by a binary sequence
si = (si1 , si2 , . . . , sini ). The length ni of the sequence si is also referred to as the depth of the edge i.
Now we introduce
fi ($) =

(3.4)

and set

(3.5)

for the external edge of the reference field at the top of the plane rooted tree. Thereby we have now
set up all the necessary notation that is needed to construct the relevant scaling limits of the N -site
Gaudin model.
We can now move on to the main result of this section, namely how to reconstruct the vertex Hamil(p)

tonians Hρ (z) of the 3-site Gaudin model of the previous section from the N -site Hamiltonians
H(p) (z) = H(p) (z, wi ). To this end, we will first construct the vertex Lax matrices (2.12) from the Lax
matrix (3.1) before studying the associated Hamiltonians (2.7) in the limit. As it turns out, we can
recover the parameter free Lax matrix Lρ that is associated with the vertex ρ as
(Iρ,1 )

(3.6)

Let us note that in the limit, the site wN = $−1 associated with the reference field N goes to infinity,
while the sites of the other external fields approach z = 0 or z = 1 depending on whether they are
located at the right or left branch of the the plane rooted tree, i.e. whether their binary sequence sρ
starts with sρ1 = 1 or sρ1 = 2. We shall prove eq. (3.6) in the third Subsection 3.3 through a recursive
procedure that will also offer insight into the construction of the polynomials gρ and fi .
Let us now turn to the limit construction for the Gaudin Hamiltonians. We claim that the Hamiltonians
(p)

H(p) (z, wi ) of the N -sites Gaudin model give rise to the Hamiltonians Hρ (z) of the different 3-sites
vertex Gaudin models defined in Section 2.2 as

Hρ(p) (z) = lim $pnρ H(p) $nρ z + gρ ($), wi = fi ($) .
$→0

(3.7)

The fact that this statement holds for the leading part of the Hamiltonians, without quantum corrections, follows directly from the corresponding limit (3.6) of the Lax matrix

But it requires a bit of work to argue that the quantum corrections also have the required behaviour
under the limit. Consider a term of the form (2.9) in the correction: by appropriately distributing the
powers $pnρ , using the fact that r1 + * * * + rq = p, and performing the change of spectral parameter
z 7→ zρ0 ($) = $nρ z + gρ ($) in the derivatives, we find that

such that this correction term reduces in the OPE limit to the corresponding correction in Hρ (z).
As the vertex operators Dρp,ν and the Casimir operators Drp of the intermediate fields attached to the
(p)

vertex ρ are naturally extracted from the Hamiltonian Hρ (z), the property (3.7) shows that the full
set of operators defined in Section 1 can be obtained from the limit of the N -sites Gaudin model
considered here. Before the limit $ → 0, The commutativity property (2.8) of the N -site Gaudin
Hamiltonians can be written as

 (p)
(q)
Hρ (z), Hρ0 (w) = 0,

∀ z, w ∈ C,

∀ p, q,

∀ ρ, ρ0 .

(3.9)

This provides an alternative proof of the commutativity of all Casimir operators Drp and vertex operators Dρp,ν . Moreover, this statement now holds without needing to use conformal Ward identities.
The proof relies on a specific choice of labeling of the edges at vertices, given by a plane rooted tree
representation of the OPE diagram. Different such representations of the diagram correspond to different limits of the same underlying N -sites Gaudin model and give rise to different sets of commuting
operators, which however generate the same algebra when acting on solutions of the conformal Ward
identities. Finally, let us note that the above construction automatically ensures the compatibility
of these operators with the conformal Ward identities, since taking appropriate limits of eq. (3.2)
(N )

demonstrates that they commute with the diagonal conformal generators Tα
3.2

.

Examples

Before we prove our main result, let us illustrate the construction of the operators from limits of
Gaudin models with two examples. The first one addresses the so-called comb channel OPE diagrams
for which we have already outlined the limit in [1]. The second example deals with the snowflake OPE
channel of the N = 6-point function.

– 29 –

Comb channel.

Let us consider the comb channel OPE diagram with N external fields. To apply

the construction of the present section, we first need to pick a plane rooted tree representation of this
diagram. We will choose to represent it with all internal edges pointing towards the bottom left. We
then label the external edges of the tree as follows: we let N be the top edge of the tree, 1 be edge
furthest to the left and label by 2, * * * , N − 1 the external edges pointing to the bottom right at each
vertex, from the bottom to the top. Moreover, following our conventions in [1], we enumerate the
vertices ρ = [r] by an integer r = 1, . . . , N − 2, from bottom to top. We represent this plane rooted
tree in Figure 8 below, with external edges indicated in black and vertices in blue.

One can compute the limit of the Gaudin model associated with this tree using the construction
outlined in the previous subsection. For the polynomials fi that determine the parameters wi of the
Gaudin model, one finds from eq. (3.4) that
wi = fi ($) = $N −1−i ,

∀ i ∈ {1, * * * , N } .

(3.10)

Let us now consider the vertices ρ = [r], with r = 1, . . . , N − 2. From the general construction, and
formula (3.3) in particular, we find
n[r] = N − 2 − r

and

g[r] ($) = 0,

∀ r ∈ {1, * * * , N − 2} .

(3.11)

Note in particular that for this choice of plane rooted tree, the polynomial functions gρ are all zero,
since all vertices ρ = [r] sit on the most left branch of the tree. The limit of the Gaudin Lax matrix

The above limit coincides exactly with the one introduced in [1] to describe the comb channel, thus
showing that the results of [1] are contained in the more general construction discussed here.
Snowflake channel. The results of the present article allow us to discuss more general topologies of
OPE diagrams than the comb channel. The first example of such a topology is the snowflake channel
of 6-point functions. We represent this OPE diagram as a plane rooted tree following the conventions
of Figure 9, where the external edges are labeled in black from 1 to 6 and the vertices are labeled in
blue from [1] to [4]. Note in particular that the internal vertex of the diagram corresponds here to the
label [3].

We can immediately read off the depth of the four vertices as

n[3] = 1,

n[4] = 0.

(3.15)

We can now encode the positions of all four vertices in a binary sequence and apply the formulas (3.3)
to construct the polynomials gρ , yielding
g[1] ($) = g[3] ($) = g[4] ($) = 0

and

g[2] ($) = $.

Similarly, one can encode the five external edges at the bottom of the diagram in binary sequences

These indeed give the expected vertex Lax matrices Lρα = Lα for the vertices labeled by r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
These two examples suffice to gain a first intuition into how we take limits of Gaudin models and
thereby manage to embed the vertex Lax matrices into the full N -sites model. We will now explain
the derivation of our results for general OPE diagrams.
3.3

Recursive proof of the limits

Subtrees. Our goal in this subsection is to prove that our limit construction is indeed able to recover
all vertex Lax matrices, as we have claimed. Let us consider some OPE channel C represented by a
plane rooted tree T . The approach that we follow is recursive. Let us consider the top vertex ρ∗ of the
tree, which is by construction attached to the external edge N . We denote by e0 and e00 the left and
right downward edges attached to ρ∗ (which can correspond to either external or intermediate fields
depending on the topology of the diagram). We can then see the tree T as being composed of the
vertex ρ∗ and of two (plane rooted) subtrees with reference edges e0 and e00 , which we will call T 0 and
T 00 respectively. In Figure 10 below, we illustrate the two subtrees obtained in the example of Figure
7.

We will now prove that if the limit construction of Subsection 3.1 holds for the subtrees T 0 and T 00 ,
then it also holds for the initial tree T , thus proving that it holds for any tree by induction. Let us
first introduce some useful notation. We will denote by E 0 and E 00 the external edges of T that belong
to the subtrees T 0 and T 00 respectively. Note that if T 0 is not trivial, i.e. if e0 is not an external edge
of the initial tree T , then the full set of external edges of T 0 is E 0 ∪* {e0 } (since e0 is external in T 0
but not in T ). On the other hand, if e0 is external in T , then we simply have E 0 = {e0 } and the
subtree T 0 is trivial. Let us also denote by V , V 0 and V 00 the set of vertices of T , T 0 and T 00 , such
that V = V 0 ∪* V 00 ∪* {ρ∗ }.
Recursion relations.

Recall the polynomial gρ ($) defined in eq. (3.3) for any vertex ρ ∈ V of T

in terms of the binary sequence sρ = (sρ1 , * * * , sρnρ ). Let us suppose that this vertex is contained in the

subtree T 0 and thus belongs to V 0 : it is then associated with a binary sequence s0 ρ = (s01ρ , * * * , s0nρ0ρ ) in
T 0 . By construction, the depth n0ρ of ρ in T 0 is given by nρ − 1. Moreover, it is clear that the binary

sequence of ρ in T is related to that in T 0 by sρ = (1, s01ρ , * * * , s0nρρ −1 ). Indeed, since ρ belongs to T 0 ,

the path from ρ∗ to ρ starts by going to the bottom left (sρ1 = 1), and is then given by the path from

e0 to ρ, encoded by s0 ρ . It is then clear that the polynomial gρ ($) defined by eq. (3.3) is related to
the corresponding polynomial gρ0 ($) defined for T 0 by gρ ($) = $ gρ0 ($). Similarly, if ρ belongs to
V 00 , we have sρ = (2, s001 ρ , * * * , s00nρρ−1 ) and thus gρ ($) = 1 + $ gρ00 ($). In conclusion, the polynomials
gρ ($) satisfy the recursion relation

if ρ ∈ V 00 ,
if ρ = ρ∗ .

(3.20)

A similar analysis can be performed for the sites wi = fi ($) associated with the external edges i ∈ N
through eq. (3.4), distinguishing three cases. If i = N is the top reference edge, then we recall that

– 33 –

wN = fN ($) = $−1 . If i ∈ E 0 is an edge belonging to the subtree T 0 , then one can relate the binary
sequences si and s0 i describing i in T and T 0 in a similar way as for the vertices in the paragraph
above. We then find that the polynomial fi ($) satisfy the recursion relation

$
if e0 is external in T,
fi ($) =
0
$fi ($) else.

(3.21)

Note that in the first case, the subtree T 0 is trivial and the index i is then necessarily equal to e0 , while
in the second case i is different from e0 and the subtree T 0 is therefore non-trivial. Finally, if i ∈ E 00
belongs to the subtree T 00 , then we similarly find

1
fi ($) =
1 + $fi00 ($)

if e00 is external in T,
else.

(3.22)

Here, i = e00 in the first case and i 6= e00 in the second one.
Induction hypotheses. We will now suppose that the limit procedure defined in Subsection 3.1
holds for the subtrees T 0 and T 00 . To phrase these induction hypotheses more precisely, let us focus
first on the subtree T 0 . If it is non-trivial, i.e. if e0 is not external in T , the external edges of T 0 are
E 0 ∪* {e0 }. We then introduce the Gaudin Lax matrix associated with T 0 as
(i)

L0α (z) =

X
i∈E 0 ∪
* {e0 }

Tα
,
z − fi0 ($)

(3.23)

where the sites associated with the external edges E 0 ∪* {e0 } are set to the positions fi0 ($) prescribed
(i)

by the limit procedure of Subsection 3.1. Here, the generators Tα

associated with external fields

0

i ∈ E are defined by their expression in the initial tree T , while the generators associated with e0 are
(e0 )

defined by Tα

(N \E 0 )

= Tα

. By construction, the latter satisfy the commutation relations of g and
(i)

commute with the other generators Tα , i ∈ E 0 , as required. Moreover, this definition ensures that
P

(i)
the diagonal conformal generators i∈N Tα of the tree T coincides with the ones i∈E 0 ∪*{e0 } Tα of
(e0 )

T 0 (however, as we will see, the definition of Tα

is in fact irrelevant for the recursive proof).

As T 0 is assumed to be non-trivial here, its vertex set V 0 is non-empty. The induction hypothesis that
we make in this subsection is then that eq. (3.6) holds for the subtree T 0 , that is to say
(Iρ,1 )

(3.24)

In this equation, we used the Lax matrix Lρα (z) associated with the vertex ρ as defined in the initial
tree T : indeed, it is clear that this vertex Lax matrix coincides with the one associated with ρ in the
subtree T 0 (in particular, the subsets of external edges Iρ,1 and Iρ,2 associated with the left and right
branches of ρ are the same when defined for T as when defined for T 0 ).

– 34 –

Similarly, if T 00 is non-trivial, we consider the associated Lax matrix
(i)

L00α (z) =

X
i∈E 00 ∪

z − fi00 ($)

(3.26)

We are now in a position to prove that the induction carries from the

subtrees T 0 and T 00 to T . For that, we will show that the limit (3.6) holds for every vertex ρ ∈ V , with
three cases to distinguish. If ρ ∈ V 0 belongs to the subtree T 0 , we will use the induction hypothesis
(3.24) and the recursion relations (3.20), first case, and (3.21). Similarly, if ρ ∈ V 00 belongs to T 00 ,
we will use the induction hypothesis (3.26) and the recursion relations (3.20), second case, and (3.22).
Finally, if ρ is the reference vertex ρ∗ , then the limit will follow without having to use any induction
hypothesis. As these proofs are rather technical, we gather them in Appendix A.

Example: 5-point conformal blocks

As an example of our construction of commuting differential operators, let us consider a correlator of
five scalar fields
hφ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 φ5 i

(4.1)

and fix the OPE decomposition as in Figure 2.
This correlator can be be written schematically as
(∆i )

hφ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 φ5 i = Ω5
(∆i )

where Ω5

(xi )ψ (∆i ) (u1 , . . . , u5 )

(4.2)

(xi ) is a prefactor that takes into account the covariance of the correlator with respect to

conformal transformations, while ψ (∆i ) (u1 , . . . , u5 ) is a conformally invariant function which depends
on five cross ratios and admits a conformal block decomposition. In order to obtain differential
equations for 5-point conformal blocks, one first needs to determine which Casimir and vertex operators
characterize these blocks, and then compute their action on the space of cross ratios ui .
For the OPE decomposition of Figure 2, the recipe of Section 2 instructs us to construct four Casimir

(4.7)

Note that – in agreement with the general recipe – the vertex operator is not uniquely defined and (4.7)
can be shifted by terms proportional to (T1 + T2 )2 (T3 )2 or to the Casimir operators.3
To make explicit computations, we will use the embedding space formalism of [25], with which one can
efficiently compute the action of the differential operators in cross ratio space; we briefly review this
formalism in Appendix B. Note here that the dimension of spacetime only appears in our computations
A
as a parameter when contracting Kronecker deltas δA
= d + 2, and can be therefore kept generic.
(∆i )

The first step is the choice of prefactor Ω5

and cross ratios ui . We chose to use the same conventions

as [28], where the author computed 5-point blocks in the case of scalar exchange; the expression for
(∆i )

Ω5

in physical space coordinates can be easily translated into one in embedding space through the

simple relation
− 2Xi * Xj = (xi − xj )2 ,
and one obtains (up to an overall normalization) the prefactor

Regarding the cross ratios, it is natural to build four of these using the same construction of the

3 In

(4.10)

(4.11)

[1], we had picked the more symmetric expression (T1 + T2 − T3 )4 for the vertex operator, which leads to an
equivalent set of operators.

– 36 –

In comparison with a potentially more natural parameterization using five independent 4-point cross
ratios, as in e.g. [31, 43], this parameterization of cross ratio space has the advantage of presenting all
of our differential operators with polynomial coefficients in the ui .
Using the scalar representation for generators in the embedding space (B.3), the operators (4.3)–(4.7)
can be easily expressed as objects D(Xi ) acting on the coordinates XiA . To obtain their action on the
space of cross ratios D(ui ) , one simply conjugates the D(Xi ) by the prefactor as follows
D(ui ) F (u1 , . . . , u5 ) =

(4.12)

In practical terms, the RHS above is expressed in terms of the generators (B.3) and the expres(∆i )

sions (4.9)–(4.11) of Ω5

and the ui 's in terms of scalar products. The LHS is then obtained by

solving (4.10–4.11) for five different scalar products and substituting them in the RHS after the conjugation has been done; the remaining scalar products will drop out and the final answer for the LHS
will be expressed only in terms of the cross ratios.
To implement this procedure more concretely, we attach to this publication a Mathematica notebook4 ,
where we present the explicit computation of the quadratic Casimirs, as well as the final expressions
one gets for the fourth-order Casimirs and the vertex operator (4.7) by trivially extending the same
algorithm.
As an attempt to simplify the analytic expressions for the differential equations, it is natural to try to
extend the 4-point change of coordinates of Dolan and Osborn [8, 9]
u = z z̄ ,

v = (1 − z)(1 − z̄)

(4.13)

to the 5-point case. A very good candidate for this purpose is the change of coordinates
u1 = z1 z ̄1 ,

u2 = (1 − z1 )(1 − z̄1 ) ,

u3 = z2 z̄2 ,

u4 = (1 − z2 )(1 − z̄2 ) ,

(4.14)

u5 = w(z1 − z̄1 )(z2 − z̄2 ) + (1 − z1 − z2 )(1 − z̄1 − z̄2 ) ,
which leads to the simplest expressions for the quadratic Casimirs that we could find. Indeed, by
4 part of this Mathematica code is based on the one written by J. Penedones for the 2013 edition of the Mathematica
Summer School in Theoretical Physics: http://msstp.org/?q=node/285.

Conclusions and Outlook

In this paper we have initiated the construction of multipoint conformal blocks for correlation functions
of N scalar fields. More concretely, we constructed a number of independent commuting differential
operators on N -point functions that matches the number of conformally invariant cross ratios. In
consequence, these operators uniquely determine conformal blocks as bases of joint eigenfunctions into
which one can expand any correlation function of N scalar fields. The set of commuting differential
operators depends on the choice of an OPE channel. We constructed them for all channel topologies,
extending the results we announced in [1]. Our construction relies on the identification of these
operators with the Hamiltonians of certain OPE limits of integrable Gaudin models, see Section 3.
Let us note that, in the special case of d = 2, the relation between conformal blocks and Gaudin
models is consistent with recent observations in [58] concerning ambitwistor realizations of scattering
5 these

expressions differ with what one would get from (4.3) and (4.4) by an overall factor of (−2).

– 38 –

equations in AdS3 , given the close connection between conformal blocks and scattering amplitudes in
anti-de Sitter space [59]. But it is important to stress that the N -site Gaudin Hamiltonians simplify
significantly in the OPE limits relevant to the theory of conformal blocks. While the 4-site Gaudin
system for d = 1 is related to the Heun equation, for example, one obtains hypergeometric differential
equations in the OPE limits.
In any given channel, the set of differential operators decomposes into two subsets formed by Casimir
differential operators on the one hand, and the novel vertex differential operators on the other hand.
Individual vertices can give rise to multivariable integrable systems with up to nv (d) independent
commuting Hamiltonians in the most generic case. All such Hamiltonians are of order higher than
two and they have not received much attention in the physics literature so far. In order to develop a
theory of these vertex systems it seems reasonable to start with the single-variable cases. According
to formula (1.16), all vertices that appear in the comb channel of an N -point function in d = 3, 4
contribute one single degree of freedom. The same is true for the nontrivial vertices in the comb
channel of N = 5, 6-point functions in any d > 2. Therefore, single-variable vertex systems already
cover many cases of interest. The associated vertex differential operator has already been constructed
in [1], though not for the most general case. In the sequel to this work we will revisit this operator,
construct it for all single-variable vertex systems, and show that it can be mapped to the fourth order
Hamiltonian of an elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model that was first discovered about 10 years
ago by Etingof, Felder, Ma and Veselov in [42].
There are two important directions that we will address in order to develop the theory of multi-point
blocks. The first one concerns the extension of what we described in the previous paragraph to vertices
with more variables, such as the central vertex in the snowflake channel of a 6-point function in d > 2.
We will discuss this in a forthcoming paper. The second important direction concerns the study of
(joint) eigenfunctions for the vertex differential operator(s). Unlike the single variable of a 4-point
function in d = 1, for which the Casimir differential equation is the ordinary hypergeometric equation,
even the single variable case of the vertex system seems to be uncharted, let alone its multi-variable
extensions. We plan to address this challenge in the future before we combine the knowledge about
vertex systems back into a full theory of multi-point conformal blocks. In this context, it would also be
interesting to examine the relations of our approach with the weight shifting technology of multi-point
blocks with non-scalar exchange recently exhibited in [41].
While executing the entire program still requires a significant amount of work, applications can be
pursued in parallel. This applies in particular to the multi-point bootstrap that was also advocated

– 39 –

recently in [43]. One can expect the study of multi-point correlation functions to give access to new
dynamical information that is not visible in scalar 4-point functions. The analytic bootstrap study
of 4-point functions has provided powerful access to anomalous dimensions of double twist operators,
as well as OPE coefficients for the operator product of two fundamental scalars into double twist
operators [60, 61]. Similarly, crossing symmetry for N = 6-point functions constrains the anomalous
dimensions of triple twist operators and various OPEs of the fundamental field with double twist
operators, depending on channel topologies that are analyzed.

Proof of the induction in the limits of Gaudin models

In this appendix, we detail the induction in the proof of the limit procedure of Section 3. We thus refer
to this section for notation and definitions. Our main goal is to show that for every vertex ρ ∈ V , the
Lax matrix of the N -sites Gaudin model satisfies the limit (3.6). For the purposes of this appendix,
it will be useful to rewrite this limit as

hρ (z, $) = $nρ z + gρ ($).

(A.2)

where we introduced

In the left-hand side of (A.1), and in all this appendix, we fix the sites wi of the Gaudin model to
their value wi = fi ($) prescribed by the limit procedure of Subsection 3.1. Recall that ρ is either the
reference vertex ρ∗ , in V 0 or in V 00 . We will treat these three cases separately.
A.1

Reference vertex

Let us first consider the reference vertex ρ∗ . The definition of nρ∗ and gρ∗ made in Subsection 3.1 can
be simply rewritten as
nρ∗ = 0

and

– 40 –

hρ∗ (z, $) = z.

The first part is the contribution from the reference edge

Contribution of the subtree T 0 .

The second part is the contribution from the subtree T 0 attached

to e0 , for which we should distinguish the cases where e0 is external or not. If e0 is external (in which
case T 0 is trivial and e0 is the only contribution from this subtree), recall from the first case of eq.
(3.21) that we then have we0 = fe0 ($) = $, so that the contribution to (A.4) simply is
(e0 )

Note that as e0 is external, we have E 0 = {e0 } so that the generators Tα

coincide with Tα

.

If e0 is intermediate in the initial diagram then the contribution from the subtree T 0 comes from the
edges i ∈ E 0 ⊂ N , with corresponding sites wi = fi ($) = $ fi0 ($) as in the second line of eq. (3.21).
By construction, the functions fi0 ($) associated with the external edges i ∈ E 0 stay finite when $ → 0:
indeed, as we supposed T 0 non-trivial, the edges i ∈ E 0 are not the reference edge e0 of T 0 and are thus
associated with polynomial functions fi0 ($). Thus, we get that the corresponding sites wi = $ fi0 ($)
in the initial tree tend to 0 when $ → 0. In this limit, the contribution of this subtree T 0 to the sum
(A.4) then simply becomes

external, we thus observe that in both cases e0 external and internal, the contribution of the subtree

thus tend to 1 when $ → 0. In both cases, we find that the contribution to (A.4) is given by

To conclude, we observe that the labeling of branches at vertices made in Subsection 3.1 using the
plane rooted tree representation T of the diagram implies that E 0 = Iρ∗ ,1 and E 00 = Iρ∗ ,2 . This shows
that the limit (A.1) is satisfied for the reference vertex ρ∗ .
A.2

Vertices in V 0 .

Let us now consider the case of a vertex ρ ∈ V 0 in the subtree attached to e0 . Note that the existence
of this vertex requires the subtree T 0 to be non-trivial and thus the edge e0 to be intermediate in the
initial diagram. The definition of nρ and the recursion relation for gρ ($) in the first line of eq. (3.20)
can be rewritten as
nρ = n0ρ + 1

and

hρ (z, $) = $ h0ρ (z, $),

where we have defined h0ρ (z, $) = $nρ z + gρ0 ($) as the equivalent of hρ (z, $) for the subtree T 0 . We

Thus, the only non-vanishing contribution to (A.13) in the limit

$ → 0 comes from the subtree T attached to e0 . Recall that T 0 is non-trivial since it possesses a
vertex ρ: the external edges i ∈ E 0 ⊂ N are thus different from e0 and are associated with the sites
wi = fi ($) = $fi0 ($), according to the second line of eq. (3.21). The contribution of T 0 to (A.13)
then reads

The Gaudin Lax matrix of the subtree T 0 (the one of the full tree, not the ones associated with vertices)
is given by eq. (3.23) and thus can be rewritten as

Conclusion.

Since the contribution (A.20) is the only non-vanishing term in the limit of eq. (A.13)

when $ → 0, we thus get in the end that
 $→0
$nρ Lα hρ (z, $) −−−→ Lρα (z),

(A.21)

as required. This indeed shows that the limit (A.1) is satisfied for vertices ρ ∈ V 0 , using the induction
hypothesis (3.24) that a similar property also holds in the subtree T 0 .
A.3

Vertices in V 00

Let us finally consider a vertex ρ ∈ V 00 . The procedure here will resemble the one in the previous
subsection so we will not describe it in detail. The definition of nρ and the recursion relation for gρ ($)
in the second line of eq. (3.20) can be rewritten as
nρ = n00ρ + 1

and

hρ (z, $) = 1 + $ h00ρ (z, $).

(A.22)

The main difference with the case of a vertex in V 0 is that we introduced a shift by 1 in the expression

of hρ (z, $). The effect of this shift is that in the computation of the limit of $nρ Lα hρ (z, $) when
$ → 0, the only non-vanishing contribution now comes from the subtree T 00 and not from T 0 . More
precisely, using the fact that the shift by 1 cancels with the 1 in the recursive expression (3.22) of the
sites wi , i ∈ E 00 , we find in the end that


00
lim $nρ Lα hρ (z, $) = lim $nρ L00α h00ρ (z, $) = Lρα (z),

$→0

$→0

(A.23)

with L00α the Lax matrix (3.25) associated with the subtree T 00 , and where the last equality follows from
the induction hypothesis (3.26) for the subtree T 00 . This then completes the proof of the induction.

Embedding space formalism and index-free notation

In this section we will briefly review the embedding space formalism of [25], as well as a slight generalization of their index-free notation that we are going to use in the proof of Appendix C. We will
in particular focus on scalar and tensorial representations. In short, the embedding space formalism
makes use of the isomorphism between the conformal group in d dimensions and the Lorentz group
in d + 2 dimensions – both corresponding to SO(d + 1, 1) – to map objects from one space to the
other. Points x ∈ Rd are mapped to (d + 2)-dimensional vectors X A = (X + , X − , X μ ), here presented
in light-cone coordinates with metric ds2 = −dX − dX + + δμν dX μ dX ν , and to make the degrees of
freedom match, these vectors are constrained to the projective light-cone
X A = X + (1, x2 , xμ ) ' (1, x2 , xμ ) .

– 44 –

(B.1)

With this mapping, scalar fields become homogeneous objects of degree −∆ with respect to the
coordinates X A they depend on
O∆ (λX) = λ−∆ O∆ (X) .

(B.2)

This has the big advantage that the conformal generators, some of which are non-linear, once mapped
to the embedding space, acquire all the same linear form, namely the one of Lorentz generators:
T[AB] = XA ∂B − XB ∂A ,

(B.3)

where XA is obtained by lowering the index of X A by contraction with the flat metric ηAB . This not
only simplifies the analytic expressions that one works with, but also allows one to carry out computer
algebra computations in a much faster and general way through the implementation of indices; this
proves very useful for the computation of operators for scalar multipoint blocks like those of Section 4.

Expressions involving these tensorial representations can be further simplified by the use of an indexfree notation in embedding space. One can implement this by either making the antisymmetries of
the tensors manifest with fermionic variables, as was first done in [62], or by making the symmetries
manifest with bosonic variables, in a form like Appendix B of [63]. In agreement with our choice of
representation for (B.4), we will keep the symmetries manifest and use the latter formalism. The core
idea is to remove indices from the tensorial expressions (B.4) by converting them to polynomials on
m auxiliary vectors Zi ∈ Cd+2 through the contractions

To keep everything consistent with the conformal covariance, tracelessness and transversality of the
tensors, the coordinate vectors need to satisfy
X 2 = X * Zi = Zi * Zj = 0 ,

∀i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L} ,

(B.8)

while the fields need to have polynomial dependence on all the Zi , be homogeneous in every coordinate

∀βij ∈ C .

(B.10)

Note how the Zi are not all on equal footing, but there is rather a hierarchy of gauge transformations (B.10) that respects the hierarchy of spins l1 ≥ * * * ≥ lL : the Zi associated to larger spins
are less constrained than the ones for smaller spins. In fact, a function O∆,{li } (X, {Zi }) satisfying the constraints (B.10) is a section of a line bundle over the flag manifold SO(1, d + 1)/Pd,L 6 ,


Pd,L = SO(1, 1) × SO(2)L × SO(d − 2L) n Rd × Cd−2 × ... × Cd−2L , each point of which is labeled
by an embedding of vector spaces {0} ⊂ Span(X) ⊂ Span(X, Z1 ) ⊂ ... ⊂ Span(X, Z1 , ..., ZL ) ⊂ Cd+2 .
The action of the conformal generators on these fields is also modified to take into account the Zi
dependence, so (B.3) becomes

Using this type of representation for generators and fields, it becomes much simpler to obtain Casimir

Classical Embedding space

For the proof in Appendix C we are going to need a classical version of the embedding space formalism
for the spinning fields that we have just discussed. For this purpose, we introduce PA as the conjugate
momentum to X A , and QiA as conjugate momenta of the auxiliary variables ZiA .
To see which constraints are imposed on these classical variables, one can check the action of the
operators

on fields or correlation functions to get conditions that need to be satisfied by scalar products of
coordinates and momenta. Some of the operators in (B.12) are in fact evaluated to constants on
correlation functions. By imposing the same behavior when replacing derivatives with momenta, one

X * Zi = X * Qi = 0 ,

X * P = −∆ ,

Relations among vertex differential operators

Our goal in this appendix is to justify the relations (2.23) and (2.24) for the total symbols of our
vertex differential operators. There are many ways to derive these relations. Here we shall follow a
more pedestrian approach that does not require much background from representation theory.
In order to derive the relations (2.23), (2.24) we first note that these were formulated in terms of the
coordinates and momenta of the external scalar fields. The representation of the conformal algebra
that is associated to the index set I decomposes into an infinite number of spinning representations.
Each of the irreducible components can be prepared in embedding space formalism (see appendix
B). Here we shall study the relations (2.23) for a given irreducible component so that the coefficients
%f,s are functions of the associated weight and spins rather than functions of symbols of the Casimir
differential operators.
After these introductory comments let us approach relation (2.23) by considering the simplest example
in which the intermediate irreducible representation is scalar. We can construct explicitly the first
three matrices (T̄ n )AB 7 in the classical embedding space that we introduced in Appendix B.1:
T̄ 1

T̄ 2 B = ∆ X A PB + XB P A − P 2 X A XB

T̄ 3 B = ∆2 X A PB − XB P A = ∆2 T̄ 1 B .

and in the discussion below we shall drop the subscript f .

(C.1)

It is then clear that, when considering scalar representations, the powers of generators T̄ n with n ≥ 3
will be dependent on lower powers of the generators. This directly implies that any vertex operator
of the type (2.21) that contains a power of a scalar generator higher than two will become dependent
on operators of lower order, e.g.
T̄ 3 * B ∝ T̄ * B .

(C.2)

We would now like to prove that something analogous to (C.1) is valid for representations of higher
depth d and higher powers, respectively. Let us then consider the generators for a mixed symmetry
tensor of depth d,
T̄[AB] = XA PB +

we expect the n-fold contractions of generators T̄ n to be independent up to power n = 2d, with the
first dependent object produced at power n = 2d + 1. To prove this, let us focus on a specific matrix
entry (T̄ n )AB of the powers T̄ n and construct the following submatrix of the Jacobian for fixed indices

If what we argued above holds, we should be able to see that some 2d-minors of (C.4) are equal to
zero, while the same matrix with the last row dropped out has all nonzero 2d-minors. We checked
this with Mathematica symbolically for the case of symmetric traceless tensors, and numerically for
mixed symmetry tensors of depth d ≤ 6, exhausting all tensorial representations that are allowed in
the range of dimensions of known CFTs. One can use a similar reasoning to show eq. (2.24).
Let us finally comment on a more conceptual interpretation of the results of this appendix. We
consider first the case of a scalar representation, whose generators can be gathered in the matrix
(T̄f )AB = X A PB − XB P A in the fundamental representation. Using the relations X A XA = 0 and
X A PA = −∆, one can show that the matrix T̄f is diagonalisable, with eigenvalues ∆, −∆ and 0 (with
multiplicity d). It is a standard result of linear algebra that T̄f is then annihilated by the polynomial
with simple roots equal to these eigenvalues, namely T (T − ∆)(T + ∆) = T 3 − ∆2 T : we recover this
way that T̄f3 = ∆2 T̄f .
A similar argument can be formulated for a representation with higher depth d = L + 1, characterized
by a weight ∆ and L spins l1 , . . . , lL . The (symbols of the) generators of this representation are
given by eq. (B.14) and can be gathered in a matrix T̄f valued in the fundamental representation.

– 48 –

The traces of odd powers of T̄f vanish, while the traces of even powers are given by the classical
Pd+2
Casimirs (B.15). These traces are the Newton sums i=1 λpi of the eigenvalues λ1 , * * * , λd+2 of T̄f
and thus determine these eigenvalues uniquely (up to permutation). More precisely, we find that T̄f
has eigenvalues ∆, −∆, l1 , −l1 , . . . , lL , −lL and 0 (with multiplicity d − 2L). If we suppose that T̄f is
diagonalizable, it is then annihilated by the polynomial with simple roots equal to these eigenvalues,
hence



2
T̄f T̄f2 − ∆2 T̄f2 − l12 * * * T̄f2 − lL
= 0.

(C.5)

This shows that the power T̄f2L+3 = T̄f2d+1 is expressible in terms of lower power T̄fn , n ≤ 2d, as
expected. Let us finally note that the coefficients in the relation (C.5) are elementary symmetric
2
polynomials in the variables (∆2 , l12 , . . . , lL
): by the Newton identities, these coefficients are then
PL
also polynomials in the Newton sums ∆2p + i=1 li2p and thus in the values (B.15) of the classical
(n,m)

Casimirs. This ensures that the coefficients %f ;AB in eq. (2.23) are polynomials in the total symbols
of the Casimir operators.
