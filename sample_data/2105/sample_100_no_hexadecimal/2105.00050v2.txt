Supersaturation is the fundamental thermodynamic parameter driving crystal nucleation and growth, yet
no method can characterize it during the formation of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). Here, we develop a
framework to experimentally characterize time-resolved profiles of supersaturation throughout NC growth.
As demonstrated with Au nanocubes, our methodology can predict the growth profiles of NCs and reveal
supersaturation-associated shape evolutions. By altering supersaturation dynamics, we modulate these shape
evolutions and NC features with atomic precision. This work paves the way for deeper understanding of the
complex phenomena directing nanoscale crystal growth and provides insight for the rational design of NCs.
Nanocrystals
(NCs)
present
structure-dependent
properties that can be superior, or unavailable, to bulk
crystals [1-6]. Using the mechanistic insight gained by
elucidating reaction pathways, synthesis methods can grow
NCs with precise size, shape, elemental composition and
lattice strain [7-14], facilitating next-generation technologies
in heterogenous catalysis, chemical processing, electronics,
photonics, energy harvesting, chemical and biological
sensing, medicine and environmental remediation [1-6,1517]. Nonetheless, despite significant interest, the growth of
colloidal NCs remains poorly understood, based in part on
limited insight into the thermodynamic processes governing
growth [18,19].
Supersaturation is the fundamental thermodynamic
parameter that drives crystal growth and can be defined by

s = ln

C
Dμ
=
,
C¥ kBT

(1)

where C is the bulk monomer concentration, C¥ is the bulk
saturation concentration, Dμ is the chemical potential and
kBT is the thermodynamic temperature. To form NCs,
synthesis formulations modulate C above the saturation
(enabling growth if nuclei are present) or nucleation limits.
For substrate-bound NCs, mechanistic experiments use open
reactions and introduce vapor or liquid sources with fixed
supersaturations to uncover insight into growth [20-23]. In
contrast, colloidal NC syntheses typically use closed
conditions, and reactions dynamically convert precursor to
monomer throughout crystal formation [Fig. 1(a)]. These
processes are complex, and supersaturation profiles during
growth have yet to be quantitatively determined, hindering
the theoretical modeling as well as mechanistic investigation
of colloidal NC growth. Since 1950, the LaMer-Dinegar
model, as shown in Fig. 1(b), has guided qualitative
understanding of how monomer tends to progress during the
nucleation and growth of colloidal NCs [24].
In this Letter, we develop a framework to characterize
supersaturation throughout the synthesis of colloidal NCs,
enabling theoretical modeling of, and mechanistic insight
into, their growth. The methodology uses inputs from facile,

real-time optical techniques to determine time-resolved
supersaturation profiles. To show this, we synthesize
colloidal Au nanocubes; use the framework to characterize
supersaturation throughout growth; predict their growth
profile; and show how supersaturation mediates, and can
modulate, the features and shape evolutions of NCs during
growth.
To develop the framework, we first consider the mass
balance for monomer concentration in closed conditions at
time i : Ci = Ci -1 + Ciconv - CiNC [Fig. 1(a)]. For Dti ® 0 , the
supply and consumption concentrations of monomer can be
determined by Ci + / - = Ri Dti , where Ri is the intensive form
of the molar rate of conversion from precursor to monomer
(for Ciconv ) or intensive form of the molar rate of monomer
consumption due to NC growth (for CiNC ). Colloidal NC
syntheses typically involve precursor-limited reactions,
which consume monomer as it is produced ( Ci » Ci -1 » 0 )
[13,25]. Hence, conversion of precursor to monomer
coincides with colloidal NC growth and Rconv (t ) = RNC (t ) .

NCs. (a) The general reaction pathway of metal precursors

The reduction pathway of metal halide perovskites was
represented by the oleate injection method for ternary NCs.
(b) LaMer-Dinegar plot of monomer concentration, in which
supersaturation (I) precedes homogenous nucleation (II) and
growth (III).

To determine RNC (t ) , we consider the thermodynamic
influences on nanoscale crystallization. The local saturation
concentration at the surface of a spherical NC of radius r is
described by the Gibbs-Thomson equation,

Ci (t ) = (C0 - C¥ )exp(-kt ) + C¥ ,

where uc is the molar volume of the monomer, g is the
surface energy and R is the gas constant [26]. Based on this
equation, as obtained by Sugimoto [27] and expanded by
Talapin et al. [28], the radial growth rate of a single colloidal
NC is described by

Monomer deposits onto surfaces during classical crystal
growth, and the areal number of monomer units for a NC is
A = 4p r 2 a 2 , where a is the lattice parameter. In turn, the
areal growth rate of a single colloidal NC is

CNC (t ) = (C0 - C¥ ) - (C0 - C¥ )exp(-kt ),

(6)

where nNC is the number of NCs undergoing growth, N A is
Avogadro's number and Vs is the volume of the synthesis
formulation. Thus, the rate of monomer consumption
depends on bulk supersaturation and is modulated by the
Gibbs-Thomson effect based on the distribution of NC size.
To characterize supersaturation, we use the observation
that colloidal NCs show size-dependent optical properties,
such as light scattering, extinction and fluorescence [13,2932]. That is, rather than directly quantify Rconv (t ) , which is
experimentally complex, we can use facile, real-time optical
techniques to determine RNC (t ) .

When these reactions have an induction period in the
conversion from precursor to monomer, the reaction can be
described by sigmoidal kinetics:

RNC (t ) = -

dCi k (C0 - C¥ ) exp[k (t - t0 )]

{1 + exp[k (t - t0 )]}2

(10)

where t0 denotes the inflection point, and

C NC (t ) = (C0 - C¥ ) -

C0 - C¥
,
1 + exp[k (t - t0 )]

(11)

Re-arranging Eq. (6), we find

é

As crystal formation coincides with monomer consumption,
we use this equation to derive the intensive form of the molar
rate of monomer consumption:

(7)

where k is the rate constant and C0 is the total monomer
concentration. The concentration of crystallized monomer is
then

RNC (t ) = -

where D is the bulk monomer diffusion coefficient, a is
the reaction transfer constant and k0g is the rate constant for
bulk growth. As 2ucg RT is on the order of nanometers, in
the diffusion regime ( D ! k0g ), Eq. (3) simplifies to

dr uc DC¥

r

When syntheses directly introduce monomer or
quantitatively convert precursor to monomer before seed
addition, reactions typically follow pseudo-first-order
kinetics [32-35]. Assuming that growth is run to completion,
in which the final monomer concentration becomes C¥ , the
bulk monomer concentration can be described by

(12)

where r is implicit to the function and RNC (t ) is specified
by Eq. (9) for pseudo-first-order reactions; Eq. (10) for
reactions with an induction period; or higher-order equations
for reactions with greater kinetic complexity [32,36]. Based
on 2ucg RT , r > 10 nm tends to lead to a small contribution
from the Gibbs-Thomson effect, and NCs grow at rates
comparable to bulk crystals. Supersaturation then becomes
an explicit relationship and is described by

(13)

According to these equations, reactions with lower-order
kinetics result in four optically observable profiles of bulk
monomer progression (Fig. 2), which each resemble sections
of the LaMer-Dinegar plot [Fig. 1(b)].

FIG. 2. Observable profiles of bulk monomer during the
precursor-limited nucleation or growth of colloidal NCs.
Low-order monomer profiles were based on Eqs. (13) and
(9) or (10) (a) during homogenous nucleation, (b) after
addition of seed to a growth formulation in which precursor
has been fully converted to monomer, (c) after addition of
seed to a growth formulation in which precursor has been
partially converted to monomer and (d) in which conversion
of precursor to monomer is initiated by seed addition.
Thus far, we have assumed that NCs undergo layer-bylayer (LBL) growth, a classical mode of crystal growth.
While NCs can grow nonclassically by attachment [37-39],
they predominantly grow by the classical modes: LBL,
normal (N) or dislocation-driven (DD) growth [2023,27,28,40-42]. Each classical growth mode can be
described by its relationship with supersaturation [26]. That
is, as we derived in the Supplemental Material, Note 2,
growth kinetics can be linked directly to supersaturation, a
thermodynamic parameter, through a linear free energy
relationship (LFER):

log(k k0 ) = dre ,

(14)

where d describes the difference in chemical environments
between reaction series, r represents the supersaturationindependent variables of growth mechanisms and e is the
relative supersaturation term defined as

LBL
ì s -s0,
îlog(s - s 0 ), DD and N,

e =í

(15)

with k0 and s 0 as the rate constant and supersaturation,
respectively, of a reference reaction. Thus, by solely
modulating s in a reaction series [43], this LFER can
distinguish between modes via e or mechanisms based on
the same mode via r (e.g., two facets grow LBL [same

mode] but monomer deposition is favored on one facet [the
mechanism], resulting in anisotropic growth).
Using our framework, we investigated the growth of
colloidal Au nanocubes. To experimentally assess size and
shape evolutions, we arrested growth at various times
(Methods) and imaged the NCs using high-angle annular
darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) [Fig. 3(a)]. Cuboctahedra evolved to
truncated cubes and then to cubes [Fig. 3(b)]. As shown in
scanning electron (SE)-STEM images [Fig. 3(c)],
overgrowth occurred on a proportion of cubes, and other
shapes including tetrahedra also appeared during synthesis.
We analyzed the yields of the NC shapes throughout growth
and found that, after evolving from cuboctahedra, the total
yield of NCs with cubic shape (truncated cubes, cubes and
overgrown cubes) remained consistent (92.9, 92.3, 92.1 and
93.0% at 2.0, 4.0, 7.0 and 15 min) (Table S1), suggesting that
overgrowth occurred on already-formed cubic NCs, rather
than during the transition from cuboctahedra to cubes.
Based on growth kinetics measured via extinction [Fig.
3(d), progression of the full extinction spectra is shown in
Fig. S1], we used Eqs. (10) and (13) to characterize the timeresolve supersaturation profile in the colloidal system [Fig.
3(e), equation parameters shown in Table S2]. Using this
supersaturation profile, we modeled colloidal nanocube
growth using Eq. (4). Notably, the theoretical growth profile
predicted the experimental one [Fig. 3(f)], supporting that
supersaturation dynamics were properly interpreted for these
NCs. We also characterized supersaturation by imaging the
color development during growth, finding agreement
between imaging and spectrophotometry and further
showing utility of this methodology (Fig. S3). Furthermore,
we compared the shape yields throughout growth to the
supersaturation profile, which indicated that overgrowth was
associated with supersaturation [Fig. 3(e)]. More
specifically, overgrowth occurred predominantly when
supersaturation was high in the early stages of synthesis.
Based on these cumulative insights, we rationalized that
reducing growth kinetics in the early stages of synthesis
would mitigate cube overgrowth. As informed by Eqs. (14)
and (15), we decreased supersaturation to reduce growth
rate. The synthesis formulation for the NCs shown in Fig. 3
used 0.1 molar equivalents (eqv., relative to Au added) of
NaOH. Supersaturation was modulated by replacing NaOH
with HCl, as H+ and Cl- are chemically endogenous to the
synthesis formulation, are labile ions and should decrease the
bulk monomer concentration (Fig. S4) [44].
Figure 4(a-c) shows the products of these syntheses, with
larger-area micrographs shown in Fig. S5. We characterized
the growth kinetics of these formulation via extinction (Fig.
S6), which indicated that these additions of HCl reduced
supersaturation, particularly in the early stages of synthesis
[Fig. 4(d)]. This indeed diminished the proportion of
overgrown nanocubes [Fig. 4(e), shape yields summarized in
Table S3]. For 0.1 eqv. NaOH, 17.1% of the NCs were
overgrown nanocubes. For 1 eqv. HCl and 2 eqv. HCl, the
yield of overgrown nanocubes diminished to 7.5% and 4.0%,
respectively. Concomitantly, increasing the amounts of HCl
led to the emergence of tetrahedra [Fig. 4(e)].

curve) overlaid on shape yields (bars) at 0.5, 2, 4, 7 and 15 min throughout colloidal nanocube growth. Shapes are denoted by
the colors in (c). (f) Experimental and theoretical growth for colloidal nanocubes. Theoretical growth was modelled using the
supersaturation profile from (e). Dots and bars represent mean and SD.
The sharpness of nanocube corners decreased as
increasing amounts of HCl were added [Fig. 4(d)], which
was likely due to the changes in supersaturation [45]. With
more HCl, the yield of truncated cubes increased while the
yield of cubes decreased [Fig. 4(e)]. For 0.1 eqv. NaOH,
32.6% of the NCs were truncated nanocubes. This proportion
increased to 56.7% for 1 eqv. HCl and then 67.9% for 2 eqv.
HCl.
We sized the nanocubes to further evaluate the influence
of the supersaturation profile on their structural features. The
nanocubes had similar overall sizes across the three synthesis
formulations (Table S4), and we measured a sharpness index
for each NC (S), as described in Fig. 4(f). Figure S7 shows
measurements by sharpness index, which was normalized by
NC size. For 0.1 eqv. NaOH, the mean estimate of S was 16.3
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9-16.6) nm, whereas it
was 15.3 (15.0-15.6) nm for 1 eqv. HCl and 13.3 (12.9-13.7)
nm for 2 eqv. HCl. These values were equivalent to 68.9
(67.6-70.2) d111 for 0.1 eqv. NaOH, 65.1 (63.8-66.4) d111 for
1 eqv. HCl and 56.3 (54.6-58.0) d111 for 2 eqv. HCl, where
d111 denotes {111} interplanar distances (the corners of facecentered cubic nanocubes point in the <111> direction) [42].
Thus, slight modifications in the supersaturation profile
modulated nanocube corners with atomic precision.

In summary, we developed a thermodynamic framework
and the accompanying methodology to characterize
supersaturation throughout NC synthesis. Remarkably, these
quantitative profiles resemble the qualitative ones originally
conceptualized by LaMer and Dinegar in 1950 [24]. Based
on these profiles, NC growth can be modeled and predicted
theoretically, and complex size and shape evolutions can be
associated with supersaturation dynamics. These insights
potentiate the rational design of colloidal NCs, including
with atomic precision.
Since NCs generally interact with light as a size-dependent
property, our approaches can be employed to broadly study
supersaturation during NC formation. The framework also
presents additional opportunities not experimentally
explored here. Characterizing monomer concentrations
during nucleation may uncover critical nucleation
concentrations [Fig. 2(a)]. The LFER in Eqs. (14) and (15)
links NC kinetics with bulk thermodynamics, presenting a
way to systematically study the mechanisms and modes of
NC growth. Moreover, the relevance of these findings also
extends beyond nanoscience, materials science and physical
chemistry, as better understanding the phenomena that direct
nanoscale crystal formation may facilitate the development
of key technologies in a broad range of fields, from medicine
to energy.

Nanoseed preparation. In a 20 ml scintillation vial, 10 mM
HAuCl4 (250 μl) was added to a solution of 100 mM CTAB
(9.75 ml), followed by the rapid addition of ice-cold 10 mM
NaBH4 (600 μl). Samples were stirred at room temperature

at 300 rpm. The color progressed to red, indicating growth.
Samples were then twice centrifuged at 20,600xg for 30 min.
The first resuspension was with MilliQ (1 ml) and the second
was with 20 mM CTAC (1 ml).
Nanocube synthesis. In a 20 ml quartz cuvette, 100 mM
CTAC (6 ml); 40 mM NaBr (30 μl); nanoseeds (30 μl); HCl
or NaOH (200 μl, see below); 10 mM ascorbic acid (390 μl,
dropwise); and 0.5 mM HAuCl4 (6 ml) were added
sequentially and then mixed via pipette. Aside from initial
pipette mixing, the solution was left untouched. The
concentration of HCl or NaOH added was modified
according to the experiment: 0.1 equivalents (eqv.) NaOH
(1.5 mM), 1 eqv. HCl (15 mM) or 2 eqv. HCl (30 mM).
Molar equivalents refer to the molar ratio with Au added.
Optical characterization of NC growth
Nanocubes were synthesized in 20 ml quartz cuvettes
(path length, 1 cm) as described above. To characterize
growth via extinction, the cuvettes were placed in darkness
in an apparatus, which passed light from a source
(OceanOptics, Orlando, USA) using fiber optic cables

(OceanView Optics, Orlando, USA), 10-m round
subminiature assembly (SMA) connectors and detector
collection lenses (L4 chamfered; OceanView Optics,
Orlando, USA) to an in-line UV/Vis spectrometer (Flame T
spectrometer; OceanView Optics, Orlando, USA) with a
4000-series detector (350-1000 nm filter; OceanView
Optics, Orlando, USA). Extinction spectra (400-900 nm,
step size: 0.217 nm) were collected every 30 s. To
characterize growth via nanoplasmonic color, the cuvettes
were imaged (EOS Rebel T7i with EF 100 mm macro lens,
Canon Canada, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) under fume hood
lighting every 30 s or 1 min. The addition of HAuCl4 marked
the start time (0 s).
Arresting colloidal NC growth
The growth of colloidal NCs was arrested via ligand
exchange and solvent transfer based on a procedure adapted
from Park et al. [2]. Nanocubes were prepared as previously
described with 0.1 eqv. NaOH. At various time points, 8 ml
of colloidal NCs was quickly added to a THF solution of 1.1
mM PS-thiol (10 ml) in a 20 ml scintillation vial. This
solution was vortexed aggressively (>2 min) until it became
grey and translucent. This procedure was used for each time
point (30 s, 45 s, 2 min, 4 min, 7 min and 15 min).
Samples were left at room temperature overnight to allow
the colloidal NCs to settle in the vial. After this, most of the
liquid was removed from the vial via pipetting, and vials
were placed under reduced pressure until the liquid had
evaporated (>2 h). Next, 1 ml toluene was added to each
sample, followed by sonication to resuspend the NCs.
Samples were then twice centrifuged at 21,000xg for 25 min.
The first and second resuspensions were with 1.0 and 0.1 ml
of toluene, respectively.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy
STEM samples were prepared by drop casting the
respective solution (5 μl) on a 400-mesh pure C, Cu grid
(Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, USA) and dried under hood
evaporation. Before drop casting, colloidal NCs were
prepared via centrifugation and resuspension in MilliQ.
Grids were cleaned via ultraviolet light (5-15 min per side)
before imaging. HAADF-STEM and SE-STEM images were
acquire using a Hitachi HF-3300 300 kV Environmental
TEM with an electron acceleration voltage of 300 kV.
NC sizing and counting
For sizing, two representative large-area HAADF-STEM
images were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.51s; National
Institutes of Health, USA), yielding n ≥ 40 NCs for each time
point. Each NC that could be clearly delineated in its
HAADF-STEM image was sized. For cubes, four
measurements were taken for each NC: two corner-to-corner
(C) and two edge-to-edge (E) measurements [Fig. S3(a)]. For
cuboctahedra, three side-to-side (D) measurements were
taken [Fig. S3(b)]. The data were presented as mean for each
time point.

To characterize the shape yields at each time point, each
NC was assessed for its shape in four representative largearea HAADF-STEM images. For a perfect nanocube, C =
E√2 based on the parameters described in Fig. S3, where C
= max(C1,C2) and E = min(E1,E2). To delineate truncated
cubes from cubes [1], we applied a factor threshold of 1.3;
that is, truncated cubes (C < 1.3E) were below this threshold,
whereas cubes (C ≥ 1.3E) were equal to or above it. The
count for each shape was summed from these images, and
yields were presented as percentages of the overall number
of NCs counted.

II. LINEAR FREE ENERGY
RELATIONSHIP
We formulated a linear free energy relationship (LFER) to
delineate the modes as well as mechanisms of classical
crystal growth based on the relationship between
supersaturation and growth kinetics. This supplementary
note summarizes the three modes of classical crystal growth
in the diffusion regime, based on their descriptions in [3],
and describes the formulation of a LFER that
comprehensively describe classical crystal growth.
Normal growth
Normal (N) growth occurs above the roughening
temperature of a metal. Above this threshold, entropy effects
cause crystal surfaces to be atomically rough, presenting an
abundance of kink sites in which monomer can directly
incorporate. Hence, the rate of normal growth depends on the
probability of finding a kink and the monomer flux and, in
solution, can be described by
R! = β" v# (C − C$ ),

(S1)

where v# is the molar volume of a Au atom in the crystal, C
is the monomer concentration and β" is the kinetic
coefficient for normal crystallization in solution that, in the
case of lower supersaturations, is approximated by
a &
∆U
β" = aν 0 2 exp 0−
2,
δ%
k' T

(S2)

in which a is the lattice parameter, ν is the vibrational
frequency of an adatom, (a/δ% )& represents the geometric
probability that a monomer finds a kink site on the crystal
surface from solution, ∆U is the kinetic barrier for the
incorporation of monomer into a kink site and k' T is the
thermodynamic temperature. As seen in Eq. (S1), when
supersaturation is small (σ ≈ C − C$ ), it forms a linear
relationship with the rate of N growth.
Dislocation-driven growth
Like N growth, dislocation-driven (DD) and layer-bylayer (LBL) growth occur in the direction normal to the

crystal surface. In these modes, steps are oriented parallel to
the crystal facet and spread laterally as monomer
incorporates. That is, growth occurs as steps fill laminarly.
Hence, the growth rate is based on the rate of step advance v
and the density of steps p:
R = pv.

(S3)

Dislocations generate steps on a crystal surface, into which
monomer incorporates. Screw dislocations, the predominant
dislocation driving DD growth, present perpetuating steps
with height equal to their Burgers vector. Monomer
advances the step, forming a secondary step normal to it but
still along the crystal facet. Above the critical edge length for
two-dimensional nucleation, monomer incorporates into the
secondary step, advancing it and leading to the formation of
a tertiary step when it reaches the critical edge length. This
process leads to the characteristic spiral growth profile, and
DD growth rate can be described in the diffusion regime by
R( = B

of dislocations and B is the rate constant defined by
B=

(S6)

where D is the bulk diffusion coefficient of the monomer and
d is the thickness of the stagnant layer.
The characteristic supersaturation delineates two limiting
cases of DD growth with distinct profiles. In the case σ ≪
σ+ , sinh(σ⁄σ# ) ≈ σ⁄σ# and Eq. (S4) simplifies to
R(,* =

B
σ&

ln(d/πa) σ#&

(S7)

which has a parabolic relationship with supersaturation. In
the other case (σ ≫ σ# ), Eq. (S4) simplifies to
R(,& = Bσ,

(S8)

which has a linear relationship with supersaturation.
Layer-by-layer growth
LBL growth involves the formation of two-dimensional
nuclei on crystal surfaces to present steps for growth. The
mononuclear LBL growth rate is described by

R-'- = J% Ah

(S9)

where A is the surface area of the facet, h is the step height
and J% is the rate of two-dimensional nucleation defined by

Polynuclear LBL growth arises when the rate of twodimensional nucleation exceeds the time taken to complete
the lateral growth of a layer, which occurs above the critical
facet size determined by
L = (v⁄J% )*⁄/ .

(S11)

Above this threshold, the polynuclear LBL growth rate can
be described by

where y% is the interstep distance.
Formulation of the linear free energy relationship
LFERs are semi-empirical equations that relate
logarithmic forms of the thermodynamics and kinetics of
reaction series [4]. Supersaturation, a thermodynamic
parameter, modulates the rate of crystal growth, a kinetic
quantity, and we hypothesized that classical crystal growth
could be comprehensively described by a LFER. To
formulate it, we first considered the forms of their growth
equations, as we derived above. At low supersaturations, R!
has a linear relationship with σ, that is, R! = ρ! σ, where ρ
represents the supersaturation-independent terms. For DD
growth, R(,* has a parabolic relationship with σ (R(,* =
ρ!,* σ & ), whereas R(,& has a linear relationship with σ
(R(,& = ρ!,& σ). As described in [5], R-'- , and hence R0-'- ,
has an exponential relationship with supersaturation within
the range typical for NC growth (R-'- = ρ-'- e3 ).
To expand this framework, we consider the difference
between crystal growth reactions: one reference reaction and
one, or more, other reaction(s) with the supersaturation
modified. After taking the logarithm of the difference in this
reaction series, we formulate, and postulate, our LFER:
log(k⁄k% ) = δρε,
(S13)
where δ describes the difference in chemical environments
between reaction series, ρ represents the supersaturationindependent parameters that can delineate growth
mechanisms, and ε is the relative supersaturation term
described by

ε=A

σ − σ% ,
log(σ − σ% ) ,

LBL
DD and N,

(S14)

with k and σ as the rate constant and supersaturation of
crystal growth reaction, respectively, and k% and σ% as the
parameters from the reference reaction. Note that both
limiting cases of DD growth result in ε = log(σ − σ% ), based
on the application of the logarithm, and these two cases can
be differentiated based on ρ. For mathematical consistency,
we typically take δ to be negative.
According to Eqs. (S13) and (S14), by solely modulating
supersaturation, the modes of classical crystal growth can be
distinguished by ε, while mechanisms can be additionally
differentiated by ρ. Moreover, the N and DD modes of
growth can be distinguished based on the local temperature
relative to the roughening temperature [3]. As nanoscale
crystal growth often occurs via classical modes, the LFER
becomes a powerful tool to investigate how NCs grow, in
addition to how macroscopic crystals grow. As this study
develops a method to characterize the time-resolved profile
of supersaturation throughout colloidal NC growth, the
LFER can also be applied to colloidal systems. Moreover, as
shown in Fig. 1(a), the general reaction pathways of colloidal
NC growth appear similar, suggesting that supersaturation
modulation paired with our LFER can be applied to study
how many different types of NCs grow.

III. KINETICS OF NANOCRYSTAL
GROWTH VIA NANOPLASMONIC
EXTINCTION AND COLOR
We characterized the growth kinetics of the colloidal Au
nanocubes via their extinction or colorimetric profiles. As
the NC growth had an initial induction period, we used Eq.
(10), and the kinetics based on extinction were analyzed by
% Yield [Au% ]!+,4 =

E4 − min(E)
,
max(E) − min(E)

(S15)

where E4 represents the peak extinction at time i and
max (E) and min (E) represent the maximum and minimum
peak extinction throughout growth. The extinction spectra
were collected using the in-line spectrometer (Methods) and
the peak extinction refers to the highest extinction value at
the peak wavelength between 500-600 nm. The full spectra
along time are shown in Fig. S2.
As the nanoplasmonic color of the colloidal NCs was red
(Fig. S4), we used the G value after red-green-blue (RGB)
analysis using ImageJ (version 1.51s; National Institutes of
Health, USA) to characterize growth kinetics via color. To
normalize the intrinsic variation among images in white
balance, we used G!,4 = G!,!+ − G!,+ , where G!,4 represents
the normalized G value, G!,!+ represents the G value from
the colloidal NC solution and G!,+ represents the G value

from the background for the ith image. The kinetics of
colloidal NC growth were then analyzed by
% Yield [Au% ]!+,4 =

max (G! ) − G!,4
,
max(G! ) − min (G! )

(S16)

where max (G! ) and min (G! ) represent the maximum and
minimum normalized G values for the array of images,
respectively. The color images were collected as described
in the Methods.

IV. THEORETICAL MODELING OF
NANOCRYSTAL GROWTH
We used the thermodynamic framework developed in this
study to model the theoretical growth of the colloidal NCs.
The time-resolved supersaturation profile for a sample was
estimated using Eq. (13), with the equation parameters
summarized in Table S2. Eq. (6) was then used to model the
growth of the colloidal nanocrystals. Since the molar ratio of
NaBr and HAuCl4 was low in the growth formulation, C$
was estimated based on the equilibrium concentration of
[AuCl2]- [5]. We approximated n56 assuming spherical
nanoseeds with a size of 2.5 nm after the initial nucleation
step in nanoseed synthesis. After the secondary growth step
in nanoseed synthesis (Methods), the size of the nanoseeds
d4 , which was the initial size of the colloidal NCs in
nanocube growth, was taken to be 4 nm.
