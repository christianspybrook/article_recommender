Abstract. Visco-energetic solutions have been recently advanced as a new solution concept for rate-independent systems, alternative to energetic solutions/quasistatic evolutions and balanced viscosity solutions. In the
spirit of this novel concept, we revisit the analysis of the variational model proposed by Francfort and Marigo
for the quasi-static crack growth in brittle materials, in the case of antiplane shear. In this context, viscoenergetic solutions can be constructed by perturbing the time incremental scheme for quasistatic evolutions by
means of a viscous correction inspired by the term introduced by Almgren, Taylor, and Wang in the study of
mean curvature flows. With our main result we prove the existence of a visco-energetic solution with a given
initial crack. We also show that, if the cracks have a finite number of tips evolving smoothly on a given time
interval, visco-energetic solutions comply with Griffith's criterion.

Keywords: variational models, energy minimization, visco-energetic solutions, crack propagation, Griffith's criterion.

1. Introduction
The variational approach to brittle fracture, based on the classical theory by Griffith [Gri20], was initiated
more than twenty years ago by Francfort and Marigo [FM98] (cf. also [BFM08]). In these models crack
growth results from a trade-off between the competing mechanisms of
- energy conservation, with the driving energy given by the stored elastic energy;
- energy dissipation, which takes into account the dissipated energy spent to open the crack.
In the case of antiplane shear the reference configuration is represented by a bounded, connected, Lipschitz
domain Ω ⊂ R2 , the displacement u : Ω → R is scalar and the cracks are represented by compact subsets K
of Ω. The evolution is triggered by a prescribed time dependent boundary condition u = g(t) on a subset
∂D Ω of ∂Ω. According to the model by Francfort and Marigo, for a linearly elastic homogeneous isotropic
material the competing energy terms are

dissipated energy:

H1 (K(t)\K(s)), where H1 denotes the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure.

For simplicity the elastic constant and the toughness of the material are normalized to 1 .
If K(Ω) denotes the collection of all compact subsets of Ω , a quasistatic evolution for the brittle fracture
model proposed in [FM98] is a function K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) fulfilling the following conditions:
(I) irreversibility: K(s) ⊂ K(t) for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T ;
(S) stability: at every t ∈ [0, T ] we have
E(t, K(t)) ≤ E(t, K ′ ) + H1 (K ′ \K(t))

for all K ′ ∈ K(Ω) with K ′ ⊃ K(t),

namely the release of potential energy when passing from the current state K(t) to any other state
K ′ ∈ K(Ω) is smaller than the energy dissipated, that is why (1.2) can also be understood as a stability
condition;

for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T ,

involving the stored energy at the process times s and t, the energy dissipated in the time interval
[s, t], and the work of the external forces represented by the integral term.
In [DMT02b] this crack model in the antiplane case was analyzed imposing a bound on the number of
connected components of the crack, thus replacing the space K(Ω) by the space Km (Ω) of all compact subsets
of Ω with at most m connected components and finite 1 -dimensional Hausdorff measure. The existence
of quasistatic evolutions satisfying (I), (S), and (E) was proved by constructing discrete-time approximate
τ
solutions: given a partition 0 = t0τ < t1τ < . . . < tN
τ = T of [0, T ], the time incremental minimization scheme

Kτi ∈ Argmin E(tiτ , K) + H1 (K\Kτi−1 ) : K ∈ Km (Ω), K ⊃ Kτi−1
for i = 1, . . . , Nτ
(1.4)

provides an approximate solution which converges to a continuous-time solution as the time step tends to 0 .
Ever since, the analysis of quasistatic evolutions for crack propagation models has been extended in several
directions, cf., e.g., [Cha03, FL03, DMFT05, DML10, FS18]. Furthermore, thanks to their flexibility and
robustness, the notion of quasistatic evolution and the parallel concept of energetic solution [MT99, MT04]
have been extensively applied to a broad class of rate-independent systems (cf. [MR15] for a survey).
Nonetheless, it has been known for some time that quasistatic evolutions/energetic solutions have a drawback. Namely, when the energy functional driving the system is nonconvex, such evolutions, as functions of
time, may have 'too early' and 'too long' jumps between energy wells, cf., e.g., [KMZ08, Ex. 6.3], and the full
characterization of energetic solutions to 1 -dimensional rate-independent systems proved in [RS13]. Essentially,
this is due to the global character of the stability condition (S), which involves the overall energy landscape.
These considerations have motivated the quest of alternative weak solvability notions based on local, rather
than global, minimality.
To our knowledge, the first attempt in this direction dates back to [DMT02a], where, as an alternative to
(1.4), the following time incremental minimization scheme was proposed for brittle fracture growth (still in the
two-dimensional antiplane case):

i−1
2
, u ∈ H 1 (Ω\K)
(uiτ , Kτi ) ∈ Argmin E(tiτ , K) + H1 (K\Kτi−1 ) + λku − ui−1
τ kL2 (Ω) : K ∈ Km (Ω), K ⊃ Kτ

for i = 1, . . . , Nτ , with λ > 0 a fixed constant. The additional L2 -contribution penalizes the L2 -distance of
the updated discrete displacement uiτ from the previous ui−1
, and thus enforces locality on the time discrete
τ
level. We also record the notion of fracture evolution by local minimality advanced in [Lar10].
A more general approach to a reformulation of rate-independent evolution devoid of unnatural jumps was
pioneered in [EM06]. It stemmed from the idea that rate-independent evolution originates in the limit of
systems governed by two time scales: the 'fast' inner scale of the system and the 'slow', but dominant, time
scale of the external forces. In this perspective, viscous dissipation is negligible during a time interval in which
the system evolves continuously, but it is expected to enter into the system behavior at jumps. Thus, one
selects those solutions to the original rate-independent system that arise as limits of solutions to the viscously
regularized system. This procedure leads to an alternative solution concept featuring a local, in place of a global,
stability/minimality condition, and an energy-dissipation balance that provides a description of the system
behavior at jumps, with the possible onset of 'viscous behavior'. On the one hand, the vanishing-viscosity
technique has been formalized in an abstract setting in [MRS12, MRS16] (cf. also [Neg14]), that codified the
properties of these 'vanishing-viscosity solutions' in the notion of balanced viscosity solution. On the other hand,
it has been developed and refined in various concrete applications, cf., e.g., [DDS11, BFM12, KRZ13, CL16]).

VISCO-ENERGETIC SOLUTIONS FOR BRITTLE FRACTURE

As far as brittle fracture models are concerned, however, the vanishing-viscosity approach has been carried
out either assuming that the crack path is a priori known, or in specific geometric settings, cf., e.g., [TZ09,
Cag08, KMZ08, KZM10, LT11, LT13, Alm17, CL17, ALL20]). These restrictions are related to the fact that
the construction of balanced viscosity solutions ultimately relies on the validity of a suitable chain rule for the
energy functional driving the system, which seems to be hard to obtain for more general fracture models.
That is why, finding an appropriate mathematical formulation for the evolution of brittle fracture as an
alternative to the notion of quasistatic evolution, without specific assumptions on the cracks, is still an upto-date and challenging issue. In this paper we aim to contribute to it by showing how the concept of viscoenergetic solution to a rate-independent system, recently introduced in [MS18], can be successfully applied to
the two-dimensional antiplane model first addressed in [DMT02b].
As we will see, visco-energetic solutions have a structure in between that of energetic and balanced viscosity
solutions. This intermediate character is also apparent in their characterization, obtained for one-dimensional
systems in [Min17], in the results of [RS17], and in their applicability to rate-independent systems in damage,
plasticity, and delamination, cf. [Ros19]. Here we are going to demonstrate that the model by Francfort
and Marigo, at least in the versions considered in [DMT02b] and [Cha03], provides yet another example of
rate-independent process for which visco-energetic solutions are an adequate tool, while the balanced viscosity
concept fails to apply.
Visco-energetic evolution of brittle fracture. Visco-energetic (hereafter often abbreviated as VE ) solutions were introduced in [MS18] in the context of an abstract rate-independent system whose state space is a
Hausdorff topological space (X, σ), endowed with
(1) a driving energy functional E : [0, T ] × X → (−∞ + ∞];
(2) a (possibly asymmetric, quasi-)distance d : X × X → [0, +∞] that encodes the energy dissipation of
the system.
In the spirit of [DMT02a], the key idea at the core of VE concept is to enforce locality by suitably perturbing
the time incremental minimization scheme. In the general context addressed in [MS18], this perturbation is
obtained by means of
(3) a viscous correction, namely a lower semicontinuous functional δ : X × X → [0, +∞], compatible with
d in a suitable sense.
The above elements constitute a viscously corrected rate-independent system (X, E, σ, d, δ).
Revisiting the brittle fracture model analyzed in [DMT02b] within the approach of [MS18], we work in the
ambient space
X = K(Ω), endowed with the topology of the Hausdorff distance h .

(1.5)

The evolution is driven by the energy functional E : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞) defined in (1.1).
Instead of imposing a bound on the number of connected components of the crack, we penalize the nucleation
of new connected components by means of the quasi-distance α(K, K ′ ) defined as the number of connected
components of K ′ disjoint from K . Indeed, we fix a constant λ > 0 and we consider the dissipation distance
d : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] defined by
d(K, K ′ ) := H1 (K ′ \K) + λ α(K, K ′ )

(1.6)

if K ⊂ K ′ , and set equal to +∞ otherwise. The additional term λ α(K, K ′ ) controls the number of connected
components and is important in order to obtain the lower semicontinuity of d with respect to the Hausdorff
distance, cf. Proposition 3.6 ahead. The constant λ plays the role of the energetic cost of the nucleation of a
new connected component of the crack.
We have chosen as viscous correction the functional δ : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] given by
Z
δ(K, K ′ ) :=
dist(x, K) dH1 (x) + μ α(K, K ′ )
if K ⊂ K ′ ,
(1.7)

for some μ > 0 . In the regular case considered in Section 6, when K ′ is close to K the integral contribution
to δ is approximately the sum of the squares of the length increments of the branches of the crack. A similar
term has already been used in [LT11, LT13] to study a viscosity-driven model of crack growth. The integral
in (1.7) is well defined for arbitrary compact sets K and K ′ , with no structural assumptions. This term was
introduced by Almgren, Taylor and Wang in [ATW93], cf. also [DG93, LS95], where it plays the role of
a sort of L2 -distance between K and K ′ in the Minimizing Movement scheme for the mean curvature flow.
The term μ α(K, K ′ ) has a technical role related to the lower semicontinuity properties of δ . The constant μ
can be interpreted as an additional energetic cost due to the nucleation of a new connected component.
Hereafter, we shall refer to the quintuple
(K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) as a viscously corrected rate-independent system for brittle fracture.
Along the footsteps of [MS18] we construct discrete solutions by solving time incremental minimization
scheme

Kτi ∈ ArgminK∈K(Ω) E(tiτ , K) + d(Kτi−1 , K) + δ(Kτi−1 , K)
for i = 1, . . . , Nτ ,
(1.8)

with Kτ0 := K0 the initial crack. It turns out that for every i = 1, . . . , Nτ (1.8) admits a solution thanks to the
aforementioned lower semicontinuity properties of d and δ , and of the energy E. Our main result, Theorem
4.5 ahead, states that there exists a vanishing sequence (τj )j of time steps along which the discrete solutions
τ
(Kτj )j , defined by piecewise constant interpolation of the minimizers (Kτi )N
i=1 , converge to a visco-energetic
solution of the viscously corrected system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ). The latter is a curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω), with
jump set JK , complying with the following conditions:
(I) irreversibility: K(s) ⊂ K(t) for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T ;
(SVE ) (d+δ)-stability: at every t ∈ [0, T ] \ JK there holds
E(t, K(t)) ≤ E(t, K ′ ) + d(K(t), K ′ ) + δ(K(t), K ′ )
(EVE ) the energy-dissipation balance

In (EVE ), the contribution Jmpc keeps track of the energy dissipated at jumps and is defined in terms of the
'visco-energetic' cost c introduced in (1.9) below.
As we have mentioned before, the structure of this solution concept is in between those of quasistatic
evolutions (cf. (1.2) & (1.3)) and of balanced viscosity solutions. On the one hand, the stability condition
(SVE ), though featuring the viscous correction δ and holding only outside the jump set JK , still retains a
global character. On the other hand, in the energy balance (EVE ) the dissipation of energy is not only recorded
by the d-induced total variation functional Vard , but, like in the case of balanced viscosity solutions, also by
an additional term that measures the energy dissipated at the jump points of K in the interval [s, t], i.e.
Jmpc (K; [s, t]). The jump cost Jmpc is, in turn, defined in terms of a functional c obtained by minimizing a
suitable transition cost along curves θ connecting the two end-points K(t−) and K(t+) of the curve K at
t ∈ JK , namely

c(t, K(t−), K(t+)) := inf TrcVE (t; θ, E) : E ⋐ R, θ ∈ C(E; K(Ω)), θ(E ± ) = K(t±) ,
where E − := inf E and E + := sup E . The transition cost

features
(1) the α -total variation of the curve θ;
(2) a quantity related to the 'gaps', or 'holes', of the set E (which is just an arbitrary compact subset of
R and may have a more complicated structure than an interval);

(3) a functional R : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, ∞) that keeps track of the violation of the VE -stability condition
along the curve θ, as it fulfills R(t, θ(s)) > 0 if and only if θ(s) does not comply with (SVE ) at the
process time t.
It is in terms of the cost c that the VE concept offers an alternative description of the system behavior at
jumps, in comparison with quasistatic evolutions. Indeed, VE solutions satisfy the jump conditions
E(t, K(t−)) − E(t, K(t+)) = H1 (K(t+))\K(t−) + c(t, K(t−), K(t+))

for all t ∈ JK ,

cf. Proposition 4.6 ahead. Thus, the release of elastic energy at a jump point is not only balanced by the length
of the crack opening (like it would be for quasistatic evolutions), but also by the 'visco-energetic' cost between
the two end-points K(t−) and K(t+).
Nonetheless, if, along the footsteps of [DMT02b], we assume that, on some interval (τ0 , τ1 ) ⊂ [0, T ] the VE
solution constructed in Theorem 4.5 has the additional property that the cracks K(t) have a fixed number of
tips, which evolve smoothly on the interval (τ0 , τ1 ) along simple and disjoint paths, then we can prove that
Griffith's criterion for crack growth is satisfied, cf. Theorem 6.5 ahead. This result is completely analogous to
[DMT02b, Thm. 8.4] for quasistatic evolutions. It reflects the fact that VE solutions essentially differ from
quasistatic evolutions in the description of the energetic behavior of the system at jumps, cf. the characterization
provided by Proposition 4.6 ahead.
Plan of the paper. In Section 2 we recall some preliminary results on Hausdorff convergence, and on the
properties of the elastic energy, proved in [DMT02b]. Then, in Section 3 we introduce the dissipation distance
d and the viscous correction δ , and settle their basic properties. Section 4 is devoted to the precise definition
of visco-energetic solutions and to the statement of our main existence result, Theorem 4.5. In Section 5,
the proof of Theorem 4.5 is carried out by showing that the viscously corrected system for brittle fracture
(K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) satisfies the conditions of the general existence result [MS18, Thm. 3.9], which thus applies
yielding the existence of VE solutions. The main result of Section 6, Theorem 6.5, provides a characterization
of the behavior at the crack tips of a VE solution K[0, T ] → K(Ω) in an interval (τ0 , τ1 ) during which K
evolves continuously as a function of time and the crack set K(t) fulfills suitable geometric conditions. Finally,
in Section 7 we show how, relying on the results from [Cha03], our existence result for VE solutions can be
extended to the planar case of linearized elasticity.
2. Notation and preliminaries
Throughout the paper, Ω is a fixed bounded connected open subset of R2 with Lipschitz boundary. As in
[DMT02b], we shall additionally suppose that the boundary of Ω decomposes into
- a Neumann part ∂N Ω, which is a (possibly empty) relatively open subset of ∂Ω with a finite number
of connected components;
- the Dirichlet part ∂D Ω := ∂Ω \ ∂N Ω ; it turns out that ∂D Ω is also a relatively open subset of ∂Ω with
a finite number of connected components.
The one-dimensional Hausdorff measure is denoted by H1 . The set of all compact subsets of Ω is denoted
by K(Ω), whereas Km (Ω) is the set of all compact subsets K of Ω with at most m connected components
and H1 (K) < +∞.
The space K(Ω) is endowed with the Hausdorff distance h, defined by

h(H, K) := max sup dist(x, K), sup dist(y, H)
for all H, K ∈ K(Ω),
(2.1)
x∈H

y∈K

where, as usual, dist(x, K) := miny∈K |x−y|, with the convention that dist(x, Ø) = diam(Ω) and sup Ø = 0 ,
so that h(Ø, K) = 0 if K = Ø and h(Ø, K) = diam(Ω) if K 6= Ø . Given (Kn )n , K ⊂ K(Ω), we will
h

often write Kn → K whenever h(Kn , K) → 0 . With a slight abuse of notation, the topology induced by the
Hausdorff distance is still denoted by h, and the corresponding product topology on [0, T ] × K(Ω) by hR . The
following compactness theorem is well known (see, e.g., [Rog70, Blaschke's Selection Theorem]).

Theorem 2.1. The metric space (K(Ω), h) is compact.
We will also make use of the following result (cf. [DMT02b, Cor. 3.3, 3.4]), derived from the Goła̧b theorem
(cf., e.g., [MS95, Thm. 10.19]). It shows that the class Km (Ω) is closed w.r.t. Hausdorff convergence, and
that, with respect to this notion of convergence the Hausdorff measure H1 is lower semicontinuous on Km (Ω)
(while it is not lower semicontinuous on K(Ω)).
Theorem 2.2. Let m ≥ 1 and (Kn )n ⊂ Km (Ω).
(i) If h(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞ for some K ∈ K(Ω), then K ∈ Km (Ω) and
H1 (K ∩ U ) ≤ lim inf H1 (Kn ∩ U )
n→∞

for every open set U ⊂ R2 .
(ii) In addition, suppose that (Hn )n , H ∈ K(Ω), with h(Hn , H) → 0 as n → ∞. Then,
H1 (K\H) ≤ lim inf H1 (Kn \Hn ) .

Deny-Lions spaces and elastic energy. Along the footsteps of [DMT02b], we will work with the Deny-Lions

for a given A ⊂ R . If A is bounded with Lipschitz boundary, then L (A) = H (A), see [DMT02b, Prop. 2.2].
For a given g ∈ H 1 (Ω) and a given K ∈ Km (Ω), let us now introduce the space of admissible displacements
V(g, K) := {v ∈ L1,2 (Ω\K) : v = g on ∂D Ω \ K} .

(2.3)

In (2.3) the equality v = g is to be interpreted in the sense of traces. Note that the trace of v on ∂D Ω \ K is
well defined, since ∂Ω is Lipschitz (see e.g. [DMT02b, Prop. 2.2]).
As discussed in [DMT02b, Sec. 4], the minimum problem

We mention in advance that this minimization problem will be involved in the definition of the energy functional
E driving our system. It may happen that the minimizer is not unique, but, by strict convexity, any two
minimizers have the same gradient on Ω\K . The following result, proved in [DMT02b, Thm. 5.1], shows the
continuous dependence of these gradients on the set K and on the boundary datum g , and will ensure the
continuity properties of the energy functional E
Proposition 2.3. Let m ≥ 1 and let (Kn )n , K ∈ K(Ω) fulfill supn∈N H1 (Kn ) < +∞ and h(Kn , K) → 0 as
n → ∞. Let (gn )n , g ∈ H 1 (Ω) with gn → g strongly in H 1 (Ω). Let (un )n , u fulfill

3. Setup for visco-energetic solutions for brittle fracture
In this section we precisely define the
(1) driving energy functional E (cf. (3.1)),
(2) dissipation quasi-distance d (cf. (3.7)),
(3) viscous correction δ (cf. (3.31)).

intervening in our notion of visco-energetic evolution of brittle fracture. Upon introducing E, d, and δ , we
will also settle some of their basic properties; in particular, those underlying the definition of VE solution.
Further properties will be investigated in Section 5 ahead, when carrying out the proof of our existence result
Theorem 4.5.
The energy functional. Throughout the paper g ∈ C1 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)) is a fixed function, whose trace on ∂D Ω
plays the role of a time-dependent Dirichlet loading acting on ∂D Ω. The energy functional E : [0, T ] × K(Ω) →
[0, +∞) is defined by

where the space of admissible displacements is given by (2.3). As we will see in Proposition 5.1 ahead, E is
lower semicontinuous on [0, T ] × K(Ω), w.r.t. to the product topology hR on [0, T ] × K(Ω), along sequences
with bounded d-distance from some reference set Ko ∈ Km (Ω). A straightforward calculation shows that the
power functional ∂t E(t, K) exists for every t ∈ (0, T ) and all K ∈ K(Ω) and that
Z
∂t E(t, K) :=
∇ġ(t) * ∇u(t) dx,

where ġ(t) ∈ H (Ω) is the time derivative of the function g and u(t) ∈ V(g(t), K) is a solution of the
minimum problem (3.1); the formula for ∂t E(t, K) is well given since ∇u(t) does not depend on the choice of
the minimizer, cf. Section 2. The upcoming Proposition 5.1 will collect all properties of E and ∂t E that are
relevant for our analysis.
The dissipation quasi-distance. Preliminarily, let us introduce a quasi-distance between two sets H and K
that keeps track of the (number of) connected components of K disjoint from H . More precisely, α : K(Ω) ×
K(Ω) → [0, +∞] is defined in this way:
α(H, K) is the number of the connected components of K that do not intersect H

(3.3)

if H ⊂ K , while α(H, K) := +∞ otherwise.
Our first result shows that α satisfies the triangle inequality.
Lemma 3.1. The function α : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] fulfills
α(H, L) ≤ α(H, K) + α(K, L)

for all H, K, L ∈ K(Ω).

(3.4)

Proof. It is enough to show (3.4) in the case in which α(H, K) < +∞ and α(K, L) < +∞ so that, in particular,
H ⊂ K ⊂ L . Hence, a subfamily of the connected components of L which are disjoint from H consists of
connected components of L which are disjoint from K . Let n = α(K, L) and suppose that L has at least j
connected components, L1 , . . . , Lj , disjoint from H and that the connected components of L disjoint from K
coincide with the sets Lj−n+1 , . . . , Lj . We now have to prove that α(H, K) ≥ j − n. For this, it suffices to
consider the connected components {L1 , . . . , Lj−n } intersecting K . For every l ∈ {1, . . . , j − n} we have that
Ll intersects at least a connected component Kl of K ; since K ⊂ L , we ultimately have that Kl ⊂ Ll . Since
Ll ∩ H = Ø , also Kl ∩ H = Ø . Therefore, each connected component Kl , l ∈ {1, . . . , j − n} , contributes to
the number of connected components of K disjoint from H , which yields that α(H, K) ≥ j − n. Since this
holds for every j ≤ α(H, L), we obtain (3.4).

Secondly, we prove that α is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. Hausdorff convergence.
Lemma 3.2. For all sequences (Kn )n , (Hn )n ⊂ K(Ω) we have that

We are now in a position to prove (3.5). Indeed, suppose that there are h connected components K 1 , . . . , K h

(otherwise, we would have K
α(Hn , Kn ) ≥ h

for all n ≥ n̄,

and (3.5) follows.



Our next key result shows that, if H has a finite number of connected components and K ∈ K(Ω) contains
H and fulfills α(H, K) < +∞, then K also has a finite number of connected components.
Lemma 3.3. Let H ∈ Kh (Ω) for some h ≥ 1 , and let K ∈ K(Ω) contain H and fulfill α(H, K) = i < +∞.
Then,
K ∈ Km (Ω)
with m = h + i .
(3.6)
Proof. It suffices to observe that there are i connected components of K disjoint from H ; each of the remaining
connected components of K intersects H and in fact contains at least one connected component of H , since
K ⊃ H . Hence, K has at most h connected components intersecting H .

For a given λ > 0 , we are now in a position to define the (asymmetric) dissipation quasi-distance d by
d : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞],

d(H, K) := H1 (K\H) + λ α(H, K) .

(3.7)

Remark 3.4. The contribution λ α to d will have the role of controlling the growth of the number of
connected components of the visco-energetic fracture evolution [0, T ] ∋ t 7→ K(t). It is exploiting this term
that we may prove the lower semicontinuity of d w.r.t. to Hausdorff convergence, in fact extending the Goła̧b
Theorem, cf. Proposition 3.6 ahead. The constant λ can be interpreted as the nucleation cost of each new
connected component of the crack set.
Obviously,
d(K, K) = 0

for every K ∈ K(Ω).

(3.8a)

On the other hand, d separates the points of K(Ω), namely for every H, K ∈ K(Ω)
d(H, K) = 0 implies H = K .

(3.8b)

Indeed, d(H, K) = 0 implies that all the connected components of K have non-empty intersection with H .
Then, from H ⊂ K and H1 (K\H) = 0 we conclude that H = K . As an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.1
we have that d satisfies the triangle inequality.
Proposition 3.5. The function d : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] fulfills
d(H, L) ≤ d(H, K) + d(K, L)

for all H, K, L ∈ K(Ω).

(3.9)

The lower semicontinuity of d w.r.t. Hausdorff convergence will be a consequence of the following result,
which in fact generalizes the Goła̧b Theorem.

Proposition 3.6. Let (Hn , Kn )n ⊂ K(Ω) × K(Ω) be a sequence such that Hn → H and Kn → K . Suppose

For clarity, first of all we will show that (3.10) holds with U = Ω, and then we shall point out how the proof

Indeed, let us consider the 1 -Lipschitz function f : Ω → [0, +∞) defined by f (x) := dist(x, V ). Since C is
a connected set, f (C) is an interval. It follows from the second of (3.15) and the fact that Hn ⊂ V ′ that
0 ∈ f (C). Furthermore, by the first of (3.15) and since η = dist(V ′ , Ω\V ), we also have that η ∈ f (C), so
that [0, η] ⊂ f (C). In particular, for every t ∈ (0, η] there exists x ∈ C such that f (x) = d(x, V ′ ) = t, so that
x ∈ C \V ′ . Therefore, (0, η] ⊂ f (C\V ′ ). Since f is 1 -Lipschitz, we then have η ≤ H1 (f (C\V ′ )) ≤ H1 (C\V ′ ),
i.e., (3.16).

where the latter inequality holds due to the fact that Hn ⊂ V (at least for sufficiently large n).

(3.22) that H1 (K\V m ) ≤ lim inf n→∞ H1 (Kn \Hn ) for every m ∈ N so that, taking the limit as m → ∞ we

From the above inequality it is then possible to infer (3.10) by the very same arguments as in Claim 1 .



Recalling that the quasi-distance α is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. Hausdorff convergence by Lemma 3.2, we
immediately deduce the following result from Proposition 3.6.
Corollary 3.7. The function d : K(Ω)×K(Ω) → [0, +∞] is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. the Hausdorff distance.

VISCO-ENERGETIC SOLUTIONS FOR BRITTLE FRACTURE

11

It follows from (3.8), Proposition 3.5, and Corollary 3.7, that the quasi-distance d on K(Ω) × K(Ω) satisfies
the basic conditions required in [MS18, Sec. 2.1].
Curves with bounded d-variation. As we shall see in the next section, VE solutions to the viscously
corrected system for brittle fracture are curves
K : [0, T ] → K(Ω)

such that

Vard (K, [0, T ]) < +∞

(3.23)

Vard (K, E) := sup

j=1

o
d(K(tj−1 ), K(tj )) : t0 ≤ t1 ≤ . . . ≤ tN , tj ∈ E for j = 0, . . . , N ,

(3.24)

with the convention that Vard (K, Ø) = 0 . Let us now gain further insight into the properties of curves
satisfying (3.23).
First of all, from (3.23) it clearly follows that d(K(s), K(t)) < +∞ for every 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T , so that
K(s) ⊂ K(t)

for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T ,

(3.25)

i.e., the function K is increasing w.r.t. set inclusion.
The next result shows that crack evolutions with finite d-variation are (h, d)-regulated in the sense of
[MS18, Definition 2.3], namely at every t ∈ (0, T ) the left and the right limits of K w.r.t. h exist and satisfy
a 'compatibility' condition w.r.t. the dissipation distance d.
Lemma 3.8. Let K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) satisfy (3.23). For t ∈ [0, T ], set
K(t−) := cl (∪s<t K(s)) ,

(3.26)

K(t+) := ∩s>t K(s),

with the conventions K(0−) := K(0) and K(T +) := K(T ). Then,

for all t ∈ (0, T ],

and, in addition,

s→t−

s→t−

s→t−

for all t ∈ (0, T ],

s→t+

s→t+

(3.28)

s→t+

Furthermore, there holds K(t−) ⊂ K(t) ⊂ K(t+) for all t ∈ [0, T ]. Let Θ := {t ∈ (0, T ) : K(t−) =
K(t) = K(t+)} . Then,
h

the set JK := [0, T ] \ Θ is at most countable, and K(tn ) → K(t) for every t ∈ Θ and every tn → t.

(3.29)

Proof. Properties (3.27) are an immediate consequence of definitions (3.26) and of the definition of Hausdorff
distance, while (3.29) has been proved in [DMT02b, Prop. 6.1], only relying on the monotonicity property
(3.25).
Let us now exploit (3.23) in order to check (3.28) for K(t−) (the proof of the assertion for K(t+) follows
the same lines). For every s ∈ [0, T ], let V (s) := Vard (K, [0, s]). Since V is monotone increasing and (3.23)
holds, we have that V (t−) := lims→t− V (s) < +∞. For every 0 < s < s1 < t we have that d(K(s), K(s1 )) ≤
V (s1 ) − V (s). Passing to the limit as s1 → t− and using the semicontinuity of d (cf. Corollary 3.7), we
conclude that
d(K(s), K(t−)) ≤ V (t−) − V (s) .
Hence, taking the limit as s → t− we conclude that lims→t− d(K(s), K(t−)) = 0 . This concludes the proof.



Our final result shows that curves with bounded d-total variation starting from a crack with finitely many
connected components evolve with a uniform-in-time bound on the number of their connected components.

Lemma 3.9. Let K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) fulfill (3.23), and suppose that K(0) ∈ Kh (Ω) for some h ≥ 1 . Then,
for all t ∈ [0, T ], with m ≤ h + λ1 Vard (K, [0, T ]).

K(t) ∈ Km (Ω)

(3.30)

Proof. Since λ α(K(0), K(t)) ≤ Vard (K, [0, t]), we can apply Lemma 3.3.



The viscous corrrection. We consider the viscous correction δ : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] defined by
Z
δ(H, K) :=
dist(x, H) dH1 (x) + μ α(H, K) ,
(3.31)
K\H

where μ > 0 is a prescribed constant, which plays the role of a nucleation cost for each new connected
component of the crack set. As before, we adopt the convention that dist(x, Ø) = diam(Ω). The first property
to be satisfied for δ to be an admissible viscous correction is lower semicontinuity w.r.t. Hausdorff convergence.
As we will see in the proof of Proposition 3.10, the contribution of the quasi-distance α , modulated by whatever
positive coefficient μ, has again a key role in ensuring lower semicontinuity, as it controls the growth of the
number of connected components of K disjoint from H .
Proposition 3.10.
(1) Let H ∈ K(Ω) be fixed. Then for all (Kn )n ⊂ K(Ω) such that the number of
connected components of Kn disjoint from H is uniformly bounded w.r.t. n, we have that

the number of connected components of Kn disjoint from H is uniformly bounded, we have H1 ((K\H)∩Ut ) ≤
lim inf n→∞ H1 ((Kn \H)∩Ut ) . Therefore, by the Fatou Lemma we have

Choosing f (x) = dist(x, H) we obtain (3.32).
Clearly, (3.33) immediately follows: as we may suppose that lim inf n→∞ δ(H, Kn ) < ∞, up to the extraction
of a further subsequence, we have that supn μ α(H, Kn ) ≤ supn δ(H, Kn ) < ∞; then, it suffices to recall that,
by Lemma 3.2, lim inf n→∞ α(H, Kn ) ≥ α(H, K).
⊲ (2): We may of course suppose supn δ(Hn , Kn ) < ∞. By Lemma 3.2, lim inf n→∞ α(Hn , Kn ) ≥ α(H, K).
In order to show the lower semicontinuity of the first contribution to δ , let us introduce the set H ε = {x ∈
Ω : dist(x, H) ≤ ε} for every fixed ε > 0 . We have that Hn ⊂ H ε for n large enough; in what follows, for
simplicity we will suppose that Hn ⊂ H ε for all n. Thus dist(x, H ε ) ≤ dist(x, Hn ) for all x ∈ Ω. Then,

where for the last-but-one inequality we have applied (3.32) . This is possible since the boundedness of
α(Hn , Kn ) and the inclusions Hn ⊂ H ε for all n ∈ N imply that the number of connected components
of Kn disjoint from H ε is uniformly bounded w.r.t. n ∈ N. Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we may pass to the limit
as ε ↓ 0 via the Fatou Lemma to obtain (3.34).

In Section 5 we will gain further insight into the properties of δ , cf. Proposition 5.2 ahead.
4. VE solutions: definition and main results
In this Section we give the Definition of visco-energetic solution to the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle
fracture and state our main existence result.
4.1. Definition of VE solution. The definition of the VE concept (cf. Def. 4.3 ahead) hinges on a notion
of stability, introduced in Def. 4.1 below, that involves both the dissipation quasi-distance d and its viscous
correction δ , and on an energy-dissipation distance featuring a cost that suitably measures the energy dissipated
at jumps.
Stable sets in the visco-energetic sense. With the viscous correction δ defined in (3.31) at hand, we
introduce the 'corrected' dissipation D : K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞]
(
R
H1 (K\H) + K\H dist(x, H) dH1 (x) + (λ + μ)α(H, K) if H ⊂ K,
D(H, K) := d(H, K) + δ(H, K) =
+∞
otherwise.
We are now in a position to introduce the notion of stability in the visco-energetic sense.
Definition 4.1. Let Q ≥ 0 . We say that (t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω) is (D, Q)-stable if it satisfies
E(t, K) ≤ E(t, K ′ ) + D(K, K ′ ) + Q

for all K ′ ∈ K(Ω).

(4.1)

If Q = 0 , we will simply say that (t, K) is D-stable. We denote by SD the collection of all the D-stable points,
and by SD (t) := {K ∈ K(Ω) : (t, K) ∈ SD } its section at the process time t ∈ [0, T ]. Analogously, with the
symbols SDQ and SDQ (t) we will denote the (D, Q)-stable sets and their sections.
We introduce the residual stability function R : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] via
R(t, K) :=

{E(t, K)−E(t, K ′ )−D(K, K ′ )} = E(t, K) − Y (t, K) with

sup
K ′ ∈K(Ω)

Y (t, K) =

inf

(E(t, K ′ )+D(K, K ′ )) .

(4.2)

K ′ ∈K(Ω)

By the properties of E (cf. Section 5.1) and the lower semicontinuity of d and δ ,
M (t, K) := ArgminK ′ ∈K(Ω) (E(t, K ′ )+D(K, K ′ )) 6= Ø.

(4.3)

Observe that R in fact records the failure of the stability condition at a given point (t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω),
since
R(t, K) ≥ 0 for all (t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω), with R(t, K) = 0 if and only if (t, K) ∈ SD .
(4.4)
Furthermore, R is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. the product topology hR on [0, T ] × K(Ω) if and only if for
every Q ≥ 0 the (D, Q)-stable sets are hR -closed.

The visco-energetic cost c. It is defined by minimizing a suitable transition cost functional over a class
of curves, connecting the left- and right-limits K(t−) and K(t+) at a jump point t ∈ JK . Such curves are
in general defined on a compact subset E ⊂ R with a possibly more complicated structure than that of an
interval. They are continuous w.r.t. the Hausdorff topology h, increasing in the sense of (3.25), and satisfying
the following additional continuity condition w.r.t. the dissipation distance d
∀ ε > 0 ∃ η > 0 : d(θ(s0 ), θ(s1 )) ≤ ε

for all s0 , s1 ∈ E with s0 ≤ s1 ≤ s0 + η .

We can now introduce the visco-energetic jump dissipation cost c : [0, T ] × K(Ω) × K(Ω) → [0, +∞] between
the two end-points of a jump of an increasing curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω). Namely, for all K− , K+ ∈ K(Ω), we
set
c(t, K− , K+ ) := inf{TrcVE (t, θ, E) : E ⋐ R, θ ∈ Ch,d (E; K(Ω)), θ(E − ) = K− , θ(E + ) = K+ },

(4.9)

with the convention inf Ø = +∞. Along the footsteps of [MS18], we define the jump variation functional,
defined along a curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) via
X
(c(t, K(t−), K(t))+c(t, K(t), K(t+)))
Jmpc (K; [t0 , t1 ]) := c(t0 , K(t0 ), K(t0 +)) +
t∈JK ∩(t0 ,t1 )
(4.10)
+ c(t1 , K(t1 −), K(t1 )) for all [t0 , t1 ] ⊂ [0, T ].
We are now in a position to define the concept of visco-energetic solution of the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ),
featuring the D-stability condition (4.11) below, required outside the jump set JK of the curve K , and the
energy balance (4.12), where the energy dissipated at jumps is recorded by the jump dissipation cost introduced
in (4.10).
Definition 4.3 (Visco-energetic solution). A curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) is a visco-energetic (VE ) solution of
the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle fracture if it satisfies
- the monotonicity condition (3.25);
- the D-stability condition
E(t, K(t)) ≤ E(t, K ′ ) + D(K(t), K ′ )

for all K ′ ∈ K(Ω) and all t ∈ [0, T ] \ JK ,

Remark 4.4. Taking into account the definitions of the corrected dissipation distance D and of the dissipationquasidistance d in (3.7), the D-stability condition (4.11) rephrases as
E(t, K(t)) ≤ E(t, K ′ ) + d(K(t), K ′ ) + δ(K(t), K ′ ) for all K ′ ∈ K(Ω) and all t ∈ [0, T ] \ JK ,
while, taking also into account Definition 4.2 and the monotonicity of t 7→ K(t), see (3.25), the energydissipation balance (4.12) can be written as
Z t
E(t, K(t)) + H1 (K(t)\K(0)) + λVarα (K, [0, t]) + Jmpc (K; [0, t]) = E(0, K(0)) +

4.2. Existence and properties of VE solutions. This section collects all of our results on VE solutions
for the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ), with E, h, d and δ defined in (3.1), (2.1), (3.7), (3.31), respectively: first
and foremost, the existence Theorem 4.5.
As mentioned in the Introduction, VE solutions are constructed as follows: for a given partition Pτ = {0 =
0
τ
= T } of the interval [0, T ] with time step τ := maxi=1,...Nτ (tiτ −ti−1
tτ < t1τ < . . . < tN
τ ), and an assigned
τ
datum K0 ∈ K(Ω), we consider the minimum problem

Kτi ∈ ArgminK∈K(Ω) E(tiτ , K) + d(Kτi−1 , K) + δ(Kτi−1 , K)
for i = 1, . . . , Nτ ,
(4.14)
which admits a solution thanks to the previously proved lower semicontinuity properties of d and δ , and the
lower semicontinuity/coercivity properties of E that will be precisely stated in Section 5.1. We introduce the
τ
(left-continuous) piecewise constant interpolant of the elements (Kτi )N
i=1
Kτ : [0, T ] → K(Ω)

Kτ (0) := K0 ,

Kτ (t) := Kτi

i
if t ∈ (ti−1
τ , tτ ] .

(4.15)

We are now in a position to give our existence result, stating the convergence of the above interpolants to a
VE solution. Let us mention in advance that, starting from an initial datum K0 ∈ Kh (Ω) for some h ≥ 1 , we
construct a fracture evolution with values in some Km (Ω), also providing an explicit bound on the index m,
cf. (4.17) below.
Theorem 4.5 (Existence of VE solutions). Assume that the time-dependent Dirichlet loading fulfills
g ∈ C1 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)).

(4.16)

Let K0 ∈ Kh (Ω) for some h ≥ 1 . Then, there exists a visco-energetic solution K of the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ)
for brittle fracture with such that K(0) = K0 . Moreover, every VE solution K with K(0) = K0 satisfies for
every t ∈ [0, T ]
(4.17)
K(t) ∈ Km (Ω), with m ≤ h + λ1 exp(CP T )(E(0, K0 ) + 1),
where CP is the constant defined in (5.6) ahead. Finally, for every sequence (τk )k of time steps with τk ↓ 0
as k → ∞ there exist a (not relabeled) subsequence of Kτk and a VE solution K such that
h

Kτk (t) → K(t)

for all t ∈ [0, T ].

(4.18)

The proof of Theorem 4.5 will be carried out in Section 5 based on some preliminary results in which we are
going to show that the dissipation distance d defined (3.7), the viscous correction δ in (3.31), and the driving
energy functional E in (3.1) satisfy a series of conditions that are at the heart of the general existence result
[MS18, Thm. 3.9], see conditions < A > , < B > , and < C > stated at the beginning of Section 5. Relying
on these properties, we will deduce the proof of Theorem 4.5 from [MS18, Thm. 3.9].

In [MS18] several results on the characterization of the VE concept, and on optimal jump transitions, were
proved. As we will see in Section 5.3, such results also hold for our specific rate-independent system for brittle
fracture, cf. Propositions 4.6 and 4.7 below.
Proposition 4.6 provides a twofold characterization of visco-energetic solutions. First of all, in analogy to
the properties of energetic and balanced viscosity solutions, for a curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) that is stable in
the visco-energetic sense, the validity of the energy balance (4.12) is equivalent to the corresponding energy
inequality ≤ (cf. (4.19)). It is also equivalent to the validity of an energy-dissipation inequality that solely
involves the dissipation distance d, cf. (4.20) below, joint with jump conditions that also feature the VE cost c.
As we have recalled in the Introduction, the notion of quasistatic evolution in brittle fracture features (4.20),
joint with a d-stability condition. Therefore, the characterization provided by Proposition 4.6(2) highlights
that VE solutions essentially differ from quasistatic evolutions in the description of the energetic behavior of
the system at jumps.
Proposition 4.6. [MS18, Prop. 3.8] Let the assumptions of Thm. 4.5 hold. A curve K : [0, T ] → K(Ω)
satisfying the D-stability condition (4.11) is a VE solution of the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle fracture
if and only if K satisfies, in addition,
(1) either the (d, c)-energy-dissipation upper estimate

E(t, K(t)) − E(t, K(t+))

=

H1 (K(t+)\K(t)) + λα(K(t), K(t+)) + c(t, K(t), K(t+)) .

(4.21)

Finally, let us gain further insight into the description of the system behavior at jumps provided by the VE
concept, via the properties of optimal jump transitions. Given t ∈ [0, T ] and K− , K+ ∈ K(Ω), an admissible
transition curve θ ∈ Ch,d (E; K(Ω)), with E ⋐ R, is an optimal transition between K− and K+ at time
t ∈ [0, T ] if it is a minimizer for c(t, K− , K+ ), namely
θ(E − ) = K− ,

θ(E + ) = K+ ,

TrcVE (t, θ, E) = c(t, K− , K+ ) .

(4.22)

Furthermore, we say that θ is a
(1) sliding transition, if R(t, θ(s)) = 0 for all s ∈ E ;
(2) viscous transition, if R(t, θ(s)) > 0 for all s ∈ E \ {E − , E + } .
We have the following result, cf. [MS18, Thm. 3.14, Rmk. 3.15, Cor. 3.17, Prop. 3.18].
Proposition 4.7. Let K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) be a VE solution of the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle fracture.
Then,
(1) at every jump point t ∈ JK there exists an optimal jump transition θ between K(t−) and K(t+) such
that θ(s) = K(t) for some s ∈ E ;
(2) for a viscous transition θ between K(t−) and K(t+) the set E \ {E − , E + } is discrete, i.e., all of its
points are isolated: namely, θ is a pure jump transition. In fact, θ may be represented as a finite, or
countable, sequence (θn )n∈O , with O a compact interval of Z ∪ {±∞} , satisfying
θn ∈ M (t, θn−1 ) = ArgminK ′ ∈K(Ω) (E(t, K ′ )+D(θn−1 , K ′ ))

for all n ∈ O \ {O− };

(4.23)

(3) any optimal jump transition can be canonically decomposed into an (at most) countable collection of
sliding and viscous transitions.

5. Proofs of the main results
As previously mentioned, prior to carrying out the proof of Thm. 4.5, in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 ahead we shall
check that the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) given by (3.7), (3.31), and (3.1) complies with a series of conditions
that were proposed in [MS18, Sec. 2.2, Sec. 3.1, Sec. 3.3] as a basis for the existence of VE solutions. Such
conditions will also involve the perturbed functional F : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞]
F(t, K) := E(t, K) + d(Ko , K)

(5.1)

with Ko ∈ Kh (Ω) for some h ≥ 1 , an arbitrary reference point. By a sublevel of F we mean a set of the form
{(t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω) : F(t, K) ≤ r}
for some r > 0 . The abstract conditions from [MS18] read as follows:
< A > : the energy functional E : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞) is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. the product topology
hR on the sublevels of F , which are hR -compact; at all (t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω) there exists ∂t E(t, K);
∂t E : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → R is upper semicontinuous w.r.t. hR on the sublevels of F , and
∃ CP > 0 ∀ (t, K) ∈ [0, T ] × K(Ω) :

|∂t E(t, K)| ≤ CP (E(t, K)+1) .

< B > : the viscous correction δ is left- d-continuous, namely for all sequences (Kn )n , K ∈ K(Ω)


h
⇒ lim δ(Kn , K) = 0
Kn → K and d(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞
n→∞

(5.2)

(5.3)

and for every (t, K) ∈ SD there holds

E(s, H) − E(s, K)
≤ 1,
d(H, K)
(s,H)f
⇀(t,K)
lim sup

(5.4)

where we have used the place-holder
h

(s, H)f
⇀(t, K) for (s → t, H → K, d(H, K) → 0, (s, H) ∈ SD , s ≤ t).
< C > For every Q ≥ 0 the (D, Q)-quasistable sets SDQ have hR -closed intersections with the sublevels of
the functional F .
As observed in [MS18], (5.4) in particular guarantees that D-stability yields local d-stability.
Relying on the validity of properties < A > , < B > , and < C > , in Section 5.3 ahead we shall conclude
the proofs of Theorem 4.5 and Propositions 4.6 and 4.7.
5.1. Verification of properties < A >, < B > , and < C > . Propositions 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 ahead state
the validity of properties < A > , < B > , and < C > , respectively, for our system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle
fracture. Throughout the proof of Propositions 5.1 and 5.3, we will repeatedly use that, for sequences (tn , Kn )n
in the sublevels of the functional F defined in (5.1), there holds
sup H1 (Kn ) < +∞

and

∃ m ≥ 1 : (Kn )n ⊂ Km (Ω)

(5.5)

as a consequence of Lemma 3.3.
Proposition 5.1. Under the assumptions of Thm. 4.5, the functional E : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞) defined in
(3.1) and ∂t E are continuous w.r.t. the hR -topology on the sublevels of F and ∂t E fulfills (5.2).
Proof. Let (tn , Kn )n ⊂ [0, T ] × K(Ω) with supn F(tn , Kn ) < +∞ converge to some (t, K) w.r.t. the hR topology. It follows from (5.5) and Theorem 2.2 that K ∈ Km (Ω), too. Since g ∈ C1 ([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)), we have
that g(tn ) → g(t) in H 1 (Ω). Therefore, thanks to (5.5) we may apply Proposition 2.3 and conclude that any
R
sequence (un )n with un ∈ Argminv∈V(g(tn ),Kn ) Ω\Kn 21 |∇v|2 dx fulfills ∇un → ∇u as n → ∞ in L2 (Ω; R2 ),

(5.6)

The very same arguments used for the continuity of E, combined with the fact that ġ ∈ C0 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)), in
fact yield the hR -continuity of ∂t E. This concludes the proof.

With the following result we check the validity of condition < B > ; we shall in fact prove the stronger
condition (5.7) below.
Proposition 5.2. The dissipation distance d defined in (3.7) and the viscous correction δ in (3.31) fulfill
lim

n→∞

δ(Kn , K)

d(Kn , K)

for all (Kn )n , K ∈ Km (Ω) such that Kn → K and lim d(Kn , K) = 0.
n→∞

(5.7)

In particular, conditions (5.3) and (5.4) are satisfied.
Proof. Since d(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞, we have that, for n sufficiently large, Kn ⊂ K and the integers
α(Kn , K) are 0 . Therefore, it is sufficient to observe that
Z
δ(Kn , K)

dist(x, Kn ) dH1 (x) ≤ h(Kn , K) −→ 0 as n → ∞,

where the last inequality follows by the definition of Hausdorff distance.



We conclude this section with a discussion on the closedness of the intersection of the Q -stable sets with
the sublevels of the functional F introduced in (5.1). It is immediate to see that this property is guaranteed
h

R
by the following condition: given a sequence (tn , Kn )n ⊂ SDQ , for some Q ≥ 0 , such that (tn , Kn ) →
(t, K) as
′

′
n → ∞ and supn F(tn , Kn ) < +∞, for every K ∈ K(Ω), with K ⊃ K and d(K, K ) < +∞, we can exhibit
a recovery sequence (Kn′ )n such that Kn′ ⊃ Kn and

lim sup (E(tn , Kn′ )−E(tn , Kn )+d(Kn , Kn′ )+δ(Kn , Kn′ )+Q)
n→∞

≤ E(t, K ′ ) − E(t, K) + d(K, K ′ ) + δ(K, K ′ ) + Q .

(5.9)

In this way, we obtain E(t, K ′ )−E(t, K)+d(K, K ′ )+δ(K, K ′ )+Q ≥ 0 for all K ′ ∈ K(Ω), whence (t, K) ∈ SDQ .
Indeed, in Proposition 5.3 below we shall obtain (5.9) in a stronger form.
Proposition 5.3. Let (tn , Kn )n ⊂ SDQ be a sequence of Q -stable points fulfilling supn F(tn , Kn ) < +∞.
h

R
Suppose that (tn , Kn ) →
(t, K). Then, for every K ′ ∈ K(Ω) with K ′ ⊃ K and d(K, K ′ ) < +∞ there exists

a sequence (Kn )n such that Kn′ ⊃ Kn and the following convergences hold as n → ∞:

Kn′ → K ′ ,

(5.10a)

E(tn , Kn′ ) → E(t, K ′ ),
d(Kn , Kn′ ) → d(K, K ′ ),

(5.10b)

In particular, condition < C > is valid.
The proof shall be carried out in the upcoming Section 5.2.

5.2. Proof of Proposition 5.3. Since supn F(tn , Kn ) < +∞, we have that (Kn ) ⊂ Km (Ω) for some m ≥ 1 .
Along the footsteps of [DMT02b], first of all we shall exhibit a recovery sequence for a fixed competitor set
K ′ = J that is, additionally, connected, i.e. J ∈ K1 (Ω), cf. the upcoming Lemma 5.4. Then, in Lemma 5.5 we
will address the general case in which the competitor set is in Kp (Ω) for some p ≥ 1 . The proof of Proposition
5.3 will be then carried out at the end of this section. The proofs of Lemmas 5.4 and 5.5 strongly rely on the
arguments for [DMT02b, Lemmas 3.8 & 3.5].
Lemma 5.4. Let m ∈ N, let (Kn )n , K ∈ Km (Ω) fulfill h(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞, and let J ∈ K1 (Ω) with
J ⊃ K . Then, there exists a sequence (Jn )n ⊂ K1 (Ω) such that Jn ⊃ Kn and

Proof. If K = Ø , it is sufficient to define Jn := J . Indeed, from h(Kn , Ø) → 0 we deduce that Kn = Ø for n
sufficiently large, and then the convergences properties (5.11) are trivially satisfied.
Let us now assume K 6= Ø , and let K 1 , . . . , K i , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, be its connected components. First of all, in
Step 1 we will provide the construction of a recovery sequence with the desired properties (5.11) for a carefully
chosen set Jb, such that Jb coincides with K , if K is connected, and Jb is a suitable subset of J containing K
(cf. (5.12b)) in the general case.
Step 1 . If i = 1 , let us set
Jb := K = K 1 .
(5.12a)

If i ≥ 2 , we apply [DMT02b, Lemma 3.7] to conclude that there exists a finite family of indices (σj )lj=0 , with
{σ0 , . . . , σl } = {1, . . . , i} , and a family (Γj )lj=1 of connected components of J \ K , such that K σj−1 ∩ Γj 6=

Step 2 . Let us now carry out the construction of the recovery sequence (Jn )n for a given J ∈ K1 (Ω) with
J ⊃ K . Let Jb be the set introduced in (5.12). Observe that J is locally connected (see [CD97, Lemma
1]), hence the connected components of J \ Jb are open in the relative topology of J . Therefore, since J is
separable, J \ Jb has at most countably many connected components (Cl )l∈L , with L a finite or an infinite
subset of N. It follows from the proof of [DMT02b, Lemma 3.7] that each component Cl is open in J and
satisfies C l ∩ K 6= Ø . Let us fix a point z l ∈ C l ∩ K for every l ∈ L . From h(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞ we
deduce that there exists a sequence (znl )n such that znl ∈ Kn for all n ∈ N and znl → z l as n → ∞. Since
Ω is Lipschitz, for every l ∈ L there exists an arc Znl ⊂ Ω connecting znl to zl , and such that H1 (Znl ) → 0
as n → ∞. Finally, along the footsteps of [DMT02b] we observe that there exists a sequence (Λn )n ⊂ N such
that

As in [DMT02b, Lemma 3.5], we now extend the construction of the recovery sequence to the case the
'competitor set' J has at most p connected components, with p ≥ 1 .
Lemma 5.5. Let m, p ∈ N, m, p ≥ 1 , let (Kn )n , K ∈ Km (Ω) fulfill h(Kn , K) → 0 as n → ∞, and let
K ′ ∈ Kp (Ω) with K ′ ⊃ K . Then, there exists a sequence (Kn′ )n ⊂ Kp (Ω) such that Kn′ ⊃ Kn and properties
(5.10) hold.
Proof. As in the proof of [DMT02b, Lemma 3.5], we consider the connected components J 1 , . . . , J i , 1 ≤ i ≤ p,
of the set K ′ , we fix ε > 0 such that the sets {x ∈ Ω : dist(x, J l ) ≤ ε} , l ∈ {1, . . . , i} , are pairwise disjoint,

where the last inequality follows from (5.17). This gives an inequality in (5.10d); the converse one is again due
to Proposition 3.10. This concludes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 5.3. By (5.5) and by Theorem 2.2(i), the set K belongs to Km (Ω) for some m. Since
λα(K, K ′ ) ≤ d(K, K ′ ) < +∞, we have that K ′ ∈ Kp (Ω) with p = m+ α(K, K ′ ). Then, the conclusion follows
from Lemma 5.5.

5.3. Proofs. In this section we prove Theorem 4.5.
Proof of Theorem 4.5. The first and the last statement follow from the general existence result [MS18, Thm.
3.9], which applies to the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ) for brittle fracture thanks to the validity of conditions
< A > , < B > , and < C > , proved in Propositions 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.
We now prove the explicit bound (4.17) on the number m of connected components. Indeed, from the
energy-dissipation balance (4.12) we infer that
Z t
Vard (K, [0, t]) ≤ E(t, K(t)) + Vard (K, [0, t]) + Jmpc (K; [0, t]) ≤ E(0, K0 ) +
CP (E(s, K(s))+1) ds (5.19)

where the last inequality follows from (3.2). Then, by the Gronwall Lemma we infer that
for all t ∈ [0, T ],

E(t, K(t)) ≤ (E(0, K0 )+1) exp(CP t) − 1
which, inserted in (5.19), yields

Vard (K, [0, T ]) ≤ (E(0, K0 )+1) exp(CP T ) − 1.
Therefore, taking into account Lemma 3.9, we infer that
K(t) ∈ Km (Ω)

for all t ∈ [0, T ] with m ≤ h +

λ

exp(CP T )(E(0, K0 ) + 1),

(with CP the positive constant in (5.6)), i.e., (3.6). This concludes the proof of Theorem 4.5.

(5.20)


6. Behavior near the crack tips
In the same spirit of [DMT02b, Sec. 8], in this section we describe the singularity at the crack tips of the
displacement u(t) associated with a VE solution K(t) to the system (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ). This will be examined
in an interval (τ0 , τ1 ) during which K evolves continuously as a function of time. Furthermore, along the
footsteps of [DMT02b], we confine the discussion to the case in which the (moving part of the) crack set
consists of a finite family of simple arcs, whose endpoints are the moving tips of the crack, as specified in
Hypothesis 6.1 below. In Theorem 6.5 below we will show that the VE solution K complies with Griffith's
criterion for crack growth.
Let us specify the structural condition on the crack K : [0, T ] → K(Ω).
Hypothesis 6.1. We suppose that K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) fulfills the following condition on some (τ0 , τ1 ) ⊂ [0, T ]:
there exists a finite family (Γi )pi=1 of arcs contained in Ω and parameterized by arc length by C2 bijective
functions γi : [σi0 , σi1 ] → Γi such that
K(t) = K(τ0 ) ∪

p
[

Γi (σi (t))

for all t ∈ (τ0 , τ1 ),

(6.1)

i=1

where, for i = 1, . . . , p, σi : [τ0 , τ1 ] → [σi0 , σi1 ] are non-decreasing continuous functions such that σi (τ0 ) = σi0
and σi0 < σi (t) < σi1 , while Γi (σ) = {γi (s) : σi0 ≤ s ≤ σ} . We also assume that the arcs (Γi )pi=1 are pairwise
disjoint, and that Γi ∩ K(t0 ) = {γi (σi0 )} for every i = 1, . . . , p.
Hence, for t ∈ (τ0 , τ1 ) the fracture grows along the branches Γi , i = 1, . . . , p, and the points γi (σi (t)) are the
moving crack tips. The compliance with Griffith's criterion stated in Theorem 6.5 ahead will be expressed in
terms of conditions involving the stress intensity factors of the displacements u(t) at the crack tips. We briefly
recall some preliminary facts about this notion.

GIANNI DAL MASO, RICCARDA ROSSI, GIUSEPPE SAVARÉ, AND RODICA TOADER

Basics on the stress intensity factor. The notion of stress intensity factor is based on the following result.
Proposition 6.2. Let B ⊂ R2 be an open ball, and let γ : [σ0 , σ1 ] → R2 be a simple path of class C2
parameterized by arc length, such that γ(σ0 ) ∈ ∂B , γ(σ1 ) ∈ ∂B , and γ(σ) ∈ B for all σ ∈ (σ0 , σ1 ). In
addition, assume that γ is not tangent to ∂B at σ0 and σ1 .
Given σ ∈ (σ0 , σ1 ), let Γ(σ) := {γ(s) : σ0 ≤ s ≤ σ} and let u ∈ L1,2 (B\Γ(σ)) satisfy
Z
∇u * ∇z dx = 0
for all z ∈ L1,2 (B\Γ(σ)) with z = 0 on ∂B\Γ(σ) .
B\Γ(σ)

Then, there exists a unique constant κ = κ(u, σ) ∈ R such that
p
u − 2κ ρ/π sin(θ/2) ∈ H 2 (B\Γ(σ)) ∩ H 1,∞ (B\Γ(σ)) ,

(6.2)

where ρ(x) = |x − γ(σ)| and θ(x) is the continuous function on B\Γ(σ) that coincides with the oriented angle
between γ̇(σ) and x − γ(σ), and vanishes on the points of the form x = γ(σ) + εγ̇(σ) for ε > 0 small enough.
Proof. Since the connected components of B\Γ(σ) have Lipschitz boundary, the space L1,2 (B\Γ(σ)) coincides
with H 1 (B\Γ(σ)). Then the proof of (6.2) can be found in [Gri85, Theorem 4.4.3.7 and Section 5.2] and
[MS89, Appendix 1].

The constant κ is proportional to the stress intensity factor considered in the engineering literature. It is
related to the derivative of the energy with respect to the crack length, as we shall see in Proposition 6.3 below.
Given an open subset A ⊂ Ω with Lipschitz boundary, a compact set K ⊂ Ω, and a function g : ∂A\K → R,
we define

(6.4)

The following result can be obtained by adapting the proof of [Gri92, Thm. 6.4.1].
Proposition 6.3. Let B and γ be as in Proposition 6.2 and let g : ∂B\{γ(σ0 )} → R be a function. For every

It is enough to show that every connected component of K ∪K disjoint from K is a connected component of
(K ′ ∪K)∩A . If C is a connected component of K ′ ∪K and does not intersect K , then C ⊂ K ′ ⊂ A , hence
C ⊂ (K ′ ∪K)∩A . If C ′ is a connected set such that C ⊂ C ′ ⊂ (K ′ ∪K)∩A , then C ′ ⊂ K ′ ∪K and hence
C ′ = C . This shows that C is a connected component of (K ′ ∪K)∩A and concludes the proof of (6.10), which,
together with (6.7)–(6.8), yields (6.6).

Griffith's condition at the crack tips. Our result for a VE solution K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) satisfying, in
addition, the structural condition stated in Hypothesis 6.1, involves the constants the κi = κi (u(t), σi (t))
satisfying (6.2) at the tips γi (σi (t)) of the branches of the crack, where u(t) is the corresponding minimal
displacement (cf. (6.11) below).
Theorem 6.5. Let K : [0, T ] → K(Ω) be a VE solution of the system for brittle fracture (K(Ω), E, h, d, δ),
with time-dependent boundary datum g ∈ C1 ([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)), and for every t ∈ [0, T ] let

Assume that K satisfies Hypothesis 6.1 on some (τ0 , τ1 ) ⊂ [0, T ], with arcs Γi and functions σi , i = 1, . . . , p.
Then,

for all t ∈ (τ0 , τ1 ),

(6.12b)

for a.a. t ∈ (τ0 , τ1 )

(6.12c)

for every i = 1, . . . , p.

Remark 6.6. Following [DMT02b], we observe that (6.12a) states that the length of every branch of the crack
is non-decreasing, in accordance with the irreversibility of the crack growth process; (6.12b) imposes that the
absolute value of the stress intensity factor, at each tip, be less or equal than 1 ; by (6.12c), the stress intensity
factor reaches the threshold values ±1 as soon as the tip moves with positive velocity. In fact, conditions
(6.12) rephrase Griffith's criterion in our context.
Therefore, Theorem 6.5 ensures that a VE solution complying with Hyp. 6.1 satisfies Griffith's criterion in
the interval (τ0 , τ1 ) during which it evolves continuously as a function of time, like it happens for the quasistatic
evolutions considered in [DMT02b, Thm. 8.4]. This is consistent with the fact that the most relevant difference
between VE solutions and quasistatic evolutions resides in the jump behavior, as highlighted by Proposition 4.6.
Proof of Theorem 6.5. As in the proof of [DMT02b, Thm. 8.4], we fix an arbitrary t ∈ (τ0 , τ1 ) and consider a
family of open balls B1 , . . . , Bp centered at the points γi (σi (t)). Up to choosing their radii sufficiently small,
we have that B i ⊂ Ω and B i ∩ K(τ0 ) = B i ∩ B j = B i ∩ Γj = Ø for j 6= i . Furthermore, we may assume that,
for every i = 1, . . . , p,
Bi ∩ Γi = {γi (σ) : ρ0i < σ < ρ1i }
for suitable ρ0i and ρ1i such that σi0 < ρ0i < σi (t) < ρ1i < σi1 , and that the arcs Γi intersect ∂Bi only at
the points γi (ρ0i ) and γi (ρ1i ) with a transversal intersection. Then, taking into account Hypothesis 6.1, we
conclude that
B i ∩ K(s) = B i ∩ Γi (σi (s)) = {γi (σ) : ρ0i ≤ σ ≤ σi (s)}
(6.13)

whenever σi (s) ∈ (ρ0i , ρ1i ). In particular, (6.13) holds at s = t and for s sufficiently close to t, since σi is
continuous at t.

and α(Γi (σi (t))∩B i , Γi (σ)∩B i ) = 0 , we deduce that

from (6.14) we obtain that

for all i = 1, . . . , p.

Then, (6.12b) follows from Proposition 6.3 applied with g = u(t).
For every [s, t] ⊂ (τ0 , τ1 ) we have that α(K(s), K(t)) = 0 by Hypothesis 6.1. Hence Varα (K, [s, t]) = 0 ,
so that Vard (K, [s, t]) = H1 (K(t)\K(s)). Since K evolves continuously in time on the interval (τ0 , τ1 ), the
energy-dissipation balance (4.12) reduces to
Z t
E(t, K(t)) + H1 (K(t)\K(s)) = E(s, K(s)) +
∂t E(r, K(r)) dr for all [s, t] ⊂ (τ0 , τ1 ) .

From (6.15), with the very same arguments as in the proof of [DMT02b, Thm. 8.4] we deduce (6.12c).



7. Extension to 2 D linearized elasticity
In [Cha03] the existence of quasistatic evolutions for fracture, proved in the scalar setting in [DMT02b],
was extended to the vectorial, still two-dimensional, setting of linearized elasticity. The argument relied on a
density result of H 1 (A; R2 )-fields in the space of fields whose symmetrized gradient is in L2 (A; R2×2
sym ), proved
2
by the author in the case A ⊂ R is a bounded open set whose complement has a finite number of connected
components.
We will now briefly explain how the arguments in [Cha03] also allow us to prove the existence of viscoenergetic solutions for the vectorial (2 D, linearized elasticity) version of the system for brittle fracture, that
we address in a domain Ω ⊂ R2 still complying with the conditions expounded at the beginning of Section 2.
The viscously corrected system for brittle fracture is now given by the quadruple (K(Ω), ELE , h, d, δ) in which
- the dissipation quasi-distance d, and the viscous correction δ are still given by (3.7), and (3.31),
respectively;
- the driving energy functional ELE [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞) is defined by
Z
1
ELE (t, K) :=
min
(7.1)
2 Ce(u) : e(u) dx,
u∈VLE (g(t),K)

Ω\K

where C is the elasticity tensor and e(u) denotes the symmetric part of ∇u ,
g ∈ C1 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω; R2 )),
and the space for admissible displacements is now given by
VLE (g(t), K) := {v ∈ LD(Ω\K) : v = g(t) on ∂D Ω \ K} .

VISCO-ENERGETIC SOLUTIONS FOR BRITTLE FRACTURE

27

Here, following [Cha03], for a given A ⊂ R2 we denote by LD(A) the space
LD(A) := {v ∈ L2loc (A; R2 ) : e(v) ∈ L2 (A; R2×2
sym )} .
We will denote by FLE the functional associated with ELE and a reference point Ko as in (5.1).
As we have seen in Section 5.3, in order to prove the existence of VE solutions it is sufficient to show that
the system for brittle fracture (K(Ω), ELE , h, d, δ) complies with conditions < A > , < B > , and < C > listed
at the beginning of Section 5. Now, the viscous correction δ obviously still enjoys property < B >. As for
< A > , it follows from the following analogue of Proposition 5.1.
Proposition 7.1. The functional ELE : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → [0, +∞) defined in (7.1) is continuous w.r.t. the
hR -topology on sublevels of the functional FLE Moreover, ∂t ELE : [0, T ] × K(Ω) → R is given by
Z
∂t ELE (t, K) =
Ce(u) : e(ġ(t)) dx
for all u ∈ VLE (g(t), K),
Ω\K

is also continuous w.r.t. the hR -topology on sublevels of FLE , and fulfills estimate (5.2).
The proof of Proposition 7.1 follows from the arguments in [Cha03, Thm. 3]. Finally, Proposition 5.3,
guaranteeing the validity of property < C > , carries over to the present setting: in particular, the construction
of the recovery sequence (Kn )n fulfilling (5.9) developed throughout Section 5.2 is still appropriate for this
vectorial setting thanks to the aforementioned continuity properties of ELE .
That is why the analogue of our existence Theorem 4.5 holds for the system (K(Ω), ELE , h, d, δ).
