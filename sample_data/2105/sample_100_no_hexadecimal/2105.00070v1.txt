Abstract: The CMS Inner Tracker, made of silicon pixel modules, will be entirely replaced
for the operation at the High Luminosity LHC. One of the crucial components of the new Inner
Tracker system is the readout chip, being developed by the RD53 Collaboration, and in particular
its analogue front-end that receives the signal from the sensor and digitizes it. Three different
analogue front-ends called Synchronous, Linear, and Differential were designed and implemented
in the RD53A demonstrator chip. A dedicated evaluation program was carried out to select the most
suitable design to build a radiation tolerant pixel detector able to sustain high particle rates with high
efficiency and a small fraction of spurious pixel hits. The test results showed that all three analogue
front-ends presented strong points, but also limitations. The Differential front-end demonstrated
very low noise, but the threshold tuning became problematic after irradiation. Moreover, a saturation
in the preamplifier feedback loop was limiting the signal return to baseline having an impact on
the dead time. The Synchronous front-end showed very good timing performance, but also higher
noise. The Linear front-end had all the studied performance parameters within requirements, but
it had the largest time walk. This limitation was addressed and mitigated in an improved design.
The analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the three front-ends in the context of the CMS
Inner Tracker operation requirements led to the selection of the Linear front-end for integration in
the final CMS readout chip.

CMS pixel detector upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC

The High Luminosity upgrade [1] of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2] will boost its
potential for physics discoveries, but also impose extreme operating conditions for the experiments.
Along with the accelerator, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) [3] detector will be substantially
upgraded during the Long Shutdown 3, starting in 2025 [4]. This upgrade is referred to as the
CMS Phase-2 Upgrade [5]. The silicon tracking system, located at the heart of CMS, is detecting
trajectories of charged particles. It will be entirely replaced during the Long Shutdown 3 because of
the accumulated radiation damage and to fully profit from the increased luminosity. The goal of the
upgrade is to maintain or improve the tracking and vertex reconstruction performance of the detector
in the harsh environment of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The CMS Phase-2 tracker will
consist of the Outer Tracker, made of silicon modules with strip and macro-pixel sensors, and the
Inner Tracker (IT), based on silicon pixel modules [6].
The high granularity of the IT offers excellent spatial resolution, used for a precise threedimensional reconstruction of particle trajectories, as well as the identification of primary interaction
vertices and secondary decay vertices. The latest layout of one quarter of the Phase-2 IT in the
r-z view ∗ is shown in Figure 1. It will be composed of a barrel component with four cylindrical

in this plane is denoted by r and the polar angle θ is measured from the z axis. The pseudorapidity η is defined as
η = −ln tan(θ/2) [6].

layers, called Tracker Barrel Pixel detector (TBPX). Eight smaller double-discs forming the Tracker
Forward Pixel detector (TFPX) and four larger double-discs forming the Tracker Endcap Pixel
detector (TEPX) will be placed in the forward direction on each side. The forward acceptance will
be extended up to a pseudorapidity of |η| = 4 [6], as indicated by the red line in Figure 1.
The IT detector comprises an active area of 4.9 m2 and it will be composed of 3892 pixel
modules. Two pixel sizes are considered for the Phase-2 IT: 100 × 25 μm2 pixels and 50 × 50 μm2
pixels. With a pixel area of 2500 μm2 the total number of readout channels will amount to about
2 billion. The detector design strives for a minimal mass of the detector to avoid degradation of
the tracking performance due to the interactions of particles with the detector material. Therefore,
lightweight mechanical structures made of carbon fiber, two-phase CO2 cooling [6] and a low
voltage powering scheme based on serial powering [8] will be used. The data will be transmitted
through low-mass electrical links and optical fibers [6] to further reduce the detector mass.
The main building block of the IT system is a hybrid pixel module, shown in Figure 2. It
is composed of a silicon sensor bump-bonded to two or four readout chips. Pixel modules with
two readout chips are indicated in green in Figure 1 and modules with four chips are indicated in
orange. The readout chips of the module are wire-bonded to a flexible printed circuit board with
passive components and connectors, called the high density interconnect, that distributes power
(low voltage to power the pixel chips and high voltage to bias the sensor), clock and control signals
and collects data from the chips. The signal produced in the sensor is transmitted to the front-end
pixel electronics, where it is processed and the data are stored during the trigger latency interval,
which will increase from the current 3.2 to 12.8 μs. The hit information is sent to the back-end
data acquisition system of the experiment only after receipt of a Level-1 trigger [9] signal. In the
innermost layer of the IT, the hit rate will reach 3.5 GHz cm−2 , while the CMS Level-1 trigger rate
will increase from 100 to 750 kHz [9].

RD53A analogue front-ends

A high-performance radiation tolerant pixel readout chip is essential for good tracking performance of the IT operating at HL-LHC. Such a readout chip is being designed in TSMC [11] 65 nm
CMOS technology by the RD53 Collaboration [12], a joint effort between the ATLAS and CMS
experiments. A large-scale demonstrator chip called RD53A [13] containing design variations was
produced. Its purpose is to prove the suitability of the chosen technology for low threshold, low
noise, and low power operation at high hit rates, to verify sufficient radiation tolerance [14], and
to select the most suitable design for the final readout chip. It is a mixed signal chip, having both
analogue and digital circuits. It features custom-designed intellectual property blocks, such as clock
data recovery and phase locked loop blocks [15] for the clock recovery from the command stream
running at 160 Mb/s; a high speed output transmitter with a current mode logic cable driver [16]
sending data at 1.28 Gb/s on up to four output lanes; and a shunt low-dropout regulator [17] for
serial powering of the pixel modules. The chip size is 20.0 × 11.8 mm2 , which is about half the
size of the final chip, as it was sharing the chip reticle with CMS Outer Tracker chips. The pixel
matrix is composed of 400 × 192 square pixels with 50 μm pitch. All the common analogue and
digital circuitry needed to bias, configure, monitor, and read out the chip is placed at the bottom
chip periphery [13].
The analogue-to-digital conversion is performed by the analogue front-end (AFE), whose
basic structure (shown in Figure 3) includes a charge sensitive amplifier (CSA) usually referred
to as preamplifier (PA), a feedback circuit taking care of the signal return to baseline and leakage
current compensation, a threshold discriminator, a threshold trimming circuit to address pixel-topixel variation of the threshold voltage, and a time-over-threshold (TOT) counting of the input
signal amplitude. In the RD53A chip the TOT40 digitization with 4-bit resolution is done with

respect to rising edges of the 40 MHz LHC clock† . Therefore, one TOT40 unit corresponds to
25 ns [13]. The chip also features a circuit for the generation of internal calibration charge injection
signals. The circuit, connected to the input of the PA, enables the injection of a well-defined and
programmable charge to test the front-end functionalities and calibrate the chip response. Every
pixel in the RD53A chip contains the same circuit based on two switches that generate voltage steps
fed to an injection capacitor [13].
The RD53A AFEs are grouped by four, i.e. 2 × 2 pixels, into analogue "islands", which are
embedded in a synthesized digital "sea", as shown in Figure 4. Three different AFE designs have
been proposed within the RD53 project, to allow for comparison and to provide a choice of the
most suitable option for each of the two experiments. The chip is divided horizontally into three
sections, each one having one AFE design, as indicated in Figure 5. The synchronous (SYNC) AFE
is implemented between columns 0 and 127, the linear (LIN) AFE between columns 128 and 263,
and the differential (DIFF) AFE between columns 264 and 399. It was not possible to have an equal
area for all three designs because the 400-pixels wide matrix is built of 8 × 8 pixel cores [13]. The
three AFEs share the digital logic and the chip periphery in the RD53A chip [13]. All three AFEs
are based on a CSA with a feedback loop ensuring the return to baseline of the PA output after each
hit. The gain of the PA can be chosen globally thanks to different feedback capacitors (CF ) present
in each AFE. The specific features of each AFE are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Synchronous front-end. The schematic of the Synchronous front-end is shown in Figure 6. It
features a single-stage CSA with a Krummenacher feedback (IKrum , VREF_Krum ) [19], which ensures
both the sensor leakage current compensation and the constant current discharge of the feedback
capacitor. The Krummenacher current (IKrum ) drives the speed of the PA output return to baseline.
The PA is AC-coupled (CAC ) to a synchronous discriminator composed of a differential amplifier,
providing a further small gain, and a positive feedback latch, which performs the signal comparison
with a threshold (Vth ) and generates the discriminator output. The latter can also be switched
to a local oscillator with a selectable frequency higher than the standard LHC clock, in order
† In the final pixel chip,

the counting will be performed on both the rising and the falling edge of the clock, resulting
in a finer TOT80 counting at 80 MHz with one TOT80 unit equal to 12.5 ns [18].

to perform a fast TOT counting. The distinctive feature of this AFE is a so-called "auto-zero"
functionality. In traditional designs, the transistor mismatch causing pixel-to-pixel variations of the
threshold is compensated with a trimming digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). In the SYNC AFE
instead, internal capacitors (Caz ) are used to compensate voltage offsets automatically. A periodic
acquisition of a baseline (VBL ) is required, which can be done during LHC abort gaps [13, 20].
Linear front-end. The Linear front-end implements a linear pulse amplification in front of the
discriminator. The schematic of this AFE is shown in Figure 7. As for the SYNC AFE, the PA of
the LIN AFE is based on a CSA featuring a Krummenacher feedback (IKrum , VREF_Krum ). The signal
from the CSA is fed to a low power threshold discriminator based on current comparison, which
compares the signal with the threshold (Vth ). It is composed of a transconductance stage followed
by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) providing a low impedance path for fast switching. A 4-bit
binary weighted trimming DAC with adjustable range (IDAC ) allows to reduce threshold dispersion
across the pixel matrix [13, 21].
Differential front-end. The PA of the Differential front-end, shown in Figure 8, has a continuous
reset (Iff ), unlike the other two designs, which use the Krummenacher feedback with constant current
reset. This continuous feedback is able to prevent the input from saturation for a leakage current
of up to 2 nA [18]. For higher currents, a dedicated leakage current compensation (LCC) circuit
can be enabled. The LCC is disconnected from the input when disabled, which improves the AFE
stability and noise performance. The DC-coupled precomparator provides additional gain in front
of the comparator and acts as a differential threshold circuit, i.e. the global threshold is adjustable
through two distributed threshold voltages (Vth1 and Vth2 ) instead of one. The precomparator stage
is followed by a classic time-continuous comparator. The threshold is trimmed in each pixel using
a local 5-bit trimming DAC (TDAC) [13].
Although the basic functionalities of the RD53A chip and each of the three AFEs were
previously verified and reported [22–26], a comparison of the three designs against the CMS
requirements, in terms of spurious hit rate, dead time and radiation tolerance, was yet to be
performed. The objective of this work was to evaluate the three AFE designs against the requirements
and to compare their performance. A dedicated evaluation program has been established and the
most relevant detector performance parameters were studied. The key measurements that enabled

CMS to identify the most suitable option for integration into the CMS pixel detector are presented
in this paper. All presented test results were obtained with the BDAQ53 test system [27], using the
calibration injection circuit, with RD53A chips bump-bonded to sensors with rectangular pixels,
i.e. 100 × 25 μm2 , if not stated differently, and operated at cold temperature of approximately
−10 °C, which is the lowest temperature that could be achieved with the cooling systems available
for the lab test set-ups.

CMS requirements for the analogue front-end

The first step towards the choice of the AFE for the CMS final chip was the establishment of
the evaluation criteria. The most relevant detector parameters were used to derive the following
CMS requirements:
Optimal threshold. The new CMS readout chip will feature 50 × 50 μm2 pixels, while the pixel
size is 100 × 150 μm2 in the present CMS pixel detector [28]. The readout chip can be bump-bonded
either to sensors with square pixels of the same size or to rectangular pixels of 100 × 25 μm2 , thanks
to electrode routing in the sensor [6]. Silicon sensors with a thickness of 150 μm will be used.
This is about half the thickness of the current 285 μm thick sensors [28]. The main advantage
of thin sensors is better radiation tolerance, but the collected signal charge is smaller. The charge
distribution obtained with 120 GeV protons from a test beam collected in a 130 μm thick sensor with
100 × 150 μm2 pixels is shown in Figure 9. The most probable value (MPV) is about 7900 e− before
irradiation and it decreases by about 2000 e− after irradiation to 1.2 × 1015 neq /cm2 [6]. Based on
the expected signal, a detection threshold of 1000 e− is required by CMS for the innermost layer
of the IT to ensure sufficient detection efficiency, especially with irradiated sensors. A threshold of
1200 e− is sufficient for the outer layers of the detector, where the fluence is lower.

pixels. The red line represents a fit to a Landau distribution convoluted with a Gaussian [6].

Radiation tolerance. The IT is the CMS subdetector closest to the LHC interaction point and
therefore it is exposed to the highest radiation levels. Two scenarios are envisaged for the HL-LHC:
in the "nominal" scenario, the accelerator would deliver a maximum of 140 proton-proton (pp)

–7–

collisions per bunch crossing, to reach a total integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1 by the end of
the physics program. In the "ultimate" scenario, the number of pp collisions per bunch crossing
would be pushed up to 200, reaching an integrated luminosity of 4000 fb−1 . A fluence reaching
2.6 × 1016 neq /cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) up to 1.4 Grad are expected in the innermost
layer in the nominal scenario, while the figures would scale up to 3.4 × 1016 neq /cm2 and 1.9 Grad
in the ultimate scenario. The RD53A chip was designed to withstand a TID of at least 500 Mrad and
an average leakage current up to 10 nA/pixel [14]. However, with this specification the radiation
levels expected in CMS, reaching 1.9 Grad in the ultimate luminosity scenario, would imply a
replacement of the innermost layer of the IT barrel after every two years of operation. The CMS
Collaboration aims for one replacement of the innermost layer during the ten-year lifetime of the
detector, hence a higher radiation tolerance is privileged.
Noise occupancy. For a stable operation at low threshold it is important to minimize the front-end
noise to have a limited fraction of spurious hits in the data. Single pixels that are too noisy can
be disabled, to keep the overall noise occupancy low, but their fraction must be low in order not
to significantly affect the detector efficiency. The average noise occupancy has to be much smaller
than the hit occupancy. Based on the occupancy simulation for different parts of the detector, shown
in Figure 10, the average noise occupancy of the new front-end is required to be below 10−6 , i.e. two
orders of magnitude below the lowest expected occupancy.

Dead time. CMS requires a maximum dead time of 1% in the innermost layer of the IT barrel to
ensure high detection efficiency even at the highest expected hit rate. This requirement translates
to a maximum efficiency loss of 1% at maximum hit rate caused by the total dead time (digital +
analogue). The dead time in the RD53A chip has a minor contribution from the digital buffering
and a major contribution from the CSA of the AFE. While the digital contribution is due to the

–8–

limited hit buffer size and cannot be reduced with the chip settings, the AFE dead time depends
on the TOT response calibration. The TOT response to a given input charge can be set in the
chip to a certain number of TOT40 units (one TOT40 unit corresponds to one 40 MHz clock cycle,
i.e. to 25 ns). The charge resolution is obtained by dividing the input charge by the corresponding
number of clock cycles and can therefore be expressed in e− /TOT40 units.

Efficiency losses (%)

A Monte Carlo simulation of hit efficiency losses due to the digital, analogue, and total dead
time is shown in Figure 11 for two charge resolutions: 1500 e− /TOT40 and 3000 e− /TOT40 . The
simulation was performed for two pixel module positions in the innermost layer of the IT barrel:
the centre (z = 0), denoted L1c, and the edge, denoted L1e. For each position both pixel geometries
were simulated. The rectangular pixels are represented with solid bins and the squared pixels with
hashed bins. The squared pixels cause a slightly higher inefficiency. As expected, the TOT charge
resolution has no influence on the digital dead time, and the hit losses caused by the AFE are smaller
with the coarser charge resolution of 3000 e− /TOT40 . The efficiency losses are higher in the centre
making the dead time requirement difficult to meet. With the charge resolution of 1500 e− /TOT40
the requirement is not satisfied in any of the two module positions, while with 3000 e− /TOT40 the
requirement is satisfied on average. The hit efficiency losses are slightly above the requirement in
the centre and slightly below at the edge. The charge resolution of 3000 e− /TOT40 was therefore
taken as the TOT calibration requirement for the AFE evaluation.

The impact of charge resolution on tracking performance was also evaluated. Simulation

and two different thresholds: 1200 e− and 2400 e− . The resolution on the transverse (d 0 ) and

longitudinal (z 0 ) impact parameters integrated over the full η range is shown in Figure 12 for three
charge resolutions: 600 e− /TOT40 , 3000 e− /TOT40 and 6000 e− /TOT40 . The impact parameter
resolution deteriorates for a higher threshold and appears to be insensitive to the charge resolution.
Since a higher charge resolution does not affect the tracking performance, a charge resolution of
3000 e− /TOT40 was taken as the baseline calibration for the inner regions of the Inner Tracker.

Equalization of threshold dispersion

The calibration injection circuit is used to inject a range of charges to measure the threshold of
each pixel and the threshold dispersion across the matrix. The occupancy versus charge of a pixel
is a sigmoid from 0 to 100% occupancy, commonly called S-curve. An example of an S-curve
plot including more than 26 000 pixels is shown in Figure 13(a). The calibration charge at which
50% occupancy is reached is taken as a measurement of the charge equivalent of the threshold
of each pixel. The mean value of the pixel threshold distribution represents the global threshold
and the root-mean-square (RMS) is the threshold dispersion. Typically, pixel-to-pixel variations
result in a threshold dispersion of several hundred electrons, which can be reduced to less than
hundred electrons after setting optimal trim bits for each pixel with a dedicated tuning algorithm.
Examples of untuned and tuned threshold distributions are shown in Figure 13(b) and Figure 13(c),
respectively.
The threshold tuning capability of the three AFE designs was tested and proven to be functional
in many samples, and it was evaluated also after irradiation. An assembly of an RD53A chip and a
sensor with 50 × 50 μm2 pixels was irradiated at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology [29] with 23 MeV
protons up to a fluence of 3 × 1015 neq /cm2 , corresponding to a TID reaching 350 Mrad. The RD53A
chip was not powered during irradiation. The sample was irradiated at room temperature and kept
constantly at cold temperature after irradiation to avoid annealing. It was tested at −10 °C in a

dry environment. The sensor bias voltage was adjusted to reach an average leakage current of
10 nA/pixel, which is the maximum specification for the RD53A chip [14]. The pixels with a noise
occupancy higher than 10−4 were considered noisy and masked, based on the lowest hit occupancy
expected from the simulation presented in Figure 10. The remaining pixels were tuned to a threshold
of 1000 e− . Pixels with an anomalously high threshold that could not be adjusted with the range of
the trim bits were masked in the tuning procedure. The threshold distributions of the three AFEs
after tuning are shown in Figure 14.
All three AFEs were functional after irradiation and could reach the required threshold with a
threshold dispersion of about 100 e− . The threshold tuning of the LIN AFE worked well and only
0.1% of pixels were masked. The auto-zeroing in the SYNC AFE worked well too, however the
leakage current caused a higher noise in this front-end and 3% of the pixels were masked. The
threshold distribution of the DIFF AFE features a narrow core and long tails, and 11.2% of pixels
were masked. The large fraction of masked pixels in the DIFF AFE is the consequence of a long

tail in the untuned threshold distribution, shown in Figure 15. Pixels with a too high threshold
cannot be tuned to the desired threshold value because the range covered by the trim bits is a global
setting for the whole chip. As the threshold dispersion depends on several AFE parameters, many
parameter combinations were tried to mitigate the problem, and the 11.2% of masked pixels was
the best result that could be achieved with this irradiated sample.
This study triggered an investigation and the design team discovered that the combined effect of
irradiation and cold temperature provoked a PMOS threshold increase in the DIFF precomparator,
resulting in a small voltage margin. Simulations showed that the voltage margin is smaller in cold
and decreases with irradiation, reaching a value close to zero for the DIFF AFE design implemented
in the RD53A chip after irradiation to 200 Mrad, which explains the problematic threshold tuning
observed after irradiation to 350 Mrad. A design improvement of the DIFF precomparator was
proposed and simulated, obtaining an extension of the expected operation range up to 500 Mrad,
which remains marginal compared to the expected dose in the CMS detector. With such operation
range, replacements of the innermost layer would be required every two years once the ultimate
luminosity is reached, while CMS is aiming at one replacement during the whole high-luminosity
program. For this reason the choice was oriented towards the other two AFEs, which seem promising
candidates for a higher radiation tolerance.

Noise evaluation

In the pixel readout chips, single noisy pixels can be disabled to reduce the rate of noise hits.
However, the fraction of disabled pixels should not significantly increase the detection inefficiency.
A single pixel was considered noisy if its noise occupancy was above 10−4 based on the lowest
occupancy expected in the IT detector from simulation (Figure 10). Therefore, as a first step of the
noise evaluation, every pixel with more than 100 hits in 106 triggers was disabled at a threshold of
1200 e− . As a second step, the noise occupancy of the non-masked pixels was measured. A new set
of 106 triggers was sent to each front-end, without any charge injection, so that each recorded hit is
induced by the noise. The average noise occupancy is then defined as the number of noise hits per
pixel and per trigger. It was measured for the three AFEs, using a non-irradiated RD53A chip with
a sensor with the highest capacitance, i.e. rectangular pixels, operated at a temperature of about
−10 °C. Results of noise occupancy measurements are presented in Figure 16. The fraction of

masked noisy pixels is indicated in the legend and the maximum noise occupancy of 10−6 , required
by CMS, is indicated by the red line. The TOT was calibrated to 1100 e− /TOT40 .
First, the influence of the threshold on the average noise occupancy was evaluated. The result is
shown in Figure 16(a). The threshold was gradually decreased from 1200 e− , keeping the same noisy
pixels disabled. As expected, the average noise occupancy decreases with increasing threshold,
regardless of the front-end design. The DIFF front-end shows very good noise performance, with
the average noise occupancy several orders of magnitude below the requirement, even for low
thresholds. No hits were found in this front-end in 106 triggers at higher thresholds, hence a higher
number of triggers was sent to evaluate the average noise occupancy. The other two AFEs satisfy
the noise requirement down to a threshold of 1000 e− , which complies also with the requirement on
the detection threshold. Nonetheless, it can be noticed that the fraction of masked pixels is higher
in the SYNC AFE.
The influence of the PA bias current on the noise was also studied. When this current increases,
the transconductance of the input transistor is increased, which results in lower noise with a penalty
of an increase in the analogue current consumption. The average noise occupancy was measured for
different PA bias currents and is presented in Figure 16(b) as a function of the measured analogue
current consumption per pixel. All the other front-end settings that could contribute to the current
consumption were kept constant during this measurement. As expected the noise in all three
AFEs decreases when more current is provided. The DIFF AFE shows again a very good noise
performance with the average noise occupancy well below the requirement, even when operated
with low PA bias. The LIN and the SYNC AFE need 3.5 μA and 4.5 μA per pixel, respectively, to
reach the required noise level. All three AFEs can meet the CMS noise requirement if the PA bias

current is adapted, hence this parameter is a handle to reduce the front-end noise at the price of an
increase in the power consumption.

Dead time and time-over-threshold calibration

Preamplifier output

An important consideration for a highly efficient particle detector is the event loss due to the
dead time, especially at high luminosity and high pileup. As explained in Section 3 the dead time
caused by the AFE depends on the TOT calibration and a charge resolution of 3000 e− /TOT40 is
necessary to achieve the 1% dead time required for the innermost layer of the IT barrel. The TOT
response can be set by adjusting the discharge current of the PA. When the PA discharge current
increases, the PA output returns faster to the baseline and the corresponding TOT is smaller, as
illustrated in Figure 17. Therefore, a faster PA discharge leads to a reduced detector dead time.
In the following the required charge resolution of 3000 e− /TOT40 is also referred to as the fast
discharge.

The TOT charge resolution of the three AFEs was measured with a constant charge injection
of 6000 e− for different PA discharge currents. First, the charge resolution of all three AFEs was set
to about 1100 e− /TOT40 , as can be observed in Figure 18(a). This resolution is not reached for the
same current in different AFEs. Then the PA discharge current was increased to verify the front-end
compliance with the dead time requirement. As expected, when the discharge current increases the
PA discharges faster and the charge resolution is coarser. All three AFEs can reach the required
charge resolution indicated by the red line. The SYNC and LIN AFEs can also discharge faster,
while the DIFF AFE shows a saturation of the PA discharge current DAC and would be operated at
its limit to reach the dead time required for the inner layers.
A dedicated measurement was carried out on the DIFF AFE, to better understand the observed
saturation effect. The charge resolution of the DIFF AFE versus the discharge current was measured
for different input charges, ranging from 3 to 20 ke− . The result, presented in Figure 18(b), confirms
the saturation of the discharge current DAC in this AFE, occurring at 30% of the DAC range,

regardless of the input charge. This implies a marginal operation of this particular AFE to reach the
dead time requirement.
Increasing the discharge current reduces the dead time, as mentioned above, but it also reduces
the AFE stability, and therefore it is likely to induce more noise. Hence the noise was re-evaluated
for the fast discharge operation. The noise was measured for two detection thresholds, 1000 e−
and 1200 e− , and two charge resolutions, 1100 e− /TOT40 and the required 3000 e− /TOT40 . The
combination of these four parameters defined four measurement scenarios for which the average
noise occupancy was measured. The measurement method was the same as in Section 5. In brief,
pixels with more than 100 hits in 106 triggers were declared noisy and masked, then the average
noise occupancy of non-masked pixels was defined as the number of noise hits per pixel and per
trigger, measured over 106 events.
The fraction of masked pixels is shown in Figure 19(a) and the average noise occupancy in
Figure 19(b) for the four considered scenarios. The average noise occupancy of all three AFEs is
higher at fast discharge and is the highest at fast discharge and low threshold, as expected. The DIFF
AFE demonstrates again excellent noise performance, with almost no noisy pixels and the average
noise occupancy well below the requirement, even at fast discharge. At slow discharge the noise in
this AFE was so low that only an upper limit was estimated. The LIN AFE has few noisy pixels and
the average noise occupancy satisfies the requirement for any scenario. The SYNC AFE appears to
be the noisiest of the three, reaching almost 3.8% of noisy pixels when operated at fast discharge
and low threshold. The higher noise in this AFE, significantly increasing with more aggressive chip
settings, was considered a critical aspect for the operation in the innermost layer of the CMS Inner
Tracker.

Late-detected hits

The time response of the pixel readout chip is of high importance to assign detected hits to their
corresponding LHC bunch crossings (BXs) and to limit the out-of-time pileup causing spurious
hits in the reconstruction. The time response of the AFE, i.e. the combination of the PA rise time
and the discriminator speed, is a function of the input charge. Pulses with the same peaking time
but different amplitude pass the discriminator threshold at different times. High amplitude signals,
depicted in blue in Figure 20, pass the threshold within one BX, i.e. within 25 ns. If the deposited
charge is just above the threshold instead, the signal is rising slower and is detected later by the
discriminator. Such a hit, shown in red, might be assigned to the following BX, and appears as a
spurious hit in another event. The smallest charge (Qmin ) which can be detected within the correct
BX (dark blue signal) is equivalent to the so-called "in-time threshold" that is higher than the
threshold of the discriminator. The time behaviour of an AFE is typically described by its time walk
curve, i.e. the response delay of the discriminator as a function of the input charge. An example of
a simulated time walk curve of the LIN AFE is shown in Figure 21. Given that the discriminator
of one of the three AFEs is synchronous to the clock, the time walk of this AFE cannot be directly
measured and another method had to be used to compare the timing of the three AFEs.
Front-end time response measurement
The charge injection in the RD53A chip can be delayed with respect to the rising edge of the
clock with a step size of 1.5625 ns [13]. The front-end time response was measured by injecting
calibration pulses with different amplitudes and with different time delays. The detection threshold
was set to 1000 e− and the full range of available charges up to 35 ke− was scanned, using a finer

charge step for low charges where timing is critical. Each charge was injected 50 times to a pixel
for each time delay. Figure 22 shows the two-dimensional plot of charge versus time for all three
AFEs. The x axis represents time in nanoseconds and t = 0 indicates the time when the highest
charge is detected. The y axis, showing the injected charge in electrons, is limited to 10 ke− in this
figure. The colour code indicates the detection probability for a given BX, for each combination
of charge and injection delay. The yellow zone corresponds to 100% detection efficiency, while in
the white part no hit is detected. The left edge of the coloured region corresponds to the time walk
curve. In the upper part of the plot, the coloured region is a straight rectangle with a time width of
25 ns, which confirms that high charges are always detected within one BX. Small charges instead
are detected later, resulting in a tail in the detection region. This tail extends up to about 40 ns in
the SYNC and DIFF AFE, indicating that these two AFEs have a comparable time response. The
DIFF AFE is able to correctly assign slightly smaller charges than the SYNC AFE. The LIN AFE
appears to be the slowest of the three, with the largest time walk of more than two BX.

Combination with time of arrival simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation was performed within the standard CMS simulation and reconstruction software framework called CMSSW [30] to evaluate the influence of the time response of each
AFE on the detector performance and to estimate the resulting fraction of spurious hits. The time
of arrival of particles was simulated for different locations in the IT detector, given that it depends
on the position of the pixel module with respect to the interaction point. Sixteen different locations
were studied: the centre (z = 0) and edge module of each barrel layer, the innermost and outermost
module of the first and last small disc, as well as of the first and last large disc (Figure 1). For each
location about 2000 minimum bias QCD events, without pileup and without a transverse momentum
cut, were simulated. The simulated pixel hits, corresponding to single pixels with deposited charge,
were sorted by released charge, ranging from 600 e− ‡ to 50 ke− , with a granularity of 150 e− and
a time resolution of 0.25 ns. The simulated time of arrival versus charge distribution for the central
module (z = 0) of the innermost layer of the IT barrel is presented in Figure 23(a).
Such a distribution was combined with the time response measurement introduced in the
previous section. The x axis of the time response is reversed, obtaining the acceptance region, in
time and charge, giving the probability of a charge to be detected in the correct BX. This way,
instead of showing when a hit is detected by the electronics, the figure indicates when a hit has to
occur to be detected in a given BX. The y axis has to be extended to match the charge range in the
simulation. Assuming that the time response remains constant for very large signals, the yellow
region with sharp edges is extended up to 50 ke− . For illustration, the time response of the LIN
AFE, after such modifications, is presented in Figure 23(b).
When the acceptance region of the front-end is superimposed with the hit distribution from
simulation, as indicated in Figure 23(c), the hits that are inside the yellow part of the acceptance
region have a 100% probability to be assigned to the correct BX. On the other hand, hits that are
outside of the detection region have zero probability to be detected in time. Figure 23(d) shows the
hits that will be assigned to a wrong BX, obtained from the exclusion of the two overlaid plots. The
integral of the exclusion plot divided by the total number of hits gives the fraction of late-detected
hits in a given location of the future detector.
An important part of this method is the time alignment of the two overlapping plots. The
origin of the time axis of both the measurement and the simulation have to be correctly aligned.
The t = 0 of the simulation corresponds to the time when the two proton bunches overlap in the
interaction region, corrected with the expected time of flight from the interaction point to the given
module. The zero of the chip acceptance can be shifted to maximize the overlap, as it would be
done in the detector by calibration. For this measurement, the peak of the simulation is placed three
fully efficient bins from the left edge of the acceptance region, i.e. 4.625 ns, as it is indicated in
Figure 23(c). This estimate of about 5 ns was used to account for the imperfect time alignment in
the detector due to the variations in the length of the electrical links, jitter and other contributions,
adding also some margin.
‡ Given

that charges smaller than 600 e− are not expected to be detected because of the threshold, the simulation
started at this charge to avoid overloading the computing time.

Fraction of late hits
The method described above was used to evaluate the fraction of hits detected late by the three
AFE designs. The result is shown in Figure 24 for the selected detector locations. The left half of
the histogram corresponds to the IT barrel layers, numbered from the centre outwards L1 to L4. For
each layer the study was done for two pixel modules, one at the edge (e) and the one in the centre
(c) of the barrel. The fraction of late hits increases with the distance from the interaction point. The
right half of the histogram is dedicated to the discs, numbered D1 to D12 with increasing distance
from the interaction point. For each disc one module on the innermost (i) and one on the outermost
(o) ring is presented. For any given disc the fraction of late detected hits is higher on the outer ring.
An ideal front-end with infinitely fast time response was also simulated and the fraction of hits
detected late was estimated using the same method described above. Results are shown in grey in
Figure 24 overlaid to the estimates of the actual analogue front-ends, because they represent the
irreducible background. For the considered positions, this fraction is between 0.38% and 7.26%.
These are hits generated by particles whose travel time up to the sensor is more than 25 ns longer than
the minimum, for which the detector is tuned. The SYNC and DIFF AFE have similar performance,

causing few percent of misassigned hits on top of the background. The DIFF is slightly faster. The
LIN AFE instead is significantly slower, causing up to additional 11% of late hits in the detector,
on top of the intrinsic worst case 7%.
LIN FE slow time response mitigation
Following the outcome of the previous measurement, a modification of the discriminator circuit
was proposed by the design team to improve the time response of the LIN AFE. The discriminator is
composed of two stages: a transconductance stage and a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). In the TIA
two diode-connected transistors, initially introduced to minimise the static current consumption at
the output of the discriminator, were forcing other transistors to operate in the deep sub-threshold
regime, consequently making them slower. A significant improvement in time walk at the cost of
a marginal increase in static current consumption was achieved by removing those two transistors.
This led to a simpler TIA stage in the new design of the LIN AFE [31], for the next version of the
chip, called RD53B [18].
Circuit simulations were used to extract the time walk curves of both the original and the
improved LIN AFE designs. They were transformed into time response plots and combined with
the time of arrival simulations to estimate the fraction of late hits for the simulated designs. The
simulated RD53A design was compared to the measurement and the difference in late hits is shown
in Figure 25. The simulated AFE gives a slightly higher number of late hits. Nevertheless, the
simulation demonstrates a very good agreement with the measurement, the difference in late hits
being below 1%. This confirms the validity of the simulation, which can therefore be used to
predict the fraction of late hits induced by the improved design. The difference in late hits between
the original design (RD53A) and the new one (RD53B) is also shown in Figure 25. The new LIN

by the simulated RD53A version of the LIN AFE and the improved RD53B version (dark green).
AFE demonstrates on average 5% less misassigned hits. The improved design of the LIN AFE
was also implemented in a test chip and verified before and after irradiation. The simulation and
measurement results after an irradiation up to 1 Grad show that the degradation of time walk after
irradiation is minor [31].
Late-hit occupancy
The fraction of late-detected hits was converted to the occupancy due to late hits, using the
simulated hit occupancies extracted from Figure 10. The result is shown in Figure 26 for all the
positions in the detector. The irreducible background of misassigned hits is almost uniform in
the tracker and amounts to between 10−5 and 10−4 , regardless of the AFE design. The late-hit
occupancy levels are at least one order of magnitude above the required noise level, indicated by the
red line in the figure. Hence the spurious hit rate in the detector is dominated by the time response
of the AFE, not by the noise. Moreover, the performance of the improved design of the LIN AFE
is comparable to the other two AFEs, although it remains slightly higher.

Conclusions

A new generation pixel readout chip is being designed for the upgrade of the CMS Inner Tracker
to cope with stringent requirements imposed by unprecedented radiation levels and hit rates. Three
different analogue front-ends were designed by the RD53 Collaboration and implemented in a large
scale demonstrator chip, called RD53A. The three designs were characterized and the expected
detector performance was evaluated against the requirements to choose the most suitable option for
CMS.
The differential analogue front-end showed the best noise performance, with the noise occupancy several orders of magnitude below the requirement, as well as a very good time response.
Nevertheless, this analogue front-end showed a problematic threshold tuning after irradiation, at

Figure 26: The occupancy due to hits detected late by the RD53A AFEs for different module
positions in the detector. The IT barrel layers are numbered from the centre outwards L1 to L4 and
for each layer the module at the edge is denoted "e" and the one in the centre is denoted "c". The
IT discs are numbered D1 to D12 with increasing distance from the interaction point and for each
disc the innermost ring is denoted "i" and the outermost one is denoted "o".

cold temperature of −10 °C and with high leakage current. An improved design was proposed,
expected to extend the operation with effective threshold tuning up to 500 Mrad, according to the
simulation results. However, given the radiation levels expected in CMS, such an operation range
would require several replacements of the innermost layer of the Inner Tracker barrel during the
physics program. In addition, a saturation in the preamplifier feedback requires to operate at the
limits of the time-over-threshold response in order to match the dead time requirement for the
innermost layer of the Inner Tracker.
The synchronous analogue front-end features an automatic threshold tuning performed periodically by the auto-zeroing circuit and offers a very good timing performance. However, it appeared
to be the noisiest of the three analogue front-ends. The noise increased for lower thresholds and
fast preamplifier return to baseline, becoming critical for the operation settings of Layer 1.
The linear analogue front-end satisfied all the requirements, but featured a slower time response.
However, an improved design was developed and is expected from simulation to reach a timing
performance almost equivalent to the other two analogue front-ends. Since all the performance
parameters of this analogue front-end were within CMS requirements and the main drawback was
addressed and mitigated, the linear analogue front-end was identified as the lowest-risk option for
the future pixel detector. CMS selected the linear analogue front-end with an improved design for
the integration into the next version of the RD53 pixel chip for CMS, named C-ROC. A prototype
is expected to become available in 2021.
