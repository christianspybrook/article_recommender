ABSTRACT
The presence of a stellar companion can place constraints on occurrence and orbital evolution
of satellites orbiting exoplanets, i.e., exomoons. In this work we revise earlier orbital stability
limits for retrograde orbits in the case of a three body system consisting of star-planet-satellite.
The latter reads acrit
sat ≈ 0.668(1−1.236ep ) for ep ≤ 0.8 in units of the Hill Radius and represents
the lower critical orbit as a function of the planetary eccentricity ep . A similar formula is
determined for exomoons hosted by planets in binary star systems, where ep is replaced with
the components of free and forced eccentricity from secular orbit evolution theory. By exploring
the dynamics of putative exomoons in α Centauri AB we find that the outer stability limit can
be much less than half the Hill Radius due to oscillations in the planetary orbital eccentricity
caused by the gravitational interaction with the binary star. We show, furthermore, how the
resulting truncation of the outer stability limit can affect the outward tidal migration and
potential observability of exomoons through transit timing variations (TTVs). Typical TTV
(RMS) amplitudes induced by exomoons in binary systems are .10 min and appear more
likely for planets orbiting the less massive stellar component.
1. INTRODUCTION

The detection of the first exoplanets (Wolszczan & Frail 1992; Mayor & Queloz 1995) established
unequivocally that planets like those in the solar system can form around other stars and be detected
using existing technology. However, there are more moons (satellites) within the solar system than
planets and if planets are abundant, then moons should be as well. The detection of exomoons is
the next frontier. After the first planets, the method of transits was identified as a viable detection
method for them (Sartoretti & Schneider 1999). Later, Holman & Murray (2005) and Agol et al.

Quarles et al.

(2005) showed the detection of Earth-like planets was possible using transit-timing methods, which
implied that the era of exomoon detection could also be forthcoming (Cabrera & Schneider 2007).
Kipping (2009a,b) showed the architectures of planet-moon pairs that would produce the strongest
observational signatures through transit timing and duration variations. Recently, Kipping & Teachey
(2020) and Kipping (2021) detailed the expected limitations on observational signatures using transit
timing variations. Finding such signatures would theoretically be possible through observations with
the Kepler Space Telescope, but an extensive analysis of its data did not readily confirm any exomoons
(Kipping et al. 2012, 2013b,a, 2014, 2015b). Careful analysis did rule out several false positives,
including one candidate for Kepler-90g (Kipping et al. 2015a). Alternative methods from transit
timing were also proposed for the detection of exomoons, including using the averaged light curves
(Simon et al. 2012), optimizing with respect to the orbital sampling effect (Heller 2014; Heller et al.
2016; Hippke 2015), Doppler monitoring of directly imaged exoplanets (Agol et al. 2015; Vanderburg
et al. 2018), or examining the radio emissions from giant exoplanets (Noyola et al. 2014, 2016).
The stability of exomoons is also a major concern when prescribing the various means of detection.
Although largely unconstrained, tidal interactions play a significant role in determining the lifetimes
of solar system moons and those orbiting exoplanets (Barnes & O'Brien 2002; Lainey et al. 2020).
However, Sasaki et al. (2012); Sasaki & Barnes (2014) placed constraints on the long-term evolution
of exomoons by exploring a wide range of tidal parameters (e.g,. tidal Love number and tidal
quality factors). Moreover, Namouni (2010) and Trani et al. (2020) tracked the fates of exomoons
that could have formed prior to substantial inward migration of their host planets and found the
shrinking planetary Hill radius RH to cause such moons to become unstable. Spalding et al. (2016)
expanded this analysis to identify a mechanism within the evection resonance that causes significant
eccentricity growth, where collisions can occur with the host planet or eventual tidal breakup due to
crossings inside the Roche limit. Eccentricity growth can also be induced through interactions with
neighboring planets, where the strength of the interactions can be scaled by the host planet's Hill
radius (Payne et al. 2013). Furthermore, Lidov-Kozai oscillations with a tilted exomoon orbit can
promote eccentricity growth of the host planet, where the precession rate from short range forces must
greatly exceed the precession from the Lidov-Kozai interaction to ensure exomoon stability (Grishin
et al. 2018). Sucerquia et al. (2019) showed that exomoons can be captured by the host star as a
'ploonet', where the moons can escape instead of collapsing onto their host planet during migration
and can complicate the detection of exoplanets. Domingos et al. (2006) produced estimates for the
outer stability boundary for prograde and retrograde exomoons based upon numerical simulations
and scaled their results relative to the planetary Hill radius RH , but those results overestimate the
outer stability boundary by ∼20% for prograde orbits (Rosario-Franco et al. 2020) and represent the
upper boundary of a transition region for stability (Dvorak 1986).
Exoplanet searches have also uncovered planets that orbit two stars in either a circumstellar (e.g.,
γ Cep (Campbell et al. 1988; Hatzes et al. 2003) or circumbinary configuration (i.e., Kepler-16 (Doyle
et al. 2011), Kepler-34 & 35 (Welsh et al. 2012), Kepler-38 Orosz et al. (2012a), Kepler-47 (Orosz
et al. 2012b, 2019), Kepler-64 (Schwamb et al. 2013), Kepler-413 (Kostov et al. 2013), Kepler-453
(Welsh et al. 2012), Kepler-1647 (Kostov et al. 2016), Kepler-1661 (Socia et al. 2020), TOI-1338
(Kostov et al. 2020)). Each of these systems hosts a giant planet. In terms of its bulk composition
(i.e., planetary mass and radius) those planets range from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like. Quarles et al.
(2012) and Hamers et al. (2018) showed the potential for the circumbinary giant planets to host

3
moons. However, an equivalent studied has not been performed for circumstellar systems, which is
the focus of this work.
The formation of exomoons around circumstellar planets in binaries could proceed through similar
processes put forward for the solar system (i.e., Canup & Ward 2006) or potentially through tidal
capture as has been proposed for the exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b-I (Hamers & Portegies Zwart
2018). The stability of the circumstellar host planets can also be influenced on the secular forcing
from the secondary star (Andrade-Ines & Eggl 2017) or mean motion resonances that can eject the
planet from the system (Quarles et al. 2020a). Due to the formation scenarios and constraints for
orbital stability, the exomoons orbiting these giant planets can do so in a prograde or retrograde
direction relative to the orbital direction of the host planet. Jupiter has captured many moons and
their retrograde orbits are taken as a tell-tale sign of this evolution (Jewitt & Haghighipour 2007).
In this work, we apply an analytic framework for the stability of exomoons that orbit planets in
binary star systems using the secular forced eccentricity and overlap of mean motion resonances in
Section 2. In Section 3 we present the results of N-body simulations of a hypothetical planet-moon
system in α Centauri AB and compare the numerical result to the predictions of the theoretical
framework. In addition, we test whether the outward tidal migration is affected by the stellar
companion in Section 3.4. Section 4 explores the observational signature of exomoons through transit
timing variations for exomoons in binary systems and estimates the number of potential systems using
the statistics for the stellar binary population. Section 5 summarizes the key findings of our work.
2. ANALYTIC CRITERIA FOR EXOMOON STABILITY WITH A STRONG PERTURBER

2.1. Secular Forced Eccentricity
The secular forced eccentricity from the three body problem can provide a simple analytical estimate
on the region of stability around a planet orbiting one star of a binary star system. In such a system,
the exomoon exists in a three body hierarchy, where it orbits a planet that in turn orbits its host
star. In addition, a secondary star orbits the center of mass of three body system at such a distance
so that the planetary orbit remains stable to produce a hierarchical four body configuration.
Various aspects of the stability of hierarchical four body configurations have been investigated in
some detail (e.g. Milani & Nobili 1983; Liu & Gong 2019, and references therein.). Most approaches
are based on Jacobi (quasi) integrals, c2 E, where c is the angular momentum and E the total energy
of the system (i.e., Marchal & Bozis 1982). Jacobi integrals are constants of motion in the circular
restricted three body problem related to zero velocity curves. In order for a three body configuration
to be Hill stable, the value of c2 E must be less than the critical value at the Lagrange point L1.
If that is the case, the zero velocity surface prevents a (massless) exomoon from escaping its orbit
around the planet. Although this concept can be shown to yield rigorous and sufficient criteria,
derived expressions for stability limits are often lengthy and cumbersome to use, especially in the
general three and four body problems where the Jacobi integrals are not constant.
We consider the hierarchical four body problem as two coupled three body problems: 1) planetmoon-host star and 2) planet-moon barycenter-host star-stellar companion. In the first three body
hierarchy, the planetary semimajor axis ap relative to the host star is much larger than the moon's
semimajor axis asat relative to the host planet (i.e., ap fl asat ). Then, the radius of the Hill sphere
around the planet depends on the planetary semimajor axis and masses through,

Quarles et al.

where Mp , Msat , and M? are the masses of the host planet, moon and host star, respectively. The
above definition corresponds to the Hill radius for a circular planetary orbit. In a more general
formula ap is replaced by rp which also includes the planetary eccentricity ep . As a consequence, RH
depends on the position of the planet on its orbit with a minimum at
0
RH
= (1 − ep )RH .

(2)

Since the planet, moon and host star form a hierarchical triple, the semimajor axis of the moon
around the planet remains approximately constant over time. To guarantee Hill stability of a moon
around the planet, we have to identify pathways for the moon to escape the Hill sphere around the
planet, which typically occurs when the planet is at periastron.

Under an external perturbation, the Hill radius RH
is modified as the planetary eccentricity evolves
(Georgakarakos 2003), where a simple model for the planetary orbital eccentricity evolution in a
hierarchical system dates back to Heppenheimer (1978). In essence, the eccentricity of the planetary
orbit can be decomposed into forced () and free (η) components (Andrade-Ines & Eggl 2017). The
former is determined by system parameters, such as the ratio of semimajor axes and the eccentricity
of the stellar binary, and can be derived from initial conditions. In their simplest form the equations
for the forced and free amplitudes of the eccentricity vector read as:
p ≈

5 ap ebin
,
4 abin 1 − e2bin

(3)

and
ηp ≈ |ep,o − p |,

(4)

where ep,o and ap are the initial eccentricity and semimajor axis of the planet p. The semimajor
axis and eccentricity of the stellar binary are denoted by abin and ebin , respectively. The maximum
planetary eccentricity (ep,max ) can be estimated by adding the amplitudes of the forced and free
components of the respective eccentricity vector,
ep,max ≈ ηp + p .

(5)

In our four body configuration, the influence of the secondary star induces variations in the planetary eccentricity as the the system evolves. As a result, we determine the smallest extent of the
planet's Hill radius as

To become unbound, a moon's orbital energy h must exceed the gravitational potential U , where

this can occur when rsat ≥ RH,min

its forced eccentricity is small, sat ∝ asat /ap fi 1. Thus, we can construct a simple stability criterion

we will measure acrit

2.2. Stability Limitations from Mean Motion Resonances
For moderate planetary eccentricity (ep & 0.3) N:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs) between
the planetary and satellite orbits add an additional component to the eccentricity evolution of the
satellite. For example, the 8:1 MMR occurs for asat ∼ 0.36 RH and the 9:1 MMR occurs for asat ∼ 0.3̄
2 1/3
RH (Kipping 2009a; Rosario-Franco et al. 2020). The libration width
RH following aN
sat = (3/N )
of MMRs grows with the perturber's eccentricity (i.e., ep ), which can allow for the overlap of MMRs
to destabilize a significant range in asat (Murray & Dermott 1999; Mudryk & Wu 2006; Morais &
Giuppone 2012). From Mardling (2013), we calculate the libration width ∆σN of the N:1 MMRs
using the following:

where H22 = 0.71 is a scale factor from the spherical harmonic expansion of a pendulum model for
resonance, M? is the mass ofpthe host star, MT is the total mass of the star-planet-satellite system,
and ξ(ep ) = cosh−1 (1/ep ) − 1 − e2p . Note that ∆σN = 0 for esat = 0, which implies that circular
satellite orbits are always stable in this model, and this is not the case, as noted by Mardling (2013).
When calculating ∆σN for circular orbits, we use esat = 10−3 or ep = 10−3 to avoid the complication
noted by Mardling or the singularity for ep → 0, respectively.
Using an Earth-mass moon on a circular orbit around a Jupiter-mass planet, we produce Figure 1
to illustrate the locations of the N:1 MMRs for such exomoons. The host star is assumed to equal
α Cen A in terms of its mass (1.133 M ) and luminosity (1.519 L ). The white curves in Fig. 1
are determined through aN
sat ± ∆σN and the color-code denotes the order N of the MMR. The black
regions represent configurations between the MMRs and the light green (solid) curve in Figure 1
traces the first intersection points between adjacent MMRs and can be calculated numerically using
N +1
a root finding function for aN
sat − ∆σN = asat + ∆σN +1 . An initial condition to the right of the light
green curve becomes unstable due to the overlap in the MMRs and this process can be slow due to the
eccentricity growth timescale of the satellite. However, in our four body configuration the planetary
eccentricity undergoes oscillations due to secular forcing by the secondary stellar companion. As a
result, the light green curve can shift leftward and more efficiently destabilize prograde satellites.
Retrograde satellites are less affected and can survive for a longer timescale at a much larger satellite
separation (Henon 1970), but chaotic diffusion within the MMR overlap can lead to instabilities on
longer timescales.
3. NUMERICAL DETERMINATION OF EXOMOON STABILITY

In this section, we numerically investigate the limits for the stability of satellites in a hierarchical
four body problem. The general setup of our simulation is detailed in Section 3.1. The retrograde
satellite stability limit (Domingos et al. 2006) is revisited in Section 3.2 to identify the lower critical
orbit boundary that was previously overlooked. Section 3.3 examines the limits to exomoon orbital
stability using the α Cen AB system. Finally, the effects of the planetary and stellar tides on EarthMoon analogs are explored in Section 3.4.
3.1. Simulation Setup & Initial Conditions

6

Quarles et al.

N-body simulations provide a direct test of exomoon stability and we use the orbital integration
package Rebound (Rein & Liu 2012; Rein & Spiegel 2015) because it is a versatile tool for the evolution
of complex N-body systems. We use the WHFAST and IAS15 integration schemes within Rebound
to evaluate the stability of exomoons (i.e., Rosario-Franco et al. 2020) on 105 or 106 year timescales
using an initial timestep that is 2.5% of the exomoon's initial orbital period. Since our initial timestep
is very small compared to the period of stellar binary, the WHFAST integration scheme maintains
sufficient accuracy. We verified this using the IAS15 adaptive integration scheme at high planetary
eccentricity. The 105 year timescale is sufficient for the most cases because the typical orbital timescale
for an exomoon is much shorter (∼0.1 yr) and the secular timescale for perturbations from the stellar
companion is ∼104 years (e.g., α Centauri AB; Quarles et al. 2018a; Quarles & Lissauer 2018; Quarles
et al. 2019). Perturbations from the stellar companion on retrograde-orbiting exomoons are weaker,
especially in the habitable zone of each star, and require the longer 106 year integrations. Our
definition of stability is for an exomoon that begins on a circular, coplanar orbit to survive for the
full integration time. Unstable conditions are those that cause the exomoon separation rsat to exceed
the host planet's Hill radius (rsat > RH ) or crash into the host planet (rsat < Rp ).
Our simulations use the α Centauri AB (α Cen AB) binary to identify the extent of exomoon
stability because the stellar masses, separation, and eccentricity are well-known, which is important
for our criteria in Section 2. Pourbaix & Boffin (2016) provide values for α Cen AB based on analysis
of archival data from HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher at the ESO La
Silla 3.6 m telescope. Pourbaix & Boffin find the masses of star A and B are 1.133 M and 0.972
M , respectively, while the binary orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity are 23.7 au (17.66 arcsec)
and 0.524, respectively. These values update the previous analysis Pourbaix et al. (2002) and find
good agreement with estimates from asteroseismology (Lundkvist et al. 2014). In our simulations,
the binary companion is coplanar, begins at periastron, and is nodally aligned (see Table 1). Our
choice for the binary initial phase affects the stability of planetary orbits sufficiently near the stability
limit (Quarles et al. 2018b, 2020a), where the initial separation of the host planets in this work are
in a regime that is long-term stable considering a wide range of initial phases for both the binary
and planetary orbit (Quarles et al. 2020a).
Since the existence of planets in α Cen AB is currently unknown (much less their atmospheric
composition), we choose an initial condition close to the inner edge of the conservative habitable
zone (Eggl et al. 2020). The habitable zone (HZ) is commonly defined as the region where liquid
water could potentially exist on the surface of a rocky planet and depends, among other things, on
the properties of the incident radiation and composition of the planet's atmosphere (Kasting et al.
1993; Kopparapu et al. 2014; Eggl et al. 2020). We place the planet at 1.232 au around star A
and 0.707 au around star B. Terrestrial planets on circular orbits at these semimajor axes receive
one solar constant's worth of radiative flux annually. For a planet orbiting α Cen A, the planet's
semimajor axis ap is sampled at 1.232 au, 2 au, 2.25 au, or 2.5 au as star A has a greater chance to
host planets as far out as ∼2–2.5 au (Quarles & Lissauer 2016). For a planet orbiting α Cen B, the
planet's semimajor axis begins at 0.707 au or at 2 au, respectively. In both cases, the planetary orbit
starts coplanar (ip = 0◦ ) with the binary orbit, with zero obliquity ψp = 0◦ , and is nodally aligned
(ωp = Ωp = 0◦ ). Most of the observed circumstellar planets in binary systems are Jupiter-like giants
(Schwarz et al. 2016). For the planetary mass Mp and radius Rp , we use values identical to Jupiter's
in our orbital stability simulations. Prior studies of the satellites in the solar system (Estrada &

Mosqueira 2006; Canup & Ward 2006) developed formation pathways akin to the terrestrial planets,
but for a circumplanetary disk. Canup & Ward (2006) suggested that in-situ formation of moons
from circumplanetary disks around giant planets are limited to ∼10−4 Mp due to the estimated flux
of infall material from the circumstellar disk, but this prediction awaits confirmation from exoplanet
observations. We use an Earth-mass exomoon Msat in our simulations due to the potential of tidal
capture through scattering events and the flux of smaller infall material could be larger than was
for the solar system due to the formation environment of the binary stars. However, we switch to
an Earth-Moon analog for the planet-moon system when considering the possible effects of tidal
evolution (see Section 3.4). This is motivated by observational constraints for α Cen AB (Zhao et al.
2018) and the comparisons that we make with the solar system.
For the exomoons, we explore prograde and retrograde orbits because both are ubiquitous within
the solar system (Jewitt & Haghighipour 2007), where there could be a higher incidence of scattering
during the early stages of planet formation (Quintana et al. 2002, 2007; Haghighipour & Raymond
2007). Since we are investigating long-lived exomoons, we expect that the tidal dissipation in the
host planet to efficiently align the exomoon's orbit with the planetary equator (i.e., coplanar with the
planetary and binary orbits) and circularize the exomoon's orbit. As a result, our numerical model
begins the exomoons on circular (esat = 0) orbits that are nodally aligned ωsat = Ωsat = 0◦ with the
planet and binary orbits. We vary the planet-satellite separation asat as a fraction of the planet's
Hill radius starting at 0.25 RH and up to 0.7 RH in 0.01 RH steps, where the 0.25 RH is just interior
to planet-satellite MMRs and 0.7 RH is the theoretical limit for stability for retrograde small bodies
in the circular restricted three body problem (Quarles et al. 2020a).
Following Rosario-Franco et al. (2020), we evaluate 20 initial phases fsat that are randomly drawn
between 0◦ –180◦ from a uniform distribution for each exomoon semimajor axis asat . When constructing our initial conditions, we use the above prescribed orbital elements and convert pairwise (e.g.,
[A,(p,sat),B]) to the Cartesian positions and velocities. The center of mass between the planet and
satellite typically resides within the planet and thus our results are indistinguishable from a Jacobian
construction of initial conditions. Table 2 summarizes the parameter ranges that we explore for the
orbital stability simulations.
3.2. Revised Retrograde Stability Limit
Previous studies (Henon 1970; Innanen 1979; Hamilton & Burns 1991; Domingos et al. 2006)
show that the extent of stable orbits for retrograde-orbiting moons is substantially larger than for a
prograde moon. Domingos et al. (2006) explored how the stability limit for retrograde satellites varied
with the planet and satellite eccentricity. However, the simulations by Domingos et al. evaluated
only a single initial phase (fsat = 0◦ ) to formulate the stability boundary. As a result, the empirically
determined retrograde stability limit was actually the upper critical orbit (Dvorak 1986). This
distinction to their study was discussed recently for the case of prograde-orbiting satellites (RosarioFranco et al. 2020). Moreover, Quarles et al. (2020a) numerically expanded the Jacobi constant

stability criterion (Eberle et al. 2008) to retrograde orbits and determined that the retrograde stability
limit ac ≈ 0.7 RH for the μ = 10−3 case studied by Domingos et al. (2006).
We perform simulations of retrograde Earth-mass exomoons hosted by Jupiter-mass planet that
orbits 1 au from its Solar-mass host star (see Section 3.1). The exomoon begins on a circular orbit,
where the host planet's eccentricity is varied from 0–0.6 in 0.01 steps. We test initial exomoon
semimajor axis values starting within 0.25–0.70 RH , where the outer limit is the determined from the
Jacobi constant criterion (Eberle et al. 2008; Quarles et al. 2020a). The planet and satellite orbits
begin nodally aligned, where we evaluate 20 random values for the initial satellite orbital phase
fsat . Figure 2 illustrates the relation between the initial satellite separation asat and the planetary
eccentricity ep using a color-code for the fraction of initial phases fstab that are stable for the full
integration timescale of 105 years. Since these simulations lack a stellar companion the longer 106
timescale described in Section 3.1 is unnecessary, but will be used for retrograde systems in Section
3.3.
The white cells in Figure 2 mark when all 20 trials either collide with or are stripped from the
host planet. The black cells mark when all 20 trials are stable, where the colored cells show the
transition. The black (dashed) curve marks the prediction from the fitting formula by Domingos
et al. (2006), where the red (solid) curve denotes our fitted stability boundary using a linear function
in the planetary eccentricity in units of the Hill radius RH ,

and the gray curves show the uncertainty in our estimate. Equation 9 has a similar structure as
Equation 7 where the planetary eccentricity is used directly (instead of the maximum eccentricity)
because the planetary eccentricity is nearly constant in time for these Sun-Jupiter-satellite systems
with negligible tidal interactions. Figure 2 demonstrates that the boundary from Domingos et al.
(2006) and our boundary represents the upper and lower critical orbits (Dvorak 1986), respectively.
Our stability boundary recovers the limit set by the Jacobi constant criterion (Eberle et al. 2008;
Quarles et al. 2020a) for circular planetary orbits. The red (solid) curve is fit by the coefficients:
C1 = 0.668 ± 0.006RH and C2 = 1.236 ± 0.019. Using our outer stability limit coefficient C1 is
13/2
important because it significantly affects the limiting satellite mass (Msat ∝ C1 ) through tidal
migration (Barnes & O'Brien 2002).

Planets orbiting either component in a stellar binary experience strong perturbations, but the perturbation strength scales with the pericenter distance of the secondary star and the initial semimajor
axis of the planet (e.g., David et al. 2003; Quarles et al. 2018b). We perform numerical simulations
(see §3.1) of prograde and retrograde orbiting satellites using the α Cen AB binary and consider host
planets whose orbits begin at the inner edge of their respective HZs (1.232 au or 0.707 au) or closer
to their respective stability limits (ap ∼2–2.5 au). α Cen AB is representative of moderately wide
binary systems (Raghavan et al. 2010; Moe & Di Stefano 2017) in terms of its eccentricity and binary
orbital period, which makes it important as a case study. The distribution of binary eccentricity and
orbital period is quite broad and we explore the possible impacts on our results in Section 4.2.
Starting with planets and moons in the respective HZ of their host star in α Cen AB, we numerically
determine the outer stability boundary for satellites (Figure 3). We also plot two gray curves that
represent the upper or lower critical orbit using the formalism derived in Section 2 in units of the
planetary Hill radius relative to the host star (Table 2),
acrit
sat = Csat (1 − p − ηp )RH

(10)

where Csat is a scale factor for RH in Equation 7. The coefficient Csat corresponds to values determined
for exomoons in single star systems (Domingos et al. 2006; Rosario-Franco et al. 2020) for prograde
and retrograde orbits. For the solid gray curve representing the upper critical orbit, Csat is 0.5
(prograde) or 0.95 (retrograde). For the dashed gray curve representing the lower critical orbit, Csat is
0.4 (prograde) or 0.65 (retrograde). Due to the absolute value imposed in Equation 3, the gray curves
have a peak at the forced eccentricity, p . Similar to Figure 2, the color-code in Figure 3 illustrates the
transition between stable and unstable orbits. In each panel, the solid curve encapsulates nearly all
the potentially stable cells, while the dashed curve marks the more conservative inner boundary. The
curves fit reasonably well because the eccentricity growth of the satellite, which is the main driver
for instabilities, grows secularly in this regime. Moderately eccentric planets (ep ≥ 0.3) undergo
eccentricity oscillations and MMR overlap causes significant eccentricity growth for the satellite.
The light green (solid) curves in Figure 3 (lower panels) mark the boundary where MMR overlap
begins in the host star-planet-satellite system. Those curves shift left and right as the system evolves.
There are a handful of stellar binaries with a separation of ∼20 au that are known to host Jovian
exoplanets near the stability limit (e.g., HD 196885AB, Chauvin et al. (2007); Correia et al. (2008);
Fischer et al. (2009); Chauvin et al. (2011); γ Cephei AB Hatzes et al. (2003); Torres (2007)) with
extensive dynamical studies focusing on the stability of the planet Thebault (2011); Giuppone et al.
(2011, 2012); Satyal et al. (2013, 2014). We perform numerical simulations of similar conditions for
a putative Jupiter-like exoplanet orbiting either star in α Cen AB at 2, 2.25, or 2.5 au from the
host star to investigate the stability of moons under more significant perturbations from the stellar
companion. Zhao et al. (2018) may have already excluded Jupiter-sized planets at these distances

Quarles et al.

using archival radial velocity measurements, but our results are scaled by the planetary Hill radius
and would still be applicable for lower mass planet-satellite pairs as long as Msat fi Mp .
Figure 4 illustrates our results for prograde orbiting satellites and is similar to Figure 3 (top row).
Satellites can be stable at larger separations when the host planet orbits its star at the forced
eccentricity p (see §2) and is apsidally aligned (ωp = ωbin ) with the binary orbit (Andrade-Ines
& Eggl 2017; Quarles et al. 2018b). Apsidal alignment is important because it limits the degree
of precession for the planetary orbit and minimizes the planet's eccentricity oscillations, where the
maximum planetary eccentricity ep can reach ∼0.2 when starting from a circular orbit (Quarles et al.
2018b). For an eccentric planetary orbit in the HZ of α Cen AB, ep can also vary by ∼0.2 over
a secular cycle (Quarles et al. 2018b), but the magnitude depends on the proximity to the forced
eccentricity. At the maximum of the planetary eccentricity oscillation, the truncation of the planetary
Hill radius is more significant and significant overlap with MMRs can occur, where an ejection of the
satellite becomes more probable.
Figure 4 demonstrates this effect through: 1) the gray curves marking the upper and lower critical
satellite orbits and 2) the light green curves denoting the boundary for overlapping MMRs. The
dashed (light green) curves represent a shift of the MMR based curves (solid) to smaller initial
planetary eccentricities by about ∼0.2, which is representative of the maximum oscillation of the
planetary eccentricity that permits planetary stability from previous studies (Quarles & Lissauer
2016; Quarles et al. 2018b). Figure 5 illustrates the planetary eccentricity oscillations (Fig. 5a–c) for
three different initial values of ep , where the remaining initial conditions are drawn from Fig. 4c and
asat begins at 0.3 RH . Figs. 5a & 5c show a higher variation due to their relative distance from the
planetary forced eccentricity (p ∼ 0.08 when ap = 2.25 au). Figure 5d–f demonstrate the evolution
of the satellite's apocenter Qsat (black dots) in response to the planet's eccentricity variation, where
the gray (dashed) curve marks the lower critical orbit boundary, light green (solid) curve denotes the
boundary for MMR overlap when esat = 0, and the magenta (dashed) shows the shift of the MMR
overlap boundary at the maximum satellite eccentricity. The boundary for MMR overlap depends
on ep and esat (see Eqn. 8), where increases in esat lead to shifts in the MMR overlap boundary
to lower ep values and increases in ep (relative to p ) correlates with a higher likelihood of reaching
the new boundary. Instability can then ensue once the satellite enters the MMR overlap region, but
this process is chaotic (Mudryk & Wu 2006). Figure 6 illustrates similar calculations as Fig. 4, but
for retrograde orbiting satellites. The overall area is greater due to the enhancement to stability
from retrograde orbits and the possible truncation due to planetary eccentricity oscillations is less
severe. Even though more of the parameter space is stable for retrograde satellites, the maximum
satellite eccentricity is also larger and the possible existence of multiple satellites would constrain the
parameter space further (Giuppone et al. 2013).
3.4. Tidal migration lifetimes in α Centauri AB
In our solar system, the lifetime of moons is significantly constrained by tidal interactions (Barnes
& O'Brien 2002; Sucerquia et al. 2019; Lainey et al. 2020). While constraints have been placed on the
long-term tidal evolution of exomoons in single stellar systems (Sasaki et al. 2012; Sasaki & Barnes
2014), this has yet to be established for exomoons in stellar binary systems. To obtain a full picture
of orbital stability of exomoons in stellar binary systems, it is necessary to consider the contribution
of planetary and stellar tides. In this section, we apply a secular constant time lag (CTL) tidal model

11
and evaluate the migration lifetimes of exomoons within the HZs of each stellar binary component
in α Cen AB.
Analyses of observational surveys (Zhao et al. 2018) have largely excluded Jupiter-mass exoplanets
from the HZs of α Cen AB, where the detection thresholds are 53 M⊕ and 8.4 M⊕ for star A and
B, respectively. Additionally, the low tidal time lag in Jupiter-like planets (k2,J ∆tJ ∼ 10−2 s or
QJ ∼ 106 ; see Leconte et al. (2010)) greatly reduces the outward migration of satellites and prevents
us from placing a strong constraint using tidal migration on possible exomoons, although recent
results for Saturn suggest substantially faster migration rates could be possible (Lainey et al. 2020).
More complicated models for the tidal dissipation in gas dominated exoplanets could be employed
(e.g., Guenel et al. 2014; Alvarado-Montes et al. 2017), but such considerations are beyond the scope
of this work. As a consequence we use an Earth-Moon analog in our tidal model instead, due to its
potential to place meaningful constraints on exomoons in α Cen AB, and because the Earth-Moon
system has tidal parameters that are better understood. Similar to section 3.3, the planetary orbits
are sampled from the inner edge of their HZ, but values for exomoon's semimajor axis begin at 8.64
R⊕ (three times the Roche radius of an Earth-Moon analog).
We implement a constant time lag secular model (Leconte et al. 2010; Hut 1981) and evaluate the
tidal evolution up to 10 Gyrs. This model calculates the secular changes to the semimajor axes (ap
and asat ), eccentricities (ep and esat ), and mean motion (np and nsat ) averaged over an orbit. The
model is scaled by the tidal Love number k2 and the time lag ∆t, where the latter is proportional
to (nQ)−1 in the constant phase lag (i.e., constant Q) tidal models (Leconte et al. 2010; Piro 2018).
A reasonable time lag for the Earth-Moon system is ∼100 s, and we assume ∆tp = 100 s, unless
stated otherwise. The initial rotation period of the host planet is 5 hours, which is consistent with
expectations from terrestrial planet formation (Kokubo & Ida 2007). The external perturbations from
the secondary star on the exomoon are weak compared to the planetary gravitational interactions
and a tidal model considering the interactions between the host star-planet-moon are sufficient. We
use a new module called tides_constant_time_lag from reboundx (Baronett et al. 2021) to test
this assumption, which is based upon the well-established code mercury-T (Bolmont et al. 2015).
Our implementation of the tides_constant_time_lag module evaluates the instantaneous torques at
each timestep using the ias15 integrator and the N-body simulations are evolved for 10 Myrs, which
is an appropriate timescale to see the effects on the satellite orbit due to tides. At the time of this
writing, the tides_constant_time_lag module does not evolve the changes to primary body's spin
due to outward tidal migration of a secondary body. Therefore, we update the spin rate of the primary
body periodically using interpolated values of the host planet's spin rate from the afore mentioned
secular model. Figure 7 illustrates the results from reboundx (solid black) and the corresponding
secular model (dashed red), where the two approaches are in agreement to a high degree. In both
models, the exomoon's eccentricity grows at similar rates and orbital energy exchanges between the
planet and moon become possible. Since the N-body method is more computationally expensive (12
CPU-days), we use the secular model for the remainder of this section.
The outward migration of a satellite varies with both the assumed time lag and with the mass of
the satellite. We evaluate the outward tidal migration using a broad range in the time lag (10–600
s) and the satellite mass (0.001–0.05 Mp ) over a 1010 year timescale (i.e., main sequence lifetime of a
G dwarf). Figure 8 shows variation in outcomes due to these parameters for an Earth-Moon analog
orbiting either stellar host in α Cen AB. The color-code delineates the assumed parameter in each

12

Quarles et al.

panel. Figures 8a and 8b evolve a Moon-like satellite (0.0123 M⊕ ). Satellites are stable for the full
range of time lags considered for α Cen A. But, exomoons can escape after 1 Gyr when their host
planet orbits α Cen B for a time lag &100 s. For α Cen B, the inner edge of the HZ is closer to
the host star and the tidal de-spinning of the host planet is faster, which can accelerate the outward
migration. Figures 8c and 8d consider a range of satellite masses, where the time lag is held fixed at
100 s. There is a smaller range of outcomes when the satellite mass is varied, where larger planetsatellite mass fractions (&0.02 Msat /Mp ) shorten the de-spinning timescale for the host planet. Once
the host planet is de-spun, the migration changes direction and the satellite begins to fall towards
the planet. In this case, the stellar tide on the host planet is weak enough so that the infall rate is
slow as is shown by the flattening of the 0.05 M⊕ curves in Figures 8c and 8d. If the host planet's
orbit was ∼0.5× smaller, then a putative satellite would collide with the host planet within 10 Gyrs
(e.g., Sasaki et al. 2012; Sasaki & Barnes 2014).
Previous studies have historically used tidal migration to place upper limits on satellite masses using
a constant phase lag (i.e., constant Qp ) tidal model (Goldreich & Soter 1966; Barnes & O'Brien 2002;
Domingos et al. 2006). However, these efforts are usually limited to cases where the satellite mass
is much smaller than the planet (i.e., Msat /Mrmp fi 1) so that the satellite mass is neglected in the
formulation of the satellite's mean motion nsat . Additionally, the final expression is determined in
terms of a fraction of the planet's Hill radius f (see their Equation 8 Barnes & O'Brien 2002). In
the constant phase lag model, the satellite's semimajor axis changes via the following differential
equation (Murray & Dermott 1999):

where G is the Gravitational constant, Rp is the planetary radius, k2,p is the planetary Love number,
and Qp is the tidal quality factor. When the initial planetary rotation period is sufficiently short
(Piro 2018), the satellite migrates past the stability limit (Equation 10) on a timescale T that is
determined through the integral of Equation 11 resulting in:

where af and ao are the final and initial semimajor axes of the satellite, respectively. For moons
that form close to the host planet, the term proportional to ao can be neglected because af fl ao .
To determine the limiting mass ratio, we make the substitution xm = Msat /Mp and set af equal
to f RH , where f = Csat (1 − p − ηp ) from Equation 10. Rewriting RH in terms of xm as RH =
ap [(1 + xm )Mp /(3M? )]1/3 and inserting af into Equation 12 yields the following expression after

Equation 13 represents the upper limit in the mass ratio xm between the satellite and the planet for a
given configuration after a set time T . For the range of parameters considered in this work Equation

13
13 has only one real root which is most easily found numerically using a root-finding algorithm, such
as the root_scalar function in numpy (Harris et al. 2020). Equation 13 reduces to Equation 8 from
Barnes & O'Brien (2002) in the low mass ratio limit (i.e., xm fi 1). As pointed out by Piro (2018),
Equation 13 will hold as long as sufficient spin angular momentum in the host planet is available for
the outward migration. Once the planetary rotation synchronizes with the satellite's mean motion,
the outward migration stops and inward migration towards the Roche limit can occur.
We test the validity of this Equation 13 using an Earth-mass host planet in α Cen AB over 10
Gyr in a constant time lag model (∆tp = 100 s) following the system setup in Fig. 8, where the
outer stability limit acrit
sat is truncated by the planetary eccentricity ep . In addition, we evaluate a
comparable constant Q tidal model for a more direct comparison. Figure 9 shows that Equation 13
(black curve) fits the boundary between stable (colored cells) and unstable (gray cells) for planetsatellite mass ratios . 10−2 , where the assumption for only outward migration remains valid. Above
this curve, there are solutions where the infall timescale (after synchronization) is longer than 10
Gyrs. The color-code denotes how far the satellite migrates outward over 10 Gyrs relative to the
respective critical semimajor axis and the ⊕ symbol denotes parameters for an Earth-Moon analog at
the planet's forced eccentricity. The constant time lag models (Figs. 9a and 9b) allow for a smoother
transition when the migration direction changes (outward to inward migration) as compared to the
respective constant Q models (Figs. 9c and 9d). We find that Equation 13 is more applicable for
planets orbiting α Cen B because its HZ is closer to the host star and when the planet-satellite
mass ratio is .2-3%. Different assumptions on the dissipation parameter (∆tp or Qp ) can affect the
outcome, but those also run into limits for plausibility since we are considering Earth-like values
estimated from the terrestrial planets in the solar system (Quarles et al. 2020b).
4. OBSERVATIONAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS

4.1. Potentially Observing Exomoons in α Centauri through TTVs
The presence of exomoons for single star systems can be deduced using transit timing variations
(TTVs) and transit duration variations of the planet as it crosses its host star (Kipping 2009a,b),
where these measurements also depend on the planet-satellite mass ratio msat /mp and separation
asat . These factors affect the maximum TTV (RMS) amplitude through the displacement of the
host planet from the center of mass (Sartoretti & Schneider 1999), where the larger planet-satellite
separations increase the TTV magnitude for a given Msat /Mp . We examine a hypothetical case of
an Earth-analog near the inner edge of the conservative HZ of each star in α Cen (see Fig. 3 and
how the presence of the stellar companion affects the maximum TTV amplitude for the putative
transiting planet due to a prograde orbiting satellite. The Earth-analog is assumed to be at its
forced eccentricity to set the outer stability limit.
The binary companion primarily affects potential exomoons through the truncation of the outer
stability limit. Planetary tides could also limit the allowed parameters, but the tidal dissipation could
be plausibly adjusted to allow for long-lived exomoons and thus cannot place a meaningful constraint
for Earth-analogs in α Cen AB. However, satellites of Earth-analogs in other binary systems with
less luminous secondary stars can be meaningfully constrained (Sasaki et al. 2012; Quarles et al.
2020b). Figure 10 shows the parameters that can produce 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min TTVs (colorcoded) induced by prograde or retrograde satellites. An analog of the current Earth-Moon system
in terms of mass ratio and separation is denoted by the ⊕ symbol, which would produce a &2 min

14

Quarles et al.

TTV. Much larger TTVs (.40 min) are possible for retrograde orbiting satellites because the outer
stability limit is farther from the host planet. An instrument similar to the Kepler Space Telescope
is ideal for observing circumstellar planets and measuring potential TTVs (Ford et al. 2011). The
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Ricker et al. 2016) has already detected a transiting planet
within a stellar triple consisting of M-stars (LTT 1445ABC; Winters et al. (2019)), however the
planet is likely already tidally locked which may limit its chances to host long-lived moons (Sasaki
et al. 2012).
4.2. Exomoons in Other Binary Systems
Although an Earth-analog in α Cen AB is a good case study, results based on the latter may not
translate to other populations of binary star systems. In this section we, therefore, examine the
frequency of Earth-analogs hosting moons in binary systems more generally through a Monte Carlo
experiment1 . In our previous work (Quarles et al. 2019, 2020a), we used empirically derived probability density functions (PDFs) from surveys of binary stars with a Solar-Type primary (Raghavan
et al. 2010; Moe & Di Stefano 2017). The PDF for the binary period distribution is a log-normal
2
2
distribution for the binary period P in days, plogP ∝ e−(logP−ξ) /2σ where ξ = 5.03, σ = 2.28, and
4 ≤ logP ≤ 7. For the mass ratio q = MB /MA , we use a broken power law PDF pq ∝ q γn , where
γ1 = 0.3 for q ≤ 0.3 and γ2 = −0.5 for q > 0.3. Following Moe & Di Stefano (2017), we add to
the PDF an excess twin fraction of 0.1 for q ≥ 0.95 to account for the observed stellar twins. An
additional power law PDF pe ∝ e0.4
bin is included to account for the binary eccentricity. Coefficients
R
for these PDFs are numerically determined so that the total probability is equal to unity, px dp = 1.
In contrast to our previous work, we ignore the uncertainty in power law exponents as they do not
substantially alter the results.
To generate random binary system parameters, we numerically determine the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for each of the PDFs described above, use a draw from a uniform distribution
U(0, 1), and then numerically determine the random variate by parallel array matching. The planetary semimajor axis ap is calculated at 1 Earth Flux (S⊕ = 1L /(1au)2 ) and can vary depending
on which star is hosting the planet. As the PDF for the binary mass ratio varies, we adjust the secondary star's luminosity using the common power law approximation of the mass-luminosity relation
for main sequence stars. We also assume that the planet begins at its forced eccentricity (see Equation 3). Our final results use the semimajor axis ratio ap /abin , where the planetary semimajor axis
max
is normalized by the binary semimajor axis abin . We calculate the maximum satellite mass (Msat
)
assuming an Earth-Moon analog for tides with a 10 Gyr lifetime (see Section 3.4) and normalize by
the planetary mass Mp = M⊕ . We choose 50 random values for the satellite mass and semimajor axis
max
using uniform distributions within the ranges −3 ≤ log Msat ≤ log[Msat
] and 0.05RH ≤ asat ≤ acrit
sat .
We then use the interpolation map technique (Quarles et al. 2020a) to verify that the generated host
planet orbit is stable and our formalism from Section 2 to determine the outer stability boundary for
the exomoon acrit
sat . Once the stability of the planetary and exomoon orbits are validated, the TTV
(RMS) amplitude is calculated (Kipping 2009a, see their Eqn. A27).
Overall, we perform 10,000 draws from the PDFs representing the binary system parameters and
50 draws of the exomoon parameters (mass and separation) assuming an Earth-analog orbiting the

primary star with a prograde orbiting satellite. The corresponding results are shown in the top
left panel of Figure 11. The process is repeated under the same condition, but with a retrograde
orbiting satellite and prograde/retrograde satellites for an Earth-analog orbiting the secondary star
to generate the results presented in the other three panels. Figure 11 illustrates the estimated number
of Earth-mass planets that could host satellites for a given TTV assuming a Solar-mass primary star.
The highest number of systems occurs for widely separated binary systems (ap /abin ∼ 0.001) and
low TTV amplitudes (∼0.3 min). Higher TTV amplitudes are possible, but a large survey would
likely be necessary to ensure a detection. A retrograde orbiting exomoon around the primary star
could produce a larger TTV amplitude (∼30 min) due to the a larger outer stability limit, while the
maximum TTV amplitude in the other cases is .10 min. Counter-intuitively, planets orbiting the
secondary star (B) have a slightly better chance of hosting exomoons because a distance of 1 Earth
Flux is closer to the host star and less likely to be significantly perturbed by the more massive star
A. These results scale with the primary star mass, where more massive primaries (1.2 M ) allow
for larger TTV amplitudes and less massive primaries (0.8 M ) restrict the parameter space due to
more significant tidal interactions between the exomoon and host star. The primary star of α Cen
AB would be a good candidate for searching for TTV inducing exomoons if transiting Earth-analogs
were present. However, surveys of α Cen AB for planets are difficult because of pixel saturation in
photometric observations (Demory et al. 2015) and astrophysical noise in radial velocity observations
(Zhao et al. 2018).
5. CONCLUSIONS

Moons are ubiquitous within our solar system, where we expect similar bodies to exist in other
planetary systems including those with stellar companions. An exomoon is influenced by a strong
perturber through free and forced eccentricity of its host planet. At the minimum of the host planet's
eccentricity oscillation, the planet's gravitational range of influence is truncated, which restricts the
largest stable semimajor axis for the exomoon. Additionally overlap in the MMRs between the
satellite and planetary orbits allow for putative satellites to escape on relatively short timescales.
Other studies (Domingos et al. 2006; Rosario-Franco et al. 2020) deduced the outer stability limit for
prograde exomoons in single star systems. We revise the stability formula for retrograde satellites
as acrit
sat = 0.6684(1 − 1.236ep ) in units of Hill radii to represent the lower critical orbit. We augment
previous findings (Domingos et al. 2006; Rosario-Franco et al. 2020) to include a correction using the
forced eccentricity (see Equation 10) determined from secular perturbation theory (Andrade-Ines &
Eggl 2017) and thus, increase the applicability to planets in binary star systems.
Constant time lag (Hut 1981) and phase lag (Goldreich & Soter 1966) models predict that tidal
dissipation can cause outward migration to free a satellite from its host planet. We apply these
models to hypothetical Earth-Moon analogs in α Cen AB. The eccentricity forcing from α Cen A on
moons hosted by an Earth-analog orbiting α Cen B can destabilize moons on a 10 Gyr timescale that
have moderate to strong tidal dissipation (∆tp & 100 s). In the opposite case, moons can maintain
stable orbits despite strong tidal dissipation (∆tp ∼ 600 s). Although we examine coplanar orbits,
Grishin et al. (2018) showed that tilted exomoon orbits can persist if the short range interactions
are stronger than those from the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We revise the analytic limit for planetsatellite mass fractions (see Equation 13) in a constant phase lag (i.e., constant Q) and compare its
validity with an equivalent constant time lag model. The maximum planet-satellite mass fraction is
most applicable to systems where the host planet's semimajor axis is more strongly influenced by

the host star. In α Cen AB, the conservative HZs are distant enough from the host star so that a
tidal constraint is less meaningful and the formalism would be more useful for considering exomoons
orbiting Proxima b (Anglada-Escudé et al. 2016).
The truncation of the Hill radius through secular eccentricity oscillations and outward tidal migration can influence potential observations of exomoons through TTVs (Kipping 2009a,b). The TTV
(RMS) amplitude is largest when satellites are close to their outer stability boundaries. These mechanisms limit the outer stability limit and can constrain the range of tidal dissipation allowed. The
maximum TTV amplitude in a system like α Cen AB is ∼40 min, where we find that an Earth-Moon
analog would exhibit ∼2 min TTV signature. In other binary systems, TTVs .1 min appear to be
the most common due to trends in the underlying stellar binary population (Raghavan et al. 2010;
Moe & Di Stefano 2017). The Kepler Mission has uncovered small TTV amplitudes (∼ 1 min) for
many planetary systems but the significance of the TTV varies widely. The astrophysical noise in
transit photometry for circumstellar planets is expected to be similar to planets orbiting single stars
as dilution from the stellar companion is less of an issue. Current space missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) focus on short period planets, which have likely already lost
their moons due to the stellar tides. Future space missions similar to Kepler (e.g., European Space
Agency's PLATO mission) that target longer period planets will be ideal in the search for exomoons.
The search for exoplanets in binary star systems is an active field, where many targeted efforts
have been applied to α Cen AB (Endl et al. 2001, 2015; Bergmann et al. 2015) using the radial
velocity method. New technologies are currently in development that use direct imaging either from
a coronagraph (Belikov et al. 2015; Bendek et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2015; Sirbu et al. 2017b; Belikov
et al. 2017; Beichman et al. 2020), a starshade (Sirbu et al. 2017a; Bellotti et al. 2020), or even high
precision astrometry (Bendek et al. 2018). Observations of α Cen AB with the Very Large Telescope
(VLT) have suggested that any exoplanets there need to be .20 M⊕ (Kasper et al. 2019), which bodes
well for the potential for terrestrial planets. The first results of the New Earths in the α Centauri
Region (NEAR) experiment on VLT uncovered a direct imaging signature of a roughly Neptune-sized
planet orbiting α Centauri A (Wagner et al. 2021), but these early results still await confirmation.
Detecting exoplanets in binary star systems is a crucial step in the search for exomoons, where a
wide array of methods (including TTVs) can be employed.

Figure 1. Map of the N:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs), where the color-code denotes the value of
N for each MMR. The regions between MMRs are colored black and could allow for stable satellite orbits
under optimal conditions. The light green curve connects the first point of intersection between adjacent
MMRs and marks a stability boundary within the three body problem.

Figure 2. Numerical estimates of the stability for retrograde orbiting exomoons in single star systems in
terms of the stability fraction fstab (color-coded), initial host planet eccentricity ep , and exomoon separation
asat in units of the planetary Hill radius RH . The white cells denote unstable initial conditions, where all 20
trials terminated before 105 yrs. The black (dashed) curve marks the upper critical orbit (Domingos et al.
2006, ; DWY06) and the red (solid) curve is the lower critical orbit determined by this work, where the
gray (solid) curves show the uncertainty. The light green (solid) curve illustrates the boundary from Fig. 1,
where MMR overlap can occur.

23

Figure 3. Similar to Figure 2, but the Jupiter-mass planet orbits either star in α Cen AB at the inner
edge of its respective HZ with an Earth-mass moon. The gray (solid and dashed) curves mark the upper
and lower critical orbit boundaries (see Equation 10). The light green (solid) curve illustrates the boundary
from Fig. 1, where MMR overlap can occur.

24

Quarles et al.

Figure 4. Similar to Figure 3, but the Jupiter-mass planet orbits either star in α Cen AB closer to its
stability limit and its Earth-mass moon begins on a prograde orbit. Specifically, the initial host planet
semimajor axis is indicated in each of the respective panels. The gray (solid and dashed) curves mark
the upper and lower critical orbit boundaries (see Equation 10). The light green (solid) curve illustrates
the boundary from Fig. 1, where MMR overlap can occur and the light green (dashed) curve denotes the
constraint on stability due to the evolution of the planet and moon eccentricity that alters the location of
the MMR overlap region (see Eqn. 8).

25

Figure 5. Short-term evolution of the eccentricity of the planetary orbit (top) and the apocenter distance
of the moon (bottom) using initial conditions sampled from Fig. 4c, where the initial semimajor axis for
each moon is 0.3 RH and initially circular. Panels a–c demonstrate the secular evolution of the host planet's
eccentricity ep over 20 kyr. Panels d–f illustrate the evolution of the moon's apocenter distance Qsat in
response to the planetary eccentricity evolution (panels a–c, respectively). The gray (dashed) curve marks
lower critical orbit boundary, where the light green (solid) and magenta (dashed) curves denote the boundary
for MMR overlap for the minimum and maximum satellite eccentricity, respectively. In panels d & f the
moon eventually becomes unstable as a result of entering the MMR overlap region, whereas the moon can
remain stable in panel e due to a lower amplitude of variation in the host planet's eccentricity (panel b).

Quarles et al.

Figure 6. Similar to Figure 4, but the Earth-mass moon begins in retrograde relative to the orbit of the
host planet. The gray (solid and dashed) curves mark the upper and lower critical orbit boundaries (see
Equation 10). The light green (solid) curve illustrates the boundary from Fig. 1, where MMR overlap can
occur.

Figure 7. Tidal evolution for 10 Myr of an Earth-Moon analog near the inner edge of the conservative HZ
of each star in α Cen AB using a constant time lag tidal model (Hut 1981). The N-body approach (solid
black) calculates the tidal evolution due to the instantaneous torques (using the tides_constant_time_lag
module (Baronett et al. 2021) in reboundx) and the secular (dotted red) method approximates the evolution
averaged over an orbit. The satellite begins at 0.03–0.05 RH or 3× the Roche limit (dash-dot cyan).

Quarles et al.

Figure 8. Evolution of tidal models for an Earth-analog planet and putative satellites in α Cen AB varying
the time lag (a & b; Msat = 0.0123 M⊕ ) or the satellite mass (c & d; ∆tp = 100 s). The host planet begins
near the inner edge of the conservative HZ at its forced eccentricity (see Equation 3), where the satellite
starts on a low eccentricity (esat = 10−3 ) orbit at 3× the Roche limit. The gray region marks the unstable
region for prograde orbits (see Figure 3).

29

Figure 9. Tidal migration simulations over 10 Gyr using either a constant time lag (a & b) or a constant
Q (c & d) model, assuming an initially rapidly rotating (Prot = 5 hr) Earth-analog host planet with a
dissipation factor ∆tp = 100s or Qp = 33, respectively. The color-code denotes the final satellite semimajor
axis af relative to the critical exomoon semimajor axis acrit
sat adjusted for the host planet's eccentricity (upper
x-axis). The gray region denotes parameters that allow for the satellite to escape, where the black curves
mark the potential upper mass limit (see Equation 13). The ⊕ symbol denotes an Earth-Moon like mass
ratio and the critical exomoon semimajor axis adjusted for the host planet's forced eccentricity (see Equation
3).

Quarles et al.

Figure 10. Potential transit timing variations (color-coded), or TTVs, for a satellite orbiting an Earthmass planet near the inner edge of the conservative HZ of either star in α Cen AB. The maximum satellite
separation asat is truncated to account for the planet's eccentricity oscillation induced from the stellar
companion, where the gray region is not likely to host stable exomoons. The ⊕ symbol denotes a mass ratio
and modern separation for the Earth-Moon system for comparison. The upper x-axis marks the exomoon
semimajor axis asat in units of planetary radius Rp , where the bottom x-axis denotes asat in units of Hill
radius RH .

Figure 11. Monte Carlo estimation for the number of moon-hosting systems in stellar binaries with respect
to the potential observables, semimajor axis ratio ap /abin and TTV (RMS) amplitude. The moon-hosting
planet (Earth-analog) is assumed to orbit near the inner edge of the host star's conservative HZ, while
the maximum putative satellite is 0.1 M⊕ . Star A is a Solar-analog, where Star B is determined from the
empirical mass ratio distribution for stellar binaries (Moe & Di Stefano 2017). The conservative HZs of
binaries similar to α Cen AB begin at ap /abin ∼ 0.03–0.05, where potential exomoons can produce a 1-10
min TTV signature.
