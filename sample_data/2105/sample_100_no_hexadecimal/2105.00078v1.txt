May 4, 2021
Abstract: Denote by X a Banach space and by T : X → X a bounded linear
operator with non-trivial kernel satisfying suitable conditions. We consider the
concepts of entropy - for T -invariant probability measures - and pressure for
Hölder continuous potentials. We also prove the existence of ground states (the
limit when temperature goes to zero) associated with such class of potentials
when the Banach space X is equipped with a Schauder basis. We produce
an example concerning weighted shift operators defined on the Banach spaces
c0 (R) and lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞, where our results do apply. In addition, we
prove the existence of calibrated sub-actions when the potential satisfies certain
regularity conditions using properties of the so-called Mañé potential. We also
exhibit examples of selection at zero temperature and explicit sub-actions in the
class of Hölder continuous potentials.

Introduction

Ergodic Optimization is the branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of
the properties of the set of invariant probability measures that maximize the
value of the integral with respect to a fixed (at least continuous) potential A (see
for instance [BLL13], [Gar17], [Jen06] and [Jen19]). The underlying dynamics
of the above-mentioned papers is given by the shift map. This is the classical
Ergodic Optimization framework.
Here we are interested in discrete-time Linear Dynamical Systems acting on
a separable Banach space X. We point out that the dynamics of a bounded
linear operator has some features which are quite different from the dynamics

of the shift. For instance, if v ∈ X is a periodic point for T : X → X, then,
the collection of all vectors in the one-dimensional subspace generated by v are
also periodic points. Nowadays there exists substantial work on the dynamics
of bounded linear operators acting on Banach spaces (see for instance [BM09,
BCD+ 18, BM20, GS91, GM14, GP11]).
In Statistical Mechanics the influence of the temperature Temp > 0 is de1
scribed by considering the potential Temp
A. It is common to introduce the
1
parameter t = Temp . The Gibbs state associated with the potential t A will be
denoted by μt A . When the potential is of Hölder class several nice properties
can be derived for its corresponding Gibbs states (see for instance [PP90]). In
[LMSV19] the authors show the existence of T -invariant probabilities with full
support using the Gibbs state point of view.
Given a Hölder potential A we call equilibrium state for A an invariant one
that maximizes a variational principle of pressure (to be defined later). For
the case when the dynamics is given by the shift several papers addressed the
question of showing that a Gibbs state for A is an equilibrium state for A as well
(see for instance [PP90]). In the first part of our paper we will be interested in
equilibrium states (they are invariant by the dynamics governed by the bounded
linear operator T ). The second part of the paper is dedicated to the topic of
Ergodic Optimization.
Several results in Ergodic Optimization were developed using tools of Thermodynamical Formalism for compact and Polish metric spaces (see for instance
[BLL13, BGT18, Gar17, GT12, Jen06, JMU06, JMU07]). This is so because
maximizing probabilities for a potential A appear in a natural way as the limit
of equilibrium states when the temperature Temp = 1t goes to zero (which is
the same to say that t → +∞). An invariant probability obtained as an accumulation point (as the limit of a subsequence tn → +∞) is called a ground
state. They are special in some sense because in addition, they maximize the
entropy among all the maximizing probability measures of the potential A (see
[BLL13, CLT01, FV18, JMU05, Kem11]).
In the case of the uniqueness of such accumulation point, we say that there
exists selection of probability at zero temperature. This is the case for example when the maximizing probability is unique. One can show that for a
generic Hölder potential, the maximizing probability is unique (see for instance
[CLT01]). A very important result in the area shows that generically in the
class of Hölder continuous potentials, the maximizing probability has support
in a unique periodic orbit (see [Con16]).
In [Bre03], [CGU11] and [Lep05], it was proved (without assuming uniqueness of the maximizing probability) the existence of a unique accumulation point
at zero temperature in the context of subshifts of finite type under the assumption that the potential depends only on finite coordinates. Se also [BGT18]
and [GT12] for another kind of examples where there exists selection at zero
temperature.
In [BCL+ 11] and [vER07], the authors present examples of a Hölder continuous potential where selection at zero temperature does not occur.

For the shift map in the non-compact setting, similar results were proved
showing the existence of ground states (the existence of accumulation points at
zero temperature). Results in this direction were obtained for countable Markov
shifts satisfying the so-called BIP property, topologically transitive countable
Markov shifts, and full shifts defined on the lattice RN (see for instance [FV18,
JMU05, Kem11, LMMS15, LV20a, SV20]).
The study of sub-actions and calibrated sub-actions provides important tools
in the study of maximizing measures associated with Hölder continuous (or even
continuous) potentials and its corresponding supports, This is so because a subaction provides tools to identify the support of maximizing probabilities (see
[BLL13, CLT01]). Several works addressed this issue in the context of XY
models, expanding maps of the circle, subshifts of finite type, and even in noncompact settings such as shifts defined on Polish spaces. A helpful tool used to
find sub-actions associated with a potential satisfying certain regularity is the
so-called Mañé potential (see for details [BCL+ 11, CF19, CLT01, Gar17, GL08,
JMU07, LMMS15, LMST09])
The dynamics of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces (see [BM09,
BCD+ 18, Gil20, GP11]) present some special properties which are significantly
different from the ones for the shift and continuous maps acting on Polish
spaces. Questions of topological nature as expansivity, shadowing, transitivity, and structural stability in this linear setting were addressed in [BCD+ 18,
BM20, Gil20]. We refer the reader to the first part of [LMSV19] for a short
account of some basic definitions and results concerning the theory of Linear
Dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension.
For the discrete-time dynamical action of a bounded linear operator T : X →
X on a Banach space X, the paper [GM14] present results about the existence of
T -invariant probability measures with full support in the case that X is reflexive
and separable. An extension of this result for a more general setting, including
non-reflexive separable Banach spaces, was presented in [LMSV19]. This was
obtained via the classical tool in Thermodynamic Formalism known as RuellePerron-Frobenius Theorem. It was assumed that the kernel of the bounded
linear operator L is nontrivial and of finite dimension. In order to define this
operator, it was necessary in [LMSV19] to fix an a priori probability on the
kernel of T with some properties.
For most of the reasoning of the present paper. we consider similar assumptions as in [LMSV19]. We introduce the concepts of entropy and pressure in the
setting of Linear Dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension. Our first goal
is to show that for a given potential A : X → R, satisfying some mild regularity
assumptions, the Gibbs state μA obtained in Theorem 1 in [LMSV19] is in fact
an equilibrium state associated with A i.e. it is satisfied a variational principle
of pressure and the supremum is attained at μA .
Our second goal is to present results on the topic of Ergodic Optimization.
We prove that the accumulation points of the family of probability measures
(μtA )t>1 , when t goes to ∞, are maximizing probability measures for A. We
point out the existence of accumulation points is not a trivial matter. This will
require assuming some properties for the potential A in order to be able to show
3

that a certain sequence of probabilities is tight. For some of our results, we will
need some more strong assumptions on the a priori probability measure than
the ones considered in [LMSV19]. Moreover, we show the existence of calibrated
sub-actions when the potential is at least Hölder continuous. Our most important new assumption is to suppose that the Banach space X has a Schauder
basis which is a property satisfied by a wide class of Banach spaces, such as,
c0 (R), lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞ and any separable Hilbert space H. Moreover, we
present examples concerning frequently hypercyclic and Devaney chaotic operators L : X → X, which are defined on the Banach spaces X = c0 (R) or
X = lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞. This class of operators, which were also considered in
[LMSV19], are given by the equation
L((xn )n≥1 ) = (αn xn+1 )n≥1 ,
where (αn )n≥1 is a sequence of real numbers satisfying suitable conditions (see
for instance [BM09, BCD+ 18, BM20, GP11]). This type of operator is known
in the classical mathematical literature as weighted shift.
At the end of the paper, we introduce the concept of Mañé potential in
the setting of Linear Dynamics. Taking advantage of the Mañé potential we
prove the existence of calibrated sub-actions associated with Hölder continuous
potentials, under the assumption that the set of maximizing measures is nonempty. Furthermore, we show that it is not necessary to assume the hypothesis
of summable variations on the potential in order to guarantee the result. In the
last section we also present some examples where is possible to get an explicit
expression for the calibrated sub-action and is guaranteed the selection at zero
temperature.
The paper is organized as follows:
In section 2 we introduce basic definitions and state the main results to be
obtained in the paper.
In section 3 we prove the existence of ground states in the matter of Linear
Dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension. More precisely, in section 3.1
appears the proof of Theorem 1 which guarantees that any Gibbs state is, in
fact, an equilibrium state. In section 3.2 appears the proof of Theorem 2, which
guarantees the existence of ground states. Finally, in section 3.4 we present a
particular example in the setting of weighted shifts.
In section 4 we show existence of calibrated sub-actions using the Mañé
potential. More precisely, in section 4.1 appears the proof of Theorem 3 and in
section 4.2 we present some examples to illustrate the theory.
The proofs of some of our results (in the setting Linear Dynamics) are similar
to the analogous ones for the shift, in this case, we will just briefly mention to
the reader references for the proof. For some other results, the proofs are quite
different and we provide full details in this case.

Main results

In this section we present some basic definitions that are required for our reasoning and we also state the main results of the paper. Consider a Banach space
X equipped with the norm k * kX . Given a bounded linear operator T : X → X,
we denote by kT kco the co-norm of T , which is given by
kT kco := inf{kT (x)kX : kxkX = 1} .
It is known that for any injective operator T is true that kT kco > 0. Moreover, for each x ∈ X, we have that kT kcokxkX ≤ kT (x)kX ≤ kT kopkxkX ,
where kT kop is the operator norm of T . From this follows the existence of
1
the limit limn→+∞ (kT n kco ) n . Indeed, the limit exists as a consequence of the
sub-additivity of the sequence of real numbers (kT n kco )n≥1 .
Hereafter, we assume that the Banach space X can be decomposed as the
direct sum
X = Ker(T ) ⊕ E ,
where Ker(T ) denotes the kernel of T , which is assumed of finite dimension.
Then, defining
p(T ) := inf{kT (x)kX : kxkX = 1, x ∈ E} ,

(1)

it follows that p(T ) > 0 and p(T )kxkX ≤ kT (x)kX for each x ∈ E. Furthermore, under the assumption that for each n ∈ N the Banach space X admits a
decomposition of the form
X = Ker(T n ) ⊕ En ,
where En+1 ⊂ En , it follows that p(T n ) > 0. Besides that, as a consequence
of the sub-additivity of the sequence (p(T n ))n≥1 , it follows the existence of the
1
limit limn→+∞ (p(T n )) n .
P+∞
It is known that the convergence of the series n=1 p(T n )−α to a real number
implies that the dynamical system T : X → X is Devaney chaotic and frequently
hypercyclic (see for details [BM09, GP11]). In particular, the above implies that
the dynamical system T is topologically transitive under the assumption that
X is a separable Banach space.
For each x ∈ X \ {0} and any n ∈ N, we use the following notation
T −n (x) := T −n ({x}) = {v ∈ X : T n (v) = x} .
Assuming that T is surjective but not injective, we obtain that the set T −1 (x)
is a non-empty and non-singleton set. Moreover, for each v ∈ T −1 (x) it is
satisfied the expression
T −1 (x) = Ker(T ) + {v} = {z + v : z ∈ Ker(T )} .
In other words, T −1 (x) is isometrically isomorphic to Ker(T ); this property
will be quite useful in the definition of the Ruelle operator (in the same way as
in [LMSV19]).
5

Denote by C(X) the set of continuous functions from X into R and by Cb (X)
the set of bounded continuous functions from X into R. The set Cb (X) equipped
with the uniform norm k * k∞ , which is given by kφk∞ := sup{|φ(x)| : x ∈ X},
is a Banach space.
Definition 1. We say that a potential A ∈ C(X) has summable variations with
respect to the bounded linear operator T : X → X, if
VT (A) :=

+∞
X

VT,n (A) < +∞ ,

(2)

n=1

where
VT,n (A) := sup{|A(x) − A(y)| : T i (x) = T i (y), 1 ≤ i ≤ n} .
We denote by SV T (X) the set of potentials with summable variations. That
is, the ones satisfying the equation in (2).
Given a function φ ∈ C(X) and α ∈ (0, 1], define
Holα
φ := sup
x6=y

|φ(x) − φ(y)|
.
kx − ykα
X

A function φ is called α-Hölder continuous, if Holα
φ < +∞. The set of all
the α-Hölder continuous functions from X into R is denoted by Hα (X) and the
set of all the bounded α-Hölder continuous functions is denoted by Hb,α (X).
Given T as above, we consider an a priori probability measure ν on the
kernel of T whose support is all the kernel. For instance, when the kernel has
dimension one, we could take ν as the Gaussian distribution on R (which is
isomorphic to the kernel of T ) with mean zero and variance 1. More precisely,
2
taking ν := f dr, with f (r) := √12π e−r /2 .
Definition 2. We say that a probability ν has strong adapted tails if, for any
ǫ > 0 there exists a sequence of positive numbers (κn )n≥1 such that
P+∞
n
n
c
1.
n=1 ν([−p(T )κn , p(T )κn ] ) < ǫ;
2. the sequence (κn )n≥1 belongs to l1 (R).

The above conditions are stronger than the ones presented in the definition of
adapted measure that appears in [LMSV19]. Any probability measure satisfying
the conditions of Definition 2 is also an adapted measure as defined in [LMSV19].
Now, we define a transfer operator acting on the set Cb (X), which will help
us to find the so-called equilibrium states and ground states, via the existence
of Gibbs states and the variational principle. Given a bounded above potential
A ∈ Hα (X) and an a priori Borelian probability measure ν, supported on
Ker(T ) and satisfying the strong adapted tails property, the Ruelle operator LA
6

of the potential A : X → R is defined as the map assigning to each φ ∈ Cb (X)
the function LA (φ) ∈ Cb (X) given by
Z
eA(z+v) φ(z + v)dν(z), v ∈ T −1 (x) .
(3)
LA (φ)(x) :=
z∈Ker(T )

We say that the potential A is normalized (for the a priori probabilty ν) if
LA (1) = 1.
Denote by B(X) the set of finite Borelian measures on X. By well-known
properties of the dual operator (see for instance [LMSV19]), we can define the
dual Ruelle operator L∗A as the map that assigns to each μ ∈ B(X) the probability L∗A (μ), which for each φ ∈ Cb (X) satisfies

φd L∗A (μ) :=

X

Following the proof of the main Theorem in [LMSV19], with a modification
in the part that guarantees the existence of the main eigenfunction (we adapt
the reasoning of Section 3 in [CSS19] to the linear dynamics setting), it is not
difficult to check that for any bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X),
there is an eigenvalue λA > 0 and a strictly positive eigenfunction ψA ∈ Hb,α (X)
associated with λA . Moreover, under the assumption that LA (1) = 1, it is
possible to guarantees the existence of a Gibbs state μA (i.e. a fixed point of the
operator L∗A ).
The hypothesis on [LMSV19] was that the potential was bounded (above
and below) and we will need here for some of our results that A is just bounded
above.
Note that even in the case when A is not a normalized potential, the above
claim implies the existence of an eigenprobability ρA (for the dual Ruelle operator L∗A ) associated with the same eigenvalue λA . The probability ρA has
the same support of the Gibbs state associated with the associated normalized
potential (to be defined below). Indeed, since the potential
A := A + log(ψA ) − log(ψA ◦ T ) − log(λA ) .
is a normalized potential one gets that L∗A μA = μA . Thus, denoting μA = μA , it
follows that ρA = ψ1A dμA satisfies the desired property. We call A the associated
normalized potential for A.
We say that μA is the Gibbs state for the (non-normalized) potential A, ρA
is the conformal measure associated with A and λA > 0 is the main eigenvalue
of LA .
Hereafter, we use the notation P(X) for the set of Borelian probability measures on X and we denote by PT (X) the ones that are invariant by the action
of T .
Definition 3. Given an a priori probability measure ν, supported on the Kernel
of T , and μ ∈ PT (X), the entropy of μ is defined as
o
nZ
 L (u) 
0
dμ : u ∈ Cb (X), u > 0 .
(4)
hν (μ) := inf
log
u
X
7

Remark 1. The values of hν (μ) are non-positive and for the measure μ of
maximal entropy the value hν (μ) = 0. In this last case, we can guarantee the
existence of such μ, because the potential B ≡ 0 is a normalized potential.
When considering the symbolic space {1, 2.., d}N, the shift σ : {1, 2.., d}N →
{1, 2.., d}N, and taking ν as the counting measure on {1, 2, .., d}, the real positive
value one obtains from the analogous expression to (4) (using Ruelle operator,
etc...) is exactly the Kolmogorov-Shannon entropy (see [Lo1, LMMS15, SV20]).
If we take ν as the normalized counting probability on {1, 2, .., d}, then we get
that the value obtained from (4) is the Kolmogorov-Shannon entropy minus the
value log d (therefore, a non positive number) as explained in [LMMS15].
When the set of preimages of any point with respect to the dynamics is not
a countable set, it is not appropriate to define entropy via dynamical partitions.
This happens for instance when considering the shift acting on the symbolic
space M N , where M is a compact metric space (like the case where M is the
unitary circle). Then, alternatively, one can define entropy via the information
provided by the Ruelle operator (which depends on an a priori probability
measure ν as above in (4), and taking the Ruelle operator associated with the
potential which is constant equal to zero). We point out that (in the general
case) it is required to take ν as a probability (and not a measure) in order for the
expression (4) to be well-defined . By taking ν as a probability (not a infinite
measure) the value we obtain in (4) is non-positive, and the maximal possible
value of the entropy of an invariant probability is the value zero. We refer the
reader to [LMMS15, SV20] for more details.
In this way, it is natural to adapt this point of view in our setting; defining
entropy of an T -invariant probability via (4). It is important to notice that (4)
depends on the so-called a priori probability measure. Hence, fixing a probability (for instance the natural standard Gaussian measure on Ker(T )), such
definition results in a topological invariant with respect to the map T .
Definition 4. Given a bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X), we call
the pressure of A the value
Z
n
o
Pν (A) := sup hν (μ) +
Adμ : μ ∈ PT (X) .
X

In addition, we say that μ
b ∈ PT (X) is an equilibrium state for A, if
Z
Pν (A) = hν (b
μ) +
Adb
μ.
X

The first result of our paper claims that given a potential A satisfying suitable conditions (see [LMSV19] for the assumptions), the set of Gibbs states
associated with A is contained into the set of equilibrium states for A and
Pν (A) = log(λA ), where λA is the main eigenvalue of the transfer operator LA .
Actually, in [LMSV19] the authors assume that the potential A defining the
transfer operator is bounded and Hölder continuous. However, as we already

8

mentioned, the proof in [LMSV19] also guarantees the existence of such Gibbs
states when the potential A is Hölder continuous and bounded above.
The precise statement of our first result is the following:
Theorem 1. Consider a separable Banach space X and a bounded linear operator T : X → X, such that, T is surjective but not bijective. Assume also that
X
= Ker(T n )⊕En , with En+1 ⊂ En , for each n ∈ N, and moreover suppose that
P+∞
n −α
< +∞. For each bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X)
n=1 p(T )
denote the Gibbs state associated with A by μA . Then, the following variational
principle is satisfied
Z
AdμA .
Pν (A) = log(λA ) = hν (μA ) +
X

That is, the Gibbs state μA associated with A is also an equilibrium state for
A.
Theorem 1 is widely known in the mathematical literature as the variational
principle of pressure, or the Ruelle Theorem. This result will be a quite useful
instrument throughout the paper. We will use it as a tool to find the so-called
maximizing measures and ground states of the potential A in the setting of Linear
Dynamics. Below we establish conditions in order to guarantees the existence of
such measures. We would like to point out to the reader that the proof of this
variational principle depends exclusively on properties of the transfer operator
defined in (3). However, we include it in order to facilitate the understanding
of the theory in the setting that we are interested.
Definition 5. A Schauder basis for the Banach space X is a sequence (ek )k≥1
of vectors in X, such that, for each x ∈ X there is a unique sequence of real
numbers (αk )k≥1 satisfying
lim

n→+∞

x−

n
X

k=1

αk ek

X

= 0.

(5)

First note that any Banach space equipped with a Schauder basis results
in a separable space. Furthermore, it is widely known that any Schauder basis
for X induces a corresponding basis of coordinate functions for the dual space
X ′ , which is given by a sequence (πk )k≥1 on X ′ , such that, for each i, j ∈ N it
P+∞
is satisfied πj (ei ) = δij . Hereafter, we use the notation x := k=1 αk ek when
the vector x ∈ X satisfies the limit in (5) for the values αk = πk (x) for each
k ∈ N. Actually, note that the sequence (πk )k≥1 is a total subset of X ′ , i.e., if
πk (x) = 0 for each k ∈ N, it follows that x = 0.
There are several examples of Banach spaces equipped with a Schauder basis,
for instance X ∈ {c0 (R), lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞} and X = H, where H is an
arbitrary separable Hilbert space; these are typical examples of spaces satisfying
that property. In particular, the set of coordinate functions agrees with the
Schauder basis itself when X = H is an arbitrary separable Hilbert space.
Moreover, in the last case, the Schauder basis is called as Hilbert basis of H.
9

Definition 6. Consider a Banach space X equipped with a Schauder basis
(ek )k≥1 and coordinate functions (πk )k≥1 . Define the set
Xi,j := {x ∈ X : j ≤ |αi | ≤ j + 1}
We say that a potential A ∈ C(X) satisfies the summability condition, if for
each i ∈ N is satisfied
+∞
X

esup{A(x): x∈Xi,j } < +∞ .

(6)

j=1

In particular, the so-called summability condition implies that for each i ∈ N
it is satisfied the property limj→+∞ sup{A(x) : x ∈ Xi,j } = −∞. Hence, in
that case we get sup(A) < +∞, and therefore, the potential A cannot be a
bounded below potential.
Definition 7. Given a potentialR A ∈ C(X), a measure μmax ∈ PT (X) is called
a maximizing measure for A, if X Adμmax = m(A), where
nZ
o
m(A) := sup
Adμ : μ ∈ PT (X) .
(7)
X

We denote by Pmax (A) the set of invariant probability measures attaining
the supremum in (7), which is usually called as the set of maximizing measures
of A.
It is important to point out that for any potential A in C(X) satisfying the
so-called summability condition, we have m(A) < +∞. However, even assuming
that condition we can have that Pmax (A) = ∅. In the following example, we
present a case where the set of maximizing measures is a non-empty subset of
PT (X). The above, under strong assumptions in the behavior of the potential.
Example 1. When v is such that T k (v) = v the probability measure μ
e with
support in the periodic orbit {v, T (v), T 2(v), ..., T k−1 (v)} of the form
μ
e :=

k−1
1 X
δ j
k j=0 T (v)

Pk−1
A(T j (v)) ≤ m(A). If for all j =
is T -invariant. Then, in this case k1 j=0
0, 1, 2, ..., k − 1, we have that A(T j (v)) = m(A), it follows that μ
e is maximizing
for A
In order to prove the existence of ground states and maximizing measures in
the case of bounded above potentials belonging to the set Hα (X) ∩ SV(X), we
will take advantage of certain properties of Gibbs states, which are consequences
of the main Theorem in [LMSV19]. The next theorem claims that under suitable
assumptions for the potential A, the set of ground states is a non-empty set.
10

Note that this is a non-trivial claim. This is so by the lack of compactness of
the Banach space X and also by the fact that the closed balls are not compact
in such vector spaces (by the Theorem of Riesz).
The statement of the result is as follows.
Theorem 2. Let X be a Banach space equipped with a Schauder basis (ek )k≥1
and consider T : X → X a bounded linear operator surjective but not bijective.
Assume
also that X = Ker(T n ) ⊕ En , with En+1 ⊂ En , for each n ∈ N,
P+∞
n −α
and
< +∞. Then, for any potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X)
n=1 p(T )
satisfying the summability condition, the family of equilibrium states (μtA )t>1
has accumulation points at infinity - denoted generically by μ∞ . The probability
μ∞ will be maximizing for A.
Our second interest in this paper is to be able to locate the union of the
supports of maximizing measures associated with a fixed potential A ∈ C(X).
A tool widely used for this purpose, in the classic literature on Ergodic Optimization, is based on calibrated sub-actions. In order to use this tool, some
hypotheses are needed. All of this, of course, for the case where Pmax (A) is
a non-empty set. The last Theorem provides conditions for the existence of
maximizing probabilities.
We would like to mention that some results about the existence of maximizing measures (where the underlying space is not compact) for a certain class of
potentials, defined on some Polish spaces with bounded expansive metrics, were
presented in [JMU07].
Another class of potentials where Pmax (A) is a non-empty set is the following:
Definition 8. Assume that the potential A belongs to C(X). We say that A
satisfies the maximizing property, if there are vector subspaces Y, Z ⊂ X, such
that X = Y ⊕ Z, dim(Y ) < +∞, and for each x = xy + xz belonging to X, with
xy ∈ Y and xz ∈ Z, we have
A(x) ≤ A(xy ) ,

(8)

and
lim

kxy kX →+∞

A(xy ) = −∞ .

(9)

Note that the maximizing property for A implies that sup(A) < +∞. In
Lemma 4 we prove that under suitable conditions of regularity for the potential
A, the maximizing property implies that Pmax (A) is a non-empty set.
In Lemma 3 we prove that Pmax (A) 6= ∅ when there exist ground states (the
last claim in Theorem 2)
Given A, the property Pmax (A) 6= ∅ will guarantee that the sub-action obtained via the Mañé potential is well-defined .
The so-called sub-actions are also known in the mathematical literature as
revelations (for details see [GL08, Jen06, Jen19])
Definition 9. Given a potential A ∈ C(X), we say that a continuous function
V ∈ C(X) is a sub-action associated with A, if satisfies the following inequality
V ◦ T ≥ V + A − m(A) .
11

(10)

There are continuous potentials A without a sub-action (see for instance
[Jen06]). In general, some regularity of the potential A is required for the
existence of sub-actions (see [CLT01]).
It is easy to see that for any maximizing probability μ for A and each subaction V associated with A, the support of μ is contained in the set
Ω(A) := {x ∈ X : V (T (x)) − V (x) − A(x) + m(A) = 0} .

(11)

It is also true that in the case the support of a probability μ is contained in
the set Ω(A), then, μ is a maximizing probability for A (see [CLT01]).
In this way, a sub-action can help to find explicitly the support of a maximizing measure (see for instance [CLT01, BLL13, Gar17]).
Definition 10. Let V be a sub-action for A, if for any x ∈ X there exists a
point y ∈ T −1 (x) which attains the equality in (10) i.e.
V (x) = V (y) + A(y) − m(A) ,
we say that V is a calibrated sub-action.
There are cases where one can show the existence of maximizing probabilities
for continuous potentials even if we cannot apply the Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius
Theorem formalism. In this case, we can consider maximizing probabilities
without talking about ground states (also known in the mathematical literature
as limits at temperature zero). Sub-actions will be helpful anyway (see the
expression in (11)). In example 2 we will consider a potential which is not
bounded but exhibits an explicit sub-action.
In order to prove the existence of sub-actions we introduce an additional tool
known in the classical mathematical literature as Mañé potential (for details see
[CLT01, GL08] and section 3 in [CLO14] for the case of the finite shift).
Definition 11. Given a potential A ∈ Hα (X) we define the Mañé potential φA
associated with A as the map given by
φA (x, y) := lim sup

ǫ→0 n∈N

where Sn (A)(x) :=

We claim that under the assumptions in Theorem 3, we have that φA (x, y)
belongs to [−∞, 0], for any pair of points x, y ∈ X (for details of the proof see
Section 4.1).
Now, we will present conditions to guarantee the existence of sub-actions associated with Hölder continuous potentials A via the use of the Mañé potential.
The statement of our third main result is the following:

12

Theorem 3. Consider X a Banach space and T : X → X a bounded linear
operator surjective but not injective. Assume P
that X = Ker(T n ) ⊕ En , with
n −α
En+1 ⊂ En , for each n ∈ N, and suppose that +∞
< +∞. Suppose
n=1 p(T )
also that A ∈ Hα (X) and Pmax (A) is a non-empty set. Then, for each x ∈ X
the map y → φA (x, y) belongs to Hα (X) and it is a calibrated sub-action for A.
An example of a potential A where the hypotheses of the above Theorem are
satisfied is A(x) = −kx − vkX , where v is a fixed point for T . In this case, the
probability with support on v is maximizing for A (see Example 2 for a more
complete discussion).

Existence of equilibrium states and maximizing measures

In this section, we present the proof of Theorem 1, which asserts the existence of
equilibrium states for the Gibbs states obtained in the Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius
Theorem formalism. We also present an example in the context of weighted
shifts (see for instance [BM09, BCD+ 18, BM20, GP11]). This will be proved in
Subsection 3.1.
Subsection 3.2 is dedicated to another topic. We propose two different roads
to guarantees the existence of maximizing measures. The first one, through the
existence of the so-called ground states for potentials satisfying a condition of
decay called in this paper the summability condition. The second one, using
the so-called maximizing property, in which we assume, in some way, that the
potential attains its maximum on a finite dimensional subspace of X. Our
purpose is to be able to set conditions such that the Mañé potential is welldefined .
We assume throughout the section that X is a separable Banach space,
T : X → X is a bounded linear operator surjective, but not bijective. We
also assume that P
for each natural number n, we get X = Ker(T n ) ⊕ En , with
n −α
En+1 ⊂ En , and +∞
< +∞.

A variational principle

Theorem 1 claims existence of an equilibrium state for each α-Hölder continuous
potential A with summable variations. First note that, by [LMSV19], it is
guaranteed existence of the eigenvalue λA > 0, a strictly positive eigenfunction
ψA ∈ Hb,α (X) and a Gibbs state μA ∈ PT (X). The Gibbs state is the natural
candidate to be the equilibrium state associated with the potential A. The next
result is the first step in order to prove that claim.
Lemma 1. Consider A ∈ Hb,α (X) and T : X → X satisfying the conditions of
Theorem 1. Then, for any μ ∈ PT (X) it is satisfied the inequality
Z

Adμ ≤ log(λA ) .

In order to prove our first main result, we will show that the supremum in

Accumulation points at zero temperature

In this Subsection, we present the proof of Theorem 2 which is the second main
result of our paper. Our strategy is to adapt a classical result used for finding
accumulation points of families of probability measures defined on non-compact
metric spaces satisfying suitable hypothesis, widely known in the mathematical
literature as Prohorov's conditions (see for instance [Pro56, Pro61]). In order
to apply the result to our setting, it is necessary to define an adequate family
of compact sets with large enough mass. In other words, we need to find sets
with measure close to one for all the members of the family (μtA )t>1 ; we have
to show that the family of equilibrium states (μtA )t>1 is tight.
Throughout this section we assume that the space X is equipped with a
fixed Schauder basis (ek )k≥1 . That is, for any x ∈ X there is a unique sequence
of real numbers (αk )k≥1 satisfying equation (5). Furthermore, we assume that
for each k ∈ N it is satisfied the equality αk = πk (x), where (πk )k≥1 is the
corresponding basis of coordinate functions for the dual space X ′ .
Consider a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers (mi )i≥1 . Given
k ∈ N, we define
(16)
Λk := {πm1 , ..., πmk } ⊂ X ′ .
Now, we define the function ΠΛk : X → Rk assigning to each point x ∈ X
the value ΠΛk (x) := (πm1 (x), ..., πmk (x)). Given any set of the form Ek =
Qk
k
i=1 [ai , bi ] ⊂ R , we say that CΛk (Ek ) is a cylindrical set generated by Ek and
Λk , if it is of the form
−1
CΛk (Ek ) := ΠΛ
(Ek ) ⊂ X .
k

(17)

We point out that the definition of cylindrical sets given above is a particular
case of the one that appears on page pp. 406 in [Pro61]. It is easy to check that
for any k ∈ N and each finite family of bounded closed intervals {[ai , bi ]}ki=1 ,
the set defined by
k
\
{x ∈ X : ai ≤ πmi (x) ≤ bi } ,
i=1

is a cylindrical set. Indeed, we have

By Lemma 3 in [Pro61], we can guarantee that a family of Borel probability
measures (μs )s∈S on X results in a tight family if, and only if, for any ǫ > 0
there exists a compact set Kǫ ⊂ X and a finite family of linear functionals Λk
(which we choose as defined by (16)), such that, for each s ∈ S it is satisfied
the inequality
μs (Π−1
(18)
Λk (ΠΛk (Kǫ ))) > 1 − ǫ .
In the following Lemma, we show that any cylindrical set of the form (17)
satisfies a kind of upper Gibbs inequality. This will be one of the main tools to
prove the existence of accumulation points for the family of equilibrium states.
15

Lemma 2. Consider a bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X) and a
Qk
collection of Borel sets {Ek }k≥1 of the form Ek = i=1 [ai , bi ], where (ai )i≥1 is
a strictly decreasing sequence of real numbers and (bi )i≥1 is a strictly increasing
sequence of real numbers with a1 < b1 . Then, there is a constant C > 1, such
that, for each k ∈ N and any x
e belonging to the cylindrical set CΛk (Ek ) it is
satisfied the following inequality
μA (CΛk (Ek ))
≤C .
eSk A(ex)−k log(λA )

(19)

Furthermore, we have C = e4VT (A) .
Proof. In order to simplify our reasoning, we assume first that A is a normalized
potential and, after that, we prove the result for an arbitrary potential. The
above assumption guarantees that LA (1) = 1 and L∗A (μA ) = μA . Since CΛk (Ek )
is a closed subset of X, there exists a function φ ∈ C(X), such that,
1CΛk (Ek ) ≤ φ ≤ 1 .
Therefore, it follows that for any x
e ∈ CΛk (Ek ) it is satisfied

where VT (A) is given by (2). Therefore, it follows that
μA (CΛk (Ek ))
≤ eVT (A) .
eSk A(ex)

(20)

Now, assume that A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X) is not a normalized potential, we
consider its corresponding normalization
A = A + log(ψA ) − log(ψA ◦ T ) − log(λA ) ,

16

where the potential ψA ∈ Hb,α (X) and the value λA > 0 satisfy the equation
LA (ψA ) = λA ψA . It is easy to check that A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV T (X), LA (1) = 1
and μA = μA (see for instance [LMSV19]).
Note that for any k ∈ N and each x
e ∈ CΛk (Ek )
x) = Sk A(e
x) − k log(λA ) + log(ψA )(e
x) − log(ψA )(T k (e
x)) .
Sk A(e

Besides that, since LA (ψA ) = λA ψA , we have
Z
e(A+log(ψA ))(z+v) dν(z), v ∈ T −1 (x) .
elog(ψA ) =
z∈Ker(T )

Then, is not difficult to check that for any x, y ∈ X is satisfied | log(ψA )(x)−
log(ψA )(y)| < VT (A) (a similar reasoning to the one used in the case of the
function u in the proof of item a) of Theorem 1 in [LMSV19]). The above
implies that sup(log(ψA )) − inf(log(ψA )) ≤ VT (A) and VT (A) ≤ 3VT (A). Thus,
from (20), it follows immediately that
k
μA (CΛk (Ek ))
≤ eVT (A)+log(ψA )(ex)−log(ψA )(T (ex))
eSk A(ex)−k log(λA )
≤ eVT (A)+VT (A)

≤ e4VT (A) .
Hence, choosing the constant C as the value e4VT (A) , we get (19), and the
proof is finished.
Remark 2. Note that Lemma 2 guarantees that for any set Xi,j of the form
described by Definition 6, we have
μA (Xi,j )
≤ e4VT (A) .
eA(ex)−log(λA )
The above is true because Xi,j = π −1 ([−(j + 1), −j] ∪ [j, (j + 1)]. This
inequality will be of great importance in the proof of Theorem 2.
Take Λk as in (16). Now, we are able to present a collection of compact sets
{Kǫ : ǫ ∈ (0, 1)} satisfying (18) for the family of equilibrium states (μtA )t>1 .
Given k ∈ N and a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers (ni )i≥1 , we
define the sets

XΛk := x ∈ X : πl (x) = 0, l ∈
/ {m1 , ..., mk }

and

o
n
Kk := x ∈ X : |πmi (x)| ≤ nmi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k ∩ XΛk ⊂ X .

(21)

Therefore, the set Kk is a non-empty compact subset of the Banach space
X. Furthermore, it is not difficult to check that
Kk = Π−1

Now, we are able to present the proof of the second main result of this paper.

Proof of Theorem 2. First note that given k ∈ N, Λk = {πm1 , ..., πmk }, and
Y ⊂ X, we have
ΠΛk (Y ) = (πm1 (Y ), ..., πmk (Y ))
= (πm1 (Y ∩ XΛk ), ..., πmk (Y ∩ XΛk ))
= ΠΛk (Y ∩ XΛk ) .
Then, for each k ∈ N, the set Kk defined in (21) satisfies

Consider the potential B ≡ 0 which obviously belongs to the set Hα (X) ∩
SV(X). It is easy to check that LB (1) = 1, and this implies that log(λB ) = 0.
Then, by Theorem 1, it follows that
0 = hν (μB ) .
Now, define
I :=

By the above and Theorem 1, it follows that

Therefore, by (19), for any pair i, j ∈ N and all x ∈ Xi,j

= et(A(x)−I)−(log(λtA )−tI)+4tVT (A)
≤ et(A(x)−I+4VT (A))
≤ et(sup{A(x): x∈Xi,j }−I+4VT (A)) .
Now, by (6), it follows that for each i ∈ N
lim sup{A(x) : x ∈ Xi,j } = −∞ .

j→+∞

The above implies the existence of ji ∈ N, such that, for any j ≥ ji we have
sup{A(x) : x ∈ Xi,j } − I + 4VT (A) < 0 ,
which implies that
μtA (Xi,j ) ≤ esup{A(x): x∈Xi,j }−I+4VT (A) .

From the above reasoning it follows that the family of equilibrium states
(μtA )t>1 is tight (for more details see Lemma 3 in [Pro61]). Therefore, it follows
from the Prohorov's Theorem the existence of a sequence (tn )n≥1 , such that,
the sequence of equilibrium states (μtn A )n≥1 is convergent, with a limit denoted
by μ∞ (see for instance [Bil99, Pro56]).
It is important to point out that the limits of different subsequences do not
have necessarily to be the same.
Remark 3. In the case that Ker(T n ) = span{e1 , ..., en } the condition (6) can
be replaced by the condition

esup{A(x): x∈X1,n } < +∞ .

Note that in this case, the summability only depends on the behavior of the
first component of x with respect to the Schauder basis (ek )k≥1 . For example,
this property is satisfied in the case of weighted shifts.

3.3

Maximizing measures

In this section, we will show the existence of maximizing measures, associated
with a certain class of potentials, in the framework of linear dynamical systems
on Banach spaces of infinite dimension. This will be achieved under two different
assumptions. First, we prove that the so-called ground states, whose existence
was obtained in section 3.2, are maximizing measures. This will be proved for
potentials A satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 2. After that, we prove the
existence of maximizing measures under the assumption that the potential A
satisfies the maximizing property (see Definition 8). In these two cases, it will
follow (see Lemma 5) that the Mañé potential only takes non-positive values,
which is one of the main requirements which will be used in the proof of Theorem
3.
The following Lemma guarantees the existence of maximizing measures under the conditions of Theorem 2.
Lemma 3. Assume that μ∞ is a ground state obtained from the existence
claimed by Theorem 2. Then, we have that μ∞ ∈ Pmax (A).
Proof. The proof of this Lemma follows from Theorem 1 and the fact that
hν (μ) ≤ 0, for any μ ∈ PT (X). Indeed, it is not difficult to check that m(A) =
limt→+∞ log(λt tA ) (see for instance [BCL+ 11, LMMS15]). Therefore, for any

20

μ ∈ Pσ (X) we have

m(A) = lim

n∈N

X

The above implies that μ∞ ∈ Pmax (A).
In the next Lemma, we also guarantee the existence of maximizing measures,
but in this case, we assume the so-called maximizing property.
Lemma 4. Consider a potential A ∈ Hα (X) satisfying the maximizing property
and let Y, Z be the subspaces of X satisfying (8) and (9). If
Y = span{v, ..., T k−1 (v)}
for some periodic point v ∈ X of period k, it follows that Pmax (A) 6= ∅.
Proof. Consider subspaces Y, Z ⊂ X satisfying the hypothesis of this Lemma.
Note that under these assumptions all the points in the subspace Y are periodic
points of period k.
Given a point x ∈ X, consider the values
mn (A, x) :=

1
Sn A(x)
n

and
m(A, x) := lim sup mn (A, x) .
n→+∞

It is not difficult to verify that m(A) ≤ supx∈X m(A, x) (see for instance
[JMU07]). Moreover, m(A, xy ) = mk (A, xy ) ≤ m(A), when xy belongs to Y .
Indeed, this is true because m(A, xy ) is the value of the integral of A with
Pk−1
respect to the periodic measure k1 j=0 δT j (xy ) .
From the limit in (9), there is a constant M > 0, such that for each x ∈ X
with kxy k > M ,
m(A, xy ) < m(A) − 1 .
(25)
Define the set XM := {x ∈ X : kxy kX ≤ M }. Note that given a point
x ∈ XM , we can express such point as x = xy + xz where xy ∈ Y has norm less
than or equal to M and xz ∈ Z, i.e. XM = YM + Z, where YM := {y ∈ Y :
kykX ≤ M }. On other hand, since any point in Y is a periodic point of period
k, it follows that
k−1
+∞
[
[
T j (YM ) ,
(26)
T j (YM ) =
Y0 :=
j=0

j=0

21

which implies that the set Y0 ⊂ Y is compact and invariant by the action of T .
Note that for each x ∈ X, such that, xy ∈ Y \ Y0 , it is valid the inequality
kxy k > M , which implies (25). Thus, taking supremum on all the points xy ∈
Y \ Y0 and using (8), we obtain that
m(A, x) ≤

sup
x∈X
xy ∈Y \Y0

sup

m(A, xy ) ≤ m(A) − 1 .

(27)

xy ∈Y \Y0

On other hand, we have
sup m(A, x) ≤ sup m(A, xy ) ≤ m(A) ,

(28)

xy ∈Y0

x∈X
xy ∈Y0

where the first one of the inequalities is a consequence of (8) and the second
one follows from the fact that all the points belonging to the T -invariant set Y0
are in fact periodic points of period k.
By inequalities (27) and (28), we have supx∈X m(A, x) ≤ m(A). Therefore,
using that m(A) ≤ supx∈X m(A, x) (see for instance [JMU07]), it follows that
sup m(A, x) = m(A)
x∈X

Furthermore, by (8), we have
sup m(A, x) = sup m(A, xy ) = m(A)

x∈X

xy ∈Y0

The above guarantees the existence of a maximizing measure supported on
the compact set Y0 , which in fact is the limit in the weak* topology of periodic
measures supported on periodic points belonging to Y0 .
Note that Lemmas 3 and 4 imply that Pmax (A) is a non-empty set. We claim
that it will follow from all of the above that the Mañé potential is well-defined
(there exist a finite supremum in expression (12)) and only takes non-positive
values.
Lemma 5. Assume that Pmax (A) is a non-empty set. Then,
Sn (A − m(A)) ≤ 0 .

(29)

In particular, the Mañé potential φA associated with A is well-defined and
takes only takes values in the set [−∞, 0].
Proof. Assume that the potential
A satisfies the first condition of the Lemma.
P
n −α
Since we are assuming that +∞
p(T
) < +∞, it follows that the dynamics
n=1
T is Devaney chaotic, which implies that
sup m(A, x) =

sup
x∈Per(X)

22

m(A, x) ≤ m(A) ,

(30)

where Per(X) is the set of periodic points of X. Moreover, the last inequality in
(30) follows from the fact that for any periodic orbit {v, ..., T k−1 (v)} is satisfied
the inequality
Z

k−1

δT j (v) ≤ m(A) .

Thus, by (30), we get (29).

3.4

An example: weighted shifts

In this section, we present particular cases where the assumptions of Theorem
1 are true. We will consider the so-called weighted shifts in this section (see for
details [BM09, BCD+ 18, BM20, GP11, LMSV19]).
Consider the normed space c0 (R) which is the set of sequences of real numbers (xn )n≥1 satisfying limn→+∞ xn = 0 equipped with the norm

normed space lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞, which is the set of sequences satisP+∞

c0 (R) and lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞, are separable Banach spaces which are
equipped with the Schauder basis (ek )k≥1 , where ek = (δik )i≥1 . Moreover, in
the case 1 < p < +∞, the space lp (R) is reflexive as well.
Consider c, c′ ∈ R satisfying 0 < c < c′ and a sequence (αn )n≥1 , such that,
αn ∈ (c, c′ ) for each n ∈ N. For each pair of natural numbers k, n define
βkn := αk . . . αk+n−1 .
Now, fixing the number n, define
dn := inf{βkn : k ∈ N} .
The weighted shift L : X → X, where X = c0 (R) or X = lp (R), 1 ≤
p < +∞, is given by the linear map L((xn )n≥1 ) = (αn xn+1 )n≥1 . It is wellknown that the asymptotic behavior of the values βkn characterize the topological
properties of the weighted shift L (see Remark 1 in [LMSV19] and [BM09,
BCD+ 18, BM20, GP11] for details). Indeed, taking p(Ln ) = dn , for each
N,
P n ∈ −α
the map p satisfies definition (1). Thus, the convergence of the series +∞

to a real number implies that the weighted shift L is Devaney chaotic and
topologically transitive.

The next Propositions are a consequence of the main Theorems of this paper;
under some strong assumptions in the values βkn and dn .
Proposition 1. Let X be c0 (R) or lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞, and L : X → X a
weighted shift. Assume also that one of the following conditions is satisfied:
1

i) limn→+∞ (dn )− n ;
P+∞ n −1
ii) sup
: k ∈ N < +∞.
n=1 (βk )

Then, for each bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV L (X) the Gibbs
state μA associated with A satisfies
Z
log(λA ) = hν (μA ) +
AdμA = Pν (A) .
X

Proof. By Lemma 2 in [LMSV19], items i) and ii) are equivalent to the property
P
+∞
−α
< +∞. Thus, our claim follows from Theorem 1. Indeed, this is
n=1 (dn )
true because p(Ln ) = dn , for each n ∈ N.
Proposition 2. Let X be c0 (R) or lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞, and L : X → X a
weighted shift. Assume also one of the following conditions:
1

i) limn→+∞ (dn )− n ;
P+∞ n −1
ii) sup
: k ∈ N < +∞.
n=1 (βk )

Then, for any bounded above potential A ∈ Hα (X) ∩ SV L (X), satisfying the
summability condition, the family of equilibrium states (μtA )t>1 has accumulation points at infinity which belongs to the set Pmax (A).
Proof. The proof follows the same reasoning already used in the proof of Proposition 1.
Remark 4. Note that Proposition 2 implies the existence of maximizing measures in the setting of weighted shifts which, in particular, will guarantee that
the Mañé potential is well-defined by Lemma 5.

Existence of sub-actions and some examples

In this section Theorem 3 will be proved. We will also present some properties
of the Mañé potential and, moreover, we will show some explicit examples where
calibrated sub-actions and maximizing measures do exist. Moreover, we show
an explicit example in which there is selection at zero temperature. The first
one of our examples concerns the existence of a calibrated sub-action in the
framework of weighted shifts on the space l1 (R). The other examples concern
the uniqueness of the maximizing measure for potentials defined on weighted
shifts in the spaces c0 (R) and lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞.

4.1

The Mañé potential

In this Subsection, we present the proof of Theorem 3 and also some results
concerning the behavior of the Mañé potential. We will adapt for the Linear
dynamics framework results from [GL08].
We assume throughout this section that X is a separable Banach space,
T : X → X is a bounded linear operator surjective, but not bijective. We also
assume
that for each value of n, we get X = Ker(T n ) ⊕ En , with En+1 ⊂ En ,
P+∞
and n=1 p(T n )−α < +∞.

Proof of Theorem 3. Fix a certain point x ∈ X. We want to prove that the
map φA (x, *) is a sub-action. In order to do that, fixing another point y ∈ X,
we consider ǫ > 0, n ∈ N, and x′ ∈ T −n (y), such that, kx − x′ kX < ǫ. Then, we
get
Sn+1 (A − m(A))(x′ ) = Sn (A − m(A))(x′ ) + A(y) − m(A) .
(31)
Since T n+1 (x′ ) = T (y), taking supremum in (31), first in the left side, and,
after that in the right side, we obtain
sup

sup

m∈N x′ ∈T −m (T (y))
kx−x′ kX <ǫ

Sm (A−m(A))(x′ ) ≥ sup

sup

n∈N x′ ∈T −n (y)
kx−x′ kX <ǫ

Sn (A−m(A))(x′ )+A(y)−m(A) .

Taking the limit, when ǫ goes to 0, in both sides of the above inequality, it
follows that
φA (x, T (y)) ≥ φA (x, y) + A(y) − m(A) .
That is, the map φA (x, *) is a sub-action.
On other hand, taking supremum in (31), first on the right side, and after
that on the left side, and subsequently, taking the limit when ǫ goes to 0, we
obtain that
φA (x, T (y)) ≤ φA (x, y) + A(y) − m(A) .
Therefore, φA (x, *) is a calibrated sub-action. The above shows that the
potential A is cohomologous to the constant m(A), via the Mañé potential.
On other hand, we will get that φA (x, *) ∈ Hα (X), as a consequence of the
assumption A ∈ Hα (X). Indeed, given ǫ > 0 and y 1 , y 2 ∈ X, it follows that
for each n ∈ N, x1 ∈ T −n (y 1 ) and x2 ∈ T −n (y 2 ), satisfying kx − x1 kX < ǫ and
kx − x2 kX < ǫ, we have

25

Sn (A − m(A))(x1 ) ≤ Sn (A − m(A))(x2 ) +

p(T n )−α ky 1 − y 2 kα
X .

Thus, taking the supremum on x1 and x2 , after that, taking the supremum
on all the natural numbers n, and, finally, taking the limit when ǫ goes to 0 in the first and in the second one - on the above expressions, we get
φA (x, y 1 ) ≤ φA (x, y 2 ) + Holα
A

+∞
X

n=1


p(T n )−α ky 1 − y 2 kα

In an analogous way, we can also prove that
φA (x, y 2 ) ≤ φA (x, y 1 ) + Holα
A

+∞
X

n=1


p(T n )−α ky 1 − y 2 kα
X .

The above implies that φA (x, *) ∈ Hα (X), and, in particular, φA (x, y) ∈ R,
for each y ∈ X, and this is the end of the proof.
Now, we present an interesting property of the Mañé potential. The proof is
valid on the general framework of Linear Dynamics on Banach spaces of infinite
dimension. It shows a relation of the Mañé potential with a general subaction V .
Analogous results on the framework of classical ergodic optimization appeared
in [CLT01] and [GL08].
Proposition 3. Suppose that the potential A ∈ Hα (X) and Pmax (A) is a nonempty set. Let V ∈ Hα (X) be a general sub-action for A ∈ Hα (X), and φA the
Mañé potential for A. Then, for any pair of points x, y ∈ X we get
φA (x, y) ≤ V (y) − V (x) .

(32)

Proof. Fix the points x, y ∈ X. First note that for any point x′ ∈ X, we have
′ α
|V (x) − V (x′ )| ≤ Holα
V kx − x kX .

Moreover, since V is sub-action, it follows that for each n ∈ N it is also
satisfied the inequality
V (T n (x′ )) − V (x′ ) ≥ Sn (A − m(A))(x′ ) .
26

Then, given ǫ > 0, n ∈ N and x′ ∈ T −n (y), such that, kx − x′ kX < ǫ, we
have
V (y) − V (x) = V (T n (x′ )) − V (x)
′ α
≥ V (T n (x′ )) − V (x′ ) − Holα
V kx − x kX
α
> Sn (A − m(A))(x′ ) − Holα
Vǫ .

Therefore, taking the supremum among all the points x′ ∈ T −n (y), satisfying
that kx − x′ kX < ǫ, and, after that, taking the supremum among all natural
numbers n, and, finally, taking the limit when ǫ goes to 0, we get (32).

4.2

Explicit examples of sub-actions and uniqueness of
maximizing measure

In this Subsection, we present explicit examples of a calibrated sub-actions
associated with bounded above Hölder continuous potentials. In some examples,
we guaranteed selection at temperature zero temperature.
Example 2. For fixed c > 1, consider the operator L : l1 (R) → l1 (R) given by
L((xn )n≥1 ) := (c xn+1 )n≥1 .
Taking v := (c−n+1 )n≥1 , it follows that for any α ∈ R we get
L(αv) = αL(v) = αv .
That is, αv is a fixed point for L for each α ∈ R. Consider the unbounded
Hölder continuous potential
A(x) := − kx − vkl1 (R) .
It follows that the delta Dirac measure δv is the unique maximizing probability
measure for A and m(A) = 0.
We want to find a sub-action associated with the potential A i.e. a function
V such that for all x is satisfied
V (L(x)) ≥ A(x) + V (x).

(33)

Assuming that c = 2 and taking V (x) := A(x), for each x ∈ l1 (R), we want
to show that (33) is true. Note that for x = (xn )n≥1 ∈ l1 (R) we have
kx − vkl1 (R) =

Then, V is a sub-action for A, because

Furthermore, this sub-action V is calibrated. Indeed, given a sequence y =
(yn )n≥1 in l1 (R), the L-preimages x of the point y are of the form
x = (xn )n≥1 = x1 ,

Taking x
e := 1, y21 , y22 , ... , we get

The next examples present cases in which it can be guaranteed selection at
zero temperature - for a Hölder continuous potential - defined on the spaces of
sequences c0 (R) and lp (R), 1 ≤ p < +∞.
Example 3. For fixed c > 1 and either X = lp (R) or X = c0 (R), consider the
operator L : X → X given by
L((xn )n≥1 ) := (c xn+1 )n≥1 .
Taking v := (c−n+1 )n≥1 , it follows αv is a fixed point for each α ∈ R.
Consider a monotonous decreasing 1-Hölder continuous function r from [0, 1]
into R, such that, r(0) = 1 and suppose lims→+∞ r(s) = 0. Consider the
potential
A(x) := − r(kx − vkX ) kx − vkX .
It follows that A ∈ H1 (X), moreover, the delta Dirac measure δv is the
unique maximizing probability measure for A and m(A) = 0. Therefore, there
exists selection of probability at zero temperature.

28

Example 4. For fixed c0 , c1 > 1 and either X = lp (R) or X = c0 (R), consider
the operator L : X → X given by
L((xn )n≥1 ) := (ci xn+1 )n≥1 ,
where i ∈ {0, 1} is the unique number such that n = 2k + i for some k ∈ N ∪ {0}.
Then,
L2 ((xn )n≥1 ) = (c0 c1 xn+2 )n≥1 .
Taking
v := (1, 0, (c0 c1 )−1 , 0, (c0 c1 )−2 , 0, (c0 c1 )−3 , 0, ...)
and
w := (0, c0 (c0 c1 )−1 , 0, c0 (c0 c1 )−2 , 0, c0 (c0 c1 )−3 , 0, ...) ,
it follows that L(v) = w and L2 (v) = v i.e. v and w are periodic points of period
two for the map L. Given α1 , α2 , the points of the form α1 v + α2 w are points
of period two, which generate a linear subspace of periodic points of period two.
Consider the potential
A(x) := −[r( kx − vkX )kx − vkX + r( kx − wkX )kx − wkX ] ,
where r was defined above.
We have that A ∈ H1 (X), the periodic orbit {v, w} of period two is such
that 1/2 δv + 1/2 δw , and it is the unique maximizing probability measure for the
potential A and m(A) = 0.
Example 5. For fixed c > 1, and either for X = lp (R) or X = c0 (R), consider
the operator L : X → X given by
L((xn )n≥1 ) := (c xn+1 )n≥1 .
Denote W ⊂ X the infinite-dimensional vector space of the form
W := { (x1 , 0, x2 , 0, ..., 0, xn , 0, ...) : x ∈ X} .
Define the potential
A(x) := −r(dX (x, W )) dX (x, W ) ,
where r was defined above and dX (x, W ) := inf{kx − wkX : w ∈ W }. Then,
A ∈ H1 (X) and any μ ∈ PL (X), with support contained in W , is maximizing
for A. For instance, the probability measure tδv + (1 − t)δL(v) , t ∈ (0, 1), where
v := (1, 0, c−2 , 0, c−4 , 0, ..., 0, c−2n , 0, ...) ,
is a maximizing measure for the potential A.
