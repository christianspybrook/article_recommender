ABSTRACT
Dwarf carbon (dC) stars, main sequence stars showing carbon molecular bands, are enriched by
mass transfer from a previous asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) companion, which has since evolved to
a white dwarf. While previous studies have found radial-velocity variations for large samples of dCs,
there are still relatively few dC orbital periods in the literature and no dC eclipsing binaries have yet
been found. Here, we analyze photometric light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility for a sample
of 944 dC stars. From these light curves, we identify 24 periodically variable dC stars. Remarkably, of
the periodic dCs, 80% have periods less than a day. We also provide spectroscopic follow-up for four
of these periodic systems, measuring radial velocity variations in three of them. Short-period dCs are
almost certainly post-common-envelope binary systems, since the periodicity is most likely related to
the orbital period, with tidally locked rotation and photometric modulation on the dC either from spots
or from ellipsoidal variations. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that these binaries may have taken
to accrete sufficient C-rich material while avoiding truncation of the thermally pulsing AGB phase
needed to provide such material in the first place. We compare these dCs to common-envelope models
to show that dC stars probably cannot accrete enough C-rich material during the common-envelope
phase, suggesting another mechanism like wind-Roche lobe overflow is necessary. The periodic dCs in
this paper represent a prime sample for spectroscopic follow-up and for comparison to future models
of wind-Roche lobe overflow mass transfer.

1. INTRODUCTION

Carbon (C) stars are those that show molecular absorption bands of C, such as C2 , CN and CH, in their
optical spectra (Secchi 1869). Intrinsic C stars have experienced C enrichment via dredge-up of fusion products from their cores. During the thermally pulsing
(TP) phase of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), shell
He flashes cause strong convection in the shell regions
bringing C into the atmosphere - the third dredge-up.

If the C/O ratio increases above unity, a giant C star
is formed, since C preferentially binds with oxygen to
form CO, leaving excess C to form the C molecules of
C2 , CN and CH. Thus, it was long thought that all C
stars were giants on the TP-AGB.
This made it quite surprising when Dahn et al. (1977)
found the first main-sequence C star, G77-61. This
dwarf carbon (dC) star cannot have yet experienced fusion to create C enhancement, or the third dredge-up, as
it is a main-sequence star. Dahn et al. (1977) put forth
a few explanations of this C enhancement on the mainsequence, with the favored being that G77-61 was in a
binary system and had experienced C enhanced mass
transfer from a previous AGB companion. This former AGB companion would since have become a white

dwarf (WD) and cooled until no longer detectable alongside the dC. Indeed this seemed to have been confirmed
when Dearborn et al. (1986) found G77-61 to be a radial
velocity (RV) binary with an orbital period of 245.5 d.
Today, G77-61 is no longer the only known dC, with
close to 1000 known in the literature. The majority of
these dCs come from the Green (2013) and Si et al.
(2014) samples which were found from all-sky spectroscopic surveys. This has included almost a dozen "smoking gun" systems in which the WD companion is sufficiently hot to be visible in the optical spectra as a spectroscopic composite (Heber et al. 1993; Liebert et al.
1994; Green 2013; Si et al. 2014). These samples have
shown that the dC stars are actually the most common
type of C star in the Galaxy.
Their carbon-enriched atmospheres make dCs the
most likely progenitors of the carbon-enhanced metalpoor, CH, and possibly the Ba II stars, all showing carbon and s-process enhancements (Jorissen et al. 2016;
De Marco & Izzard 2017). These stars, being more luminous than dCs, have been studied via RV campaigns,
which have shown increased binarity compared to normal O-rich stars, indicating they have likely also experienced mass transfer from an unseen companion (Sperauskas et al. 2016). Barium dwarfs and CH subgiants
show periods from RV analysis of 1–20 years (Escorza
et al. 2019).
Blue straggler stars are another class similar to dCs
in that they may have experienced mass transfer from a
previous AGB companion. As discussed by Gosnell et al.
(2019), blue straggler stars in a cluster color-magnitude
diagram are more luminous and bluer than the main sequence turnoff. While some are likely formed in mergers
or collisions, most blue straggler stars are thought, like
dC stars, to be the result of mass transfer from a giant to a main sequence dwarf. Most blue straggler stars
are found in wide binaries with periods of order 1000
days, consistent with expectations of mass transfer from
an AGB star onto a main-sequence companion (Chen &
Han 2008; Gosnell et al. 2014), which leaves a CO-core
WD remnant (Paczyński 1971). Those blue straggler
stars that form after mass transfer from an red giant
branch star, yields a blue straggler in a shorter binary
period (of order 100 days; Chen & Han 2008) leaving a
He-core WD companion. The salient point relevant to
dC stars is that significant mass is typically gained in
these encounters.
While dC stars are now known to be numerous, details of their properties remains sparse. This is especially true of their orbital properties. Currently, there
are only six orbital periods for dCs in the literature.
The first is of the dC prototype G77-61, found to be a

single-line spectroscopic binary with an orbital period
of 245.5 d (Dearborn et al. 1986). The central source of
the Necklace Nebula was found to be a binary with a
dC, which has a photometric period of 1.16 d (Corradi
et al. 2011; Miszalski et al. 2013). The three longest
period dCs in the literature are those from Harris et al.
(2018) who found astrometric binaries with periods of
1.23 yr, 3.21 yr, and 11.35 yr. The most recent dC period to be found was from Margon et al. (2018), who
found a photometric period of 2.92 d and confirmed this
as the orbital period with spectroscopic follow-up.
There have also been large sample few-epoch spectroscopy campaigns of dCs. Whitehouse et al. (2018)
conducted a few-epoch survey of 28 dCs finding RV variability in 21 of them, implying a high binary fraction.
Roulston et al. (2019) conducted a larger survey of 240
dCs using few-epoch spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Blanton et al. 2017). They found
that dCs are consistent with 100% binarity, with separations of order 1 au and periods of order 1 yr. Both
the Whitehouse et al. (2018) and Roulston et al. (2019)
surveys lacked enough spectral epochs to fit individual
orbits and instead relied on statistical analysis to describe the dC population as a whole.
de Kool & Green (1995) modeled the space density
of dCs, and they predicted the dC period to be bimodal with peaks near 102 –103 d and 103 –105 d, consistent with the known periods listed above. de Kool &
Green (1995) also found that the production of dCs is
strongly dependent on metallicity, finding no dCs should
be formed in systems with initial metallicity greater than
half of solar (i.e. [Fe/H]> −0.3). This is in agreement
with metallicity measurements of G77-61, where Plez &
Cohen (2005) found [Fe/H] = −4.0, making G77-61 one
of the lowest metallicity stars known. This also has been
supported by Farihi et al. (2018) who found 30–60% of
dCs to be halo objects, which are metal poor.
The known dC periods span from ∼ 1 d to ∼ 4100 d,
likely indicating different formation pathways. The
longest dC periods that are of order 10s of years likely
experienced only standard Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF)
or wind-RLOF (WRLOF). These periods are consistent
with other types of post-mass-transfer systems, such as
the blue straggler stars.
The dCs with periods . 1 d would have likely experienced common-envelope (CE) evolution (Paczynski
1976; Ivanova et al. 2013), since the TP-AGB envelope
expands to several 100s of solar radii. Of interest is how
CE evolution affects dC formation. From the known dC
periods, it is very likely that dCs with periods near a
few days or less will experience some form of CE during
the AGB phase of the evolved companion.

ZTF Variability in Dwarf Carbon Stars
Once the CE phase has started, the plunge-in of the
lower-mass companion (in our case, the future dC) could
truncate the evolution of the AGB by ejection of its envelope. If this happens before the TP-AGB phase and
the third dredge-up, it is likely that the C enhancement
needed for dC formation will not occur. However, if
the CE begins after the AGB companion has already
become a C-giant, then it may be possible for the mainsequence companion to accrete enough C-rich material
from the CE to become a dC (depending on the accretion efficiency). If the accretion efficiency is not high
enough, however, the main-sequence companion will not
accrete enough material from the CE alone, requiring
some combination of CE evolution with efficient mass
transfer before the CE phase that is sufficient to transform an O-rich main-sequence star into a C-rich dC.
Significant accretion of mass and angular momentum
from the AGB companion could result in significant
spin-up and subsequent activity in some dCs (Green
et al. 2019). If there are dCs left in very tight orbits
with the WD remnant, they may show tidally locked
rotation periods (synchronous rotation), as well as tidal
distortions causing ellipsoidal variations. A search for
periodicity in photometrically variable dCs could reveal
some systems useful for constraining their evolution.
Another motivation to study variability in dCs is that
no dC masses have yet been measured, because there
are no known eclipsing dC systems. We can estimate
dC masses from optical or infrared (IR) colors (see Section 6.2), but these estimates have uncharacterized systematics, due to differences between normal O-rich stars
and C stars in the optical and IR regions.
This lack of eclipsing dC systems highlights the importance of photometric surveys to search for the first
well-characterized eclipsing dC systems. These systems
could, when combined with RV follow-up, provide the
first reliable dC mass measurements, and help us understand more about the amount, and composition, of
accreted mass needed to form a dC.
Margon et al. (2018) conducted a search for periodic
dCs using the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; Law
et al. 2009; Rau et al. 2009), finding just one periodic dC.
However, they clearly highlighted the potential for large
photometric surveys to find periodic dCs, particularly
dCs with short periods that should have experienced
the strongest phases of CE mass transfer.
In this paper we report on a unique sample of close
binary dCs - implicating them as post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) and likely pre-CVs - discovered
from their periodic photometric variability in the Zwicky
Transient Facility. In Section 2 we describe the sample
of dCs we selected to search and in Section 3 we de-

tail our process for cleaning and preparing the raw light
curves. In Section 4 we describe our process for finding
which dCs have detected periodic signals. In Section 5
we present spectroscopic follow-up for four of the periodic dCs in this paper. Finally, in Section 6 we present
comparisons of these short period dCs to binary population synthesis models to understand how a commonenvelope phase relates to dC formation.
2. SAMPLE SELECTION

To search for variability in as many dCs as possible,
we compiled a list of all dCs from the current literature. The largest contributor is the Green (2013) sample of carbon stars from the SDSS. We also selected
a smaller number of dCs from Si et al. (2014) (who
found dCs using a label propagation algorithm from
SDSS DR8, yielding 96 new dC stars) and from Li et al.
(2018) (who selected carbon stars from the Large Sky
Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey (LAMOST; Cui et al. 2012) using a machine learning approach). Our resulting final sample consists of 944
dCs.
With our compiled sample, to ensure that any periodic candidate was indeed a dwarf carbon star, we used
Gaia DR2 parallaxes, proper motions (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and distances (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018).
We required that each periodic C star had MG > 5 mag
from Gaia DR2 based either on (1) significant parallax
$/$err > 5 (18/24 periodic dCs) or (2) a significant
proper motion (μ/σμ > 5) which sets an upper limit on
the dC distance by limiting its transverse velocity to be
less than an assumed Galactic escape velocity (Smith
et al. 2007) of about 600 km/s (6/24 periodic dCs).
3. LIGHT CURVE PROCESSING

Using our list of dCs, we cross-matched our sample to
the Zwicky Transient Facility DR3 (ZTF; Bellm et al.
2019; Masci et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019). We required a match to be within 200 of our target coordinates
and each star having ≥ 10 epochs in the available ZTF
filters.
From the resulting matches, we grouped all sources
detected within the match distance to our dC sample to
ensure all epochs for each dC were included. The final
sample of light curves resulted in 668 dCs with ZTF g
light curves, 712 dCs with ZTF r light curves, and 406
dCs with ZTF i light curves. We summarize the light
curve sample for each filter in Table 1.
For each light curve, we only used epochs for which
the ZTF flag catflags == 0 (no ZTF flags), ensuring
every epoch is of a high quality.
We checked for any epochs which appear to be discrepant by performing an outlier removal on all the

light curves. We first select from the raw light curve
the brightest and faintest 5% of epochs. Within these
brightest and faintest 5%, we calculate the median magnitude of each (i.e. the median of the 5% brightest and
5% faintest) and the mean error of that same brightest and faintest 5%. We then removed any outliers that
were 2σ brighter than the median of the brightest 5%,
and removed those 2σ fainter than the median of the
faintest 5%. If this selection dropped the number of
epochs below 10, we removed that light curve from our
analysis. This treament rejects most artifacts without
removing genuine astrophysical variability.
We checked the light curves for each dC, in each filter, to determine if each dC had detected variability by
examining how the mean magnitude changed across the
observed light curve time span. A number of dCs which
show no periodic variability in our analysis in Section 4
(and a few periodic dCs) show signs of non-periodic variability, as well as secular, long-term trends. These nonperiodic but variable dCs are of interest and may be
signs of flaring, variable obscuration, or perhaps accretion onto the WD companion. They warrant further
investigation, but we do not discuss them further in this
paper.
The light curves that show long-term trends of brightening or dimming on 100s of days timescales cause the
mean magnitude to vary over the entire time span of the
light curve. This variable mean magnitude can cause
issues with our period search. Therefore, we removed
these long term trends by fitting out a third-order polynomial to the raw light curve.
4. PERIODIC VARIABILITY

For each light curve, we searched for periodic signals
down to a minimum period of 0.1 d using the the LombScargle periodogram (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982). We
selected the highest peak, and if this peak corresponds
to an instrumental alias (1d, 29.5d, 1yr, etc.) or a harmonic of one of these aliases (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 2, 3, 4,
5), we removed that signal from the light curve and re-

calculated the periodogram until the highest-power frequency was not an alias (we counted a frequency not
as an alias if it was more than 150 frequency bins away
from the pure alias frequency, i.e. more than 0.005 d−1
away from an alias).
For the highest remaining peak, we calculated the
false-alarm probability (VanderPlas 2018). We required
that log (FAP) ≤ −5 in at least one filter for us to select
a specific dC as a periodic candidate, more conservative
than e.g., the log (FAP) ≤ −3 used in the recent ZTF
periodic variable catalog of Chen et al. (2020).
For the dCs which have light curves selected as periodic candidates, we checked for any possible harmonic
confusion in the found period. For each dC, in each
filter, we plot a power spectrum from the LS analysis.
This is used to determine how strong the highest-power
frequency is compared to the log (FAP) limit and the
background peaks. Figure 1 shows an example power
spectrum for an object with a very strong periodic signal and shows clear peaks (with 1-d aliasing) above the
background.
In some cases, the strongest peaks were aliases, typically harmonics of 1 month, that overwhelmed the power
spectrum. For these dCs, we inspected each power spectrum in conjunction with phased light curves. If another non-alias peak (i.e., with a frequency more than
0.005 d−1 away from an alias) was found in the power
spectrum meeting our FAP limit, that new peak was selected as the period for that dC. If no non-alias peaks
could be found, the dC candidate was removed from our
sample.
Some dCs show strong periodic signals in one filter,
but do not reach our FAP limit in the other available
filters. For these dCs, if one filter has a period that
meets our FAP limit and that period is visible in the
other filter, we include that second filter even if its FAP
does not meet our limit. This makes it possible for some
dCs to have a log (FAP) ≥ −5 in a filter if they have
log (FAP) ≤ −5 in another filter.
For all periodic dC candidates selected after inspection
of their power spectra, we plotted phased light curves
folded on the highest selected peak period. In addition,
we plotted 8 different harmonics of that period (1/2,
1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 2, 3, 4, 5) to check for aliases caused
by gaps in the observational coverage. Using this plot,
we calculated model-fit statistics (e.g., χ2 ) and selected
which period harmonic has the best model fit. We used
the best period to phase the light curve, to which we fit
the final periodic model.
Figure A1 (Appendix) shows the phased light curves
for all of the periodic dC candidates. Each light curve is
plotted twice in phase to clearly show the periodic vari-

Figure 1. Example light curve and power spectrum for the dC SDSS J151905.96+500702.9. This dC shows a clear and strong
signal at 3.3 d−1 (with 1-d aliasing) that stands out above the low noise background in the power spectrum. The red horizontal
line represents the peak height needed for a signal to meet our log (FAP) ≤ −5 criterion. Grey vertical dashed lines mark the 1-d
aliases caused by gaps in data collection, and the best period from our analysis is marked by an arrow. The highest significance

Section 4) is marked by the red solid line.

ability. The red line in each plot represents the best-fit
model (as described below) and the residuals are shown
below each light curve.
Our best-fit models were computed using the automatic Fourier decomposition (AFD) method, as detailed in Torrealba et al. (2015). We set an upper limit on the number of Fourier series terms of
nmax = 6 to reduce over-fitting. No significant nonharmonic terms were included; though one dC, LAMOST J062558.33+023019.4, showed different peaks in
its power spectrum between the g and r filters with the
second highest peak in each filter being the highest peak
in the other. The best AFD model was used to calculate
the amplitude and epoch of brightest time (t0 ) for each
light curve. We removed any dC for which the folded
light curve shows no clear periodic signal or for which
the amplitude of the variability was less than 0.005 mag.
Table 2 contains the properties for this final periodic
dC sample. We estimated errors for the best found
period using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method. For each dC, in each filter with a detected period, we started 50 MCMC walkers in a Gaussian around
the detected period. We sampled the walkers for 10,000
steps each, at each step using the phase dispersion minimization technique (Stellingwerf 1978) to calculate the
likelihood at each walker position. We used the 1σ of
the marginalized period distribution as the photometric
period error for that dC. However this is only a statis-

tical error, and does not account for the possibility that
we have selected an alias rather than the true period.
Our final dC sample contains 24 individual dCs that
are periodic in at least one ZTF filter. Given the wide
initial orbits necessary for progenitor dC systems to
avoid truncation of the TP-AGB phase before enough
C-rich material can be transferred, it is remarkable that
19 (80%) of these dCs have periods < 1 d, indicating
they should have experienced a common-envelope (CE)
phase. The likely origins of the variability in these dCs
include spot rotation on the dC or tidal distortion of the
dC atmosphere from being in a close orbit with a WD.
Since many of these dCs have short periods, we assume
that these systems would have experienced a CE phase
and have circularized and synchronized (Hurley et al.
2002). However, if the light curve variability is from the
dC being tidally distorted, our detected period would be
half the orbital period (even with 2× longer true orbital
periods, these systems should still have experienced a
CE phase). Tidal distortion should introduce a nonsinusoidal shape to the light curves. However, there is
little evidence of this in our sample, lending some evidence that most of the detected variability is probably
from spot rotation. Therefore, the origin of the variability in these dCs is not yet fully known without comparison to spectroscopic RV follow-up.

ZTF Variability in Dwarf Carbon Stars
5. SPECTROSCOPIC FOLLOW-UP

To constrain the origins of the photometric variability
we have begun spectroscopic follow-up of the periodic
dCs discovered here. We report spectroscopic follow-up
for four of these dCs: SDSS J151905.96+500702.9, SDSS
J123045.53+410943.8, LAMOST J062558.33+023019.4
(referenced further on as J1519, J1230, J0625 respectively) and SBSS 1310+561.
5.1. Spectroscopic Set-Up
The dCs J1519 and J1230 were observed with the Binospec spectrograph on the MMT telescope (Fabricant
et al. 2019). For all observations, we used the 0.8500 slit
with the 600 l mm−1 grating centered on 7250 Å, giving
coverage from 6000 Å to 8000 Å covering Hα and the
CN bands. The reduced spectra have a dispersion of
0.61 Å pix−1 with R≈3590. All Binospec data were reduced using the standard Binospec reduction pipeline1
(Kansky et al. 2019).
The dC J0625 was observed with the Magellan Echellette (MagE; Marshall et al. 2008) spectrograph on the
Magellan Baade Telescope. All observations used the
0.8500 slit and were reduced using the MagE reduction pipeline2 (Chilingarian 2020). The reduced spectra
cover from about 3200 Å to 10000 Å with R≈4500.
Observations for SBSS 1310+561 were acquired at
the 1.5m Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO)
telescope with the FAST spectrograph (Fabricant et al.
1998) using the 600 l mm−1 grating and the 1.500 slit,
which provides wavelength coverage from 6000 Å to
8000 Å at 1.5 Å spectral resolution.
5.2. SDSS J151905.96+500702.9
One of the more interesting dCs in our periodic sample, with photometric periodicity detected with highest
significance, is SDSS J151905.96+500702.9 (also known
as CBS 311; we use J1519 in the rest of this paper), a
dC+DA spectroscopic composite binary. J1519 was discovered by Liebert et al. (1994) and has been studied
on numerous occasions (Farihi et al. 2010; Green 2013;
Whitehouse et al. 2018; Ashley et al. 2019; Roulston
et al. 2019; Green et al. 2019). However, this is the first
reporting of its periodic variability.
J1519 (r = 17.3 mag) has four epochs of optical spectra in the SDSS, with the most recent spectrum shown in
the top panel of Figure 2. The spectrum of J1519 shows
a dC with a hot DA WD companion, as well as Hα emission. Whitehouse et al. (2018) and Roulston et al. (2019)

found RV variability using few-epoch spectroscopy with
∆RVmax of 46.8 ± 15.8 km s−1 and 44 ± 20 km s−1 ,
respectively. Farihi et al. (2010) conducted a study of
WD–red dwarf systems, including J1519, using the Hubble Space Telescope. They found J1519 to be unresolved,
placing the constraint on its separation of < 10 au.
5.2.1. J1519 WD Model Fits
Since J1519 is a spectroscopic dC+DA composite, we
can fit WD model atmospheres to the WD component
to fit Teff and log(g) using the SDSS spectra. Bédard
et al. (2020) fit WD models and found fit values of
31233±213 K and 7.97±0.05 respectively.
Farihi et al. (2010) found that spectroscopically fit
WD parameters are often biased due to a cool companion. To update the fits of Bédard et al. (2020), we
performed our own model atmosphere fits to the DA
component of J1519 using the synthetic WD model atmospheres of Levenhagen et al. (2017). We first fit the
late type dC (dCM) template of Roulston et al. (2020)
to the SDSS spectrum of J1519 by finding the best-fit
velocity, shifting the template, and then scaling it to the
flux near Hα. We then removed the dC spectrum from
the total spectrum, leaving just the WD component. We
then fit the visible Balmer lines from Hβ and blue-ward
to the entire grid of WD model spectra. We interpolated the grid of WD model spectra to include half-steps
in the model space. Our best-fitting model parameters
for Teff and log(g) were 31000±500 K and 7.85±0.05, respectively, and can be seen in Figure 2. The black line is
the single SDSS spectrum with the highest S/N shifted
to the rest-frame, and the blue line is the best fit WD
model spectrum. We did not use Hα for the WD fit as
the dC component contributes most to the spectrum in
emission. In addition, we did not use the H9 line, as
only half of the line is visible in the SDSS spectrum.
The WD temperature of our fit is in good agreement
with that of Bédard et al. (2020). However, our log(g) is
0.12 dex lower, resulting in both our WD mass and cooling age being lower than those in Bédard et al. (2020).
For the purposes of this paper, we adopt our fit values
of log(g) and Teff . The WD properties we use can be
found in Table 3, with the mass, radius, and cooling age
coming from the models of Fontaine et al. (2001).

5.2.2. J1519 Radial Velocities
Although RV variability has been detected in J1519,
there are no published RV orbital fits for this system.
Based on our photometric analysis, we found a period
of 0.30237 ± 0.00070 d (∼ 7 hr) for J1519. Therefore,
we conducted a spectroscopic monitoring of J1519 using

et al. (2001)

the MMT spectroscopic setup as was described in Section 5.1. On the nights of 2020 August 19 and 20, we
observed a sequence of 21×200 s exposures, on the night
of 2020 August 22 we observed 27×200 s exposures, and
on the nights 2021 April 21 and 23 we observed 24×230 s
exposures. The exposures on each night were then coadded in threes, resulting in seven final epochs on the
first two nights, nine epochs on the third night, and eight
on each of the last two nights for a combined total of 39
epochs (with about 600 s total exposure each), with an
average S/N ≈ 5 for all epochs in the continuum region
near Hα.
Since the full spectrum includes both stellar components, we measured the RV from the Hα emission line,
presumed to come from the dC atmosphere alone. First,
for each epoch, we re-scaled the late-type (dCM) dC
template of Roulston et al. (2020) to the flux in our
MMT spectrum in the region of 6300–6500 Å. We then
used this as the model for the dC continuum level of that
epoch, which was used to calculate the Hα emission line
center, equivalent width and associated errors. The RV
measurements have an average error of approximately
5 km s−1 , and the equivalent width measurements have
an average error of approximately 0.18 Å.
Figure 2 shows the measured RV (middle) and Hα
equivalent widths (bottom) for J1519. To fit the RV
curve, we used the rvfit program which uses a simulated adaptive annealing procedure, the details of which
can be found in Iglesias-Marzoa et al. (2015). We left
all parameters free to be fit, with the solution quickly
converging to a circular orbit. We therefore refit the RV
curve leaving all parameters free again except for the
eccentricity, which we fix to e = 0.0. The resulting bestfit model can be seen in Figure 2 (red curve) and the fit
parameters can be found in Table 4.
The best fitting orbital period from the RVs
(0.327526 ± 0.000012 d) is longer than the best photometric period by 0.02516 ± 0.00070 d (about 36 minutes). Fixing the period in the RV fitting procedure

to that of the photometric period results in a poorer
model fit, with the longer period model being a better fit at the 3.2σ level. The best-fit semi-amplitude of
K2 = 33.3±1.4 km s−1 (∆RVmax = 2K = 66.6 km s−1 )
is in agreement with the RV variations found by Whitehouse et al. (2018) and Roulston et al. (2019), as their
random epochs likely did not catch the true RV amplitude. However, the low measured semi-amplitude suggests an extremely low inclination of this system, with
i ≈ 10◦ if we take our estimated dC mass of 0.4 M from
Section 6.2.
One possible explanation for a longer orbital period
than photometric period is that J1519 was spun up by
the accretion that it experienced, and has not yet synchronized the rotation and orbital periods in the approximate 8 Myr since mass transfer stopped (assuming the
mass transfer ceased at the same time the WD formed).
Green et al. (2019) analyzed Chandra observations of
J1519 (as well as five other Hα emission dCs) and found
it to show X-ray emission consistent with having a short
rotation period, which would lend support to the accretion spin-up scenario. Deeper photometric imaging and
RV follow-up, particularly of the WD component, could
even better characterize this system. It is clear, however,
that this dC has both photometric and RV variability
on a <0.33-d timescale, indicating it most likely has a
short orbital period and formed through a CE event.
5.3. SDSS J123045.53+410943.8
Another interesting dC is SDSS J123045.53+410943.8
(J1230), whose SDSS spectrum is shown in Figure 3.
J1230 shows the C2 and CN lines typical of late type
dC stars, but also shows strong absorption lines of K
and a strong CaH band near 6800 Å. Additionally, this
dC shows strong emission lines of Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and
Ca H and K. Unlike J1519, there is no visible WD component in the spectrum of J1230.
We observed J1230 (r = 16.6 mag) with the Binospec
spectrograph on the 6.5m MMT using the setup described in Section 5.1. We took 6×266 s spectra on the
nights of 2021 February 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 15. This
resulted in a total of 42 spectra, with an average S/N
of 13 in the continuum region near Hα. We measured
the line center and equivalent widths of the Hα line, as
well as for the two K lines visible in our MMT spectra of
J1230. The emission and absorption lines have the same
velocities, indicating the are coming from the same region. We average these velocities to measure the RV for
each of the 42 epochs.
In the same method as J1519, we used the rvfit program to fit the RV curve of J1230. For this dC, we left
all parameters free for fitting, with the resulting best

Figure 2. TOP: SDSS spectrum for the dC+DA SDSS J151905.96+500702.9, in black. The hot WD is visible, as are the
carbon bands of C2 and CN. The spectrum also shows Hα emission. The best fitting model atmosphere to the DA component
of the dC+WD composite J1519 is shown in blue, with the inset to the right showing a zoomed-in, stacked view of the Balmer
lines used in the model fit (the black lines are the normalized flux of the WD component, and the blue lines are the best fitting
model atmosphere, dashed grey lines means that that Balmer line was not used in the fit due to poor quality). The resulting
dC component - simply the observed spectrum with the WD model subtracted - is shown in red. MIDDLE: RV as measured
from the Hα line for J1519, phased on the time of periastron passage from the RV fit, and the fit RV period of 0.327526 d. The
red solid line represents the best fitting model. BOTTOM: Equivalent widths measured from the Hα line, phased on the fit RV
period of 0.327526 d. The blue curve is the best-fit model to the data of a single sinusoid. The y-axis has been inverted so that
smaller equivalent width values (more emission) are up.

period fit matching that of the photometric light curve
(P = 0.8826 ± 0.0014 d). We, therefore, fix the period
to the photometric period and the eccentricity to 0.0,
and refit the RVs. The resulting best fit can be found
in Table 4 and the phased RV curve in Figure 3. As
with J1519, we find the parameter errors using a MCMC
method centered around the best fit parameters.
The best fit gives a circular orbit with a semiamplitude of K2 = 123.0 ± 0.7 km s−1 . If we use our
estimated dC mass from Section 6.2 (0.25 M ) and an
assumed WD mass of 0.6 M the implied inclination of
this system is around i = 55◦ .
The presence of multiple emission lines of H and Ca
may suggest that the photometric variability of J1230
may be coming from re-processing of the WD flux on
the surface of the dC. Even though the WD companion to J1230 is not hot enough to be seen in the optical
spectrum, it may be warm enough to still heat the surface of the dC. If this is true, we could expect the dC to
be at maximum brightness when the WD-facing side is
pointed toward us maximally, i.e. when the dC is moving transversely on the sky, between the ascending and

descending nodes. Comparing the light curve of J1230
to the RVs however shows this is not the case, as if it
were, we would expect the RV to be moving to the descending node after the photometric maximum, which
the RV curve for J1230 is 0.33 out of phase with. This
suggests that the photometric variability may not be
coming from re-processing, but rather from spot rotation on an active dC (with the emission lines indicating
chromospheric activity). We do note that the uncertainties on our epoch of maximum brightness and period
make it difficult for such precise comparison so many
cycles after our light curve t0 , which could cause us to
incorrectly predict the phase when our spectroscopy was
collected in 2021 February by up to 0.75 cycles. Followup photometry should improve the ephemeris and allow
a more confident comparison.
5.4. SBSS 1310+561

Figure 3. TOP: SDSS spectrum for the dC SDSS J123045.53+410943.8. The typical carbon bands of C2 and CN for late
type dCs are labeled. Additionally, clear and strong emission of Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and Ca H and K are visible. Middle: RV
as measured from the Hα and K I lines for SDSS J123045.53+410943.8, folded at the photometric period of 0.8826 d. The red
dashed line represents the best fitting model. Bottom: Equivalent widths measured from the Hα line, phased on the photometric
period. The blue curve is the best fit single sinusoid model to the data, while the grey dotted line is the average equivalent
width value. The y-axis has been inverted so that smaller equivalent width values (more emission) are up. We do not detect
any significant variation in phase for the equivalent width, to a limit of <1.50 Å.

and 6×300 s spectra on the night of 2021 February 12
for a total of 12 spectra with an average S/N of 32 in
the continuum region near Hα.
Unlike with our MMT and Magellan observations,
because of observing time constraints on our awarded
FAST time, these spectra were only observed close to
the quadrature phases based on the ZTF photometry
(P = 0.83867 ± 0.00066 d). We assumed that the photometric period corresponds to the orbital period, and
used t0 from the light curve to calculate the expected
times that SBSS 1310+561 should be at the quadrature
phases (φ = 0.25 and φ = 0.75). Our actual observations
were taken at phases φ = 0.59±0.02 and φ = 0.83±0.01
(these uncertainties only take into account the span of
phases the spectra were taken and not the uncertainty
from the light curve t0 , which may be substantial - up to
0.5 in phase after the approximately 460 orbits between
the light curve observations and the spectroscopy).
From these spectra, we measured the RV at φ = 0.59
to be Vr = 31.9 ± 7.5 km s−1 and the RV at φ = 0.83
to be Vr = −83 ± 11 km s−1 . Taking the difference
in these two velocities for this system (∆RV = 115 ±
13 km s−1 ) can place a lower limit on the semi-amplitude
of K2 > 57 ± 7 km s−1 . Using our estimated mass

from Section 6.2 (0.34M ) and an assumed WD mass
of 0.6 M , this constrains the inclination to i ≥ 24◦ (if
i = 60◦ , then we would expect K2 = 122 km s−1 ). Since
the phase difference between our two epochs is quite
small, this ∆RV suggests that SBSS 1310+561 is in a
tight orbit and is very likely a PCEB.
5.5. LAMOST J062558.33+023019.4
The dC LAMOST J062558.33+023019.4 (hereafter
J0625, r = 13.9 mag) was observed on the nights of 2021
January 11 and 12 using the Magellan MagE instrument
setup described in Section 5.1. Each night, we observed
15×300 s exposures. The final reduced spectra consists
of 30 epochs with an average S/N of 22 each in the continuum region near Hα.
Using the Hα emission line, we measured the RV of
J0625 for each epoch. We found no evidence for RV
variability, nor any variability in Hα equivalent width.
We found the RV to vary with only a standard deviation
of 3.9 km s−1 , and with a maximum ∆RV = 12.1 ± 3.2
km s−1 . In addition, cross-correlation of the spectra
across epochs resulted in no significant measured RV
variations. Using our estimated mass from Section 6.2
(0.84 M ) and an assumed WD mass of 0.6 M , this

places a constraint on the inclination of i ≤ 7◦ (if
i = 60◦ , then we would expect K2 = 44 km s−1 ). This
may suggest that the photometric variability is not related to the orbital period in this system since such a
low inclination (and low semi-amplitude) is unlikely if
the photometric period of 7.5942 d represents the orbital
period. Hence, this system adds weight to the evidence
that the photometric variability in dCs may often be
due to spot rotation.
6. COMMON ENVELOPE CONNECTION

For the progenitor of the dC companion to become a
C giant, it must enter the third-dredge up phase (Iben
1974). AGB stars have a degenerate CO core with a
double-shell (moving outward from the core) of helium
and hydrogen. As the hydrogen shell (which produces
most of the energy) continues to fuse H into He, the
helium shell surrounding the core continues to grow.
Eventually, the helium shell experiences runaway fusion,
driving expansion of the envelope material above. This
He-shell "flash" and expansion means the star is now
in the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phase. Helium shell fusion causes the inter-shell region to become
strongly convective, dredging helium fusion products to
the surface, i.e., the third dredge-up. As the expansion
continues, the pressure in the helium shell will drop,
eventually stopping its energy production. The layers
contract again with hydrogen shell fusion resuming, and
the cycle repeats.
Each successive thermal pulse becomes stronger,
reaching deeper into the intershell zone, and the stellar radius increases (Iben & Renzini 1983). As helium

11

shell fusion products are brought to the surface, it is
possible that the envelope carbon abundance increases
until C/O > 1. Since C preferentially binds with O, C2
and CN bands only appear when C/O> 1, forming a C
giant star.
AGB stars going through the TP-AGB phase can
reach radii of 800 R (3.7 au) as they experience successively stronger thermal pulses (Marigo et al. 2017). Assuming an AGB mass of 2.5 M , AGB radius of 800 R ,
and a dC mass of 0.4 M , this system would experience
the beginning of a common-envelope (CE) with an initial period of ≈ 4.2 yr (if the dC mass is 1.0 M instead,
then P≈ 3.8 yr). Therefore, dCs with initial periods
≈ 4 yr (1500 d) or less will very likely have experienced
a CE phase, corresponding to the shorter-period peak
modeled by de Kool & Green (1995). The dCs in this
paper with P< 1 d are most certainly the result of a CE
spiral-in. Of the six dC periods in the current literature,
two of them have P< 3 d, so have likely experienced a
CE. It seems then that many dCs may have experienced
a CE phase.
Dell'Agli et al. (2021) recently studied the extreme
AGB stars (those AGB stars which have extremely red
mid-IR colors, e.g. Gruendl et al. 2008) and showed that
the the excess dust and outflow densities of these stars
may be explained by envelope stripping in a CE event.
Their models suggest that these extreme AGB stars are
actually post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) with
orbital periods of order 1 d, matching the periods for dCs
in our sample. Dell'Agli et al. (2021) also found that
the CE in their models starts after the rapid growth
of the AGB radius, once the C/O ratio increases past
unity, which corresponds well with the requirements for
producing the short-period dCs we find. This makes
these extreme AGB stars potential progenitors systems
of the dCs that are in the CE phase currently.
However, is mass accretion during a CE phase the
most likely mass transfer mechanism to form dCs? We
can address this question by looking at our periodic dC
sample in the context of models that simulate expected
binary populations.
6.1. Binary Population Synthesis Models
We used the binary population synthesis (BPS) models of Toonen & Nelemans (2013) to see if the observed
population of dCs can be reproduced by theory. The
full details of the BPS models can be found in Toonen
& Nelemans (2013) and are briefly described here.
These BPS models were created using the SeBa
(Portegies Zwart & Verbunt 1996; Nelemans et al. 2001;
Toonen et al. 2012; Toonen & Nelemans 2013) population synthesis code. This code generates an initial pop-

12

Roulston et al.

ulation of binaries and simulates their evolution, taking
into account processes such as stellar winds, magnetic
breaking, mass transfer, common-envelope, and angular
momentum loss. The initial stellar population is generated from the classical BPS distributions found in Toonen & Nelemans (2013) via a Monte Carlo method. The
resulting binaries are then convolved with a Galactic
model including a star formation history that depends
on time and location in the Milky Way based on Boissier
& Prantzos (1999) so that the simulated binaries can be
compared to our observed sample.
For the synthetic populations used here, the commonenvelope phase is modeled on the basis of the energy
budget i.e. the classical α-formalism of Tutukov & Yungelson (1979). We discuss the results of two different
models here that account for two different CE efficiencies: model αα and αα2 which have αλ of 2 and 0.25,
respectively. The parameter λ is the structure parameter of the envelope to calculate the envelope binding
energy (Paczynski 1976; Webbink 1984; de Kool et al.
1987; Livio & Soker 1988; de Kool 1990; Xu & Li 2010).
The α parameter describes the efficiency with which orbital energy is consumed to unbind the CE. A smaller
value of α implies less efficient usage of orbital energy,
and therefore a stronger shrinkage of the orbital period
during the CE-phase. We do not consider the orbital
angular momentum method of Nelemans et al. (2000),
as this model does not reproduce the observed characteristics of the general PCEB (WD/main sequence) population (Toonen & Nelemans 2013).
Furthermore, the BPS models here allow for accretion during the common-envelope phase. The accretion
rate is limited by the thermal timescale of the accretor
times a factor that is dependent on the stellar radius and
the corresponding Roche lobe (Portegies Zwart & Verbunt 1996; Toonen et al. 2012) following Kippenhahn
& Meyer-Hofmeister (1977); Neo et al. (1977); Packet
& De Greve (1979); Pols & Marinus (1994). The total
accreted mass is then given by the integral of the accretion rate times the timescale of the CE event, which
here is taken to be 100 yr. This timescale is consistent
with hydrodynamical simulations (Ricker & Taam 2008;
Ivanova et al. 2013) and observations of hot subdwarf
binaries (Igoshev et al. 2020), although cataclysmic variables may suggest a longer CE timescale, up to 104 yr
(Michaely & Perets 2019; Igoshev et al. 2020).
6.2. BPS Comparison to Observed dC Sample
We use the resulting model population for a direct
comparison to our observed sample of short-period dCs,
assuming the photometric period is the current orbital
period. To do this, we estimated dC masses based on

their infrared absolute magnitude MK in the K band.
Comparisons of M dwarf spectra (Ivanov et al. 2004)
to C star spectra (Tanaka et al. 2007) reveal them to
be much more similar in the infrared than in the optical region. We used Ks band (2.159 μm) magnitudes
from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006). Six of our periodic dCs do not have Ks
band magnitudes. For these, we first fit Gaia absolute
G band (MG ) to the dCs that do have Ks band magnitudes. This fit was then used to convert the Gaia MG
into MKs for the dCs lacking Ks band magnitudes. We
then fit MKs for our dCs to stellar masses using data
from Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007). This fitting also provides us with bolometric luminosities for the dCs in our
sample. Comparing our bolometric luminosities to those
provided in Green et al. (2019) (who used a spectral energy distribution method fitting 0.35 − 12.5 μm) for the
four dCs that overlap, we find our luminosities agree
within 3%, indicating our dC mass estimates should be
reliable.
Our mass estimates can be found in Table 5. We find
that none of our dCs are fit with masses > 1 M or
< 0.2 M , in agreement with the range for which detectable C2 , CN, and CH bands are expected. We note
that some of the lowest mass dCs may have been brown
dwarfs or even planets before they accreted significant
C-enriched material from their former AGB companion.
Using the mass-radius relationship for main-sequence
stars of Eker et al. (2018), we estimate the radius for
these periodic dCs as well, which are included in Table 5.
Using these estimated radii we calculate the Roche-lobe
filling factor (RLFF), using the equation of Eggleton
(1983) to find the Roche radii. Three out of 24 of our
periodic dCs may be experiencing RLOF back onto the
WD (all have a RLFF > 1 in Table 5). However, we
caution that physical parameters are derived from Orich main-sequence models, which may not accurately
represent all dCs. For example, (1) we do not know
the mass of the unseen WD companion and assume it
is 0.6 M (2) we assume these mass-radius and MK mass relations hold for dCs, as they do for normal Orich stars (3) dCs are thought to be of a lower metallicity
population and studies have found that low metallicity
M dwarfs may have smaller radii (Kesseli et al. 2019) and
(4) since dCs may have increased activity and magnetic
fields due to their mass accretion, their radii may be
inflated (Kesseli et al. 2018). We see no obvious evidence
of flickering or accretion outbursts in any of our ZTF
light curves that might indicate current RLOF back onto
the WD.

Note-Distances and magnitudes for the periodic dCs in our sample. We use the Gaia distances, colors, and magnitudes, as well as the 2MASS absolute
K magnitudes to estimate masses and bolometric luminosities for our dCs. For the solar bolometric luminosity, we adopt the value log10 L = 33.58.
We also calculate the Roche-lobe filling factor (RLFF) under the assumption of a 0.6 M WD companion. We calculate the mass errors to be of order
0.05 M , the log10 (Lbol /L ) errors to be of order 0.1, and the radius errors to be of order 0.05 R . However, we caution that physical parameters
are derived from O-rich main-sequence models, which may not accurately represent all dCs.

To compare the BPS models directly to our observed
dC sample, we applied a series of cuts and selection effects to the models, as follows: (1) P < 100 d (2) r mag
< 19.5 (3) MdC ≤ 1 M (4) 1.0 <MZAMS < 4 M (5)
the initial primary must be a TP-AGB star at the onset of the CE phase. Here, MdC is the current mass of
the main sequence companion in the BPS models, and
MZAMS is the initial mass of the primary at the beginning of the models (which will become the AGB donor).
We show the resulting BPS models in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 - models αα2 and αα, respectively. In both
figures, the BPS models are shown as the colored 2D
histogram in mass and period (note that the histogram
color scale is logarithmic and its range is different for
each plot), and the periodic dC stars from this paper
represented as the red scatter points (with KDE contours). The dashed black line represents the RLOF
boundary, with systems occupying the region to the left

(shaded in grey) filling their Roche lobes, under the assumption of a 0.6 M WD companion. Both figures also
show a histogram of the estimated mass accreted during
the CE phase (assumed to last 100 yr).
Figure 4 shows model αα2 (αλ = 0.25) and includes
three different magnetic braking prescriptions. Panel (a)
uses the magnetic braking of Rappaport et al. (1983),
panel (b) that of Ivanova & Taam (2003) and panel (c)
that of Knigge et al. (2011). Again, the color scale is
logarithmic and its range is different for each sub-figure.
Model αα2, however, does not reproduce the mass distribution of our dCs very well, generating low mass systems than observed (still under the assumption that our
physical parameters derived from O-rich main-sequence
models apply to dCs). While it may be that model αα2
does not produce low mass dCs, we have not considered
our sample selection effects in this comparison. Our observed sample is likely biased toward lower mass dCs as

Figure 4. Binary population syntheses results for model αα2, which is the model with lower common-envelope efficiency
(αλ = 0.25) in which less orbital energy goes to unbinding the CE. The background heat map shows the number of systems
(colored on a log scale) in model αα2 going through a CE phase while the primary is in the TP-AGB phase. The plotted masses
are for the secondary (i.e. the dC) and periods are for the currently observed system. Each panel uses a different magnetic
braking formalism: (a) magnetic braking from Rappaport et al. (1983) (b) magnetic braking from Ivanova & Taam (2003) (c)
magnetic braking from Knigge et al. (2011). The red plus scatter markers are our observed short period dC sample without
Hα emission, while the purple triangles are dCs which show Hα emission. The red contours are a KDE contour for the entire
periodic dC sample. The dashed black curve represents the boundary for current dC systems to be experiencing RLOF, where
systems to the left in the grey shaded region may be experiencing RLOF. The bottom panel shows a histogram of the estimated
mass accreted by the secondary during the CE phase. While this model (αα2) reproduces the period distribution better than
model αα (see Figure 5), the estimated accreted mass is even lower than that of αα because of the lower CE efficiency. Since
>0.03 M of mass transfer is likely required to create a dC, a CE is not likely to be the primary mechanism for accretion to
form a dC.

(1) they have stronger C2 and CN bands, and (2) their
variability is fractionally larger and so easier to detect.
Model αα (Figure 5) uses a higher CE efficiency (αλ =
2) similar to classical BPS studies and includes the standard magnetic braking of Rappaport et al. (1983). From
Figure 5, it is seen that this model is unable to reproduce the short periods of our observed dC sample. This
is in agreement with the conclusions based on the SDSS
PCEBs (WD+MS systems; Zorotovic et al. 2010; Toonen & Nelemans 2013; Camacho et al. 2014), where Toonen & Nelemans (2013) found that standard efficiency
(αλ = 2) CE was also unable to reproduce the observed
periods, as it generated too many long-period PCEBs.
A crucial shortfall is that the estimated mass accreted
for all models is too small to convert a main-sequence
star into a dC (see Section 7 for a discussion). Miszalski et al. (2013) suggest that to shift the secondary
envelope from approximately solar (C/O)i ∼ 1/3 to the
observed (C/O)f > 1 requires ∆M2 = 0.03–0.35 M for
M2 = 1.0–0.4 M . The predicted mass accretion in our
BPS models is lower than this by 2−3 orders of magni-

tude. Together with the strong mismatch between the
modeled and observed dC period-mass distributions, it
seems clear that there must be further mass accretion
outside the brief CE phase.
Qualitatively it is also possible to argue that accretion during CE evolution is rarely significant for nondegenerate companions. The common envelope itself
typically possesses much higher specific entropy than
the surface of the accretor, with the consequence that
matter accreted by the companion star reaches pressure
equilibrium at the surface of that star with much higher
temperature, and vastly lower density, than the accretors initial surface layer. A temperature inversion or
roughly isothermal layer is expected to bridge this entropy jump with the result that, over the duration of
the CE evolution (which is much shorter than the thermal time scale of the accretor), the accretor is thermally
isolated from the common envelope, while the common
envelope itself becomes increasingly tenuous.
A solution to the under-prediction of accreted mass
may be that more mass accretion may take place be-

The background heat map shows the number of systems (colored on a log scale) in model αα going through a commonenvelope phase while the primary is on the TP-AGB phase.
The plotted masses are for the secondary (i.e. the dC) and

fore the CE phase, but during the TP-AGB phase, by
wind accretion during wind-RLOF (WRLOF; Mohamed
& Podsiadlowski 2007). WRLOF is a mass transfer
state that lies between standard wind mass transfer and
standard RLOF, where the wind of the primary star
is focused toward the secondary star. This results in
increased mass transfer efficiency as compared to the

standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton case (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939; Bondi & Hoyle 1944).
In the WRLOF regime, the primary is technically not
filling its Roche lobe. However, low-velocity wind matter is funneled through the Roche lobe to the companion,
allowing for mass transfer to take place in binaries with
wider orbits than the classical RLOF case. WRLOF
would boost dC formation since, if the initial orbital
separation is too small, the expanding AGB atmosphere
can cause a CE before the third dredge-up can turn the
AGB into a C star.
A variety of simulations (Abate et al. 2013; Saladino
et al. 2018, 2019; Saladino & Pols 2019) have shown
that WRLOF in binaries with AGB primaries can have
mass-transfer efficiencies of 40-50%. For an average
AGB wind mass loss rate of 10−7 –10−4 M yr−1 (Höfner
2015), a main sequence companion could accrete enough
material (∼ 0.35M ) in only 103 –106 yr, within the time
an AGB star is expected to stay a C star (106 yr; Marigo
et al. 2017). WRLOF has also been shown to efficiently
tighten the orbit (Saladino et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018)
so that more systems could be driven towards orbits
with the periods we find.
Indeed, it appears the WRLOF may be the dominant
mass transfer mechanism for many chemically peculiar
stars. Abate et al. (2013) showed that simulations of
AGB binaries with WRLOF were better able to reproduce the observed formation rates of the CEMP-s
stars. Saladino et al. (2019) and Saladino & Pols (2019)
also performed simulations finding AGB binaries with
WRLOF were consistent with the observed properties of
the CEMP-s, CH, and Ba stars. This further strengthens the connection between dCs, WRLOF, and the other
chemically peculiar stars.
However, detailed modeling of the WRLOF in the specific case of the TP-AGB phase with a C star is needed to
understand how the larger stellar radii of AGB-C stars
and the increased dust formation often found in their
winds affect the WRLOF mass transfer efficiencies. The
periodic dCs in this paper represent a prime sample that
is ready for spectroscopic follow-up and for comparison
to future models of WRLOF mass transfer.
7. SUMMARY

We searched ZTF light curves of a sample of 944 dCs
for signs of periodic signals. We found 24 dCs with signs
of significant photometric variability, with 80% having
P< 1 d. The most likely origins of this periodicity is
either from spot rotation or surface heating of the dC
from the close WD companion. Even if the detected
ZTF periods arise from ellipsoidal variations and represent half the orbital period, such short periods are sur-

prising for dC stars, which require significant accretion
to turn them into the C-enriched dwarfs we see today.
Spectroscopic follow-up is needed to determine the
source of the variability in each of these periodic dCs,
especially to ensure for the case of spot rotation that
the system is circularized and tidally locked so that the
rotation period can be assumed to equal the orbital period (i.e. that our reported photometric periods correspond to both rotational and orbital periods). The
periodic dCs in this paper provide a rich new sample to
target for spectroscopic follow-up, as well as to study
dC formation and properties. We have confirmed the
photometric period as the orbital period for one dC for
which we have obtained spectroscopic follow-up. In two
other dCs we have confirmed that they must have short
orbital periods from their RVs (not confirming the photometric period as the orbital period however). In all
three cases, these short (P< 1 d) orbits indicate these
dCs have indeed experienced a CE phase.
These short periods indicate that at least some dCs
will experience a CE at some point in their formation,
with the dCs having P< 1 d experiencing substantial
plunge-in. We used binary population synthesis models to show that the observed sample of dCs is not
well-reconstructed by mass transfer during the commonenvelope phase alone, since the dCs in our sample require at least 0.03 M of mass accretion but our models predict 2–3 orders of magnitude less transfer during the CE phase, suggesting mass accretion before the
CE phase. However, some systems such as cataclysmic
variables indicate CE timescales an order or two longer
(Michaely & Perets 2019; Igoshev et al. 2020) than our
assumed 100 yr (based on Ricker & Taam 2008; Igoshev et al. 2020), which may substantially increase the
amount of accreted material to the point that the CE
alone could provide enough mass to form a dC.
Hydrodynamical simulations of CE evolution typically
find that accretion onto a non-degenerate companion is
not common, because of the entropy barrier between the
companion and the surrounding material (e.g. Ivanova
et al. 2013, for a review). In fact, even in the case of neutron star companions, which can accrete more efficiently
due to neutrino cooling, accretion is limited to . 0.1M
(MacLeod & Ramirez-Ruiz 2015). Further modeling of
the CE phase involving C-AGBs may provide further
insight.
dC systems that begin as very wide binaries would
experience stable mass transfer and a widening of the
orbit. Systems that initially are close would begin a
CE phase either during the red giant branch or during
the AGB before the TP-AGB and, without experiencing the third dredge-up during the TP-AGB, would not

produce dCs. Therefore, it seems that the most likely
mass transfer mechanism to form dCs is WRLOF.
Further modeling of WRLOF in binaries with a TPAGB star are needed to fully test this formation pathway
of dCs. Additionally, further work is needed to understand the relationship between initial dC metallicity and
mass to constrain the amount (and composition) of material that needs to be accreted to form a dC. This would
be an important step in constraining the mass-transfer
efficiency in the WRLOF case.

Figure A1. Light curves for the periodic dCs in this paper. Each panel is the light curve in one filter for each dC; therefore
one particular dC may appear in more than one panel if detected in more than one ZTF band. For each light curve we plot the
magnitude, with errors, phased on the best found period. The red line in each shows the best fit model, described in Section 4.
Below each phased light curve are the residuals of the light curve and the model. Each light curve is shown twice in phase for
clarity.

Figure A1. Light curves for the periodic dCs in this paper. Each panel is the light curve in one filter for each dC; therefore
one particular dC may appear in more than one panel if detected in more than one ZTF band. For each light curve we plot the
magnitude, with errors, phased on the best found period. The red line in each shows the best fit model, described in Section 4.
Below each phased light curve are the residuals of the light curve and the model. Each light curve is shown twice in phase for
clarity.
