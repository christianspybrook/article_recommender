Abstract
We present a characterization of a small (9-liter) and mobile 0.1% 6 Li-doped pulse-shape-sensitive plastic scintillator antineutrino
detector called SANDD (Segmented AntiNeutrino Directional Detector), constructed for the purpose of near-field reactor monitoring with sensitivity to antineutrino direction. SANDD comprises three different types of module. A detailed Monte Carlo
simulation code was developed to match and validate the performance of each of the three modules. The combined model was then
used to produce a prediction of the performance of the entire detector. Analysis cuts were established to isolate antineutrino inverse
beta decay events while rejecting large fraction of backgrounds. The neutron and positron detection efficiencies are estimated to be
34.8% and 80.2%, respectively, while the coincidence detection efficiency is estimated to be 71.7%, resulting in inverse beta decay
detection efficiency of 20.0%±0.2%(stat.)±2.1%(syst.). The predicted directional sensitivity of SANDD produces an uncertainty
of 20◦ in the azimuthal direction per 100 detected antineutrino events.

1. Introduction
Nuclear power reactors are the most intense man-made
sources of antineutrinos. A 1-GW thermal (GWt) nuclear reactor emits ∼ 1020 antineutrinos per second isotropically. As
the composition of the reactor core evolves due to the consumption of 235 U and the production of 239 Pu, the antineutrino flux
and energy spectrum both evolve downwards [1]. This makes
it possible in principle to monitor the ON/OFF status and the
fuel evolution of the core over time. Antineutrinos have a very
low interaction cross section, which makes their detection challenging. The same property allows them to pass through large
amount of material unimpeded, which makes them unshieldable. The detection of antineutrinos presents opportunities for
non-intrusive real-time monitoring of the operational status of
nuclear reactors for safeguards, which falls within purview of
the International Atomic Energy Agency [2, 3]. Additionally,
short-baseline measurements of reactor antineutrinos could offer valuable insights into the nature of the neutrino [4, 5, 6, 7].
The concept of continuous non-intrusive real-time monitoring of a reactor core using antineutrinos has been demonstrated
several times. The concept was first demonstrated in the 1980's
at the Rovno nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union [8, 9]. It
was followed by experiments at the Bugey nuclear power plant
in France using 6 Li-loaded liquid scintillator [10, 11] and in the

2000's at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS)
in the US [12] using a 0.64-ton Gd-doped liquid-scintillator detector deployed at an overburden of 20 meters water equivalent
(m.w.e.). Recently, the Nucifer experiment, a 0.8-m3 Gd-doped
liquid scintillator detector located 7 m away from the 70-MWth
Osiris reactor, provided a short baseline measurement of the reactor neutrino flux at an overburden of 12 m.w.e. [13].
Antineutrinos undergo the inverse beta decay (IBD) reaction
on protons in a hydrogen-rich target volume:
ν̄e + p → e+ + n,

(1)

producing an MeV-scale positron that slows down and annihilates with an electron, emitting two 0.511-MeV gamma rays.
The neutron thermalizes and can be detected via capture on nuclei with high thermal neutron capture cross sections, usually
added to the detection medium in small concentrations, such as
155
Gd, 157 Gd, and 6 Li.
While the capabilities of antineutrino detectors for nuclear
safeguards have been demonstrated, practicalities associated
with deployment need to improve [2]. Most short-baseline detectors have been deployed below ground to suppress fast neutrons caused by the cosmic ray muons [1, 9]. Thick hydrogenous shielding is required around the target material to further
reduce the fast neutron flux. This increases the overall size
and complexity of the detector and limits the range of possible deployment locations. To solve this issue, contemporary
near-field detectors employ segmented geometry and materials
capable of pulse-shape discrimination to reject fast neutron induced backgrounds and to select the delayed coincidence events

that are confined both in time (<200 μs) and space (<1 m). This
approach greatly suppresses the accidental coincidence and the
muogenic backgrounds, allowing for aboveground deployment.
For example, PROSPECT is an aboveground segmented 4-ton
6
Li-doped pulse-shape-sensitive liquid-scintillator detector that
has demonstrated real-time monitoring of the 85-MW HighFlux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at a 7-m standoff [14].

Among the aforementioned detectors, SANDD (Fig. 1) is the
only detector that uses pulse-shape-sensitive plastic homogeneously doped with 6 Li [28] (0.1%wt). In contrast to neutron
capture on 155 Gd, 157 Gd, or H, which produces one or more
gamma rays that deposit their energies over a larger volume,
neutron capture on 6 Li produces an alpha and a triton, which
deposit their energies over a short range. Hence, the use of
6
Li combined with the fine segmentation enables additional discrimination for/against neutron captures via rod multiplicity,
improving IBD coincidence identification and further suppressing the high rate of backgrounds near the surface. The fine
lateral and azimuthal segmentation of the scintillator elements
also permits good spatial resolution, a requirement for directional sensitivity. Antineutrino direction can be statistically reconstructed from the average displacement vector defined by
the positron and neutron capture locations [29]. Detectors such
as Goesgen [30, 31], Palo Verde [30, 32], CHOOZ [33], Double
CHOOZ [34, 35, 36], and more recently PROSPECT [37] have
theoretically and experimentally studied their directional sensitivity to antineutrino flux. So far, Double CHOOZ reported
the lowest angular uncertainty of ∼43◦ from 100 detected IBD
events [36].
The focus of this paper is a characterization of the full 9-liter
SANDD (Fig. 2). It builds on earlier work [15], which characterized a prototype of the central module with shorter pulseshape-sensitive rods and no 6 Li doping. The aim of the previous
work was to test a data acquisition system capable of recording
key performance metrics such as pulse-shape-parameter (PSP),
energy (E), z-position resolution and particle ID via segment
multiplicity (Rm ). The relevant performance metrics in this
work are similar, but also include PSP of the neutron capture on
6
Li. Fig. 1 shows a rendering of the full sized 9-liter SANDD.
The full 9-liter SANDD described here employs the same readout for the central module, and a dual-end readout of scintillator
bars with 1" photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for the outer modules.

Figure 1: Exploded view of the final configuration of the SANDD detector
to be constructed and deployed near a nuclear reactor [15]. Here the central
module, one 2.54 cm × 2.54 cm × 40.64 cm bar, and one 5.08 cm × 2.54 cm ×
40.64 cm bar are referred to as component 1, component 2, and component 3,
respectively.

All of the short-baseline detectors described above employed
organic liquid scintillators. Some of these liquids can be chemically toxic, volatile, and flammable. Energy depositions in the
container holding the liquid may also not contribute to light
production and detection. Furthermore, materials compatibility
with the liquid scintillator containment can be problematic, and
support and retaining structures require careful engineering.
To improve the safety characteristics and ease of deployment,
several efforts to develop compact aboveground solid (plastic)
antineutrino detectors are underway. Current and proposed
near-field detectors such as SANDD [15, 16], PANDA [17],
SoLid [18, 19], DANSS [20, 21], CHANDLER [22], VIDAAR [23], IMSRAN [24], and NuLat [25, 26, 27] are
segmented and employ pulse-shape-sensitive solid materials.
These detectors 1 utilize heterogeneous detection medium: the
main "target" scintillator is wrapped in neutron-capture material either containing Gadolinium (as in PANDA, DANSS, VIDAAR, and ISMRAN) or 6 Li in the form of 6 LiZnS:Ag (as in
CHANDLER and SoLid).

The central module of SANDD consists of an 8 × 8 array of 6 Li-doped pulse-shape-sensitive plastic rods (5.4 mm ×
5.4 mm × 40.64 cm) coupled to a pair of 64-pixel SiPM arrays (Fig. 2(a)). The central module of SANDD is surrounded
by a layer of 2.54 cm × 2.54 cm × 40.64 cm 6 Li-doped pulseshape-sensitive plastic bars, which is further surrounded by a
layer of 5.08 cm × 2.54 cm × 40.64 cm 6 Li-doped pulse-shapesensitive plastic bars. Each bar is coupled to a pair of 1" PMTs
(Fig.2b). The performance characteristics of the central module, one of the middle layer bars, and one of the outer layer bars
were measured and compared separately to a GEANT4 simulation [38, 39]. Henceforth we refer to each of these components
as component 1, component 2, and component 3, respectively,
as described in Table 1.
The three different components of SANDD are shown in
Fig. 2 and parameterized in Table 1. Analysis cuts were established to retain the majority of IBD events while removing
a large fraction of background events. As a result, antineutrino
detection efficiency and uncertainty in the direction of the reactor antineutrino flux are predicted by a tuned simulation.

Waveforms saved to disk were analyzed as follows: First,
the baseline was calculated by averaging the first 70 pre-trigger
samples (280 ns) and 30 pre-trigger samples (120 ns) of the
digitized SiPM and PMT waveforms, respectively. The baseline
was then subtracted on an event-by-event basis. The time of
leading edge tL of each waveform was defined as the position
of the maximum positive slope of the waveform.
Charge integration limits were optimized based on the PSP,

Details of the composition and the fabrication of the 6 Lidoped pulse-shape-sesitive plastic scintillator can be found in
Ref. [40]. Multiple solid scintillator sections were prepared
over an 8 months period. Some sections were machined for
the 64-rod inner module, while the others were machined into
the outer layer bars. The rods were then optically coupled
to a pair of SiPM arrays (SensL J-60035 series, 50.44 mm ×
50.44mm [41]) using BC-630 silicone optical grease, as shown
in Fig. 2(a). The scintillator rods were supported by an 8 × 8
square plastic frame that was fitted to each SiPM. The frames
were used to maintain the alignment of each rod with its associated SiPM pixels. Two additional 8×8 square plastic frames
were placed at one-third and two-thirds of the length of the rods
to prevent them from sagging and contacting each other such
that the total internal reflection within each rod can be maintained. The larger bars were wrapped with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape (POLY-TEMP PN-16050) and each end was
optically coupled to a 1" Hamamatsu R1924A-100 PMT [42]
using BC-630 silicone optical grease, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
The light sensors (SiPMs or PMTs) mounted at either end of
each plastic scintillator will be referred to as light sensors A
and B.
The SiPM and PMT operating voltages were set at 28 V and
−1100 V, respectively. The SiPM signals were amplified using
CAEN N979 (10× gain) amplifiers while the PMT signals were
sent directly to the Struck SIS3316 digitizer module (250 MS/s,
14 bit, 5 V dynamic range) without further amplification. Details of the data acquisition system can be found in Ref. [15].
Thresholds were set to ensure data rates were not too high for
the DAQ - corresponding to an approximate energy threshold of 0.2 MeVee and 0.1 MeVee for the central module and
the large cross section bars, respectively. Waveforms (1600 ns)
were sent to disk as each digitizer buffer was filled. The digitized waveforms were stored in ROOT format [43], and then
processed by a series of standard ROOT routines. In the analysis, individual channel timestamps were sorted into events consisting of waveforms within a 1 μs event window. Energy depositions were required to trigger the light sensors on both ends
of a given scintillator segment to be accepted for analysis.

where μe (μn ) and FWHMe (FWHMn ) are the mean and the fullwidth-half-maximum values of the PSP distribution for electron
(proton) recoils at any given electron equivalent energy. 252 Cf
and 22 Na data were used to optimize the PSP; we used pure
electron-recoil data (22 Na) to characterize the lower PSP band
before finding the upper PSP band in the mixed electron/protonrecoil data (252 Cf). The optimized charge integration limits
for the SiPM data were found to be [tL − 40 ns ≤ Qtotal ≤
tL + 1120 ns] and [tL + 76 ns ≤ Qtail ≤ tL + 1120 ns]. The optimized charge integration limits for the PMT data were found
to be [tL -20 ns ≤ Qtotal ≤ tL +1300 ns] and [tL +28 ns ≤ Qtail ≤
tL +1300 ns]. The charge response differences from channel to
channel caused by gain or optical coupling efficiency variations
were corrected using a collimated 137 Cs gamma-ray source directed at the center of the module. Here, lead bricks were
used for shaping the 137 Cs source into a fan beam of ∼0.5-cm
width. For each component of SANDD, each channel's charge
response was equalized by scaling the position of its Compton
continuum maximum to the channel with the largest Compton
continuum maximum.
To measure the apparent attenuation length of the scintillator, a series of collimated 137 Cs measurements were taken at
regular intervals along the length of each component. In each
case, the location of Compton continuum maximum was identified by fitting the energy response with a Gaussian profile while

method [46], resulting in combined χ2 /ndf map as shown in
Fig. 4.
To determine the range of acceptable surface roughness and
intrinsic attenuation length, a series of 1D scans were performed over the range of sigma alpha values. Each scan yielded
a χ2 plot over a range of intrinsic-attenuation-length. Each plot
was then fitted with a second-degree parabolic function to determine the intrinsic attenuation length parameter corresponding to the χ2 minimum at that surface roughness. For each such
minimum, the range of acceptable intrinsic attenuation length
parameters were the ones that yielded a χ2 value within 68%
CL of the minimum value. This generated a range of acceptable χ2 values (within 68% CL) over a range of attenuation
length and sigma alpha values. The minima of all the parabolic
fits were taken as the best fit values and the uncertainty was
given by the range of acceptable values. The chosen sigma alpha and intrinsic attenuation length parameters are 0.12±0.02
and 72.6±10.3 cm, respectively (Table. 2).
The simulation framework was also tuned in terms of light
yield of the scintillator and the coupling efficiency between the
light sensor and the scintillator by comparing the measured and
simulated energy responses to a center collimated 137 Cs source.
To eliminate the dependence on the event position, the energy
was calculated as follows:

types of component. Apparent attenuation lengths of 18±2 cm,
28±2 cm, and 31±2 cm were measured for component 1, component 2, and component 3, respectively.
In the Geant4 simulation, there are two parameters influence
the apparent attenuation length: intrinsic attenuation length of
the plastic and the surface roughness of the plastic. A simulation was performed to investigate the relative importance of
these two characteristics. The surface roughness parameter was
modeled with the sigma alpha parameter in Geant4 [44]. In the
large cross section bar simulations (components 2 and 3), scintillator bars were wrapped with the Teflon tape. The UNIFIED
model was used with the Teflon reflection type set to lambertian
distribution and scintillator reflection type set to specular lobe
distribution. The sigma alpha parameter describes the degree
of non specular reflection at surface in terms of a Gaussian distribution with a width of sigma alpha radians. The simulation
placed a small air gap between the scintillator and the Teflon
tape. The refractive index of the scintillator was assumed to be
similar to polystyrene (∼1.6 in the range of 480–680 nm). The
shapes of the absorption and the emission spectra of the plastic
were taken from measurements [40].
The comparisons to simulation in Fig. 3 were obtained by
simulating 477 keV electrons at the same positions as the data
(with a 0.5-cm position spread). Note that the energy corresponding to the Compton continuum maximum of 662-keV
137
Cs gamma rays is 477 keV [45]. The energy depositions produce optical photons that are propagated through the scintillator
material and arrive at the light sensors (SiPMs or PMTs). The
Hamamatsu PMT quantum efficiency [42] and the SensL SiPM
photon detection efficiency [41] were then folded into the detector responses. The charge responses from the simulation and
experiment were normalized to minimize the sum of the squares
of the differences between them as shown in Fig. 3.
To determine the best combination of surface roughness and
intrinsic attenuation length, independent χ2 /ndf maps were obtained for light sensors A and B and for different components. Small differences in best-fit surface roughness and intrinsic attenuation length were then resolved using the Fisher

where E A is the charge collected at light sensor A, E B is the
charge collected at the opposite light sensor B, and E is proportional to the energy deposited in the target volume. Equation.(4) assumes that light transport within each rod or bar behaves exponentially. Figure 6 shows the measured backgroundsubtracted energy responses to a collimated 137 Cs source. The
energy resolution values of approximately 22%, 16%, and 18%
were observed at the Compton continuum maximum of 662keV gamma rays for component 1, component 2, and component 3, respectively. The measured energy responses were
then compared to the simulated ones within [0.4,1.0] MeVee
energy range to obtain χ2 maps as shown in Fig. 5. A similar
optimization was performed to tune the scintillator light yield
and scintillator/light sensor coupling efficiencies. The two parameters are fully correlated, and hence a strong correlation as
shown in the band of good fits extending from top left to down
right can be observed (Fig. 5). Since we cannot estimate the
two parameters independently, we report the combined value
of both parameters as shown in Table 2. An example comparison between the measured and simulated energy responses for
one of the best fits is shown in Fig. 6. The discrepancy below
0.4 MeVee may be due to the low-energy scattered gamma-ray
interactions in the target volume that are not captured by the
simulation. For example, the 662-keV gamma rays may scatter
off the detector's surrounding materials and deposit their energy
in the target volume.

We also tuned the Birks parameter for the plastic scintillator in the simulation over a range of possible Birks parameters
by comparing the measured response to 252 Cf neutron captures
with the simulated response as shown in Fig. 10. In doing so,
sigma alpha, intrinsic attenuation length parameter, coupling efficiency, and light yield were fixed to values shown in Table 2.
The aforementioned method to determine the optimal simulation parameters and their associated uncertainties yielded the
accepted ranges of the Birks constant, as shown in Table 2.
Comparison between the measured and the simulated neutron
island for the best fit is shown in Fig.11.
The FOM, as defined in Eq. (3), was used to quantify the
relative separation of the PSP for neutron and gamma rays. The
FOM is presented as a function of energy in Fig. 7 for each of
the components. Components 1, 2, and 3 have FOM values of
0.67, 0.89, and 0.83 at 1 MeVee, respectively.
SANDD uses the relative charge detected in the light sensors
at either end of each scintillator segment to determine the position of the event along each rod or bar (z-position). We define

The upper and lower PSP bands correspond to proton and electron recoils, respectively. A 6 Li neutron capture island is observed in each case at approximately 0.47 MeVee. The measured neutron island shape is shown in Fig. 11. Gaussian profile was used to estimate the widths of the neutron island and the
widths were found to be 0.08 MeV, 0.06 MeV, and 0.06 MeV

In this section, the selection of positron and neutron capture
candidates and the rejection of common backgrounds in the full
SANDD, consisting of a full assembly of components 1, 2 and 3
(Fig. 1), is discussed. Neutron capture and positron candidates
were selected by establishing cuts on the energy, rod multiplicity, and PSP. Coincidence time window was then optimized to
select positron-neutron pairs and to estimate the antineutrino
detection efficiency. Lastly, directional capability of SANDD is
discussed.
In the simulation, SANDD was surrounded by a 1.5cm-thick
polyethylene layer around the sides of the scintillator (not the
top and bottom where the light sensors are mounted) to reflect
neutrons back into the sensitive detector volume and increase
the neutron capture efficiency. The polyethylene thickness was
constrained by the size of the dark box available. The neutrons
and positrons that result from IBD interactions were independently simulated in SANDD. 1-MeV electrons were simulated
uniformly in the scintillator segments to convert the photon hits
into MeVee. A 0.2-MeVee trigger threshold was assumed.

of the charge ratio was found to follow an "S" curve over the
length of each segment, especially if the attenuation length was
small with respect to the length of the segment. For apparent
attenuation lengths comparable to the length of the scintillator, a linear profile was found to be an adequate approximation.
The linear fit was used to obtain an estimate of the position of
each event along the segment and to convert the RAB and sigma
of RAB distribution of a collimated gamma-ray source into the
z-position residual and its associated uncertainty. We did not
observe significant variation in the sigma of RAB distribution of

4.1. Neutron capture detection efficiency
The neutron capture efficiency in SANDD was found to be
45.4% with 87.2% of the neutrons were captured by 6 Li and
12.8% of the neutrons were capture by hydrogen. The remaining neutrons either exited SANDD (51.9%) or were captured
by hydrogen in the polyethylene layer (2.7%). The average neutron capture time was 37.2 μs and the average distance travelled
by neutron was 7 cm. The thickness of the polyethylene layer
largely affects the capture efficiency of the neutrons. For example, the neutron capture efficiency in SANDD increases to

Figure 11: Comparison between the simulated and the measured energy responses to 252 Cf neutrons for (a) component 1, (b) component 2, and (c) component 3.
The range of fit was set at 2 sigma from the mean energy response to neutron capture.

55.5% with 87.3% of the neutrons were captured by 6 Li and
12.7% of the neutrons were captured by hydrogen when 30-cm
thick polyethylene is used.
To determine the simulated detection efficiency due to the
energy cut, Gaussian profiles were fitted to each component's measured energy response to neutron capture-like events
(Fig. 11). Here, the energy is defined as the maximum energy
observed among the scintillator rods and bars. Two-sigma cuts
in the energy parameter space were subsequently determined
as [0.38,0.71] MeV, [0.37,0.61] MeV, and [0.35,0.61] MeV for
components 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These energy cuts correspond to a simulated 95.7% detection efficiency.
Neutron capture candidates were further required to have a
rod multiplicity equals to one. Neutron captures on 6 Li produce alpha and triton particles with a total kinetic energy of
4.78 MeV. These particles have a short range and hence their
energy depositions are mostly contained within the same rod or
bar [15]. Among the neutron captures that pass the two-sigma
energy cut, 99.9% have rod multiplicity equal to one (Fig. 14).
For neutron capture candidates, PSP was also used to differentiate between different particles. The PSP cut to identify
neutron capture candidates was defined to reject background
gamma rays at the 99% level in the two-sigma energy range.
The experimental detection efficiency due to the PSP cut was
determined from the 252 Cf data as shown in Fig. 12. The resulting measured neutron capture efficiencies were 73.6%, 94.7%,
92.7% for components 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Component

1 loses more lights due to the high aspect ratio, disturbing its
PSP performance. In Fig. 12a, the PSP cut is not shown for the
average central module response since a different PSP cut was
applied for every rod. Multiplying the volume-weighted detection efficiency due to the PSP cut with the detection efficiencies
due to the energy cut and the rod-multiplicity cut, the overall
IBD-neutron detection efficiency was estimated to be 34.8%.
4.2. Positron detection efficiency
Positron candidates were required to deposit a minimum of
1 MeVee and a maximum of 7 MeVee summed over all the rods
and bars of SANDD. The minimum energy requirement was
chosen due to the poor pulse-shape discrimination performance
below 1 MeVee (Fig. 8). An upper energy cut of 7 MeVee was
chosen to exclude the cosmic muon background. Based on the
simulated energy response to IBD positrons, the [1,7] MeVee
energy requirement yielded a detection efficiency of 83.6%.
The PSP requirement for positron candidates was established
using a 252 Cf neutron source, and setting the probability of
falsely identifying a fast neutron recoil as a positron at 1% as
shown in Fig. 13. The corresponding positron efficiencies due
to the PSP cuts were 78.5%, 98.2%, and 97.0% in the energy
range [1 MeVee,7 MeVee] for components 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Multiplying the volume-weighted detection efficiency
due to the PSP cut with the detection efficiencies due to the energy cut, the IBD positron detection efficiency was estimated to
be 80.2%.

value of Q is unity if a cut is not applied or if there is no statistical advantage gained from applying the cut. The neutron

Lastly, a temporal cut to identify positron-neutron pair candidates was established. A quality factor "Q" analysis (Eq. (6))

cuts were then applied to estimate the spread in the antineutrino
detection efficiency. The systematic uncertainty due to the PSP
cut was estimated based on the uncertainties in the Gaussian
fit parameters shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13. The antineutrino
detection efficiency and its uncertainties were estimated to be
20.0%±0.2%(stat.)±2.1%(syst.).
We consider deploying SANDD near a research or power reactor. An example of research reactor is the 85-MWt HFIR at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory and an example of power reactor is the 1500-MWt Hartlepool reactor in Northern England.
There are potential deployment sites located 7 m and 50 m away
from the center of HFIR and Hartlepool reactor cores, which
correspond to the estimated detected IBD rate of 2.6/day and
0.9/day, respectively.

4.5. Directionality
The determination of antineutrino direction via the IBD interaction in hydrogenous media requires a probabilistic approach.
The positron carries most of the energy of the IBD interaction,
while the neutron carries most of the momentum. The IBD
positron promptly annihilates, and hence its interaction position can be used as an estimate for the IBD interaction point.
The neutron undergoes a random walk before it is captured.
Hence, on an event-by-event basis, the neutron capture location
can vary considerably, and many IBD events are required to reconstruct the direction. On average, a vector drawn from the
positron to the neutron capture position will point away from
the antineutrino source.
In the simulation, the direction of the antineutrino flux was
set to the SANDD local positive x direction (see Fig. 1). The
aforementioned analysis cuts were applied and the relative
positron and the thermal-neutron capture positions were estimated. The (x,y) positions were estimated from the scintillator segment with the largest energy deposition. The z position
was reconstructed based on the charge difference collected at
both light sensors. The x,y,z-projections of the distribution of
the positron-neutron vectors are shown in Fig. 16. Projections
along the x, y, and z axes reveal an approximately Gaussian
distribution of displacements with widths 41 mm, 44 mm, and
65 mm respectively, and average displacements of 11.6 mm,
0.09 mm, and 0.08 mm. The arrangement of the outermost
layer bars of SANDD is asymmetric, resulting in the observed
difference between the x and y distribution widths.

Figure 15: Q analysis was applied to the measured background data and the
simulated time-to-capture to obtain the best temporal cut used to isolate promptdelayed coincident events. The average IBD neutron capture time was investigated via simulation and found to be 37.2 μs. The optimum coincidence time
cut was found to be 44 μs.

tral module where the aforementioned PSP cuts, energy cuts,
and rod-multiplicity cuts were applied to the background data
to estimate the time distribution between a positron-like event
followed by a capture-like event. As shown in Fig. 15, the optimum temporal cut is found to be 44 μs, resulting in the simulated delayed coincidence detection efficiency of 71.7%.
4.4. Antineutrino detection efficiency
The antineutrino detection efficiency was calculated by multiplying the estimated neutron capture detection efficiency, the
positron detection efficiency and the time coincidence efficiency (Table. 3). The associated systematic uncertainties are
summarized in Table. 4. To estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the variation in the simulation parameters, IBD simulations were repeated with the parameter uncertainties listed in
Table. 2. For each case, we performed a simulation of 1-MeV
electrons uniformly distributed in the scintilator volume to convert the photon hits into MeVee. The aforementioned analysis

respect to the antineutrino source. Hence, the azimuthal angle

IBD events) in comparison with the Double CHOOZ experiment (±43◦ for 100 detected IBD events).
To understand how the detector design affects the angular
uncertainty, we performed simple Geant4 simulations neglecting the detector response. Simulated detectors were a 2D array of 6 Li-doped plastic segments with varying segment crosssections and distances between segments. The simulated IBD
neutrons were emitted with positive x direction and uniformly
distributed in the detector volume. Perfect position reconstruction, where neutron production and capture positions are precisely known, was assumed. This means the reconstructed (x,y)
position uncertainties correspond only to the cross-section of
the segments. Note that in this simulation, the detector geometry and the random walk of neutrons are the only factors
affecting the directional performance. Figure 18a shows perfectly reconstructed angular uncertainties for 100 IBD neutron
capture events with varying segment cross-section and constant
distance between segments at 0.6 mm. Figure 18b shows the
response with varying distance between segments and constant
segment cross-section at 1". An increase in the distance between the segments results in a larger reconstructed angular uncertainty. However, when the distance between the segments
approaches the cross-section of the segments, this effect becomes less significant. A decrease in the cross-section of the
segments results in a smaller reconstructed angular uncertainty.
However, such improvement is less significant when the segment cross-section is less than the average 2D neutron capture
distance (7.2 cm average capture distance in 3D space corre-

The reconstructed azimuthal angle was close to zero since the
direction of antineutrinos was set to the local positive x. The associated uncertainty (∆φ) was calculated based on the average
neutron displacement (l) and position resolution (P). We calculated the average displacement as the root sum squared of the
means of the x,y-projections, yielding a value of 11.6 mm. We
calculated the position resolution as the average of the standard
deviations of the x,y-projections, yielding a value of 42 mm.
The 1-sigma uncertainty for 100 detected IBD event was estimated as:

One could obtain similar results by repeating the calculation
using the sum of 100 vectors. Figure 17 shows the x,y,zprojections of the sum of 100 vectors. The estimated average displacement and the position resolution were 1154 mm
and 423 mm, yielding azimuthal angle and 1-sigma uncertainty
of 0.4◦ and 20◦ , respectively. SANDD is therefore predicted
to have a better directional resolution (±20◦ for 100 detected

Angular uncertainty for 100
neutron captures [deg]

Cosmic neutrons are expected to be the most dominant background aboveground [37]; they could create an IBD-like signal
from a proton recoil followed by neutron capture. The SatoNiita cosmic neutron spectrum [47] was used to sample the energy of cosmic neutrons. We used a cos3 θ [48] angular distribution with respect to the positive y axis to sample the direction
of the cosmic neutrons since SANDD will be deployed with its
x-z plane parallel to the ground. In the simulation, the SANDD
was surrounded on all sides with a 30 cm-thick polyethylene
fast neutron shield. The inner 1" consisted of borated polyethylene to capture the incoming neutrons once thermalized. The
estimated cosmic neutron-induced background detection rate
was ∼2.9/day, suggesting that S/B ≈ 1 may be achievable if
SANDD were to be deployed at a hypothetical 85 MWth reactor 7 m from the core (predicted signal rate is 2.6/day). For
such an S/B level, the estimated azimuthal angle and the associated 1-sigma uncertainty for 100 detected IBD events are
-31◦ and 31◦ , respectively. This suggests that the background
must be well-characterized to estimate the antineutrino direction properly. Assuming that the background would be measurable to the same accuracy as the signal during reactor-off
periods and the polyethylene shielding could reduce the rate of
neutrons originating from the reactor to a negligible level during the reactor-on periods, one can estimate the antineutrino
direction by subtracting the reactor-off data from the reactor-on
data. Note that we ignored background contribution from antineutrinos produced by the world rectors, neutrons produced
by untagged muons, and accidental coincidences of two uncorrelated signals in our current background rate estimation. A
more detailed study is needed to estimate the SANDD background level properly.

5. Conclusion
SANDD is a directional antineutrino detector that could potentially operate aboveground. The fine segmentation and the
pulse-shape discrimination capability of SANDD allows the
prompt-delayed coincidence to be discriminated against the
cosmic background. Components of SANDD were characterized and a detailed Monte Carlo simulation code was developed
and tuned to investigate the performance of SANDD. Analysis cuts were developed to strike a balance between the antineutrino detection efficiency and the particle misclassification
probability. The coincidence detection efficiency was estimated
to be 71.7% and the neutron and positron detection efficiencies were estimated to be 34.8% and 80.2%, respectively, resulting in antineutrino detection efficiency of 20%. Uncertainty
of ±20◦ in the azimuthal direction was predicted for 100 detected antineutrino events. For comparison, Double CHOOZ
experiment observes ±43◦ angular uncertainty for 100 detected
IBD events [36].Measurement of the direction of incoming antineutrinos could be useful for determining supernova direction,
detecting geoneutrinos that could lead to better understanding
of the earth's interior and its formation mechanism [49], improving the oscillation sensitivity for reactor antineutrino experiments, and disambiguating antineutrinos emitted by multiple reactor cores in the vicinity of the detector.

sponds to 5.8 cm capture distance when projected onto x,yplane), suggesting that the neutron scattering plays a dominant role in determining the width of the distributions shown in
Fig. 16. When we performed full simulation with the detector
response considered, a detector consisting entirely of a 6×6 array of component 2 bars (9.3 L detector volume) with 0.6 mm
air gaps between the bars is predicted to yield an angular uncertainty of 18◦ for 100 detected IBD events. Such predicted
angular uncertainty is smaller than that estimated for the current SANDD design (20◦ for 100 detected IBD events), which
employs several larger bars and air gaps between the three different components. However, the current SANDD design (9 L
detector volume) was chosen to provide an opportunity to investigate the particle ID performance of component 1 while retaining a good directionality and maintaining a reasonable electronics cost for a similar detector volume. The investigation of the
component 1 performance was important to study background
suppression techniques via rod multiplicity.
4.6. Background estimation
We performed a cosmic neutron simulation to estimate the
impact of background on the SANDD directional performance.

While SANDD shows the promise for mobility and good directional and detection performance, this design also has several limitations. For instance, SANDD uses a statistical approach to reconstruct the direction of antineutrino flux, which
could fail in the presence of overwhelming background. An
event-by-event directional reconstruction method using IBD
has been proposed by Safdi and Suerfu [50], where the detector volume is segmented into alternating target and capture
layers with the former made sufficiently thin for neutrons to escape [50]. Rearrangement of SANDD components could potentially allow for such technique to be used. Another limitation
is our planned active volume (9 liters) that may not allow for
measurement beyond reactor on/off detection. To monitor the
core inventory of a 20–200 MWth plutonium production reactor, a ton-scale detector is required [51, 52] to obtain reasonable
statistics in the measured antineutrino spectrum. To increase
SANDD active volume while maintaining a reasonable cost of
light sensors, cross section of SANDD plastic can potentially
be made as large as the 2D average distance travelled by the
IBD neutrons (5.8 cm). Further study is needed to understand
the tradeoff between the antineutrino detection rate and the directional performance.
Future works include study of the cosmic background and
the feasibility study of SANDD aboveground deployment. Detector performance using different detector material such as
wavelength-shifting plastic wrapped in 6 Li-loaded ZnS scintillator may be studied. The use of fast-timing DAQ to improve
the z-position resolution and particle identification may be explored as well.
