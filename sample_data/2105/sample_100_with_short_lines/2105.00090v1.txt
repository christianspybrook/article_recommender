abstract in multiagent systems the agents may have goals that depend on a social shared interpretation about the facts occurring in the
system these are the socalled social goals artificial institutions provide such a social interpretation by assigning statuses to the concrete
elements that compose the system these statuses are supposed to enable the assignee element to perform functions that are not exclusively
inherent to their design features however the enabled functions are not
explicit in the existing models of artificial institutions as a consequence
i agents may have difficulties to reasoning about how to achieve their
own social goals with the help of artificial institutions and ii these institutions are not well instrumented to receive incoming agents in the
case of open systems considering those problems this paper proposes
a model to express the functions  or the purposes  associated with
the statusfunctions helping the agents to reason about their social goals
and the institution we evaluate the model by using it in some scenarios
showing how the agents can use purposes to reason about the satisfaction
of their social goals in institutional contexts and how the institution can
be flexible enough to support new agents operating in the system

introduction

multiagent systems mas are systems composed of autonomous computational
entities henceforth referred to as agents that can interact within a dynamic
environment to achieve their common and individual goals 38 the interaction
among the agents is in the very core of mas making it a useful approach to

handle computational problems involving social aspects 36 one of these aspects
is a shared interpretation about the facts occurring in the system for example
consider a scenario where i the agent bob has the goal of having a book and
ii the agent tom desires to sell a book to this end i bob needs to execute
an action that means giving a value and in return receive a good and ii tom
waits for such action to then deliver the book in this scenario both goals are
social goals because they can not be achieved alone and depend on a common
interpretation involving certain facts without such common interpretation bob
might not know which action to perform to give a value in exchange for the book
even this would not be the case tom might not acknowledge the action of bob
refusing thus to deliver the book the highlighted problem therefore involves
social aspects
inspired by human societies some works propose models and tools to provide
this kind of interpretation to computer systems and in particular to mas 18
they usually consider that the elements involved in the interaction among the
agents constitute or count as institutional concepts that are the common interpretation of those concrete elements 87613 for example agents acting in
an ecommerce scenario may constitute or count as buyers while some of their
actions may count as payments these institutional concepts are referred in the
literature as statusfunctions they are status that assign functions to the concrete elements 3130 for example the status buyer assigns to an agent some
functions such as perform payments take loans etc artificial institutions are
the component of the mas that is responsible for defining the conditions for an
agent to become a buyer or an action to become a payment 3130
the existing works on artificial institutions are more concerned with specifying and managing the constitution of statusfunctions however they focus
more on the status than the function while the status is explicit the function
is implicit in other words the works described in the literature as far as we
know do not provide the means for the institution to express the functions associated with the status explicitly the main drawbacks of this limitation are i
the agents cannot reason about the functions performed by the elements that
carry the status and ii the institutions may be incompatible 3 with the agents
specification
the limitations discussed earlier have some implications first different agents
may have problems to achieve similar social goals if their goals are internally
identified by different terms even if they are acting in the same environment
and institution it is especially critical in open mas where the agents can be
designed and implemented by different parties and it is not possible to predict
in design time neither the number nor the behaviour nor the way the agent
3

compatibility in this work refers to the situation in which the vocabulary used in the
specification of the agents works properly with the vocabulary of the institutional
specification compatibility can occur in several ways including i if the vocabulary
present in the agents specification is identical to the institutional vocabulary or ii
if the programmer encodes compatibility with the institutional specification within
the agent

shall interact among themselves and explore the available resources 1725 for
example in the book store scenario the payment statusfunction can have the
function of leading the system to a state where the agent that executes an action
that counts as payment has the book in this case have a book is the function of
the payment statusfunction interpreted from the agents perspective it is also
the bobs social goal consider that alice joins the book store scenario alice
has the social goal of acquiring a book both bob and alices have similar social goals however if the functions associated to the statusfunctions are not
explicit alice will only reach her social goal if her code includes the goal of
having a book similar to bob second the same agent may not reach his social goal if it moves itself to a new environment and institution similar to the
previous with the same goal for example consider a new scenario in the system called a library in it have a book is the function of a statusfunction other
than payment when entering this system bob will not achieve his social goal
because there is no payment statusfunction there and he was coded for that
very statusfunction of the book store then bob will only reach his social goal
if he performs the action with the statusfunctions associated with his social
goal in that institution third the same institution may not be compatible with
different agents with similar social objectives but coded with other terms this
is the same limitation as to the previous example but seen from the institutions
perspective the institution needs to add new statusfunctions compatible with
agents specifications to its specification to get around this problem however
some statusfunctions can make it inconsistent for example it is not possible
to specify the payment statusfunction in a library that only lends books
although the work on artificial institutions focus on supporting the regulation of the system institutions also need to help agents through constitutive
rules statusfunctions etc to achieve their social goals 29 these examples
show that the institutions as they are currently conceived do not specify the
functions associated with the statusfunctions they do not support the reasoning of agents 29 concerning the satisfaction of their own social objectives and
are not prepared to receive agents designed by different developers thus the
main contribution of this paper is a model based on the notion of purpose to
explicitly represent the functions of the statusfunctions and to relate them to
the social goals of the agents it is inspired by the construction of the social
reality by john searle 3130 and documentality by maurizio ferraris 11

background

this section presents the main concepts used in our approach subsection 21
presents the philosophical concepts that support our contribution subsection 22
briefly describes the state of the art on artificial institutions with respect of the
explicit representation of the functions associated to the institutional concepts
21

institutions according to philosophical theories

an institution is composed of institutional facts 3130 these are based on
statusfunctions and constitutive rules statusfunctions are statuses that have
associated functions these statuses enable concrete elements to perform functions associated with the statuses that cannot be explained through their physical virtues constitutive rules specify the assignment of statusfunctions to concrete elements with the following formula x countas y in c for example
a piece of paper countas money in a bank where x represents the concrete
element y the statusfunction and c the context where that attribute is valid
statuses are imposed on objects when the statusrelated functions meet some
purpose the functions are called agentive functions because they are assigned
from practical interests of the agents 31 p20 these practical interests of agents
are called purposes since the institution is formed by people ie agents and
their collective agreements 31 it is possible to say that the agents themselves
through their purposes assign meaning to the statusfunctions in other words
a purpose is the interpretation of a function performed by an element that carries a status from the agents perspective for example someone has the purpose
of winning a chess game when it leads the chessboard to a circumstance that
countas a checkmate this purpose does not occur naturally it is attributed
through the practical interests of the agents playing the game ie under that
context fundamentally both agents involved in the game must have the same
understanding of these facts ie about the function and their purpose otherwise none of them achieve their social goal searle asserts that someone must
be capable of understanding what the thing is for or the function could never be
assigned 31 p22 understanding a function requires to understand for what it
serves ie its purpose in the case of chess game the purpose of moving the
piece to a checkmating position is to win the game this purpose is in line with
the interests of the agents who are playing the game ie its is understood by
the people involved in the institution
while searle suggests that statusfunctions are a consequence of collective
intentionality their origin remains at least in part unexplained for example
throughout history human societies agreed on assigning the function of money
to a piece of paper a shell or a portion of salt however the function seems
not having a genesis it is hard to establish when money or any other social
objects were invented it is also even more difficult to explain the nature of the
collective intentionality that motivates people to act in different ways when they
have contact with a concrete element constituted with a status indeed searle
considers statusfunctions as a unique abstraction whose function depends on

coupling purposes with statusfunctions in artificial institutions

the individual interpretation of each individual without worrying about how
these functions are represented and shared
to address the mentioned issues ferraris 1011 proposes to ground the social
reality on structures called documentality these structures of documents store
informations that not only describe or prescribe but they actually build social
objects such a structure makes it possible to explain the staying and persistence
of functions and his purposes associated with status over time the speech acts
that gave origin to functions and status were written and stored in documents
that run through time these documents allow people to learn theses structures
through study perception etc for example the money exercise its functions in
the individual intentions only based in the memory and consequently in the set
of functions that the social objects recover of the individuals with the base on
the recording
to summarize social objects are used to externalize the set of recordings that
allow that individuals to remember the functionalities that a status eg money
makes available by being assigned to a social object eg paper note from
these theories it is possible to conclude that an additional system of elements
is required so that functions and status can persist and have value recognized
over time within the social reality 10 a similar system can be applied to mas
to make explicit the functionalities of the statusfunctions that compose the
institutions it will permit to improve the agents reasoning about the satisfaction
of their goals and overcome the difficulties that motivate the realization of this
work
22

institutions in mas

the main idea of using artificial institutions as a counterpart of human institutions in computer systems has inspired work in mas in different ways these
works use the countas relationship established through the constitutive rules
proposed by searle to support the regulation of the system 5 this work considers that the constitutive relation as well as the related concepts eg statusfunctions provide functions to be exploited by the agents to achieve their goals
the purpose of this section is to review state of the art on artificial institutions
with respect of the explicit representation of the functions associated to the
institutional concepts
works on artificial institutions are usually inspired by the theory of john
searle 3130 some works present functional approaches relating brute facts to
normative states eg a given action counts as a violation of a norm these
works do not address ontological issues and therefore it becomes even more
difficult to support the meaning of abstract concepts present in the institutional
reality other works have ontological approaches where brute facts are related
to concepts used in the specification of norms eg sending a message counts
as a bid in an auction however these works have some limitations that are
discussed below
some approaches allow the agents to reason about the constitutive rules 91367351
however generally the statusfunction y  is just a label assigned to the concrete

6

cunha rafhael r et al

element x  and used in the specification of the regulative norms therefore y
does not seem to have any other purpose than to serve as a basis for the specification of stable regulative norms 341 some exceptions are i in the works
of 14151316 where y represents a class formed with some properties as roles
responsible for executing actions time to execute them condition for execution
etc ii in 34 where y is a general concept and x is a subconcept that can
be used to explain y although the exceptions contain more information than
just a label in the y element these data are somehow associated with regulative
norms there are no models that make explicit what the constituted elements
ie the statusfunctions perform in the institution thus the agents may not
understand that the actions performed can also satisfy their social objectives
for example the agents goal have a book is a purpose of the payment statusfunction considering the previously described example of selling books there is
currently no way for bob and tom to understand that the actions performed if
interpreted through their purposes can also satisfy their objectives it occurs because there is not work that made explicit the purposes of the statusfunctions if
the purposes of statusfunctions were made explicit the statusfunctions name
would be less relevant to the systems correct functioning also new agents could
enter the system and understand the purposes of carrying out some functions
that have institutional interpretation and thus resolve themselves to satisfy their
objectives
the limitation discussed above indicates the need to develop a model that explains the purposes of statusfunctions belonging to institutional reality aguilar
et al 28 corroborate this conclusion by stating that institutions have not yet
considered how to help agents in decisionmaking helping them to achieve their
own goals the modeling of purposes of statusfunctions described in the next
section is a step to fill this open gap

the purpose of statusfunctions

inspired by the document structures suggested by ferraris cf section 21 this
section describes a model to specify the purposes associated with the statusfunctions in artificial institutions the focus is on the main concepts and their
relations the practical implementation of this model is beyond the scope of this
paper
the model proposed in this work is composed of agents institutions and
purposes agents are autonomous entities that pursue their goals in the system 38 through mas definition cf section 1 we can see that goal is a
fundamental concept to understand and program mas the literature presents
several definitions of goal that are different but complementary to each other see
more in 33719272022 in this work goals are something that agents aim to
achieve eg the holding of a certain state the performance of an action etc
institutions provide the social interpretation of the environmental elements
of the system the several models of artificial institutions are usually inspired by
the theory of searle considering that constitutive rules specify the assignment of

status to those elements enabling them to perform functions in a certain social
context these statuses with their associated functions are then called statusfunctions the assignment of statusfunctions to the environmental elements is
specified through constitutive rules these rules are generally expressed as x
countas y in c where x represents an environmental element ie a brute
fact y represents a statusfunction to be assigned to x and c represents
the context under which the constitution takes place it is beyond the scope of
this paper to propose a model of artificial institution rather it considers this
general notion of institution as the entity that constitutes statusfunctions that
is adopted by several models in the field of mas
while agents and institutions are known concepts purposes are introduced
in the proposed model the purposes are the practical interests of the agents that
can be satisfied by the functions associated with the statusfunctions cf section 21 if a goal is something desirable by the agent and a purpose of a
statusfunction expresses practical interests of the agents then we propose to
link them in this work it is assumed that agents have goals that are satisfied
by the purposes of the statusfunctions in other words a purpose is the social
interpretation of a function linked to a status aligned with the agents social
goal therefore the difference between a purpose and an agent goal is the social
characteristic collective acceptance etc that a purpose requires without this
social interpretation a purpose and consequently a social goal aligned with that
purpose cannot be achieved in addition it is considered that the purposes are
detailed through a knowledge base according to borst 4 a knowledge base is
an adequate abstraction to represent a shared conceptualization within a context therefore detailing through knowledge bases is essential for the model
to be flexible enough and represent the purpose of statusfunctions in different
contexts
shortly we are stipulating a relationship between functions of statusfunctions
and purposes and between these purposes and goals of agents thus if i an

agent has a goal that satisfies a purpose ii this purpose is associated to a
statusfunction and iii a constitutive rule specifies how a statusfunction is
constituted then it is explicit how the agent should act to achieve its goal ie
acting to constitute the statusfunction that is associated to the same purpose as
the goal in the previous example bob can know that he satisfies his social goal
consulting the purpose of payment statusfunction and subsequently consulting
the institutional specification to understand what concrete action is constituting
the payment statusfunction

evaluation

to illustrate the scenario of using institutions in multiagent systems consider an
open multiagent system where the agents bob alice franois and joo aim
to have a book different programmers have developed the different agents
specifications that are slightly different from each other the agent bob has
the goal of have a book alice has the goal of get a book franois has the goal
of obtenir a book and joo has the goal of ter a book this example is used
in the next subsections to illustrate the limitations of not having an explicit
representation of the purposes of the statusfunctions subsection 41 describes
the disadvantages of not using the model from the perspective of the agents
subsection 42 shows how the model overcomes the disadvantages described in
the previous section the subsection 43 describes the disadvantages of not using
the model from the institutions perspective finally the subsection 44 discusses
the advantages that the model offers when used from an institutional perspective
41

limitations from the agents perspective of not using the model
proposed in this work

in the section we consider a scenario where all agents described in the introduction are located in a book store figure 2 this system is instrumented with
an institution that contains a constitutive rule stating that the concrete action
transfer countas pay such a system could include other statusfunctions and
constitutive rules but for simplicity we focus only on this case to illustrate the
main features of the model proposed cf section 3
the first problem observed is the incompatibility of the specification of the
agents with the institutional vocabulary for example consider that bob has a
plan to achieve his goal and this plan requires him to take a concrete action x
that is institutionally interpreted as pay in this case both specifications bob
and institution are compatible because there is a constitutive rule stating that
a concrete action x counts as pay by reading the book stores institutional specification bob discovers the action that fills his plan ie that x is transfer in the
institution however the problem occurs when other agents have plans considering other words for pay as afford replay and remit their specifications are
not compatible with that of the institution this is because the statusfunction
is just a label if the label specified in the agents plans eg afford repay and

remit is different from the label described in the institutional specification the
agents cannot resolve themselves which are the proper action to perform an
adhoc solution for this problem is to modify the agents code so that they are
compatible with the institution however in a scenario where there are many
agents this solution may be impractical
another problem observed is that the agents are unable to reason4 about
the satisfaction of their objectives for example the constitutive rule transfer
countas pay does not make it explicit that the function of the statusfunction
pay can lead to a state of the world where the agents have achieved their goals
therefore the agents cannot understand that the transfer action  institutionally interpreted as pay  takes them to a state of the world where they have
achieved their objectives institutions as they are currently conceived do not
provide instruments for agents to reason about actions based on their institutional meaning and therefore conclude that they satisfy their social objectives
the solutions to solve this problem transfer the responsibility of checking if the
agents social objective has been satisfied to the system however these solutions
decrease the agents autonomy they need to follow regulatory rules perform actions that do not know the consequences etc
42

advantages from the agents perspective of using the model
proposed in this work

to illustrate how the proposed model solves the limitations from the agents
perspective consider again the example involving bob alice franois and joo
and the common social goal of having a book figure 3 however the purposes
related to the statusfunction pay are now explicit
first the agents specification and institutional vocabulary become compatible this is due to the agents plans being specified considering the purposes
4

reasoning about the satisfaction of their social goals in the context of this work
means that agents consult the purposes ie the consequences of executing a concrete action that has an institutional interpretation in order to realize that these
consequences are analogous to their objectives

related to the statusfunctions instead of the nomenclature used in the specifications for example in the subsection 41 alices plan requires her to perform
an action that counts as pay this could bring some incompatibilities as already
discussed the existence of purposes related to statusfunctions allows alice to
perform an action that has the purpose of getting a book the main difference
with this proposal is that the institutional nomenclature of statusfunctions ie
pay is irrelevant as long as the agent has access to the statusfunctions purposes in other words the agents plan will not look to the status but to the
purposes associated with it agents can act in the institution according their
purposes without requiring changes in their code

fig 3 use of the proposed model in an institutional specification

another advantage is the improvement in the agents reasoning about the
satisfaction of their goals by adding purposes related to statusfunctions agents
can reason about the purposes ie the consequences of carrying out actions
constituting statusfunctions from this the agents can check which actions are
aligned to their social goals and if performed these actions can satisfy them for
example the statusfunctions pay has some associated purposes among them
that of having a book if bob looks for this own social goal of having a book
in the purposes he can infer that the statusfunction pay is of his interest
and moreover that the concrete action of transfer is counting as pay in this
institution the very x action for his plan in this institution is thus transfer
this solution allows the agent himself to check if his social objective can be
satisfied this solution seems to be appropriate because it prevents the agent
from following unnecessary regulative rules or performing actions he does not
know the consequences

first institution contains a constitutive rule stating that the action transfer countas pay rent donation and replace the second institution contains a constitutive
rule stating that signing a loan countas pay rent donation and replace the
third institution contains a constitutive rule stating that receiving the book from
a friend countas pay rent donation and replace finally the fourth institution
contains a constitutive rule stating that putting a book on a shelf countas pay
rent donation and replace all these scenarios are part of a similar context that

fig 4 the institution prepared for different agents

the problem from an institutional perspective is that institutions have to be
specified for every possible incoming agent in the example they have to have
four constitutive rules one for each agent for every new different agent a new
constitutive rule have to be added in each institution the institutional specification is thus quite dependent of how agents are programmed the institutional
developer has to be worried about the agents internals instead of specifying a
good institution independent of the incoming agents
in fact there are some solutions to work around this problem the first
one is to change the institutions specification by adding new constitutive rules
however it cannot be guaranteed that the new constitutive rule makes sense in
that system or institution which sometimes makes this solution unfeasible a

12

cunha rafhael r et al

second possible solution is to change the agents code however as already mentioned in 41 subsection this solution becomes impractical if many agents are
operating on the system furthermore if a new system is available for agents or
new agents to join different systems new changes need to happen as it is currently conceived the institution is not open enough to support the performance
of different agents designed with different but similar plans and objectives

advantages from the institution perspective of using the model
proposed in this work

to illustrate the proposed model this models use from the institution perspective consider again the example involving bob alice franois and joo still
have the same goals but can move through four institutions containing four different institutional specification figure 5 in addition there are purposes related
to the statusfunctions each institution contains its own institutional specification that is extended by adding purposes related to the statusfunctions these
purposes represent the interests of agents possibly operating in the institution

fig 5 use of the proposed model in some institutional specifications

we can notice that the institutional specification in particular the constitutive rules is not conceived for the different possible incoming agent the link between the statusfunctions and agents goals is done in a new document properly
conceived for that if a new agent is considered to be participant of the institution only this document has to be adapted the constitution is kept unchanged
for example the book store specification contains an associated document that
describe the purposes of the pay statusfunction in this case pay is related to
the social goals ie has the purposes of bob alice franois and joo

results and discussions

the problem motivating this paper is the impossibility of the agents to reason about the functions associated with statusfunctions representing the institutional interpretation of certain facts that occur in the environment this
problem is partially solved by computational models that implement artificial
institutions however these models do not represent the purpose of this interpretation from an agent perspective agents have to be hardcoded to know
which statusfunctions can be useful for them to achieve their social goals and
institutions must be recoded to receive new agents specified by different parties
considering this problem we propose a model to express the purposes associated
with the statusfunctions that compose the artificial institutions the conception of our model is an adaptation from a particular point of view of searles
and ferrariss theories 31301110 which claims that the purposes are specified
by practical interests of the individuals that can be satisfied by the functions
associated to the statusfunctions cf section 21 we assume that the purposes
are defined based on the interests of the agents however they are specified by
a party involved in the development of the system in other words it is not the
agents themselves who define the purposes based on collective agreements etc
there are some advantages of such conception that we discuss below the
first one is related to the flexibility of the agents that can achieve their social
goals even being developed by different programmers for example the subsection 41 illustrates a scenario where all agents are located in the same institution
eg book store in this example specified agents with vocabularies other than
the institutional vocabulary may have difficulties to i execute their plans and
ii understand when their social goals are reached the solution to this problem
is described in subsection 42 where the agents plans can be specified considering
the purposes related to the statusfunctions rather than the status nomenclature the advantages are a the agents can reason about these functions and
adapt in different scenarios to satisfy their plans and b by reasoning about the
functions of the statusfunctions the agent can perceive that these functions are
similar to their interests and therefore they can help the agents to reach their
social goals the agents capability to reason about the functions and adapt to
different scenarios is an important advance in open systems flexibility 239
the agents understanding of what makes his social objective satisfied is also
an important advance in his autonomy 28 in this case the agent can reason
about the actions in the plans and the regulative rules that govern the system in
both cases the agent has greater autonomy and flexibility in deciding whether
a particular action will help him reach his social goal
the second advantage is related to the institutions flexibility in being prepared to receive different agents designed by different developers for example
the subsection 43 illustrates a scenario where all agents can enter and leave
different institutions in this example institutions are not prepared to receive
different agents then the developer needs to modify the institutional specifications however in open systems it is not possible to predict which agents will
enter or leave the institution 1725 the solution to the problem is described in

14

cunha rafhael r et al

subsection 44 an the explicit link between statusfunctions and purposes that
allows us to prepare the institution for new agents
the advantages can also be seen in the concepts of cohesion and coupling
present in software engineering the cohesion of a module corresponds to the
degree to which the module is dedicated to implementing only one responsibility
of the system 24 cohesive modules are those that have few responsibilities this
way maintenance is simpler and avoids side effects it is easier to change one part
of the application without affecting other parts the coupling means how much
a module depends on the other module to work 26 when there is low coupling
the application becomes more flexible reusable and more organized therefore
the ideal for a system to be flexible and understandable are modules with high
cohesion and low coupling 26 the proposed model has both properties high
cohesion occurs because the model proposes to extend only the statusfunctions
present in the institutional reality through the introduction of the concept of
purposes related to these functions the low coupling is guaranteed because the
model does not depend on the other system modules environment institution
agents etc to function correctly this separation of responsibilities also ensures
that the model is flexible and requires less effort to perform maintenance
according to 12 human societies usually have a representation i internal
of the social reality ie the individuals do not necessarily reason in terms of
statusfunctions norms purposes etc and ii implicit as it is built on top of
peoples mental states that believe for instance that a certain man is the king
in the proposed model purposes compose a system i explicit as it is properly
specified through institutional concepts and ii external as it is persisted outside the agents mind such conception is in agreement with some authors that
point that institutions can or perhaps even should be used for purposes that
are beyond the normative ones 281332332123 in summary our work proposes an interface to make different couplings in different institutions without
changing the institutional specification or the coding of the agents in other
words agents and institutions remain unchanged because the purpose is the
link between agents interests and the institutions from this the change from
one scenario to another occurs only in the mapping between the institutional
specification and the purposes that reflect the agents interests
as future work we plan to explore additional theoretical aspects related to
the model such as i investigations about how other proposed institutional
abstractions fit on the model ii the verification of the consistency among
statusfunctions purposes and agents social goals and iii check if the functions related to status must be further detailed we plan to also address more
practical points such as i the modeling of a statusfunctions purposes based
on a real scenario ii the implementation of this model in a computer system
and iii the integration this model in an computational model that implements
the constitution of statusfunctions and after in an mas platform

coupling purposes with statusfunctions in artificial institutions
