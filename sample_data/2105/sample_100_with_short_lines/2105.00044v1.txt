abstract
let h be a digraph possibly with loops and d a digraph without loops whose arcs are colored with
the vertices of h d is said to be an hcolored digraph if w  x0      xn  is an open walk in d and
i  1     n1 we say that there is an obstruction on xi whenever colorxi1  xi  colorxi  xi1  
 ah
a k l hkernel by walks in an hcolored digraph d k  2 l  1 is a subset s of vertices of d such
that for every pair of different vertices in s every walk between them has at least k  1 obstructions and
for every x  v d  s there exists an xswalk with at most l  1 obstructions this concept generalize
the concepts of kernel k lkernel kernel by monochromatic paths and kernel by hwalks if d is an hcolored digraph an hclass partition is a partition f of ad such that for every u v v w  ad
coloru v colorv w  ah iff there exists f in f such that u v v w  f  the hclass digraph
relative to f  denoted by cf d is the digraph such that v cf d  f  and f g  acf d iff
there exist u v  f and v w  g with u v w  v d
we will show sufficient conditions on f and cf d to guarantee the existence of k l hkernels by
walks in hcolored digraphs and we will show that some conditions are tight for instance we will show
that if an hcolored digraph d has an hclass partition in which every class induces a strongly connected
digraph and has a obstructionfree vertex then for every k  2 d has a k k  1 hkernel by walks
despite finding k lkernels is a n p complete problem some hypothesis presented in this paper can be
verified in polynomial time

introduction

for terminology and notation not defined here we refer the reader to 3 if d is a digraph and x  v d
we denote by a x the set x v  ad  v  v d a x the set u x  ad  u  v d and
ax  a x  a x if d is a digraph without loops a sink is a vertex x such that a x   if h is a
digraph possibly with loops a sink is a vertex x such that a x  x x if s1 and s2 is a subsets of v d
we denote by n  s1  the proper outneighbor of s1  in this paper we write walk path and cycle instead of
directed walk directed path and directed cycle respectively if w  x0      xn  is a walk path we say that
w is an x0 xn walk x0 xn path the length of w is the number n and it is denoted by lw  if t1  z0      zn 
and t2  w0      wm  are walks and zn  w0  we denote by t1  t2 the walk z0      zn  w0      wm  if x
belongs to a walk w  we denote by x respectively x  the successor respectively predecessor of x in w 
if s1 and s2 are two disjoint subsets of v d a uvwalk in d is called an s1 s2 walk whenever u  s1 and
v  s2  if s1  x or s2  x then we write xs2 walk or s1 xwalk respectively for a nonempty subset
f  ad the subdigraph arcinduced by f is denoted by dhf i
the concept of kernel was introduced by von neumann and morgenstern in 23 as a subset s of vertices
of a digraph d such that for every pair of different vertices in s there is no arc between them and every
vertex not in s has at least one outneighbor in s this concept has been deeply and widely studied by several
authors due to a large amount of theoretical and practical applications by example 7 9 10 and 11 in
6 chvtal showed that deciding if a digraph has a kernel is an npcomplete problem and a classical result
proved by knig 19 shows that every transitive digraph has a kernel
the concept of kernel has been generalized over the years a subset s of vertices of d is said to be a
kernel by paths if for every x  v d  s there exists an xspath that is s is absorbent by paths and for
every pair of different vertices u v  s there is no uvpath in d that is s is independent by paths this
concept was introduced by berge in 5 and it is a well known result that every digraph has a kernel by paths
5 see corollary 2 on p 311 the concept of k lkernel was introduced by borowiecki and kwanik in 21
as follows if k  2 a subset s of vertices of a digraph d is a kindependent set if for every pair of different
vertices in s every walk between them has length at least k if l  1 we say that s is an labsorbent set if
for every x  v d  s there exists an xswalk with length at most l if k  2 and l  1 a k lkernel is a
subset of v d which is kindependent and labsorbent if l  k  1 the k lkernel is called a kkernel notice
that every 2kernel is a kernel several sufficient conditions for the existence of kkernels have been proved as
example see 14 15 and 20 in 14 the authors proved the following theorem
theorem 11 14 if d is a symmetric digraph then d has a kkernel for every k  2 moreover every
maximal kindependent set in d is a kkernel

a digraph is mcolored if its arcs are colored with m colors if d is an mcolored digraph a path in d is
called monochromatic respectively alternating if all of its arcs are colored alike respectively consecutive arcs
have different color a subset s of vertices of d is a kernel by monochromatic paths respectively kernel by
alternating walks if for every x  v d  s there exists a monochromatic xspath respectively an alternating
xswalk and no two different vertices in s are connected by a monochromatic path respectively by an
alternating walk notice that a digraph d has a kernel if an only if the mcolored digraph d in which every
two different arcs have different colors has a kernel by monochromatic paths the existence of kernels by
monochromatic paths in mcolored digraphs was studied primarily by sands sauer and woodrow in 25 it
is worth mentioning that galeanasnchez introduced the concept of kernel by monochromatic paths in 13
due to the difficulty of finding kernels by monochromatic paths in mcolored digraphs in 12 galeanasnchez
studied the color changes in an mcolored digraph in order to obtain conditions for the existence of kernels by
monochromatic paths as a consequence she defined the colorclass digraph of an mcolored digraph denoted
by c d as the digraph whose set of vertices are the colors represented in the arcs of d and c1  c2  is an
arc in c d if and only if there exist two arcs of d namely u v and v w such that u v has color c1 and
v w has color c2 
let h be a digraph possibly with loops and d a digraph without loops whose arcs are colored with the
vertices of h d is said to be an hcolored digraph for an arc x z of d we denote by x z its color
a vertex x  v d is obstructionfree in d if a b  ah whenever a  a x and b  a x we
say that a subdigraph d0 of d is an hdigraph if for every two arcs u v and v w in d0 we have that
u v v w  ah a directed walk path in d say w  x0      xn  is an hwalk hpath whenever
the consecutive colors encountered on w form a directed walk in h in 22 linek and sands introduced the
concept of hwalk and their work was later considered by several authors as example 2 8 16 and 24 a
subset s of vertices of d is absorbent by hpaths absorbent by hwalks if for every x  v d  s there exists
an xshpath xshwalk and s is said to be independent by hpaths independent by hwalks if for every
pair of different vertices u v  s there is no uvhpath uvhwalk between them a kernel by hpaths
or simply hkernel respectively kernel by hwalks is a subset of vertices of d that is both absorbent by
hpaths and independent by hpaths respectively absorbent by hwalks and independent by hwalks
if d is an hcolored digraph an hclass partition of ad is a partition of ad say f  such that for every
u v v w  ad u v v w  ah if and only if there exists f in f such that u v v w  f 


if x  v d we define nf
x  f  f  u x  f for some u  v d nf
x  f  f  x v  f for


some v  v d and nf x  nf x  nf x if f is an hclass partition of ad the hclass digraph
relative to f  denoted by cf d is the digraph such that v cf d  f  and fi  fj  is an arc in cf d
if and only if there exist u v  fi and v w  fj for some u v w  v d notice that cf d can allow
loops moreover c d is a particular case of cf d when h has only loops every vertex in h has a loop and
every class in f consist in those arcs colored alike an hclass partition f is walkpreservative if for every
f g  acf d and z  v dhf i there exists a zwpath in dhf i for some w  v dhgi notice that
w  v dhf i  v dhgi
if w  x0      xn  is a walk in an hcolored digraph d and i  0     n  1 we say that there is an
obstruction on xi iff xi1  xi  xi  xi1  
 ah indices are taken modulo n if x0  xn  we denote by
oh w  the set i  0     n  1  there is an obstruction on xi  the hlength of w  denoted by lh w  is
defined as lh w   oh w   1 if w is open or lh w   oh w  otherwise the hlength was primarily
studied by galeanasnchez and snchezlpez in 16 for closed walks and by andenmatten galeanaschez
and pach in 1 for open paths clearly the usual length lw  coincides with the hlength lh w  in the very
particular case when ah   an open walk in an hcolored digraph is an hwalk if and only if it has
hlength 1
it is worth mentioning that in 1 the authors defined the hlength for hcolored graphs and hcolored
digraphs a particular kind of hcoloring in graphs was studied by szeider in 26 and as a consequence in 1
was proved that under the assumption p 6 n p  finding uvpaths of minimum hlength in hcolored graphs
hcolored digraphs has no polynomial solution although there is a polynomial algorithm to find uvpaths of
minimum hlength for some h 1
let d be an hcolored digraph and s a subset of vertices of d if l  1 we say that s is an l habsorbent
set by paths respectively l habsorbent set by walks if for every vertex v  v d  s there exists a vspath
respectively vswalk whose hlength is at most l if k  2 we say that s is a k hindependent set by
paths respectively k hindependent set by walks if for every pair of different vertices in s every path
respectively walk between them has hlength at least k if k  2 and l  l we say that s is a k l hkernel
by paths respectively k l hkernel by walks if it is both k hindependent by paths and l habsorbent
by paths respectively k hindependent by walks and l habsorbent by walks if l  k  1 a k l hkernel by paths is called a k hkernel by paths respectively k hkernel by walks it is straightforward
to see that every kernel by hpaths respectively kernel by hwalks is a 2 hkernel by paths respectively
2 hkernel by walks and every k lkernel is a k l hkernel by paths and a k l hkernel by walks
in d if h has no arcs nor loops since finding k lkernels in digraphs is a n p complete problem finding
2

k l hkernels in hcolored digraphs is a n p complete problem
on the other hand the concepts of k l hkernel by paths and k l hkernel by walks are not equivalent
in 4 the authors showed an infinite family of digraphs with 2 hkernel by walks and no 2 hkernel by
paths and an infinite family of digraphs with 2 hkernel by paths and no 2 hkernel by walks
in 18 the authors showed that by applying conditions on cf d it is possible to guarantee the existence
of k hkernels by walks and k hkernels by paths in d in the same spirit in this paper we will show
sufficient conditions on f and cf d in order to guarantee the existence of k l hkernels by walks in hcolored digraphs and we will show that some conditions are tight moreover some hypothesis presented in this
paper can be verified in polynomial time

preliminary results

lemma 21 let d be a symmetric digraph and k l  n if 2  k and k  1  l then d has a k lkernel
proof it follows from theorem 21 and the definition of k lkernel
lemma 22 let d be an hcolored digraph f an hclass partition of ad and x  v d the following
assertions holds


a if d x 6 0 and d x 6 0 then for every f1  nf
x and f2  nf
x we have that f1  f2   acf d

b if x is obstructionfree in d and dx 6 0 then there is a unique f  f such that x  v dhf i
c if t is a walk in d such that oh t    then there is a unique f  f such that at   f 
d if u v and w are three different vertices in d t is a uvwalk and t 0 is a vwhwalk then either lh t 
t 0   lh t  or lh t  t 0   lh t   1


proof a if f1  nf
x and f2  nf
x then there exists u v  v d such that u x  f1 and x v  f2 
it follows from definition of cf d that f1  f2   acf d

b since dx 6 0 then there exists f  f such that x  v dhf i on the other hand since x is obstructionfree we have that ax  f  concluding that f is unique
c if t  x0      xn  then xi1  xi  xi  xi1   ah for every i  0     n  1 indices modulo n if
x0  xn  hence it follows from definition of hclass partition that there is a unique f  f such that
at   f 
d suppose that t  z0  u z1      zn  v and t 0  zn  v zn1      zm  w it is straightforward to see
that oh t  t 0   oh t   n and oh t   oh t  t 0  which implies that either lh t  t 0   lh t 
or lh t  t 0   lh t   1
lemma 23 if d is a digraph with no isolated vertices and k is a kernel by paths in d then for every x  k
d
d x 6 0
proof proceeding by contradiction suppose that there exists x  k such that d
d x  0 since d has no
isolated vertices then there exists y  v d such that x y  ad which implies that y 
 k hence there
exits a yzpath in d say p  such that z  k since d
x

0
we
have
that
z

6
x
which
implies
that x yp
d
is an xzpath in d with x z  k contradicting the independence by paths of k therefore d
d x 6 0
lemma 24 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad if s is a nonempty subset

of f and k is a kernel by paths in dhf s f i then for every x  k nf
x  s 
6 
proof let k be a kernel by paths in d0  dhf s f i and x  k by lemma 23 we have that d
d 0 x 6 0
hence there exists z  v d0  such that z x  ad0  it follows from definition of d0 that z x  f for some


f  s which implies that f  nf
x  s hence nf
x  s 
6 
lemma 25 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad if s is an independent set
in cf d then dhf s f i is an hsubdigraph of d
proof let d0  dhf s f i and u v v x  ad0  we will prove that u v v x  ah by
definition of d0  there exists f g  s such that u v  f and v x  g hence we have that f g 
acf d since s is an independent set in cf d then f  g which implies that u v v x  f  it
follows from the fact that f is an hclass partition of ad that u v v x  ah therefore d0 is an
hsubdigraph of d

lemma 26 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad if d is strongly connected
then cf d is strongly connected
proof let f and f 0 be different vertices in cf d and x0  x1  z0  z1   ad such that x0  x1   f and
z0  z1   f 0  it follows from the fact that d is strongly connected that there exists an x0 z1 walk in d say
c  w0      wn  whose initial arc is x0  x1  and ending arc is z0  z1 
since w0  w1   f  wn1  wn   f 0  and f 6 f 0  we can conclude that oh c 6  lemma 22 c let
oh c  1      r  for some r  1 and we can assume that i  i1 whenever i  1     r  1 for
every i  1     r let gi  f such that wi  wi   gi  notice that p  g1      gr  is a walk in cf d
and gr  f 0 
if 1  0 then f  g1  which implies that p is an f f 0 walk in cf d if 1 6 0 then f g1  
acf d which implies that f g1   p is an f f 0 walk in cf d hence we conclude that cf d is
strongly connected
corollary 27 let d be a strongly connected hcolored digraph and f a nontrivial hclass partition of
ad if s is an independent set in cf d then ncf d s 6 
proof since cf d is nontrivial and strongly connected lemma 26 then s 
6 v cf d as cf d is
strongly connected there exists an arc from s to v cf d  s which implies that ncf d s 6 
lemma 28 let d be an hcolored digraph f an hclass partition of ad s a nonempty subset of
v cf d such that dhf i is unilateral for every f  s k a kernel by walks in dhf s f i and x z  k
if x  v dhf1 i and z  v dhf2 i for some f1  f2   s then f1 6 f2 
proof proceeding by contradiction suppose that f1  f2  since dhf1 i is unilateral then either there exists
an xzpath in dhf1 i or there exists a zxpath in dhf1 i say p  it follows that p is a path in dhf s f i such
that x z  k which contradicts the independence by paths of k therefore f1 6 f2 
lemma 29 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad such that for every f  f 
dhf i is strongly connected the following assertions holds
a f is walkpreservative
b cf d is a symmetric digraph
c if s  v cf d is an independent set in cf d and f1  f2   s then v dhf1 i  v dhf2 i  
proof a let f g  acf d and x  v dhf i it follows from definition of cf d that there exists
u v z  v d such that u v  f and v z  g notice that v  v dhf i  v dhgi since dhf i is
strongly connected then there exists an xvwalk in dhf i which implies that f is walkpreservative
b let f1  f2   acf d it follows from definition of cf d that there exists u v z  v d such
that u v  f1 and v z  f2  since u v  adhf1 i then dhf1 i is a nontrivial strongly connected
digraph which implies that there exists u0  v dhf1 i such that v u0   f1  in the same way there exists
z 0  v dhf2 i such that z 0  v  f2  it follows from definition of cf d that f2  f1   acf d concluding
that cf d is a symmetric digraph
c proceeding by contradiction suppose that v dhf1 i  v dhf2 i 6  and consider x  v dhf1 i 
v dhf2 i since dhf1 i and dhf2 i are nontrivial strongly connected digraphs then there exist u  v dhf1 i
and z  v dhf2 i such that u x  adhf1 i and x z  adhf2 i it follows from definition of cf d that
f1  f2   acf d which is no possible since s is an independent set in cf d therefore v dhf1 i 
v dhf2 i  
proposition 210 let d be an hcolored digraph and f a nontrivial walkpreservative hclass partition of
ad such that cf d has no sinks if s is an independent set in cf d then there exists a kernel by paths
in dhf s f i say n  such that n  v dhgn  s gi
proof we will denote by d1 the digraph dhf s f i since cf d has no sinks then n  s 6  hence
denote by d2 the digraph dhgn  s gi let n be a kernel by paths in d1 intersecting v d2  the most
possible that is for every kernel by paths in d1  say n 0  we have that
n  v d2   n 0  v d2

notice that possibly n  v d2    we claim that n  v d2    proceeding by contradiction suppose
that there exists x0  n  v d2  since x0  v d1  it follows from definition of d1 that there exists f  s
such that x0  v dhf i by hypothesis cf d has no sinks which implies that there exists g  v cf d
such that f 6 g and f g  acf d it follows from the fact that f is a walkpreservative hclass

partition that there exists an x0 zpath in dhf i say c for some z  v dhgi notice that c is a path in d1 
z  v d1   v d2  and z 6 x0  moreover since n is independent by paths in d1  then z 
 n  we will prove
the following claims in order to get a contradiction
claim 1 there exists a zx0 path in d1 
since z 
 n  there exists a zypath in d1 for some y  n  say p 0  it follows that c  p 0 is an x0 ywalk
in d1 such that x0  n and y  n  which implies that x0  y concluding that p 0 is a zx0 path in d1 
claim 2 n  x0   z is a kernel by paths in d1 
in order to show that n 0  n  x0   z is an absorbent set by paths in d1  consider u  v d1   n 0 
if u  x0  then c is an x0 n 0 path in d1  if u 6 x0  then u  v d1   n  it follows from the fact that n is
an absorbent set by paths in d1 that there exists a uvpath in d1  say p  for some v  n  if v 6 x0  then
p is a un 0 path in d1  if v  x0  then p  c is a un 0 walk in d1  concluding that n 0 is an absorbent
set by paths in d1 
now we will show that n 0 is an independent set by paths in d1  proceeding by contradiction suppose
that there exists a uvpath in d1  say t  where u v  n 0  since n is an independent set by paths in d1 
then z  u v if z  u it follows that c  t is an x0 vwalk in d1  which contradicts the independence
by paths of n  if v  z by claim 1 there exists a zx0 path in d1  say p  which implies that t  p is a
ux0 walk in d1  contradicting the independence by paths of n  therefore n 0 is an independent set by
paths in d1  and the claim holds
notice that n 0 v d2   n v d2 1 which is no possible by 1 therefore n v d2    concluding
that n  v d2 
proposition 211 let d be an hcolored digraph with no isolated vertices f a walkpreservative hclass
partition of ad and s an independent and labsorbent set in cf d for some l  1 if k is a kernel by
paths in dhf s f i then k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks in d
proof let d0  dhf s f i and x0  v d  k if x0  v d0  since k is a kernel by paths in d0  there exists
an x0 kpath in d0  say t  it follows from lemma 25 that t is an hpath hence lh t   1 which implies
that lh t   l  1
now we will assume that x0 
 v d0  by hypothesis x0 is no isolated which implies that x0  v dhf0 i
for some f0  f  notice that f0 
 s because x0 
 v d0  since s is an labsorbent set in cf d we can
consider an f0 ft path with minimum length in cf d say t  f0      fr  where fr  s notice that r  l
since f is walkpreservative there exists x1  v dhf0 i  v dhf1 i such that there exists an x0 x1 path in dhf0 i say t0  and for every i  2     r  1 there exist xi  v dhfi1 i  v dhfi i and
xi1  v dhfi i  v dhfi1 i such that there exists an xi xi1 path in dhfi i say ti  notice that ti
is an hpath for every i  0     r  1 and xr  v d0  moreover since c is a path in cf d then
ati   atj    whenever i 6 j
0
now we consider c  r1
i0 ti  and suppose that c  z1      zn  notice that zn  v d  because
zn  xr 
claim 1 lh c  l  1
for every i  0     r  2 let ui  l  1     n  1  zl1  zl   fi  be and l  i  0     r  2 
ui 6  for every i  l define i  maxui 
we will show that oh c  i  i  l if m  oh c then it follows that zm1  zm  zm  zm1  

ah on the other hand we have that zm1  zm   atj  for some j  0     r  1 since tj is an
hpath then zm  zm1  
 atj  which implies that m  maxuj and j  r  2 hence m  i  i  l
it follows that oh c  l hence oh c  l that is oh c  r  1 and we can conclude that
lh c  l
if zn  k then by claim 1 we have that c is a x0 kpath with lh c  l  1 if zt 
 k since zn  v d0 
0
0
and k is an absorbent set by paths in d  then there exists a zn kpath in d  say tr  hence c 0  c  tr is
an x0 kwalk in d and by lemma 22 lh c 0   lh c  1 which implies that lh c 0   l  1
therefore k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks in d
notice that the conclusions in proposition 211 are tight we will show an example where k is not necessarily
an r habsorbent set by walks in d for some r  l  1 consider the hcolored digraph showed in figure
1 and for every i  1     6 let fi  e  ad  e  ci  clearly f  fi  i  1     6 is a walkpreservative hclass partition of ad notice that s  f6  is a 3absorbent set in cf d on the other
hand it is straightforward to see that k  x4  is a kernel by paths in dhf6 i which is not an r habsorbent
by walks in d for every r  1 2 3

figure 1
on the other hand if d is an hcolored digraph and f is an hclass partition which is no walkpreservative
then proposition 211 is not necessarily true consider the hcolored digraph showed in figure 2 for every
i  1     5 let fi  e  ad  e  ci  it is straightforward to see that f  fi  i  1     5 is an
hclass partition of ad notice that f2  f3  is an arc of cf d such that x3  v dhf2 i and there is no
x3 wwalk in dhf2 i with w  v dhf3 i that is f is not a walkpreservative hclass partition of ad on
the other hand s  f5  is a 4absorbent set in cf d but no kernel by paths in dhf5 i is a 5 habsorbent
set by walks in d

main results

the following lemmas will be useful
lemma 31 let d be a digraph with at least one arc w  x  v d  dx  0 and k l  n such that
2  k and 1  l if k is a k l hkernel by walks in d  w  then k  w is a k l hkernel by walks in d
lemma 32 if d is an hdigraph then every kernel by paths in d is a k l hkernel by walks in d for
every k  2 and l  1
proposition 33 let d be an hcolored digraph with no isolated vertices f a walkpreservative hclass
partition of ad and s  v cf d an independent and labsorbent set in cf d for some l  1 if
n  s   and k  2 then every kernel by paths in dhf s f i is a k l  1 hkernel by walks in d
proof let k be a kernel by paths in d0  dhf s f i since f is walk preservative it follows from proposition
211 that k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks in d now in order to prove that k is a k hindependent
set by walks in d for every k  2 we will show that k is a pathindependent set in d proceeding by
contradiction suppose that there exists an x1 xn path in d say t 0  x1      xn  such that x1  xn   k

consider f0  nf
x1   s lemma 24 hence there exists x0  v d such that x0  x1   f0  a x1  and
let t  x0  x1   t 0 be
if at   f0  then at 0   f0  which implies that t 0 is an x1 xn path in d0  contradicting the fact that k
is an independent set by paths in d0  hence at  6 f0  let t  mini  1     n  1  xi  xi1  
 f0  it

follows that xt1  xt   f0  and xt  xt1   g for some g  f with f 6 g notice that f g  acf d
and since s is and independent set in cf d then g 
 s therefore g  n  s which contradicts the

assumption that n s   hence k is pathindependent in d which implies that k is a k hindependent
set by walks in d for every k  2
therefore k is a k l  1 hkernel by walks in d for every k  2
corollary 34 let d be an hcolored digraph f a walkpreservative hclass partition of ad and k l  n
such that k  2 and l  1 if s is a k lkernel in cf d such that n  s   then d has a k l1 hkernel
by walks
proof let w  x  v d  dx  0 and k 0 a k lkernel in cf d such that n  s   since k 0 is an
independent and labsorbent set in cf d it follows from proposition 33 that d  w has a k l hkernel
by walks say k by lemma 31 we can conclude that k  w is a k l hkernel by walks in d
proposition 35 let d be an hcolored digraph and f a walkpreservative hclass partition of ad such
that cf d has a k lkernel say s if the following conditions holds
a cf d has no sinks and every cycle in cf d is either a loop or has length at least k

b for every x  v d such that nf x  s 6  and nf x  n  s 6  we have that nf
x  s

then d has a k l  1 hkernel by walks
proof first suppose that d has no isolated vertices let d1  dhf s f i since cf d has no sinks and s
is an independent set in cf d then n  s 6  now let d2  dhgn  s gi by proposition 210 we can
consider a kernel by paths in d1  say k such that k  v d2  we will show that k is a k l  1 hkernel
by walks in d
since f is walkpreservative it follows from proposition 211 that k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks
in d it only remains to show that k is a k hindependent set by walks in d first we will prove the
following useful claim

claim 1 for every x  k nf
x  ad1 

if x  k then x  v d1   v d2  since x  v d1  it follows from definition of d1 that there exists
f  s such that ax  f 6  hence nf x  s 6  on the other hand since x  v d2  an analogous

proof will show that nf x  n  s 6  by hypothesis b we can conclude that nf
x  s
in order to show that k is a k hindependent set by walks in d consider an x0 xn walk in d say
t  x0      xn  such that x0  xn   k
claim 2 oh t  6 
proceeding by contradiction suppose that oh t    hence there exists f 0  f such that at   f 0 
which implies that xn1  xn   f 0  it follows from claim 1 that f 0  s hence t is an x0 xn walk in
d1  which contradicts the fact that k is an independent set by paths in d1  therefore oh t  6  and
the claim holds
by claim 2 suppose that oh t   i  i  1     t where t  1 and i  i1 for every i 
1     t  1 on the other hand for every i  1     t consider fi  f such that xi  x
i   fi  and
f0  f such that x0  x1   f0  it follows from definition of cf d that t 0  f0  f1      ft  is a walk in
cf d notice that lh t   lt 0   1 and by claim 1 ft  s consider the following cases
case 1 f0  s
if f0 6 ft  as s is a kindependent set in cf d then lt 0   k which implies that lh t   k if
f0  ft  then t 0 is a closed walk in cf d which is not a loop and by hypothesis lt 0   k hence
lh t   k
case 2 f0  v cf d  s

by lemma 24 consider f  nf
x0   s since f0 
 s then f 6 f0  it follows from definition of cf d
00
0
that t  f f0   t is a walk in cf d notice that lh t   lt 00  if f 6 ft  as s is a kindependent
set in cf d we have that lt 00   k which implies that lh t   k if f  ft  then t 00 is a closed walk
in cf d which is not a loop and by hypothesis lt 00   k hence lh t   k

it follows from case 1 and case 2 that k is a k hindependent set by walks in d therefore k is a
k l  1kernel by walks in d
now suppose that w  x  v d  dx  0 is nonempty by the the previous proof we have that d w
has a k l  1 hkernel by walks say k by lemma 31 we can conclude that k  w is a k l  1 hkernel
by walks in d

as a consequence of proposition 35 we have the following result for strongly connected digraphs
corollary 36 let d be a strongly connected hcolored digraph and f a walkpreservative hclass partition
of ad such that cf d has a k lkernel say s if the following conditions holds
a every cycle in cf d is either a loop or has length at least k

b for every x  v d such that nf x  s 6  and nf x  n  s 6  we have that nf
x  s

then d has a k l  1 hkernel by walks
proof if d is an hdigraph it follows from lemma 32 that for every k  2 and l  1 d has a k l hkernel
by walks hence we may assume that d is not an hdigraph it follows that cf d is a nontrivial strongly
connected digraph lemma 26 which implies that cf d has no sinks by proposition 35 we have that d
has a k l  1 hkernel by walks
proposition 37 let d be an hcolored digraph with no isolated vertices f a walkpreservative hclass
partition of ad and s a k lkernel in cf d such that k  3 and l  1 if for every f  s dhf i is
unilateral and has no sinks then every kernel by paths in dhf s f i is a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d
proof let k be a kernel by paths in d1  dhf s f i since f is a walkpreservative hclass partition it
follows from proposition 211 that k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks in d it only remains to show
that k is a k  1 hindependent set by walks in d consider a walk in d say c  x0      xn  such that
x0  xn   k


claim 1 nf
x0   s 
6  and nf
xn   s 
6 

since x0  k it follows from lemma 24 that nf
x0 s 6  on the other hand since xn  v d1  then
xn  v dhf i for some f  s by hypothesis dhf i has no sinks which implies that a xn   f 6 


hence f  nf
xn  concluding that f  nf
xn   s and the claim holds


by claim 1 consider f 0  nf
x0   s and f 00  nf
xn   s it follows from lemma 28 that f 0 6 f 00 

claim 2 oh c 6 
proceeding by contradiction suppose that oh c   hence there exists f  f such that ac  f 
by definition of cf d we have that f 0  f  f f 00   acf d since f 0  f 00   s and s is an
independent set in cf d then f 6 f 0 and f 6 f 00  hence f 0  f f 00  is an f 0 f 00 path in cf d
which is no possible since s is a kindependent set with k  3 therefore oh c 6  and the claim
holds
by claim 2 suppose that oh c  i  i  1     t where t  1 and i  i1 for every i 
1     t1 for every i  1     t let fi  f such that xi  x
i   fi  and f0  f such that x0  x1   f0 
notice that x0  v dhf0 i and xn  v dhft i on the other hand it follows from definition of cf d that
c0  f0  f1      ft  is a walk in cf d consider the following cases
case 1 f0  s
first suppose that ft  s notice that c0 is a walk in cf d such that lh c  1  lc0  on the
other hand we have that f0  ft   s x0  v dhf0 i and xn  v dhft i which implies that f0 6 ft
lemma 28 since s is a kindependent set in cf d we have that lc0   k we can conclude that
lh c  k  1
now suppose that ft 
 s and consider c1  c0  ft  f 00  notice that c1 is a walk in cf d such that
lh c  lc1  on the other hand we have that f0  f 00   s x0  v dhf0 i and xn  v dhf 00 i
which implies that f0 6 f 00 lemma 28 since s is a kindependent set in cf d then lc1   k we
can conclude that lh c  k  1
case 2 f0  v cf d  s
first suppose that ft  s and consider c2  f 0  f0   c0  notice that c2 is a walk in cf d such
that lh c  lc2  on the other hand we have that f 0  ft   s x0  v dhf 0 i and xn  v dhft i
which implies that f 0 6 ft lemma 28 since s is a kindependent set in cf d then lc2   k we
can conclude that lh c  k  1
now suppose that ft 
 s and consider c3  f 0  f0   c0  ft  f 00  notice that c3 is a walk in
cf d such that lh c  1  lc3  on the other hand by  we have that f 0 6 f 00 and since s is a
kindependent set in cf d then lc3   k we can conclude that lh c  k  1

it follows from the previous cases that k is a k  1 hindependent set by walks in d therefore k is a
k  1 l  1kernel by walks in d
corollary 38 let d be an hcolored digraph f a walkpreservative hclass partition of ad such that for
every f  f  dhf i is unilateral and has no sinks if cf d has a k lkernel for some k  3 and l  1 then
d has a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks
proof first suppose that d has no isolated vertices if s is a k lkernel in cf d with k  3 and l  1
then by proposition 37 every kernel by paths in dhf s f i is a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d
on the other hand if w  x  v d  dx  0 is nonempty then by the previous proof we have
that d  w has a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks say k by lemma 31 we can conclude that k  w is a
k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d
corollary 39 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad if for every f  f we
have that dhf i is strongly connected then for every k  2 and l  k  1 d has a k l hkernel by walks
proof first suppose that d has no isolated vertices since dhf i is strongly connected for every f  f  we
have that f is walkpreservative lemma 29 a and dhf i is unilateral and has no sinks for every f  f 
on the other hand by lemma 29 b we have that cf d is a symmetric digraph which implies that cf d
has a k  1 l  1kernel for every k  1  3 and l  1  k lemma 21 hence by corollary 38 we have that
d has a k l hkernel by walks for every k  2 and l  k  1
on the other hand if w  x  v d  dx  0 is nonempty then by the previous proof we have that
d  w has a k l hkernel by walks for every k  2 and l  k  1 by lemma 31 we can conclude that d
has a k l hkernel by walks for every k  2 and l  k  1
proposition 310 let d be an hcolored digraph f an hclass partition of ad and s a k lkernel of
cf d for some k  3 and l  1 if for every f  s dhf i is strongly connected and has a obstructionfree
vertex in d then d has a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks
proof first suppose that d has no isolated vertices let s  f1      fr  for some r  1 and for every
i  1     r let zi  v dhfi i such that zi is obstructionfree in d by lemma 29 c we have that zi 6 zj
whenever i j  1     r and i 6 j 
claim 1 k  zi  i  1     r is a kernel by paths in d1  dhf s f i
in order to show that k is an absorbent set by paths in d1  consider w  v d1   k since w  v d1 
then there exists j  1     r such that w  v dhfj i it follows from the fact that dhfj i is strongly
connected that there exists a wzj path in dhfj i say p  hence p is a wkpath in d1  concluding that
k is an absorbent set by paths in d1 
it only remains to show that k is a pathindependent set in d1  it follows from lemma 29 c that
v dhfi i  v dhfj i   for every i j  1    r with i 6 j which implies that there is no zi zj path
in d1 for every i j  1    r with i 6 j hence k is a pathindependent set in d1  and the claim
holds
now we will show that k is a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d in order to show that k is an l  1 habsorbent set by walks in d notice that f is a walkpreservative partition of ad lemma 29 a and since
k is a kernel by walks in d1  we can conclude from proposition 211 that k is an l  1 habsorbent set by
walks in d
it only remains to show that k is a k  1 hindependent set by walks in d consider zi  zj   k with
i 6 j and a zi zj walk in d say c  zi  x0  x1     xn  zj 
claim 2 oh c 6 
proceeding by contradiction suppose that oh c   which implies that there exists f  f such
that ac  f  since zi and zj are obstructionfree in d then f  fi and f  fj lemma 22 b
concluding that fi  fj  which is no possible since fi 6 fj  hence oh c 6  and the claim holds
by claim 2 suppose that oh c  i  i  1     t where t  1 and i  i1 for every i 
1     t  1 for every i  1     t let gi  f such that xi  x
i   gi  and g0  f such that
x0  x1   g0  it follows from definition of cf d that c 0  g0  g1      gt  is a walk in cf d notice that
zi  v dhg0 i zj  v dhgt i and lh c  lc 0   1 since zi and zj are obstructionfree in d then fi  g0
and fj  gt lemma 22 b which implies that g0  gt   s and g0 6 gt  since s is a kindependent set in
cf d then lc 0   k which implies that lh c  k  1 hence k is a k  1 hindependent set by walks
in d therefore k is a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d
on the other hand if w  x  v d  dx  0 is nonempty then by the previous proof we have
that d  w has a k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks say k by lemma 31 we can conclude that k  w is a
k  1 l  1 hkernel by walks in d

theorem 311 if d is an hcolored digraph such that for every vertex x  v d there exists an xwhwalk
for some vertex obstructionfree w in d then d has an kernel by hwalks
proof first we define the digraph d0 whose vertex set consists in the obstructionfree vertices of d and
x z  ad0  if and only if there exists an xzhwalk in d now we will show that d0 has a kernel say k
by proving that d0 is a transitive digraph then a simple proof will show that k is a kernel by hwalks in d
in order to show that d0 is a transitive digraph consider u v v w  ad0  it follows from definition
of d0 that there exists a uvhwalk in d say w1  and a vwhwalk in d say w2  since v is a obstructionfree
vertex in d then we have that w1  w2 is a uwhwalk in d which implies that u w  ad0  concluding
that d0 is a transitive digraph
since d0 is a transitive digraph consider a kernel in d0  say k we will show that k is a kernel by hwalks
in d it follows from definition of d0 and the fact that k is an independent set in d0  that k is an independent
set by hwalks in d it only remains to show that k is an absorbent set by hwalks in d
consider x  v d  k if x is a obstructionfree vertex in d then x  v d0  and since k is a kernel
in d0  there exists w  k such that x w  ad0  which implies that there exists an xwhwalk in d if
x
 v d0  then by hypothesis there exists z  v d0  and an xzhwalk in d say w1  if z  k then w1 is a
xkhwalk in d if z 
 k then there exists w  k such that z w  ad0  which implies that there exists
an zwhwalk in d say w2  since z is a obstructionfree vertex in d then w1  w2 is an xkhwalk in d
concluding that k is a kernel by hwalks in d
corollary 312 if d is an mcolored digraph such that for every vertex x  v d there exists a monochromatic
xwwalk with color c for some vertex w such that every arc in aw has color c then d has a kernel by
monochromatic paths
proof consider the digraph h whose vertices are the colors represented in ad and ah  c c  c 
v h since d is an hcolored digraph satisfying the hypothesis on lemma 311 it follows that d has a
kernel by hwalks which is a kernel by monochromatic paths in d
corollary 313 if d is an mcolored digraph such that for every vertex x  v d there exists a alternating
xwwalk for some vertex w such that a w and a w have no colors in common then d has a kernel by
properly colored walks
proof consider the digraph h whose vertices are the colors represented in ad and ah  c d  c d 
v h c 6 d since d is an hcolored digraph satisfying the hypothesis on theorem 311 it follows that d
has a kernel by hwalks which is a kernel by alternating walks in d
theorem 314 let d be an hcolored digraph and f an hclass partition of ad such that for every f  f 
dhf i is strongly connected and has a obstructionfree vertex in d for every k  2 d has a k hkernel by
walks
proof since cf d is a symmetric digraph lemma 29 b for every k  2 we have that cf d has a
kkernel theorem 11 by theorem 310 d has a k hkernel by walks for every k  3 on the other hand
it follows from theorem 311 that d has a 2 hkernel by walks concluding that d has a k hkernel by
walks for every k  2
