abstract we analyze the top lyapunov exponent of the transfer matrix for the nearest
neighbor ising chain with random external field this lyapunov exponent coincides
with the free energy of the ising chain with random external field but it also plays a
central role in the analysis of the two dimensional ising model with columnar disorder
and of the quantum chain with transverse random field we obtain its sharp behavior
in the large interaction limit when the external field is centered this balanced case
turns out to be critical in many respects from a mathematical standpoint we precisely
identify the behavior of the top lyapunov exponent of a product of two dimensional
random matrices close to a diagonal random matrix for which top and bottom lyapunov
exponents coincide in particular the lyapunov exponent is only loghlder continuous

i1 if d  1 the transfer matrix of the ising model with external magnetic field h and
nearest neighbor interaction potential j is equal to ehj times 11 with   e2j
and z  e2h  therefore the free energy density of the model is h  j plus the largest
among the two eigenvalues of m 
i2 if d  2 on the square lattice and for h  0 one can still express the partition
function of the model in terms of the largest eigenvalue of m with an adequate
choice of  j1  and z  zj1  j2  where j1 and j2 are the horizontal and vertical
nearest neighbor interactions and  is a phase arising from a fourier transform in the
nonrandom direction in particular the free energy density can be expressed as the
integral of such an eigenvalue for fixed j1 and j2  over     with the small 
long wavelengths being relevant for the critical behavior in this limit ie  small
 j1  becomes proportional to  and we point out also that the  or  small limit
clearly corresponds to large j in i1
i3 the ground state analysis of the d  1 quantum ising field with traverse field leads
once again to the same matrix problem and it is directly connected to the d  2
classical model discussed in i2 see eg 20
for the d  1 non quantum case there is no phase transition ie the free energy
is a real analytic function and this is just the regularity of the leading eigenvector of a

matrix with positive entries but for d  2 or in the d  1 quantum case there is a
phase transition this is possible due to the fact that  j1   0 for   0 and  so we
are no longer in the context of matrices with positive entries and the two eigenvalues may
coincide when j1 and j2 are positive this can happen only if   0 these solutions
are to a certain extent robust with respect to introduction of some types of disorder
for example in d  1 if h varies from site to site and it is the realization of a sequence
hj jz of random variables for example iid then the free energy expression still holds
provided we replace the leading eigenvalue of the single matrix with the top lyapunov
exponent of the sequence

where k  k is an arbitrary norm of matrices and of course zj  e2hj    e2j  analogously in the d  2 and with columnar disorder  j2 is replaced by an iid sequence  the
free energy is equal to the lyapunov exponent averaged over the phase 22 23 27
the large interaction limit for the disordered external field one dimensional ising model

where  is the only nonzero real solution of ez    1 and cz is a positive constant the
assumption on the values of z is important in 12 an example without this property
is given in which cz must be replaced by a logperiodic function is given in 14 13
has been proven under the stronger assumption that the law of z has a compact support
bounded away from zero and that z has a c 1 density beyond the application this result
identifies a singular behavior of the lyapunov exponents and enters the field of inquiry into
the regularity of lyapunov exponents eg 19 2 28 as a case in which the singularity
is sharply identified
in this work we focus on elog z  0 since we assume also z non trivial we have that
ez    1 is solved only by   0 we will discuss in  14 what is known if elog z 6 0
and ez  1 in this case   1 as opposed to   0 1 of 13
the elog z  0 or   0 case has been considered in 24 434 and pp 12181220
where the authors claim via formal expansions that for   0

for a specific class of laws of z superposition of one biexponential and one dirac delta
moreover the 2scale approach of 12 can be generalized and leads to a prediction in the
spirit of 14 for arbitrary distributions of z 11 see also the discussion on weak disorder
limits in section 14
our aim is obtaining a mathematical control on l for   0 for a wide class of laws
for z we anticipate that our results will hold asymptotically under the assumption that
z has a suitably regular density and without requiring the support to be bounded but
both z and 1z are in lp for a p  1 as in 14 we will start from the 2scale idea of
12 what is done in 12 is to guess a probability measure  we call it the dh probability
 that should be sufficiently close to the furstenberg probability on the projective space

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

3

ie simply the sector 0 2 because we work with positive matrices in dimension two
with which one can explicitly express the lyapunov exponent the measure essentially
concentrates near 0 but a much finer description is needed the 2scale idea is about
gluing together an   0 limit problem near 0 and another limit problem near 2 both
problems are non trivial and they require a quantitative understanding of the invariant
measure of a chain that appears in the context of one dimensional random walks in
random environment rwre 7 17 16 and in random affine iterations 6 even if the
problems at 0 and 2 are in a sense dual problems when elog z 6 0 they are actually
different in nature one of the two chains is positive recurrent the other is transient in
14 we first gave a rigorous construction of the dh probability  this is essentially an
asymptotic matching problem  and then we showed that this probability is sufficiently
close to the furstenberg probability to yield 13 in the key second step we exploited a
contraction property under the random matrix action of a suitable norm that depends
on a parameter   0  the contraction factor is precisely ez    1
when elog z  0 there are two major changes with respect to the elog z 6 0 case 
1 the two limit problems change nature they become two qualitatively identical problems  if z has the same law as 1z they are the same problem  and they are both
null recurrent these chains are associated to a balanced rwre also known as sinai
walk and they are a particular critical random difference equation these chains do not
have an invariant probability but they do have a unique finite measure on which we
need a sharp control in order to perform the gluing procedure the gluing procedure
builds the dh measure which is a probability measure and is close to the invariant
probability of the chain we are interested in which is positive recurrent
2 elog z  0 means   0 so there is no room to apply the contractive procedure
of 14 as a matter of fact this problem is critical in the sense of 1 4 and the
contraction property exploited in 14 is simply not there we take this occasion
to stress that elog z  0 is rather is expected to be since mathematically the
problem is open also the criticality condition for the two dimensional ising model
with columnar disorder 22 23 and 8 app a
we will nevertheless take the dh path we are going to explain in  13 how we do it
notably how we deal with the lack of the contraction property but first let us introduce
more formally the model and state our main result
12 the main result for what follows it is more natural to work with zj  log zj and
let z be a variable that is distributed like the zj s on z we assume
1 exponential integrability namely that there exists   0 such that
p z  x  o exp x 

15

2 z has a density  which is uniformly hlder continuous for a   0 1 ie

we remark that these hypotheses imply that  is locally bounded and that x

every p  1 
of course we assume ez  0

1  2 and  depend only on the law of z for j we have a semiexplicit expression
see 312 and for  we give an explicit lower bound note that theorem 11 is stated also
for   0 we can pass from  to  by conjugation via the diagonal matrix with 1 1
on the diagonal
theorem 11 shows in particular that l is not hlder continuous this is not in
contrast with 19 2 because we are looking at the neighborhood of random matrices in
which there is no separation between the two lyapunov exponents in the osedelec sense
3 ch iv we take this occasion also to point out that with respect to the well known
halperin example in the context of anderson localization 28 app 3 the singularity
identified by theorem 11 as well as 13 is present also if  is c  or even analytic and
it is not related to low regularity of the law of z like in the halperin case
13 a walk through our approach the dh strategy for   0 in order to explain
our approach we make a change of perspective on the problem by setting
k   log  

18

so that the original matrix m of 11 becomes

expk

19
expk  z expz
and if we parametrize p r2  
 r with the coordinates 1 expxt we readily see that the
action of the matrix 19 is

 k
e  ex
 z  hk x 
110
x 7 z  log

we observe that hk  is odd and x 7 x  hk x which is also odd is small if x  k k
and far from the boundary points k

so hk x is very close to x on an interval that approaches r in the limit k   see
fig 2
denote by x  xn n01 the markov chain generated by the map 110 that is
xn1  zn1  hk xn  

112

since the image of hk is k k the process xn  hardly leaves k k and when the
process is in k k and far from the boundaries it is close to being a random walk with
centered increments
x is an irreducible positive recurrent markov chain see the beginning of appendix a
and via its invariant probability k one has that

where the first equality is an abuse of notation aon that we will systematically commit
the formula 113 will be further explained later on see in particular 27 but it is

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

what follows by specializing the furstenberg formula for the top lyapunov exponent 3
th 36 to our context
since x is close to being a symmetric random walk in the bulk and because of the strong
containing effect at the boundary it is natural to expect that the invariant probability is
going to be close to the lebesgue measure times a suitable constant 1ck in the bulk
and this measure should decay quickly outside k k if this is the case ck  2k in the
k   limit if we insert this guess into 113 we readily see that the leading contribution
comes from x close to k on the scale k by this we mean an interval centered in k of
diverging length ok we are therefore interested in focusing on how the process looks
from k so we consider xn  k and we readily see that the process that appears for
k   is
yn1  zn1  h yn 
with hy  y  log1  expy 
114
this new markov chain of which we will give a detailed treatment has a strong repulsion
at zero forcing y to live most of time in the positive semiaxis but there is no mechanism
that bounds y from above in fact y is null recurrent and the non normalizable invariant
measure does approach a multiple of the lebesgue measure far from the origin the
random iteration 114 is the critical random difference equation that emerges in the
analysis of sinai walks 1 4 6 29 consequently the literature is extensive notably on
the behavior of the invariant measure of the y process at  however the focus for us
is twofold
1 characterizing the local part of the invariant measure and the behavior at 
2 obtaining a sharp estimate on the behavior at 
while point 1 is central because it determines the leading behavior of 113 point
2 is as important because the invariant measure of y just provides the dh guess on
the negative and positive semiaxes separately they are essentially symmetric problems
but we need a sharp asymptotic analysis at  of the two measures ie at the origin
which is very far from both k and k to glue them together the results available on
this problem are obtained in too general a context and they are too weak for our purposes

figure 1 the solid line gives density of the invariant probability for k  10 and
z  12  310  1    1 with  a bernoulli with success probability 23 and
 a standard gaussian with  and  independent the distribution of z is asymmetric
and bimodal the densities of the two non normalizable measures that build the dh
measure are essentially given by the prolongation of the plateau to the right for one
measure and to the left for the other one dashed lines

once the dh probability kdh explicit is built its closeness to the invariant probability
k not explicit has to be established what is directly accessible is the action of the
one step markov kernel t  tk on kdh and we certainly want t kdh  kdh small in

14 this closeness is estimated for   0 in terms of a norm  indexed by   0 
and the key point is that kdh  k  is bounded above by c t kdh  kdh   with
c  11  ez   if   0 ie ez    1 we work with ez   0 is well defined
too it is simply the l1 norm of the primitive of  which is in l1  and in fact 0 is or
could be a good norm for our purposes the problem is that c0  
to get around this problem we take an approach that avoids using contraction properties in fact we show that the bound holds with c0  c0 k which is ok 2  up to
logarithmic corrections the divergence of c0 k can be overcome if t kdh  kdh 0
decays faster that k 2  with our hypotheses this decay is exponential in k
remark 12 at this stage the dominant role of k with respect to k may appear strange
but this is just an artifact of the choice of 113 which is the formula that one obtains
when looking at the exponential growth of the 1 1 entry of the matrix but k takes the
leading stand if we consider the formula stemming out of the exponential growth of the
2 2 entry see 27 of course the lyapunov exponent does not depend on the choice
of entry this is discussed further in remark 32
14 generalizations more on the literature and organization of the paper
the case elog z 6 0 and ez  1 under these hypotheses ez    1 has a solution for
  1 unless pz  0 1  1 and this last case can be looked upon as    case
we assume in any case that z is not a constant one can find in 12 an argument in
pbc
favor of the fact that l  j0 cj 2j  c 2  o2  at least for  6 z results
in this direction can be found in 15 that we cite also for more complete results let us
point out however that identifying the singular behavior that is the presence of c 2 
is an open problem and the approach we employ does not seem to be appropriate when
this is a subleading term ie   1
weak disorder limits the weak disorder limit corresponds in dynamical terms to a very
slow dynamics this allows to rescale time and the arising dynamics is a two dimensional
system of stochastic odes that can be exactly solved this limit dynamics has the
remarkable property that the furstenberg probability has an explicit formula which leads
to an expression for the lyapunov exponent in terms of bessel functions to our knowledge
this appeared first in the works of mccoy and wu 22 but similar computations for related
systems were already in the literature see8 9 10 20 26 for recent works on weak disorder
limits and historical overviews deriving the full asymptotic expansion of the lyapunov
exponent is then a somewhat cumbersome but straightforward exercise 8 prop 13
particularly relevant for us is the   0 limit behavior of the lyapunov exponent for
  0 8 111 which can be refined to 8 end of sec 4

1
 o 2 
115
4 log1  log 2  
where  is the eulermascheroni constant and the o2  which can be explicitly expressed
is non zero of course the last formula should be compared to our main result 17
as already pointed out in 8 the extremely sharp matching of the finite disorder case
and the infinitesimal disorder case is mathematically quite surprising not only the leading
order matches but the structure of the subheading terms is the same to the extent of
what is known however there does not appear to be any way to recover finite disorder
results from infinitesimal disorder computations this is particularly unfortunate for the

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

7

d  2 columnar disorder case 22 23 27 mccoy and wu used the weak disorder limit to
infer results about the model and setting forth a precise and highly non trivial prediction
for the critical behavior that represents a challenge for mathematicians see 8 app a
and references therein
what about lower regularity of the distribution of the disorder our approach does not
capture only the leading behavior but also the main subleading correction and gives a
very small error term much like 115 which stems instead from an exact computation
clearly in estimating the error term there seems to be a lot of room for example it would
be sufficient to show the one step estimate that kt kdh  kdh k1  ok c  for a c  2
but our approach naturally yields an exponential estimate see 310 this approach ie
estimating the inverse laplace transform strongly relies on an appropriate regularity of 
ie asymptotic decay in fourier space the imaginary direction for the laplace transform
and yields leading term subleading correction and exponential bounds it is really not
clear whether our one step bound procedure could go through with less regularity
as a matter of fact we are unable to treat the exactly solvable case of 24 in this case
the laplace transform of the invariant finite measures are more explicit but they have
a poor decay in the imaginary direction
more general matrices all we did can be greatly generalized and this discussion applies
to 14 too matrices of the form

can be dealt with in a straightforward way under suitable hypotheses for the first example

e
out and the key variable becomes zz for the second example the analysis does not
contain much novelty if z z 0 and z 00 are independent and positive and if we require on
the marginal laws of z 0 and z 00 the same integrability and regularity we have required for
z a complete analysis of two dimensional matrices with positive entries approaching for
  0 a diagonal matrix might be of interest but it is probably rather cumbersome and
the ising model motivation is lost some higher dimension matrices generalizations are
treated in 15 app a
organization of what follows in section 2 we study the main markov chain x we state
in proposition 22 the crucial bound that we call reduction to one step estimate we also
study the auxiliary chain y that is central in the construction of the dh probability
in section 3 we construct the dh probability and perform the one step bound the
proof of our main result theorem 11 is in this section right after proposition 33
in section 4 we prove the reduction to one step estimate ie proposition 22
2 the underlying markov chains
in general if z is a random variable we use gz x  pz  x and fz x  1 
gz x this notation is used also for finite measures  g x  x  and f x 
 x we will work also with non normalizable finite measures notably with
measures  such that  x   for every x and the notation f x will be used
also in this case

and by the change of variable z  x  hk y we complete the proof of the first identity

it is well known that the lyapunov exponent can be expressed in terms the invariant
probability for the action of the random matrix on the projective circle 3 ch 2 and
for two by two matrices with positive entries we can work on 0 2 or considering the
tangent of this angle on 0  see 14 16 or 12 sec 2 our parametrization choice
p r2  
 r recall 19110 just corresponds to applying the logarithm to the tangent
of the angle and it suffices to apply this change of variables to the expressions in 12 14
which take advantage of the specific form of the matrix under consideration to obtain a

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

simpler expression than the standard furstenberg formula we obtain that by writing k

proof since the markov chain xn  is irreducible and positive recurrent see the beginning
of section a limn t n g x  gk x for every x  r which is a continuity point of gk 
we will see that gk  is continuous see remark 28 but at this stage this is not needed
since the set of discontinuities of gk  is countable hence of lebesgue measure zero

the proof of proposition 24 is given for completeness in the appendix the markov
chain y is a very particular case of the critical random difference equation problem
see 1 4 6 and references therein we sketch a concise proof of proposition 24 because
the context of 1 4 6 is really much wider and proposition 24 can be proven with
substantially easier arguments
we conclude this section by studying the asymptotic behavior of f  from the results
of 4 6 one can extract that f x   x  cx for x   however our techniques
require a stronger result see 213 below which requires substantially more constraining
requirements than the hypotheses in 4 6
here is a preliminary result that allows the use of the laplace transform besides being
an immediate consequence of the analysis in 4 6 it can also be extracted from 14
lemma 33 since context and notations here are slightly different we give the proof in
the appendix we make a definite choice of f by stipulating that f x0   1 for an x0
which is strictly inside the support of 
lemma 25 there exists c  0 such that f x  c expcx for every x  x0 
here is the main result of this section
proposition 26 there exist three constants m  0 c  r and   0 1 such that
for x  
f x  m x  c  o exp x 
213
0
moreover for every   0  recall 15 for  we have for x  

f x  o exp 0 x 
214
the constants carry the subscript  because they are primarily determined by  but
m and c depend also on the arbitrary choice of x0  c m and  instead depend only
on 
proof we start with 213 we are going to use the laplace transform for non
r
negative functions and measures supported on 0  fbu  r expuxf  dx

b
0 expuxf  dx and if f is absolutely continuous f u  0 expuxf x dx if
ff x  expcx for x large then fbu is analytic in the complex half plane u  c and
fbu  fbu
in order to use the laplace transform to study the righttail of  we introduce yen 
log1  expyn  then yen  is a markov chain with




 

yen1  log 1  exp zn1  yen
 zn1  yen  log 1  exp  zn1  yen

215
e
analogous to 211 the chains yn  and yn  are equivalent and the invariant measure 
of yen  is directly related to  in particular  is finite f x  0 for every x  0 and
by proposition 24 f x   for every x in fact we have f x  f log1  expx

11

so we can replace f x with f x in 213 obtaining an equivalent expression note the

that in the same domain

217

so b  c on the other hand proposition 24 tells us that b  0 because r

with p  the prefactor and i the integral we remark that this allows to analytically
continue iu to smaller values of u even down to u  w0  1 and w0 is chosen larger
but arbitrarily close to b  but p u has a singularity at u  0 as we are going to
explain
 u  1u has a simple pole at u  0 like for all the negative integers and these
are the only singularities moreover the  function has no zero

so p  does contribute a simple pole at z  0 a priori there is still the possibility that
i0  0 making this singularity removable but in fact this is not possible because we
have already remarked that b  0
we have therefore proven not only that b  0 but also that

extended to z  c  z    and the only singularity in this region is the simple pole

similarly  has a density but the argument needs to be refined equation 234 still
holds also without the subscripts k but because r   we need an appropriate upper
bound for xhy in order to take the derivative under the integral since  x 

14

g giacomin and r l greenblatt

 for every x   l reduces the problem to finding and upper bound for y  0 and
large of course we can focus on x in a compact set but this follows because there exists
  0 and z0 such that z  expz for z  z0  in order to show this and to make the
argument more readable let us replace z with z if z  expz for z larger
than some value z0 is false then there exists a sequence zj  with limj zj   and zj  
expzj  uniform hlder continuity rimplies that z  expzj 2 for z  zj  

ezj 2c1  so possibly for j large zj 2 z dz  expzj ezj 2c1  since
the lefthand side decays exponentially by choosing   0 small we reach a contradiction
so we have shown that  vanishes exponentially fast using that  x has linear
asymptotic growth f  c 1 follows
3 the dh probability the one step bound and the proof the main result
we now define the dh probability ie the measure that we expect and will prove to
be close to the invariant probability k  it is built by gluing together the invariant measure
for the edge process at k and for the one at k unless  is symmetric the two edge limit
problems are not the same since the one on the left involves x 7 x as jump density
probability and the one one the right involves x 7 x so the cumulative function on
the left respectively right edge will be denoted by fc  respectively fb  moreover
we choose to normalize the cumulative functions so that they are for x   equivalent
to x proposition 26 than says that there exist cs  r s is c or b and   0 1 such
that for x  
fs x  x  cs  o expx 
31
we define the dh probability by giving its integrated tail probability gk x  kdh x 
cf sec 13

fb k  xck
if x  0 
gk x

where the fact that the definition must be consistent at x  0 fixes the value of ck  0
which therefore by 31 satisfies
ck  2k  cc  cb  oexpk 
we register also that for the cumulative probability fk   1  gk  we have

1  fb k  xck  if x  0

a slight modification of the proof yields that we can choose   0 min  
before proving proposition 33 we remark in an official way that it is the last brick
needed for our main result
proof of theorem 11 recall that k is the invariant probability of the main chain x it
suffices to choose g  gk and apply corollary 23 by using proposition 33 we obtain
that

converges vaguely for k   towards c and 2kk k1 converges vaguely towards b 
vague convergence ie with test functions that are compactly supported and c 0  is an
elegant statement but 311 is much stronger and in particular it solves the issue raised

with f  which is fk  given in 34 for the first addendum in the righthand side of

exchanged arbitrarily we choose to work with the first addendum and the bound we are
after is achieved in two steps

that fk y has two different expressions according to the sign of y namely we want to

where in the second step we have exploited the regularity of  for x  2k 0  the
constant c is the lefthand side in 16  and for smaller xs we have just bounded
x  hk y  x  hk y with x  hk y  x  hk y and we have performed the
integral over x using once again fc y  k  2k in the range we consider
the proof of proposition 33 is therefore complete

4 diffusion estimate the proof of proposition 22
in this section we essentially estimate the speed of convergence to stationarity of the
chain x the process is essentially a symmetric random walk far from the boundary but
the positive recurrent character crucially depends on the visits to the boundary by a
preliminary manipulation we reduce the estimate we need to estimating the expectation
of the time of first exit from k k and this is achieved by diffusion approximation on
k  2 log log k k  2 log log k and by a rough estimate on the remaining portions of
length 2 log log k
proof of proposition 22 in order to work with more explicit constants we give the proof
under the assumption that both pz  log 2  0 and pz   log 2  0 we explain in
remark 42 how the proof can be easily generalized
our proof involves two auxiliary markov chains closely related to x which we now
introduce
the first one is x   xn nn0 with state space r  c for x  the state c is
  c for every m larger than n on
absorbing cemetery that is xn  c implies xm


the other hand if xn  y  r the probability that xn1
 c is 1  h0k y therefore
if xn  y  r the chain survives with probability h0k y and in this case it jumps to
x with transition density x  hk y note that h0k x is even decreasing for x  0

41

so h0k x  12 if x  k and h0k x  h0k 0  1 for every x
by the observations we just made it is easily seen that the chain x  can be coupled
with a simpler chain x   xn nn0 that has a smaller death probability the transition
kernel for x  from y  k k to x  r is given by x  hk y and it is therefore a
probability transitions from k k to c are forbidden on the other hand the kernel from
y  r  k k to x  r is x  hk y2 and the probability of going from y  r  k k
to c is 12 c is absorbing also for this chain
of course these two chains are dominated by the even simpler chain x  xn nn0 for
which the death probability is zero its natural state space is just r but of course we can
keep r  c as state space and the absorbing state does not communicate with r and
the transition kernel from y to x is the probability density x  hk y in fact x is just
the main markov chain we consider in this walk ie 112
we denote by py the joint law of the chains x x  and x  and the index y denotes
the common initial condition
let us assume that g is non negative the general result is recovered by linearity

remark 42 the purpose of the assumption that pz  log 2 and pz   log 2 are
non zero is to guarantee that the chain x can exit k k under this assumption in fact
pxn1  kxn  x  0 for x sufficiently close to k and analogous statement at k
note in fact that hk k  k  log 2  log1  e2k  if either pz  log 2  0 or
pz   log 2  0 the definitions of the chain x  should be modified by stipulating that
the chain may step to the absorbing state c only when x  k  c with c  0 such that
k  c  hk k  c 0 and k  c  hk k  c 0 are in the interior of the support
of  of course in this case the probability of jumping to c is no longer 12 since

are bounded below by 2log kc  these two estimates are equivalent up to the fact that
 is not symmetric but this affects only the choice of the constants and in an obvious
way so we just treat the first expression ie when the chain exits on the right
we take this occasion also to remark that if we take two chains x and x 0  with x0  x
and x00  x0  both satisfying 112 coupled by the common randomness zn  we have

xn1  xn1
 hk xn   hk xn0  with hk  increasing so the sign of xn  xn0 does not
depend on n therefore p0 k  k 2  xk  0  px0 k  k 2  xk  0 for x  x0  so it
suffices to check that

p0 k  k 2  xk  0  2log kc 
416
moreover what the process does outside k k is irrelevant so when xn   k we
replace hk xn  in 112 with xn  this means that hk x is redefined as hk x1kk x 
x1rkk x note that this corresponds to choosing a different increasing function hk 
to show that 416 holds we choose   0 so that inf x0k px x1  x0   x0  x 
p  0 note that this infimum is achieved at x  k and since we have trivialized the drift
outside k k the infimum over x  0 k can be taken over x  0  we introduce
also the stopping time

let us read this complicatedlooking expression each item in the list that follows corresponds to the three lines of the righthand side of 418
1 we ask that in less then k 2 2 steps the chain exits the interval k  2 log k k 
2 log k from the right we will show that by brownian motion approximation
this probability is positive uniformly in k for this to work we need the drift to be
negligible on the relevant diffusive time scale which given the form of hk requires
us to stop sufficiently far ie 2 log k from the boundary
2 we ask that the chain exits on the right the interval of length 22 log k 2 log log k
centered in k2 log k in 4log k2 steps or less note that in the unlikely favorable
event that k0  k2 log k then xk2 log k  k  2 log log k is verified so we can
assume xk2 log  k  2 log k k  2 log log k and again we can treat this step by

the time span is much shorter than what we considered before this will cost a
probability factor bounded away from zero like for 1 we also remark that on
this event k0  k2 log log k 
3 once the chain is at a distance at most 2 log log k from the right boundary point
k we ask that it goes straight out of the domain by making steps of length at
least   0 this will cost a factor smaller than one but bounded below by
p  0 at each step since the number of steps is proportional to log log k this
costs a probability factor that vanishes like a power of 1 log k note that we have
modified the chain outside of k k by removing the boundary repulsion so that
this ballistic strategy can be performed also once the chain is beyond k
before starting the lower bound estimate for the righthand side of 418 we anticipate
that by the strong markov property we will be able to perform three separate estimates
each estimate corresponding to one of the three items in the list
corresponding to the first item we aim at showing that

p0 k2 log k  k 2 2 and xk2 log k  k  2 log k
419
is bounded away from zero uniformly in k  k0  the event does not change if we replace
hk x with x for x  k  2 log k in defining the markov chain x so we will do so
moreover we define the process xtk  xtk2 k if tk 2 is an integer and otherwise we define
xtk by affine interpolation so the trajectory is continuous we are going to show via
a diffusion approximation that the sequence of processes xk kn  with xk a random
element of c 0 0 t 
r r with t  0 arbitrary converges in law to a brownian motion
with variance  2  x2 x dx this is formally stated in the following lemma
lemma 43 for every continuous and bounded function f from c 0 0 t  r to r we
have that
lim e0 f xk   e0 f b   0 
420
k

where under p0  b  b with b a standard brownian motion
proof of lemma 43 we apply the diffusion approximation procedure detailed in 31 pp
266272 by 31 assumptions 242526 theorem 1123 it sufficed to check three
conditions
1 the vanishing drift condition
z
lim
sup
k
x  yx  hk y dx  0 
k y yk2 log k

421

note that we can restrict to x  k  2 log k because the process has been modified
so to be centered outside of this interval 421 holds because using first
r
xx dx  0 and then 111 we obtain
z

422
x  yx  hk y dx  hk y  y  exp2 log k  2

and 421 is verified
2 the control of the variance
z
lim
sup
x  y2 x  hk y dx   2  0 
k y yk2 log k

423

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

23

and this is a direct consequence of the fact that in the range of y that we consider
y  hk y is bounded by the boundary case y  k  2 log k and the resulting
expression vanishes as k  
3 the control on large jumps for every   0

lim k sup p z1  hk x  x 1k2 log kk2 log k x  k  0 
424
k

xr

which is largely verified because hk x  x  o1k 2  for x  k  2 log k and
because z1 has finite exponential moments
this completes the proof of lemma 43



lemma 43 implies
 k

p0 k2 log k  k 2 2 and xk2 log k  k  2 log k  p0 t  12 bt  1  p 
425
and t is the hitting time of 1 1 by b  hence for k sufficiently large

p

p0 k2 log k  k 2 2 and xk2 log k  k  2 log k 
2

426

we now restart from time k2 log k and use the strong markov property xk2 log k 
k  2 log k k  2 log log k and we apply a brownian motion approximation to the chain
xk2 log kj j01 on the time scale log k2  the steps are analogous to the ones of the
previous step also in this case it is more concise to resort to the comparison argument
explained right before 416 so that the starting point of our chain can and will be
chosen equal to k  2 log k therefore by recentering ie by translating the system so
that k  2 log k becomes the origin of course we have to shift accordingly the repulsion
it suffices to show that


lim p0 2 log k2 log log k  2 log k2  x2 log k2 log log k  0  p0   t  bt  1  0 
k

427
but 427 is just a close analog of lemma 43 and the key point is that the proof is
essentially the same up to replacing k with log k note notably that now the repulsion
is much stronger oexp2 log log k  o1log k2  uniformly in the interval but this
yields a negligible drift because time is olog k
therefore we arrive at there exists p0  0 and k0 such that

inf p0 k2 log k  k 2 2 and xk2 log k  k  2 log k 
kk0

k0  k2 log k  2 log k2 and xk0  k  2 log log k  p0 428
now we apply again the strong markov property using the fact that xk 2 log log k 
k  2 log log k and the last estimate is just a product estimate that leads to recall 418

d2 log log ke
p0 k  k 2  xk  k  p0 p

429

with c  3 log1p  and k sufficiently large this completes the proof of lemma 41

appendix a complementary results on the auxiliary chains
the analysis of the basic properties of the x chain can of course be found for example
in the first two chapters of 3 by basic properties we mean existence and uniqueness of an
invariant probability that follow from irreducibility and positive recurrence we choose
not to discuss these issues in detail because we do give below more details about the y
chain that is a bit more delicate to deal with  in particular the invariant measure is not
normalizable  and because for the y chain we need a few results that depend on our
restricted framework for y we are going to exploit 21 and we will in particularly give
a lyapunov function to show recurrence for x we have positive recurrence because of
the rather evident confinement properties that can be made explicit using for example the
lyapunov function x 7 x  k2  and 21 th 1134
proof of proposition 24 we distinguish here among the case in which the support of  is
bounded away from  and when it is not
in the first case it is straightforward to see that if c  infx  x  0  0 then
the process eventually enters  logexpc  1  and does not leave this set in fact
 logexpc  1 is the fixed point of y 7 hy  c moreover y is irreducible more
precisely irreducible in the terminology for example of 21 with  any probability with
a density that is positive on  logexpc  1  and zero on the complement this is a
direct consequence of the fact that z has a density of 211 and of the fact that c is the
left edge of the support of the transition probability recurrence of y follows for example
by applying the criterion in 18 th 31 or we can apply 21 th 802 with a lyapunov
function equal to logx  m   1 with m  m   0 suitably chosen
if the support of  is not bounded below then the process is still irreducible and
this time  is any probability with positive density recurrence can be established in the
same way the repulsion from the left is very strong an explicit lyapunov function is
x2 10x  10 x logx  m   1 21 th 802 
so in both cases  exists it is finite and it is unique 21 th 1049 of course  is
characterized by 212 in particular for every bounded borel set b

z z
b 
z  hy dy dz 
a1
b

r

and we use this formula to show that b   for every bounded borel set to show
this we use the fact that   1ab for suitably chosen positive constants  a and b
assume that there exists a bounded borel set b1 with b1    then there exists
x
r 0  b1 such that x0  1n x0  1n   for every n and this directly yields
r z  hy dy   for every z such that z  hx0   a b but in this case by
a1 b   for every b  a  hx0  b  hx0  of positive lebesgue measure which
is impossible because  is additive
to establish r   we suppose that r   and we assume that  is a probability in this case we remark that the process defined recursively by
 sn
 sn1  zn1 
and by s0  y0 satisfies sn  yn for every n hence psn  n  pyn  n
but the central limit theorem implies that the lefthand side converges as n   to a
positive number while the righthand side vanishes in the same limit because yn  is tight
by the ergodic theorem applied to our supposedly positive recurrent process hence
r  
for the left tail property we start by remarking that using 212 with g  1ab1 
a  b and restricting the integral in the righthand side to y   loge  1 ie

ising transfer matrix with balanced disorder

25

hy  0 1 and to x  a b
a b  1     y z  a  z  hy  b  1   y  hy  0 1 a b 
a2
that is a b1   loge1a b by choosing a and b such that a b 
0 we see that  loge  1   therefore  x   for every x and the
proof is complete

proof of lemma 25 the measure by setting g  1x in 212 we see that for every
xr
z
f x 
f x  hy dy 
a3
since both h and f  are non decreasing we have that y 7 f x  hy is non
increasing so by a3 we have that for every x and every z
z z
f x 
f x  hy dy  f x  hzf z 
a4


set e
c  infy  f y  0   0 one extracts form 114 that infy  f y 
0   logexpe
c  1 now consider the sequence xj  x0 the value we have chosen
for f x0   1 and for j  n xj  xj1   with   0 such that x0  hx1  
x0  hx0    e
c so that q  f x0  hx1   0 such a choice of   0 is possible
because x0   logexpe
c  1 so
x0  hx0    log1  expx0   e
c

a5

note moreover that for j  n we have xj  hxj1     log1  expxj1  
  log1  expx1   x0  hx1  so f xj  hxj1   q for every j therefore from
a4 we infer that
1
a6
f xj1   j 
q
since f is non decreasing this yields the claim

appendix b about the fourier transform of 
b
with our laplace transform notation it
 z t is the characteristic function of z
that is the fourier transform of the law of z in this appendix we show how our hypotheses
15 and 16 on the distribution  imply that the characteristic function satisfies the
bound
z
z t
dt   
b1
12
r 1  t
and lemma b1 directly yields b1 thanks to our hypotheses 15 and 16 we use
r
ft  fbit  r f x expitx dx

lemma b1 assume that there exists   0 such
r that f x  f y  x  y for every
x 6 y  r and that there exists c  0 such that r f x expcx dx   then
1 fr x  oexpbx with b  c1  
2 r ft1  t12  dt  

proof it suffices to consider the case x   we proceed by contradiction assume
that there exists a sequence of positive numbers xn  with limn xn   and f xn  

26

g giacomin and r l greenblatt

2 expbxn  for every n then for every x  xn  xn  expbxn  we have f x 
expbxn  therefore
z xn expbxn 
f x expcx dx  expbxn  expbxn  expcxn   1 
b2
xn

r
which is impossible because r f x expcx dx   therefore 1 is established
for 2 we start by remarking that 1 implies that the continuous
function f is in lp
r
2
for every p  1 in particular for p  2 letting 2 h  r f x  h  f x2 dx for
h  12 12 and k  2 we have
z 
z k
2
2
exp2bx dx
f x  h  f x dx  c
2 h 
b3
kh
k
2
0
 2kh  c exp2bk 
so if we choose k  b log1h  if b log2  2 we just choose a smaller value
for b  we have that there exists c  0 such that for h  12
p
2 h  ch log1h 
b4

also evidently suph 2 h  2kf k2  these estimates imply that for every   0
