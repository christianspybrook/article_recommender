this paper we focus on heavy ion beam hib inertial confinement fusion hif a
spherical mmradius deuterium d  tritium t fuel pellet is irradiated by hibs
to be compressed to about a thousand times of the solid density the dt fuel
temperature reaches 510kev for the ignition to release the fusion energy the

comput phys commun 240 83 2019 which is a 2d implosion simulation
system in hif the dt fuel is compressed to the high density and so the dt
fuel spatial deformation may be serious at the dt fuel stagnation therefore
the osuki and osukin 3d systems employ a lagrangian fluid code first to
simulate the dt fuel implosion phase until just before the stagnation then all
the simulation data from the lagrangian code are converted to them for the euler
fluid code in which the dt fuel ignition and burning are simulated

1 introduction
code osukin 3d 3 dimension is an upgraded 3d version of our code
osuki 1 and it provides a capability to simulate a deuterium d  tritium
t fuel target implosion ignition and burning in 3d in heavy ion beam hib
inertial confinement fusion icf

in icf dt fuel target implosion ignition and burning are essentially
important to release a sufficient fusion energy output in icf a few mg dt
in a fuel pellet is compressed to about a thousand times the solid density
by an input driver energy for example lasers or heavy ion beams hibs or
pulse power in addition the ion temperature of the compressed dt must
reach 510 kev 2 in order to compress the dt fuel stably to the high
density the implosion nonuniformity should be less than a few percent3
the key issues of the fuel implosion in icf include how to realize the uniform
implosion the osukin 3d code system provides an integrated computer
simulation tool to study the dt fuel implosion ignition and burning in heavy
ion inertial confinement fusion hif 4 5
the dt fuel implosion is simulated until just before the void closure time
by the lagrangian code which can couple with the ok3 code to include the
timedependent hibs energy deposition profile in the target energy absorber
layer for example the detail hibs illumination on a hif dt target can be
computed by a computer code of ok3 6 7 8 the lagrange code data are
converted to the data imported to the euler code the euler code is robust
against the target fuel deformation the dt fuel ignition and burning are
simulated further by the 3d euler fluid code the osukin 3d code system
simulates the 3d hif target implosion dynamics and would contribute to
release the fusion energy stably for society
2 osukin 3d code algorithm description
21 osukin 3d code structure
the osukin 3d code system consists of three parts the lagrangian
fluid code 9 the data conversion code from the lagrangian code to the
euler code and euler code the fluid model is the threetemperature model
in ref 10 the lagrangian fluid code the data conversion code and the
euler code are described below in detail
in the lagrangian fluid code the spatial meshes move together with the
fluid motion 9 however the lagrange meshes can not follow the fluid
large deformation on the other hand the euler meshes are fixed to the
space and the fluid moves through the meshes therefore just before the
void closure time that is the stagnation phase the lagrangian code is used
to simulate the dt fuel implosion after the void closure time the euler
code is employed to simulate the dt fuel further compression ignition and

burning between the lagrangian code and the euler code the data should
be converted by the data conversion code
all the simulation process is performed in its integrated way by using the
script of codeosukinfusionstartsh the processes executed by this
shell script are as follows
1 make the stack size infinite
2 remove all output data file and make the new output files
3 change the permission of shell scripts to executable
4 compile the main function of the lagrangian code and execute it
5 if any problems do not appear during the calculation of the lagrangian
code compile the main function of the data conversion code and execute it
6 if there is no problem during the data conversion compile the main function of the euler code and execute it
22 steps in lagrangian code

figure 5 interpolation of velocity

usually the euler mesh size is small compared with the size of the lagrange mesh for the interpolation of physical quantities other than
velocity the physical quantity of the corresponding lagrange mesh
acquired by the meshsearchcpp is interpolated by the 0th order
method on the other hand if the corresponding lagrange mesh is
smaller than the euler mesh it is done in the same way shown in fig
5 and eq 40 for the example velocity interpolation this is the
special treatment in 3d to optimize the required memory size
6 main convertcpp this is the main procedure of the conversion code
the procedure selects the output lagrangian data transferred to the
euler code among the lagrangian data sets obtained in the lagrangian
code the lagrangian meshes are deformed along with the fluid motion
the lagrangian code stops before no mesh is crushed the conversion
range is the all dt layer and a part of the aluminum region the
volume of the al region is 25 times larger than the thickness of the
dt layer the required number of the euler meshes is calculated the
lagrange data sets are examined from the data set from the time of
2ns earlier than the last output data set the function selects the
conversion date which has the smallest number of the euler mesh
required if the number of euler meshes exceeds the number of euler
meshes set in the input lch the euler mesh total number is forced
24

to set to the upper limit defined beforehand
7 meshsearchcpp this procedure examines the location of each euler
mesh among the lagrangian meshes the meshsearch function divides
a lagrange mesh into 12 triangular tetrahedra as shown in fig 6 and
examines if the definition point of an euler mesh is contained in the
specific lagrange mesh

5 instructions for the user
before running the osuki code the user must set the target pellet and
hib parameters accordingly as follows

aok3 code calculation type in 3d osukin code one can select the ok3 illumination code calculation type the ok swich  1 is the full calculation with
ok3 the ok swich  5 is the 1d uniform energy distribution type and the
hibs energy distribution changes only in the radius direction the ok swich 
10 is the 1d energy distribution with the illumination nonuniformity in the  and
 directions one can add artificially nonuniformity in the  and  directions in
main lccpp
bprojectile ion type five projectile ion types are included in ok3pb u cs
c and p users can choose one of them or add other species expanding the arrays
azb and aab in input lch
cion beam parameters the user can specify the hib radii on the target surface
changing the parameter tdbrc in input lch the design of the beam input
pulse is also done in the same file the pulse rise start time rise time and beam
power are set by variables t beamj del t beamj and p owerjj  1  5 respectively users should also input the total input beam energy into input energy in
the define ecshh manually when the users want to run the euler code independetly as the parameter value of the wobbling beam the maximum radius of
the beam axis trajectory in the rotation and the oscillating frequency should be
specified users can set the desirable values for the maximum beam trajectory
radius rrot in the inputok3h and the rotational number rotationnumber in
the input lch
dthe beam irradiation position the file hifschemeh contains 1 2 3 6 12 20
32 60 and 120beam irradiation schemes users can choose one of them or add
other hib irradiation schemes supplementing the file
ethe reactor chamber users can specify the chamber radius by changing the parameter of rch the parameter dz fixes the pellet displacement from the reactor
chamber center in the cartesian ps coordinates see fig 10 in ok3 the target
alignment errors of dx dy and dz can be specified one can change this setting in
the input lch
fthe target pellet structure and mesh number the parameter values of target are set in input lch and init lch in input lch users can change
the boundary radius of each layer the total mesh number and the mesh number for each layer the present osukin 3d includes an example dtalpb

if users want to employ a new substance for target structure usera also need to
add the solid density and the atomic mass in constanth users can control
the lagrangian radial mesh number for each layer by changing the value m w c
in input lch when m w c  0 the radial mesh width dr1  dr2     
in all layers becomes equal when the mwc is large the radial mesh number for
each layer num k1  num k2      becomes close to the same number

users can run codeosukinfusionstartsh to start running the osukin 3d code simulations when the shell script is executed the lagrange fluid code the data conversion code and the euler fluid code are
sequentially activated the results of the lagrangian simulation are saved in
the output directory and the results of the eulerian simulation are saved
in output euler
6 testing the program osukin 3d
the several tests are shown below to present the target fuel implosion
dynamics in the example cases the hibs and the target fuel have the
following common parameters which are the same values employed in ref
1 the beam radius at the entrance of a reactor chamber ren  35 mm the
beam particle density distribution is in the gaussian profile and all projectile
pb ions have 8 gev the target is a multilayered pellet in which the pellet
outer radius is 4 mm a pb layer thickness is 0029 mm the al thickness is
0460 mm and the dt thickness is 0083 mm the pb al and dt layers have
the radial mesh numbers of 4 46 and 30 in these example cases respectively
40

and the total mesh number in the theta direction is 90 the input beam pulse
is shown in fig 12 in ref 1 the beam radius is 38mm on the target
surface however rb  38mm changes at wb to 37mm for the wobbling
beam irradiation here wb is the rotational period of the beam axis the
rotational frequency is 424mhz rotaionnumber  11
first the 3d langrange code was run without the ok3 illumination code
this is the case for ok switch  10 and we added the artificial nonuniformity y32 the spherical harmonics with the amplitude of 300 in
fig 11 the ion temperature distribution is shown at t35ns and in fig
12 the mass density distribution is presented at t35ns the target shape
is largely distorted due to the nonuniformity of the hibs deposition energy
distribution

figure 11 ion temperature in the 3d lagrange code without ok3 code at t35ns the
nonuniformity distiribution is y32 with the amplitude of 30

41

figure 12 mass density in the 3d lagrange code without ok3 code at t35ns the
nonuniformity distriution is y32 with the amplitude of 30

we also performed runthrough simulation tests in the example cases
the ok3 code was coupled with the runthrough simulations the implosion
data were obtained by the lagrange code and the data just before the void
closure time were transferred to the euler code through the data conversion
code two cases are computed for the target fuel implosion dynamics with
the spiral wobbling or without the oscillating hibs these examples are the
runthrough simulations with the ok3 illumination code ok switch  1
the input beam pulse employed in the runthrough tests is shown in fig
13 this beam input energy is 54mj we show the r  t diagram for the
case without the hibs wobbling in fig 14 the lagrangecode test results
stored in the output directory are visualized in figs 15 for the target ion
temperature ti  distributions at t  00 150 200 and 225 ns for the
case with the hibs wobbling behavior the rms nonuniformity results
are shown in figs 16 a for dt layers ion temperatureti  b for dt
layers mass density c for al layers ion temperatureti  and d for al
layers mass density when the hibs have the wobbling motion during the
implosion with the wobbling frequency of 424mhz the radius acceleration
distributions are shown in figs 17 a in the  direction and b in the 
42

direction at t  625tw  112ns solid lines and at t  675tw  122ns
dotted lines here tw shows the one rotation time figures 17 present
that the nonuniformity phase of the implosion acceleration is controlled
externally by the hibs wobbling behavior 1 18

figure 17 radial acceleration distributions in a  and b  the solid lines show the
acceleration ditributions at t  625tw  113ns and the dotted lines at t  675tw 
122ns

after the lagrange code computation the implosion data are converted
and transferred to the euler code figures 18 show the ion temperature
distributions by the euler code figures 18 show that the dt fuel is ignited
and the gain obtained is about 175 in this example case for a realistic
hif reactor design the implosion parameters should be further optimized to
obtain a sufficient gain which should be larger than 3040 in hif 1 4 5 18

in order to check the accuracy of the 3d euler code we also performed the
euler code tests using the initial conditions of the 2d euler code the initial
conditions in the euler code are the output of the lagrangian code to this
end the 2d euler initial conditions were converted into 3d therefore the
physical values are uniform in the  direction the lagrangian test 2d results
for the target ion temperature ti  and the mass density  distribution at
t  29 ns are shown in figs 14 and 15 in ref 1 for the cases with and

without the wobbling hibs the 2d eulerian test results for the fusion
energy gain is shown in fig 16 in ref 1 in fig 19 we show the ion
temperature distributions by the 3d euler code the wobbling hibs are not
used in this simulation in this case the fuel is ignited at t 301ns the
histories of the fusion gain g of the 2d code and the 3d code are shown in
fig 20 the fusion gain was 525 by the 2d code and 576 by the 3d code
in addition we also did another test for the wobbling hibs see figs 15
and 16 in ref 1 and the fusion gain was 761 in 2d 1 and 674 in 3d
the results would confirm that the 3d euler code reproduces the 2d results
successfully for the ignition time and the fusion gain obtained

we also simulated the doublecone ignition scheme19 using a 3d euler
code the doublecone ignition scheme was proposed by prof jie zhang
19 and the two compressed dt clouds are created by the gold cones the
two dt spherical clouds collide each other like the impact fusion 20 in
this example case the compressed dt maximum density of the dt fuel is
set to be 10  105 kgm3  with the gaussian spatial distribution the dt
ignition will be attained by an additional heating which is not taken into
consideration in this example the ion electron and radiation temperatures
are 10ev initially in the euler code the radius of the fuel is 92m and
the mass was 01mg we set the colliding speed w of the two dt fuel clouds
to 30  105 ms the ion temperature distributions are shown in fig 21

7 conclusions
we have developed and presented the osukin 3d code which is useful
to simulate 3d spherical dt fuel target implosion in hif the osukin code is an upgraded implosion simulation system from the 2d osuki
code and consists of the lagrangian fluid code the data conversion from the
lagrangian code data to the euler code data and the euler code near the
void closure phase of the dt fuel implosion the dt fuel spatial deformation
is serious at the stagnation phase the dt fuel is compressed to about a
thousand times of the solid density the osukin 3d code would provide
a useful tool for the integrated dt fuel target implosion simulation in hif
