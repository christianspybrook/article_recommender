abstract the construction of conformal blocks for the analysis of multipoint correlation functions
with n  4 local field insertions is an important open problem in higher dimensional conformal
field theory this is the first in a series of papers in which we address this challenge following and
extending our short announcement in 1 according to dolan and osborn conformal blocks can be
determined from the set of differential eigenvalue equations that they satisfy we construct a complete
set of commuting differential operators that characterize multipoint conformal blocks for any number
n of points in any dimension and for any choice of ope channel through the relation with gaudin
integrable models we uncovered in 1 for 5point conformal blocks there exist five such operators
which are worked out smoothly in the dimension d

introduction and summary of results

in the last few decades conformal field theories have steadily gained importance first in d  2 and
then for d  2 they provide a powerful source of new paradigms that advance our understanding
of quantum field theory deep in the quantum regime which is inaccessible to perturbation theory

1

through the adscft correspondence conformal field theories have even begun to teach us about
some of the deepest mysteries of quantum gravity
in a conformal field theory poincare symmetry is enhanced to conformal symmetry this symmetry
enhancement turns out to be highly constraining even in d  2 where the conformal group is finite
dimensional and only contains d  1 generators outside of the poincare group these few additional
generators provide enormous control over the operator product expansion ope of local fields and
in fact fix these products up to some numerical ope coefficients the latter determine all higher
correlations at least in principle in practice however higher correlations with more than n  3 field
insertions possess an intricate dependence on the insertion points of the local fields and their simplicity
only becomes visible after expanding correlators in a basis of conformal blocks the latter are very
much like plane waves in ordinary fourier analysis ie conformal blocks or rather the closely related
conformal partial waves are to conformal symmetry what plane waves are to the translation group
once the basis of conformal blocks is known one can expand the correlation function conformal
symmetry then implies that the coefficients are simply products of the coefficients that appear in the
ope
all this is of course well known since the early days of conformal field theory see 24 but the
pioneers of conformal field theory were only able to write down integral formulas for conformal blocks
5 6 these socalled shadow integrals are very much like feynman integrals in particular it is a
considerable challenge to relate shadow integrals to some known special functions to read off their
properties and to find relations between them at least for d  2 where the integrations cannot be
performed directly there has been little progress on this problem until dolan and osborn shifted
attention from the integrals to the differential equations that these integrals satisfy 7 8 once they
had constructed their socalled casimir differential operators they were able to extract a wealth of
information on 4point blocks see also 911 this work has been the decisive input for the modern
conformal bootstrap program see 12 for a review and many references to the original literature
and its spectacular applications to the d  3 ising model in particular 1316 more recently it was
observed that the casimir differential operators studied by dolan and osborn could be identified with
the hamiltonians of an integrable 2particle quantum mechanics system of calogerosutherland type
17 the observation was later explained in the context of harmonic analysis for the conformal group
1821 calogerosutherland hamiltonians and their eigenfunctions have actually been studied in
mathematics for several decades where it has become instrumental in developing the modern theory of
multivariate hypergeometric functions after the relation with conformal blocks was noticed it became

2

clear that most of the results on 4point blocks had been known long before the work in conformal
field theory mostly from the early work on calogerosutherland models by heckman and opdam 22
see 23
in principle it is possible to probe a conformal field theory by studying the entire set of 4point
functions for the infinite number of spinning conformal primary fields and even though the theory
of spinning conformal blocks is reasonably well developed by now see eg 2427 working with an
infinite number of correlation functions seems impossible at least in the absence of any additional
algebraic structure in practice it may appear more promising to study higher correlations of a small
set of fundamental fields of the theory the 8point function of a fundamental scalar field for example
already contains as much dynamical information as an infinite set of spinning 4point functions given
that it took more than 30 years to develop a theory of 4point blocks it may seem like a daunting
task to actually extend this theory to multipoint blocks though there has been significant activity
in this direction lately see eg 2841 the embedding of 4point blocks into harmonic analysis
of the conformal group and the profound relations with integrable quantum mechanical models may
be viewed as a strong hint towards the appropriate mathematical tools for the study of multipoint
blocks and in fact as we have announced in 1 the relation to integrable models is not restricted to
the case of 4point blocks as we have outlined multipoint blocks for any number n of local fields
can be characterized as joint eigenfunctions of a complete set of commuting differential operators the
latter were argued to arise as hamiltonians of gaudin integrable models
our goal in this paper and its sequels is to substantiate our claims and to develop them into a full
theory of multipoint blocks in this paper we perform the first step of this program and explain
in detail the relation between multipoint conformal blocks and gaudin integrable systems we will
actually go further than 1 which only sketched the construction of differential operators for the socalled comb channel conformal blocks 28 the results described in this work apply to any channel ie
they provide a complete set of commuting differential operators for whatever channel one is interested
in including eg the snowflake channel that has also received some attention lately 34 36 as we
shall explain below in any given channel the differential operators split into two groups the dolanosbornlike casimir differential operators that measure the weight and spin of intermediate fields
and the novel vertex differential operators that measure a choice of tensor structure in the operator
product of intermediate spinning fields in a second paper of this series we will address such internal
vertices for the comb channel of 3 and 4dimensional conformal field theories these vertices give rise
to a single vertex differential operator see 1 for an example that we will identify as the hamiltonian

3

of an elliptic calogeromoser system for some complex crystallographic reflection group first obtained
in 42 extensions to vertices with more than one degree of freedom which are relevant eg for the
snowflake channel in 4d as well as a theory of solutions for single and multivariable vertices will be
addressed in the future
the main results of this work are the following we construct the casimir and vertex differential
operators that are simultaneously diagonalized by conformal blocks commutativity of this set of
operators is established by realizing it as a limit of the gaudin integrable model the connection to
the gaudin model seems to be necessary for the full proof although some parts of the proof can be
established by elementary arguments further we provide evidence that independent casimir and
vertex operators are equal in number to independent cross ratios and can thus be used to completely
characterize conformal blocks this is done by exhibiting a number of relations between the operators
leaving us with an explicit commuting system with no apparent further dependencies finally we construct the five commuting casimir and vertex operators for 5point functions explicitly as differential
operators in the five cross ratios
for the remainder of this introduction we will give a more precise summary of the main results and
place them in the context of conformal field theory
summary of results in this work we consider correlation functions of n local scalar primary fields
i with conformal weights denoted by i 
gn xi  i   h01 x1     n xn 0i 

11

the fields are inserted at points xi  i  1     n  of ddimensional euclidean space rd  scalar primary
fields are characterized by their commutation relations with the generators of the conformal algebra
which take the form
t  i xi   ti i xi 

12

where t are the usual first order differential operators and  runs through the set of conformal
generators
prerequisites and notation conformal correlation functions are symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two fields on the other hand the way we compute them is not in fact n point
correlation functions are evaluated by a repeated use of operator product expansions opes and the
precise sequence of performing these expansions determines what is known as an ope channel these
n
channels can be represented as plane tree diagrams cope

figure 1 choice of an ope channel for a 10point function vertices highlighted in blue are associated with
nontrivial tensor structures

one such example for the 10point function given a fixed enumeration of the external scalar fields
the number of ope channels is 2n  5 each of these channels is associated with a system of
conformal blocks that provide a fourierlike expansion of the correlation function after stripping
off some appropriate prefactors xi i  the conformal blocks depend only on conformally invariant
cross ratios it is well known that one can form

of such independent cross ratios from a set of n points xi  rd  note that this number is independent
of the ope channel the conformal blocks we want to expand our correlation functions in must
depend on the same number of labels for example in the case of a 4point function in d  1 one has
two cross ratios the associated blocks are famously labeled by the conformal weight  and the spin l
of the field that is exchanged in the intermediate channel since the latter transforms in a symmetric
traceless tensor representation of the rotation subgroup a single number l is sufficient to characterize
the spin
when dealing with higher correlation functions it is easy to see that the quantum numbers of fields
exchanged in the intermediate channels are not sufficient the precise number of such intermediate
field labels does depend on the channel topology at least for n  5 but it is always strictly smaller
than the number ncr of cross ratios as an example let us consider n  5 in this case there exist 15
ope channels but they all possess the same topology in figure 2 we have displayed one of the fifteen
ope channels all other 14 channels are related to this one by a permutation of the leaves modulo

figure 2 choice of ope diagram for 5point correlator

symmetries of the bare ope diagram that has been stripped of its leaves as one can readily see
the ope evaluation involves two intermediate fields since these appear in the operator product of
scalar fields they are symmetric traceless tensors and hence characterized by two quantum numbers
each the intermediate fields thus carry four quantum numbers in total we think of these as being
attached to the internal links of the ope diagram but in order to fully characterize the relevant
blocks we need five quantum numbers and so we are short by one as we shall show below this
remaining quantum number is attached to the central vertex of the 5point ope diagram note that
two legs of this central vertex are associated with a symmetric traceless tensor while only one is scalar
for d  3 such 3point functions are not determined by conformal symmetry they require the
choice of a socalled tensor structure for a very particular basis in the space of tensor structures it
becomes possible to assign a fifth quantum number to the choice of tensor structure one that can be
measured simultaneously with the four independent eigenvalues of the casimir operators measuring
a complete set of quantum numbers simultaneously through a sufficiently large set of commuting
differential operators is the main goal of this work we want to do so in any d for any number n of
external points and for all ope channels quantum numbers are measured by acting with differential
operators in the cross ratios the latter divide into two families first differential operators that
measure the quantum numbers of intermediate fields are associated with the links of the ope diagram
and are referred to as casimir differential operators since they are straightforward generalizations of
the casimir differential operators constructed for n  4 by dolan and osborn second differential
operators that measure choices of tensor structure the first example of which was introduced recently
in 1 are referred to as vertex differential operators let us note that for scalar blocks the choice of
tensor structures and hence the vertex differential operators are relevant as soon as multiple nonscalar
exchanges are involved these types of blocks have only been considered very recently in the paper
41 by poland and prilepina and in a certain limit in 43
before we can describe our results on both types of differential operators we need to set up some

6

notation given an ope channel we enumerate internal lines by latin indices r  1     n  3 and
vertices by greek indices   1     n  2 there are no rules on how to enumerate these two sets
of objects ope diagrams are plane trees and hence by cutting any internal line with label r we
separate the diagram into two disconnected pieces hence r is associated with a partition of the
external fields into two disjoint sets
n  1     n   ir1  ir2 

14

similarly any vertex  gives rise to a partition of n into three disjoint sets
n  i1  i2  i3 

15

given any subset i  n we can define the following set of first order differential operators in the
insertion points xi

when d  4k  2 the symmetric invariants of order p  d2  1 are twofold degenerate and we should
use two different symbols for these two invariants of order d2  1 in order not to clutter notation

7

too much we decided to ignore this distinction in other words we will consider d21 as a pair of
symmetric invariants when d  4k  2
in our formulas for the differential operators we have placed a subscript g to stress that they are
defined as operators acting on correlations functions ie on functions g that satisfy the conformal
ward identities

111

in our construction of the differential operators we have favored the set ir1 over ir2  but from the
conformal ward identities we can conclude that
tir1  gn xi  i   tir2  gn xi  i  
though some caution is needed when we apply this relation to the evaluation of the casimir differential
operator see subsection 21 for details it is not difficult to see that all differential operators of even
order come out the same if we pick ir2 rather than ir1  there is only one family for which the set
matters namely for the pfaffian operators when d is a multiple of four in that case the operator
flips sign when we change the set of course overall factors are a matter of convention and hence of
no concern therefore we shall drop the reference to the set we use in the construction of casimir
p

differential operators writing drp instead of dr1

an important point to note is that the casimir differential operators need not be independent to
illustrate this consider the case n  4 for d  2 since all external fields are assumed to be scalar
the single intermediate field is a symmetric traceless tensor and is hence characterized by two numbers
only its weight  and spin l these can be measured by the casimir differential operators d2 and d4 
but starting from d  4 the conformal algebra possesses casimir elements of higher order which are
independent in general but become dependent on the lower order ones when evaluated on symmetric
traceless tensors more generally the number of independent casimir differential operators at a given
internal line r is given by
n
dr cope
 d  dir1  d

where di d  mini n  i rd 

112

and i denotes the order of the set i1 we shall refer to the number di d as the depth of the index
set i and to dr as the depth of the link r note that dr  dir1  d  dir2  d is independent of which
of the two index sets we choose to compute it with by summing the depths of all internal links we

can determine the total number of independent casimir differential operators to be

let us note that the total number of casimir differential operators does depend on the topology of
the ope channel not just on the number n of points in the case of n  6 and d  4 for example
n 6
there are ncdo ccomb
 d  7 casimir differential operators in the comb channel while the snowflake
n 6
channel admits only ncdo csnowflake
 d  6 of such operators

vertex differential operators what we have described so far is nothing new and can be established by
elementary means but as we have explained starting from n  5 the casimir differential operators
do not suffice to resolve all quantum numbers of the conformal blocks ie ncdo is strictly smaller
that ncr for all ope channels our main task is to construct additional differential operators that
can measure the choice of tensor structures at the vertices independently of the weights and spins
of the intermediate fields ie we need to find a complete set of vertex differential operators that
commute with the casimir differential operators and among themselves in this work we describe how
to accomplish this task for any number n of external scalar fields and any ope topology one central
claim is that these vertex differential operators take the form

where   1     p1 and p  2 4     2rd  d1 when d is odd for even d we let p run through even
integers until we reach d and add a set of pfaffian vertex operators pf 12    1 2    d2 which are
constructed with a symmetric invariant tensor p of order p  d2  1 let us note that the definition
of all these vertex differential operators also makes sense for   0 and   p the corresponding
objects coincide with casimir differential operators for the links that enter the first and second leg
of the vertex this is why we have excluded them from our list the remaining operators still allow
us to reconstruct the casimir operators for the link that enters the third leg therefore there is one
linear relation for each value that p can assume ie we have rd linear relations in total one may use
these relations to eliminate eg the operator with   p2
p
let us note that the definition of the vertex operators dij
depends on the choice of labeling of

the subsets ij forming the partition n  i1  i2  i3 associated with the vertex  which is
arbitrary however the algebra generated by the vertex operators dp is in fact independent of this
choice more precisely the vertex operators constructed from another choice of labeling of the ij s

see section 22
the number of vertex differential operators at a given vertex is now easy to count taking into account
that one additional linear relation among the operators listed in eq 114 one finds

1 2
for d odd
4 d  1

115

the first key result of this work is that these vertex differential operators commute among themselves
and with the casimir differential operators commutation between casimir and vertex differential
operators is obvious similarly it is easy to show that two vertex operators commute if they are
associated with different vertices  6 0  the deepest part of our claim concerns the fact that also
vertex operators associated with the same vertex commute it does not seem straightforward to
prove this statement by elementary manipulations below we shall use an indirect strategy in which
we identify these vertex differential operators with hamiltonians of some gaudin integrable system
defined on a 3punctured sphere for the latter commutativity has already been established
of course the vertex differential operators we listed may not all be independent as for the casimir
operators see discussion above in order to count the number of independent vertex differential
operators we shall employ the depth function di d we introduced in eq 112 for a given vertex
n
 inside an ope channel cope
 the number of independent vertex differential operators is expected

to be equal to the degrees of freedom associated to this vertex

 d independent vertex differential operators that are

needed to characterize the vertex  this is the second key result of this work it will allow us in
particular to determine the precise order of each independent vertex differential operator
while gaudin models for the 3punctured sphere only enter the discussion as a convenient tool to
construct commuting vertex differential operators at the individual vertices the relation between
conformal blocks and gaudin models turns out to reach much further in fact is is possible to embed
the whole set of casimir and vertex differential operators for arbitrary scalar n point functions into
gaudin models on the n punctured sphere the latter contains n additional complex parameters that
are not present in correlation functions in the gaudin integrable model these parameters correspond
to the poles of the lax matrix and they enter all gaudin hamiltonians by considering different
limiting configurations of these parameters is is possible to recover the full set of casimir and vertex
differential operators for scalar n point functions in all the ope channels this construction not
only embeds our differential operators into a unique gaudin integrable model but also shows that
operators in different channels are related by a smooth deformation
let us finally outline the content of the following sections section 2 is mostly devoted to the study
of the individual vertices after a brief discussion of commutativity for casimir differential operators
and also vertex differential operators assigned to different vertices we shall zoom into the individual
vertices for most of section 2 in section 22 we construct the vertex differential operators in terms of
the commuting hamiltonians of a 3site gaudin integrable system section 23 addresses the relations

 11 

between these operators for restricted vertices the main purpose of section 3 is to embed the whole set
of casimir and vertex differential operators for arbitrary scalar n point functions into gaudin models
on the n punctured sphere in section 4 we discuss one concrete example namely we construct all
five differential operators that characterize the blocks of a scalar 5point function in any d  3 two
of these operators are of order two while the other three are of fourth order the paper concludes with
a summary outlook to further results and a list of interesting open problems to be addressed

2

the vertex integrable system

the aim of this section is to address the key new element in the construction of multipoint conformal
blocks for d  3 the vertices themselves in the first subsection we shall show that the construction
of commuting differential operators for scalar n point blocks can be reduced by rather elementary
arguments to the construction of commuting differential operators for 3point functions of spinning
fields recall that the dependence on spin degrees of freedom can be encoded in auxiliary variables
from which one is often able to construct nontrivial cross ratios2 even in the case of a 3point function
constructing sufficiently many commuting vertex differential operators that act on such cross ratios of
the 3point function requires more powerful technology from integrability which we shall turn to in the
second subsection there we construct commuting differential operators for vertices from the gaudin
integrable model for the 3punctured sphere the basic construction provides nv d of such commuting
operators and hence sufficiently many even for the most generic vertices for special vertices such as
those appearing in the comb channel with external scalars there exist linear relations between these
operators these are the subject of the third subsection
21

reduction to the vertex systems

our goal here is to prove that casimir and vertex operators constructed around different vertices of
an ope diagram commute more precisely we shall show that
 drp  drq0   0



q
 drp  da

21

for every pair r p r0  q of casimir operators and any choice  q  of a vertex operator including
the pfaffian casimir and vertex operators that appear at order p q  d2  1 when the dimension d is
even note that the individual vertex differential operators also depend on the choice a  12 23 13
of a pair of legs in addition we shall also establish that vertex operators associated with different
2 here and throughout the entire text we use the term cross ratio rather loosely to refer to all conformally invariant
combinations of the positions and auxiliary variables at each point

 12 

vertices commute
p
 da
 dq

0 b   0

22

and all triples p  a and q  b this leaves only the commutativity of operators attached to the
same vertex which is deferred to the next subsection
the properties 21 and 22 are in fact elementary they require global conformal invariance the
tree structure of ope diagrams and the commutativity property 17 to begin with let us recall
that we associated two disjoint sets ir1 and ir2 to every link as we pointed out before the casimir
ir1 

differential operators 18 do not depend on whether we used the generators t

ir2 

or t

to

construct them let us briefly discuss the details of the proof note that we think of d as an operator
acting on correlation functions g this is signaled by the subscript g in the definition of the casimir
differential operators in evaluating products of first order differential operators one can only apply
the ward identity 111 to the rightmost operator which acts directly on the correlation function
and not on some derivative thereof but once we have converted the rightmost operators t ir1  into
t ir2   they will commute with all operators to their left such that we can freely move them all the
way to the left and proceed to apply the ward identity to the next set of first order operators and so
on if we finally take into account that the invariants  of the conformal lie algebra are symmetric
we arrive at an expression for the casimir differential operators in terms of t ir2  
a similar analysis can be carried out for vertex operators see also subsection 22 without loss of
generality we can assume that we have constructed our vertex operators in terms of the generators
t i1  and t i2  and want to switch to constructing them from t i1  and t i3  instead to do so
we make use of the invariance condition

that follows from relations 15 and 111 after we apply this to the rightmost operator in the
vertex differential operator we use the commutativity property 17 to move the generators t i1 
and t i3  to the left of t i2   we continue this replacement process until all the generators t i2 
are removed and using symmetry of the tensor  we find

along with a similar relation for the pfaffian vertex operators for p  d2  1 and d even since the
last term in this sum with   p   is just a casimir operator we have managed to express all vertex

 13 

differential operators that are constructed from the generators associated with i1 and i2 as a linear
combination of the vertex operators associated with the pair i1 and i3 and a casimir operator
this is the main input in proving the commutativity statements 21 and 22
let us start with a pair of links r r0  each of these links divides the set of external points into the two
disjoint sets ir1  ir2 and ir0 1  ir0 2 respectively since the ope diagram is a tree it is always possible
to find a pair i j  1 2 such that iri  irj   for this choice

because of the commutativity property 17 this proves our first claim note that the same arguments also apply to the case in which r  r0 and also if one or both operators are pfaffian ie if d is
even and p q  d2  1

vertex automatically divides the diagram into three branches

let us now extend this argument to include vertex differential operators in order to prove that the
casimir operators associated to a link r commute with the vertex operators associated to any vertex
 we recall that any choice of a vertex  on an ope diagram divides the diagram into the three
distinct branches that are glued to the vertex and we denote these by ij as in figure 4 a quick
glance at figure 4 suffices to conclude that given r and  it is possible to find a pair i  1 2 and
j  1 2 3 such that iri  ij  since the link r must be in one of the three branches it follows that
iri  ij1  ij2    for j1 6 j 6 j2  commutativity of casimir and vertex differential operators
then follows since we can construct the casimir differential operators in terms of the generators for
iri while using the generators for ij1 and ij2 for the vertex differential operators
let us finally consider any two distinct vertices  and 0 on an ope diagram as we highlight in
figure 5 any configuration of two vertices divides the diagram into five parts four external branches

figure 5 schematic representation of a generic ope diagram with focus on two internal vertices operators
supported around distinct vertices trivially commute as they can be written in terms of generators that belong
to different branches

ij  i0 j  j  1 2 attached to only one vertex and the central part c of the diagram that is attached
to both vertices  and 0  following what we just claimed with focus on one vertex we can use diagonal
conformal symmetry to rewrite the operators around  and 0 to depend on disjoint sets of legs ij 
i0 j with j  1 2 since generators associated to these sets commute 17 it follows automatically
that operators constructed around different vertices must commute as well
this implies that to prove commutativity of our set of operators we can just focus on operators that
live around one single vertex to prove the commutativity of these vertex operators we will now make
use of the integrability technology that is provided by gaudin models
22

the vertex system and gaudin models

in this section we will explain how the operators 114 associated with a vertex  in the ope
diagram naturally arise from a specific gaudin model which in particular will provide us with a proof
of their commutativity let us start by reviewing briefly how gaudin models are defined 44 45
they are integrable systems naturally constructed from a choice of a simple lie algebra g having in
mind applications of these systems to conformal field theories we will choose g to be the conformal
lie algebra sod  1 1 of the euclidean space rd  with basis t as in the previous section the
gaudin model depends in general on m complex numbers wj  called its sites to which are attached
m independent representations of the algebra g to obtain the vertex system we address in this
section we restrict our attention here to the case m  3 and associate with these three sites the
representations of g corresponding to the three fields attached to the vertex  more precisely using
the notation defined in section 1 and in particular the partition n  i1  i2  i3 constructed
from the vertex  we will attach to the three sites wj  j  1 2 3 of the gaudin model the generators

 15 

ij 

t

which define representations of g in terms of firstorder differential operators in the insertion

points xi 
a key ingredient in the construction of the gaudin model is its socalled lax matrix whose components
in the basis t  are defined here as
l z 

3
i 
x
t j

z  wj
j1

26

where z is an auxiliary complex variable called the spectral parameter in the above equation we
have denoted the lax matrix as l z to emphasize that this is the matrix corresponding to the
vertex  for any elementary symmetric invariant tensor p of degree p on g there is a corresponding
zdependent gaudin hamiltonian of the form
hp z  p1 p l1 z    lp z     

27

where    represent quantum corrections involving a smaller number of components of the lax matrix
l and their derivatives with respect to z these corrections are chosen specifically to ensure that the
gaudin hamiltonians commute for all values of the spectral parameter and all degrees
 p

h z hq w  0

 p q 

28

the existence of such commuting hamiltonians was first proven in 46 using some previously established results 47 on the socalled feiginfrenkel center of affine algebras at the critical level the
explicit expression for the quantum corrections was obtained in 48 49 for lie algebras of type a
and in 50 for types b c d which is the case we are concerned with here indeed g  sod  1 1
is of type b for d odd and of type d for d even we refer to 51 for a summary of these results
the properties of the feiginfrenkel center were further studied in the recent work 52 the results of
p

which imply that the quantum corrections in h z are sums of terms of the form
 1 q zr1 1 l1 z    zrq 1 lq z

29

where q  p  1 q is a completely symmetric invariant tensor of degree q on g and r1      rq are
positive integers such that r1      rq  p for what follows it will be useful to consider the leading
part of the hamiltonian 27 alone without quantum corrections which we will denote as
bp z  1 p l z    l z 
h
1
p

210

let us finally note that the quantum corrections are absent for both the quadratic hamiltonian h z
d21

and the pfaffian hamiltonian h

z that exists for d even such that these two hamiltonians

coincide with their leading parts

 16 

to make the link with the vertex operators defined in section 1 we will make a specific choice of the
parameters wj of the gaudin model more precisely we set
w1  0

w2  1

and

211

in particular the lax matrix 26 reduces to

let us now study the gaudin hamiltonians h z for this particular choice of parameters we will

is the vertex operator defined in eq 114 to obtain this expression we have used

the fact that t

and t

commute to bring all t

s to the left as well as the symmetry

to relabel the lie algebra indices as in eq 114 noting that the fractions

z  z  1p for   0     p are linearly independent functions of z it is then clear that one can

extract all the vertex operators d12
from h
12

pp
d12
coincide with the casimir operators of the fields at the branches i1 and i2 of the vertex the
d21

same equation also holds for the pfaffian operators h

z

p
our goal in this section is to prove the commutativity of the vertex operators d12
using known

results on gaudin models this would follow automatically from the commutativity 28 of the
p

p
 but we have
gaudin hamiltonians h z if these hamiltonians contained the operators d12

bp z of the
already proven above that the latter are naturally extracted from the leading parts h
gaudin hamiltonians without the quantum corrections these quantum corrections are in general
crucial for the commutativity of the hamiltonians however we shall prove below that the quantum
corrections of the specific gaudin model considered here can always be expressed in terms of lowerdegree hamiltonians and can thus be discarded without breaking the commutativity property in this
p

b z pairwise commute for all values of the spectral parameter
case the noncorrected hamiltonians h
p
and all degrees thus demonstrating the desired commutativity of the vertex operators d12


let us then analyze these quantum corrections recall that they are composed of terms of the form
29 reinserting the expression 212 of the lax matrix for the present choice of parameters wj in
this equation we find that the quantum corrections contain only terms of the form
2 
 1 q ti1 1     ti 1  ti1
   tiq 2  

 17 

214

with prefactors composed of powers of z and z  1 and where  1 q is a completely symmetric
invariant tensor on g of degree q  p as in eq 29 in particular  1 q decomposes as a product
of elementary symmetric invariant tensors k  symmetrized over the indices i  with k  q  p the
correction in the above equation can thus be reexpressed as an algebraic combination of lowerdegree
k
bk z
vertex operators d12
 since these are the coefficients of the noncorrected hamiltonian h

recursion on the degrees shows that the quantum corrections can indeed be expressed in terms of
lowerdegree hamiltonians as anticipated
let us end this subsection with a brief discussion on the role played by the choice of labeling of
the branches i1  i2 and i3 attached to the vertex  as mentioned in section 1 this choice is
p
arbitrary but enters the definition 114 of the vertex operators d12
 which in this case contain
i1 

only the generators t

i2 

and t

 in the context of the 3sites gaudin model considered in this

subsection this is related to the choice of positions wj of the sites made in eq 211 in particular
i3 

the absence of generators t

in the gaudin hamiltonians hp z is due to the fact that we sent the

site w3 to infinity one could have made another choice of labeling and constructed vertex operators
i3 

p
d23
from the generators t

i2 

and t

 for instance the corresponding choice of positions of

the sites would then be related to the initial one by the mbius transformation that exchanges 0 and
 and fixes 1 ie the inversion z 7 z1  more precisely under such a transformation of the spectral
parameter the lax matrix of the gaudin model behaves as a 1form on the riemann sphere and
satisfies

previous subsection let us note that the use of the ward identities was a crucial step in the above
reasoning as highlighted for instance by the subscript g in eq 217 this step should be performed

 18 

i1 

with care in particular when using the ward identities to replace t

i2 

 t

i3 

by t

in the

hamiltonians 217 indeed one can use the ward identities only for generators on the right in order
to do so one thus has to commute generators to bring them to the right replace them through the
ward identities and commute them back to their original place although this procedure can in general
create nontrivial corrections it can in fact be done freely in the case at hand indeed commuting

b creates a term proportional to the structure
operators tkj and tl j within the hamiltonian h

 this ensures

p
that the hamiltonian 217 indeed serves as a generating function of the operators d23
built from

i2 

and t

 a similar reasoning applies for the other choices of labeling by considering the

appropriate mbius transformations that permute the sites 0 1 and  of our 3site gaudin model

restricted vertices and relations between vertex operators

in the previous subsection we have shown that all of the operators listed in eq 114 commute with
each other as we have pointed out before we did not include operators with   0 and   p in the
list since these coincide with casimir differential operators

either j  1 or j  2 the remaining p  1 operators satisfy one more linear relation since

219

let us note that this relation also applies to the pfaffian vertex operators that exist for p  d2  1
when d is even we have used this relation to drop one of the vertex differential operators once these
obvious relations are taken care of the total number of commuting vertex differential operators is given
by eq 115 and matches precisely the maximal number of cross ratios that can be associated to a
single generic vertex see upper bound of eq 116 in the introduction but restricted vertices carry
fewer variables so their corresponding differential operators constructed in the previous section must
obey further relations it is the main goal of this subsection to discuss these relations we will also
check that once these are taken into account the number of remaining vertex differential operators
matches the number 116 of cross ratios at restricted vertices
i

our arguments are based on an important auxiliary result concerning the differential operators t

that are associated to some subset i  n of order i  n2 to present this requires a bit of

 19 

preparation up to this point there was no need to spell out the precise form of the symmetric
invariant tensors p that we used to construct our differential operators now we need to be a bit
more specific as is well known such tensors can be realized as symmetrized traces

220

here t  denote the generators of the conformal lie algebra and     signal symmetrization with
respect to the indices in the following we shall use the symbol str to denote this symmetrized
trace the trace can be taken in any faithful representation the simplest of such choices is to
use the fundamental representation in order to construct the associated symmetric invariants more
explicitly we shall replace the index  that enumerates the basis of the conformal algebra by a pair
  ab where a b run through a b  0 1     d  1 with t ab  t ba  in the fundamental
representation the matrix elements of these generators take the form
ab c
d

tf

  ac  bd   bc  ad 

where ab is the minkowski metric with signature d  1 1 and  ab is its inverse this makes it now
easy to compute p explicitly the only issue arises in even d in this case the symmetrized traces
in the fundamental representation do not generate all the invariants in order to obtain the missing
invariant one has to include the trace in a chiral representation the standard construction employs
the spinor representation in which generators t ab are represented as
tsab






1 a b 
     
4

where  a are the d  2dimensional  matrices and the matrix indices are    1     2d21  one
can then project to a chiral spinor representation with the help of c   0     d1 
let us now introduce the symbol t i to denote the following liealgebra valued differential operators
t i  t   ti 

1 ab
i
t
 tab 
2

upon evaluation in some finitedimensional representation such as the fundamental or the spinor
representation these become matrix valued differential operators with this notation we write our set
114 as

t i2 


p

221
g

when d is odd and the parameters p and  assume the values p  2 4     d  1 and   1     p  1
as usual for even dimension d on the other hand we use the symmetrized trace in the fundamental

 20 

representation for p  2 4     d and construct the missing pfaffian vertex differential operators as


d21

222

g

where we take the trace in the spinor representation and include the factor c in the argument
in finding relations between the vertex differential operators for restricted vertices we actually work
with the total symbols of the differential operators rather than the operators themselves this means
i

that we replace the partial derivatives  with commuting coordinates pi  the associated matrices
of functions of xi and pi will be denoted by t i  as before we shall add a subscript f s to denote
the matrices in the fundamental and the spinor representation after passing to the total symbol the
entries of the matrices commute and we can drop the symmetrization prescription when taking traces
as a result the total symbols of the vertex differential operators are simply traces of powers of the
matrices t i 
we are now ready to state the main result needed to elucidate the relations between vertex differential
i

operators it concerns the matrix elements of the nth power of the matrices tfs for the fundamental

and the spinor representations in both cases these matrix elements are functions of xi and pi with

i  i our main claim is that these matrix elements can be expressed in terms of lower order ones
of the same form whenever n  2di  where di  di d is the integer defined in eq 112 more

precisely for each matrix element ab there exist coefficients ab

such that


223

note that there is no summation over a b on the right hand side the coefficients ab depend only
p
on the external conformal weights i and the total symbols di
of the casimir operators associated

with the index set i if the index set i has depth di  1 for example ie

if the t i describe

the action of the conformal algebra on a single scalar primary then starting from n  3 all matrix
elements can be expressed in terms of lower order ones in the case of the spinor representation one
has a very similar relation

224

which now applies for n  di and involves a summation over m that ends at di  di d see definition
112 so if di  1 for example the matrix elements of the square are expressible in terms of the
i

matrix elements of ts  we verify both statements 223 and 224 in appendix c using embedding
space formalism see appendix b

 21 

we are now prepared to discuss relations between vertex differential operators let us consider a
vertex  inside our ope diagram as we have explained before  splits the set n into three subsets
ii with i  1 2 3 each of these sets determines an integer di  dii  d let us suppose that we
construct the vertex differential operators using t ii  for i  1 2 as in eq 221 if one of the integers
d1 or d2 is smaller than rd we immediately obtain relations among the vertex differential operators
in fact when applied to the matrices t i 1  our claim 223 implies that all operators we obtain
when   2d1 can be expressed in terms of casimir and vertex differential operators of lower order
the same is true when p    2d2  as follows again from eq 223 but this time applied to t i 2 
consequently for any p  2d1  2d2  we can restrict the range of the index  to be p  2d2    2d1 
with   0 p excluded as before
but this does not yet include the full set of relations that appears whenever d3 is smaller than mind1 
d2  rd  one of the simplest examples of this occurs in the 6point snowflake channel in d  3 see
figure 6 where two symmetric traceless tensor operators on two branches are combined at the central
vertex  to form another symmetric traceless tensor on the third branch

figure 6 snowflake ope diagram here the tensor product of any two branches around the vertex  would
allow a mixed symmetry tensor of depth d  4 to appear in d  7 but diagonal conformal symmetry constrains
this to match with the symmetric traceless tensor produced on the third branch

to take restrictions from the third branch i3 into account it is sufficient to use the total symbol of
eq 23 and impose once more our dependence statement 223 for product matrices this time for
t i3   this tells us that the matrix elements of powers

n a
t i1   t i2 

b

225

with n  2d3 can be written in terms of lower order terms in order to convert this observation into
relations among the vertex differential operators of order p we can multiply the expression 225 with

 22 

some appropriate powers of t ii   i  1 2 and consider the matrix elements of the products


t i1   t i2 

n 

t i2 

 

t i1 

pn

226

for n  2d3  any allowed value of p  n and   0     p  n by binomial expansion we can write
the expression 226 as a linear combination of our basic vertex differential operators after taking
relations on the branches i1 and i2 into account we obtain an additional nontrivial relation from the
b
third branch i3  for example in the cases where n is odd contracting 225 with t i2  a leads
to a relation between vertex and casimir operators of order n  1 and further lower order operators
this effectively reduces the amount of vertex operators at order p by up to p  2d3  1 though the
actual number can be lower in case there are less than p  2d3  1 vertex operators at order p left after
imposing the constraints from the first two branches if we are interested in counting the number of
vertex operators at a given even order p the procedure we just outlined is summarized in the following
counting formula

p

p  2

0 p  2di p  2di  1  0 

227

where 0 is the heaviside step function with 0 0  0 the factor p2 gives the maximal amount of
vertex operators at order p the factor p  2di  1 corresponds to the number of relations introduced
for every di  p2 and the maximum enforces the number to be 0 if there are more than p  2
relations in total
our description of relations between vertex differential operators exploited the auxiliary statement
223 and did not include the pfaffian vertex differential operators it is clear however that precisely
the same reasoning also applies to the latter using eq 224 instead of eq 223 the counting
formula 227 gets also slightly modified for this pfaffian case

note that the arguments we have outlined here exhibit relations between vertex operators but we have
not shown that these relations are complete ie that the remaining vertex differential operators are
in fact independent a priori it could in fact happen that the exceeding relations we get from here
or additional relations obtained from a different reasoning could provide additional dependencies
we checked however that summing the counting formulas 227 and 228 for all allowed orders p
in a given dimension d gives rise to a number of vertex differential operators equal to the number
of cross ratios 116 associated with every allowed vertex this provides strong evidence in favor

 23 

of the independence of our vertex differential operators in some particularly relevant cases in lower
dimensions we can also prove independence
example the n  6 snowflake channel for d  7 let us see how all of this works in the example of a
snowflake channel in d  7 presented in figure 6 we enumerate the internal links by r  1 2 3 the
associated index sets iri are i11  1 2 i21  3 4     here we have two symmetric traceless
tensors associated with r  1 2 in a more general ope diagram these could produce a mixed
symmetry tensor with maximal depth d  rd  4 but in the snowflake diagram the field on the third
link must also be a symmetric traceless tensor of depth di3  d  7  2 our prescription tells us to
consider operators 221 up to p  8 eliminating powers of t1  t 12 and t2  t 34 higher than
4 it immediately follows that there are no vertex operators of order 8

231

here and in the following steps we are using notation for which stroked terms are dependent on lower
order operators let us also recall that the operators with   p2 have been omitted to account for
the relation between the vertex and casimir differential operators for the third leg the reduction of
t3  t 56 to a symmetric traceless tensor implies the existence of p  2d3  1 relations between p

expansion

ope channels and limits of gaudin models

at this point we have defined a set of differential operators associated with the intermediate fields and
the individual vertices of a given ope diagram with n external fields the new vertex operators were
constructed in subsection 22 from a gaudin model with three sites which was crucial in proving their
commutativity our construction of the vertex operators has been local in its focus on a particular
building block namely a single vertex that is associated to a local element of the ope diagram
the purpose of this section is to adopt a more global perspective by showing that the whole set of
casimir and vertex differential operators for any n point ope channel can be obtained by taking an
appropriate limit of an n site gaudin model the n site gaudin model itself makes no reference to
the choice of ope channel the latter enters only through the choice of limit we will therefore refer
to these limits as ope limits of the n site gaudin model these ope limits are generalizations of the
socalled bending flow and caterpillar limits that have been considered in the mathematical literature
see eg 5355 the same limit of a 4site gaudin model  which may be identified with the elliptic
inozemtsev model 56  has also appeared in the physics literature recently 57 eberhardt komatsu
and mizera have shown that the limit theory coincides with the hyperbolic calogerosutherland model
which is known to describe the casimir equations of 4point conformal blocks
31

n sites gaudin model and ope limits

let us first define the gaudin model that we will use in this section since this construction is similar
to the one of the 3sites gaudin model considered in section 22 we refer to that section for details and
references as before we consider a gaudin model based on the conformal lie algebra g  sod  1 1
but now with n sites whose positions w1      wn  c are for the moment arbitrary we naturally
associate these sites with the n external fields in the correlation function under consideration and
more precisely attach to each site i  1     n  the representation of g defined by the generators
i

t  which describe the action of the conformal transformations on the scalar field i xi  in terms of
firstorder differential operators then we define the components of the lax matrix of the model as
l z wi

31

the associated gaudin hamiltonians hp z wi  of degree p are given by the same equation 27
that we used for the 3site case recall that p denotes the conformally invariant symmetric tensor of
degree p and    represent quantum corrections the latter have the same form as in the 3site case
see eq 29 it is well known that these n site gaudin hamiltonians commute just as their three

 25 

site analogues ie they satisfy eq 28 at the same time it is easy to verify that they are invariant
under diagonal conformal transformations

111 this means that gaudin hamiltonians descend to correlation functions g
the hamiltonian hp z wi  of the n site gaudin model depends on the n complex parameters wi
that specify the poles of the lax matrix these parameters have no a priori interpretation in the
context of correlation functions note that we can always apply mbius transformations on the zvariable to fix three of the wi  this is what allowed us in the previous section to set the parameters
of the 3site gaudin model to the specific values 211 in which case the lax matrix 212 and
its corresponding differential operators contain no extra parameters our main claim is that we can
reconstruct the entire set of 3site lax matrices l z as well as the associated vertex hamiltonians

in order to make a precise statement we need a bit of preparation the limits we are about to discuss
must depend on the choice of the ope channel so let us assume we are given such a channel c in
order to define the limits we pick an arbitrary external edge in the diagram which will serve as a
reference point and which up to reordering we can suppose to have label n  as this edge is external
it is attached to a unique vertex which we will denote by   such a choice of reference vertex defines
a socalled rooted tree representation of the diagram we then draw the ope diagram on a plane
with the vertex  situated at the top and with each vertex having two downward edges attached
such a representation on a plane forces us to make a choice of which edges are pointing towards the
left and which edges are pointing towards the right this choice is arbitrary and gives rise to what is
called a plane or ordered representation of the underlying rooted tree we give an example of such
a plane rooted tree representation for an 8point ope diagram in figure 7 below

figure 7 plane rooted tree representation of an ope diagram with 8 external fields

recall from section 1 that each vertex  of the ope diagram defines a partition n  i1  i2  i3 
with the sets ij formed by the labels of the external fields attached to the three branches of the
vertex although the choice of labeling of these branches was arbitrary in section 1 we will now fix it
using the plane rooted tree representation of the diagram picked above choose the branch i1 to be
the one pointing to the bottom left and the branch i2 to be the one pointing to the bottom right
by construction the last branch i3 then always points to the top and contains the reference point
n
each vertex  in the diagram is thereby associated with a sequence s  s1  s2      sn  of elements
sa  1 2 this sequence s encodes the path from  to  it tells us whether we have to move to
the left for sa  1 or right for sa  2 every time we reach a new vertex until we arrive at  after
n steps we shall also refer to the length n of the sequence as the depth of the vertex and to s as
the binary sequence of  note that the top vertex  has depth n  0 let us point out that the
notion of depth used in this section refers to the distance from the root  and is very different from
the depth d introduced in eq 112 of the introduction
in order to construct the limit of the gaudin model that we are interested in we will need to assign
a polynomial g  to each vertex  if s is the binary sequence associated with the vertex  the
polynomial g is defined as
g  

n
x

a1 sa 2 

33

obviously the top vertex  is assigned to g   0 the vertices of depth n  1 are associated
with g1   0 or g2   1 depending on whether they are reached from  by going down to the
left 1  or to the right 2 

 27 

similarly we can assign polynomials fi  to each external edge 1  i  n at the bottom of the plane
rooted tree once again we can encode the path from  down to the edge i by a binary sequence
si  si1  si2      sini  the length ni of the sequence si is also referred to as the depth of the edge i
now we introduce

for the external edge of the reference field at the top of the plane rooted tree thereby we have now
set up all the necessary notation that is needed to construct the relevant scaling limits of the n site
gaudin model
we can now move on to the main result of this section namely how to reconstruct the vertex hamilp

tonians h z of the 3site gaudin model of the previous section from the n site hamiltonians
hp z  hp z wi  to this end we will first construct the vertex lax matrices 212 from the lax
matrix 31 before studying the associated hamiltonians 27 in the limit as it turns out we can
recover the parameter free lax matrix l that is associated with the vertex  as

let us note that in the limit the site wn  1 associated with the reference field n goes to infinity
while the sites of the other external fields approach z  0 or z  1 depending on whether they are
located at the right or left branch of the the plane rooted tree ie whether their binary sequence s
starts with s1  1 or s1  2 we shall prove eq 36 in the third subsection 33 through a recursive
procedure that will also offer insight into the construction of the polynomials g and fi 
let us now turn to the limit construction for the gaudin hamiltonians we claim that the hamiltonians
p

hp z wi  of the n sites gaudin model give rise to the hamiltonians h z of the different 3sites
vertex gaudin models defined in section 22 as

hp z  lim pn hp n z  g  wi  fi

37

the fact that this statement holds for the leading part of the hamiltonians without quantum corrections follows directly from the corresponding limit 36 of the lax matrix

 0

l1 n z  g     lp n z  g   1 p l1 z    lp z

 28 

but it requires a bit of work to argue that the quantum corrections also have the required behaviour
under the limit consider a term of the form 29 in the correction by appropriately distributing the
powers pn  using the fact that r1      rq  p and performing the change of spectral parameter
z 7 z0   n z  g  in the derivatives we find that

 1 q zr1 1  n l1 n z  g     zrq 1  n lq n z  g

  1 q zr1 1 l1 z    zrq 1 lq z
p

such that this correction term reduces in the ope limit to the corresponding correction in h z
as the vertex operators dp and the casimir operators drp of the intermediate fields attached to the
p

vertex  are naturally extracted from the hamiltonian h z the property 37 shows that the full
set of operators defined in section 1 can be obtained from the limit of the n sites gaudin model
considered here before the limit   0 the commutativity property 28 of the n site gaudin
hamiltonians can be written as
h

for arbitrary  and is therefore preserved in the limit   0

 p

h z h0 w  0

 z w  c

39

this provides an alternative proof of the commutativity of all casimir operators drp and vertex operators dp  moreover this statement now holds without needing to use conformal ward identities
the proof relies on a specific choice of labeling of the edges at vertices given by a plane rooted tree
representation of the ope diagram different such representations of the diagram correspond to different limits of the same underlying n sites gaudin model and give rise to different sets of commuting
operators which however generate the same algebra when acting on solutions of the conformal ward
identities finally let us note that the above construction automatically ensures the compatibility
of these operators with the conformal ward identities since taking appropriate limits of eq 32
n 

demonstrates that they commute with the diagonal conformal generators t

examples

before we prove our main result let us illustrate the construction of the operators from limits of
gaudin models with two examples the first one addresses the socalled comb channel ope diagrams
for which we have already outlined the limit in 1 the second example deals with the snowflake ope
channel of the n  6point function

 29 

comb channel

let us consider the comb channel ope diagram with n external fields to apply

the construction of the present section we first need to pick a plane rooted tree representation of this
diagram we will choose to represent it with all internal edges pointing towards the bottom left we
then label the external edges of the tree as follows we let n be the top edge of the tree 1 be edge
furthest to the left and label by 2     n  1 the external edges pointing to the bottom right at each
vertex from the bottom to the top moreover following our conventions in 1 we enumerate the
vertices   r by an integer r  1     n  2 from bottom to top we represent this plane rooted
tree in figure 8 below with external edges indicated in black and vertices in blue

one can compute the limit of the gaudin model associated with this tree using the construction

gaudin model one finds from eq 34 that

formula 33 in particular we find
nr  n  2  r

and

gr   0

 r  1     n  2 

311

note in particular that for this choice of plane rooted tree the polynomial functions g are all zero

the above limit coincides exactly with the one introduced in 1 to describe the comb channel thus
showing that the results of 1 are contained in the more general construction discussed here
snowflake channel the results of the present article allow us to discuss more general topologies of
ope diagrams than the comb channel the first example of such a topology is the snowflake channel
of 6point functions we represent this ope diagram as a plane rooted tree following the conventions
of figure 9 where the external edges are labeled in black from 1 to 6 and the vertices are labeled in
blue from 1 to 4 note in particular that the internal vertex of the diagram corresponds here to the
label 3

these indeed give the expected vertex lax matrices l  l for the vertices labeled by r  1 2 3 4
these two examples suffice to gain a first intuition into how we take limits of gaudin models and
thereby manage to embed the vertex lax matrices into the full n sites model we will now explain
the derivation of our results for general ope diagrams
33

recursive proof of the limits

subtrees our goal in this subsection is to prove that our limit construction is indeed able to recover
all vertex lax matrices as we have claimed let us consider some ope channel c represented by a
plane rooted tree t  the approach that we follow is recursive let us consider the top vertex  of the
tree which is by construction attached to the external edge n  we denote by e0 and e00 the left and
right downward edges attached to  which can correspond to either external or intermediate fields
depending on the topology of the diagram we can then see the tree t as being composed of the
vertex  and of two plane rooted subtrees with reference edges e0 and e00  which we will call t 0 and
t 00 respectively in figure 10 below we illustrate the two subtrees obtained in the example of figure

figure 10 subtrees of the tree 7

we will now prove that if the limit construction of subsection 31 holds for the subtrees t 0 and t 00 
then it also holds for the initial tree t  thus proving that it holds for any tree by induction let us
first introduce some useful notation we will denote by e 0 and e 00 the external edges of t that belong
to the subtrees t 0 and t 00 respectively note that if t 0 is not trivial ie if e0 is not an external edge
of the initial tree t  then the full set of external edges of t 0 is e 0  e0  since e0 is external in t 0
but not in t  on the other hand if e0 is external in t  then we simply have e 0  e0  and the
subtree t 0 is trivial let us also denote by v  v 0 and v 00 the set of vertices of t  t 0 and t 00  such
that v  v 0  v 00   
recursion relations

recall the polynomial g  defined in eq 33 for any vertex   v of t

in terms of the binary sequence s  s1      sn  let us suppose that this vertex is contained in the

subtree t 0 and thus belongs to v 0  it is then associated with a binary sequence s0   s01      s0n0  in
t 0  by construction the depth n0 of  in t 0 is given by n  1 moreover it is clear that the binary

sequence of  in t is related to that in t 0 by s  1 s01      s0n 1  indeed since  belongs to t 0 

the path from  to  starts by going to the bottom left s1  1 and is then given by the path from

e0 to  encoded by s0   it is then clear that the polynomial g  defined by eq 33 is related to
the corresponding polynomial g0  defined for t 0 by g    g0  similarly if  belongs to
v 00  we have s  2 s001       s00n1  and thus g   1   g00  in conclusion the polynomials
g  satisfy the recursion relation

0
 g 
g   1  g00

if   v 0 
if   v 00 
if    

320

a similar analysis can be performed for the sites wi  fi  associated with the external edges i  n
through eq 34 distinguishing three cases if i  n is the top reference edge then we recall that

 33 

wn  fn   1  if i  e 0 is an edge belonging to the subtree t 0  then one can relate the binary
sequences si and s0 i describing i in t and t 0 in a similar way as for the vertices in the paragraph
above we then find that the polynomial fi  satisfy the recursion relation


if e0 is external in t
fi  
0
fi  else

321

note that in the first case the subtree t 0 is trivial and the index i is then necessarily equal to e0  while
in the second case i is different from e0 and the subtree t 0 is therefore nontrivial finally if i  e 00
belongs to the subtree t 00  then we similarly find

1
fi  
1  fi00 

if e00 is external in t
else

322

here i  e00 in the first case and i 6 e00 in the second one
induction hypotheses we will now suppose that the limit procedure defined in subsection 31
holds for the subtrees t 0 and t 00  to phrase these induction hypotheses more precisely let us focus
first on the subtree t 0  if it is nontrivial ie if e0 is not external in t  the external edges of t 0 are
e 0  e0  we then introduce the gaudin lax matrix associated with t 0 as
i

l0 z 

x
ie 0 
 e0 

t

z  fi0 

323

where the sites associated with the external edges e 0  e0  are set to the positions fi0  prescribed
i

by the limit procedure of subsection 31 here the generators t

associated with external fields

0

i  e are defined by their expression in the initial tree t  while the generators associated with e0 are
e0 

defined by t

n e 0 

 t

 by construction the latter satisfy the commutation relations of g and
i

commute with the other generators t  i  e 0  as required moreover this definition ensures that
p
p
i
i
the diagonal conformal generators in t of the tree t coincides with the ones ie 0 e0  t of
e0 

t 0 however as we will see the definition of t

is in fact irrelevant for the recursive proof

as t 0 is assumed to be nontrivial here its vertex set v 0 is nonempty the induction hypothesis that
we make in this subsection is then that eq 36 holds for the subtree t 0  that is to say

in this equation we used the lax matrix l z associated with the vertex  as defined in the initial
tree t  indeed it is clear that this vertex lax matrix coincides with the one associated with  in the
subtree t 0 in particular the subsets of external edges i1 and i2 associated with the left and right
branches of  are the same when defined for t as when defined for t 0

we are now in a position to prove that the induction carries from the

subtrees t 0 and t 00 to t  for that we will show that the limit 36 holds for every vertex   v  with
three cases to distinguish if   v 0 belongs to the subtree t 0  we will use the induction hypothesis
324 and the recursion relations 320 first case and 321 similarly if   v 00 belongs to t 00 
we will use the induction hypothesis 326 and the recursion relations 320 second case and 322
finally if  is the reference vertex   then the limit will follow without having to use any induction
hypothesis as these proofs are rather technical we gather them in appendix a

example 5point conformal blocks

as an example of our construction of commuting differential operators let us consider a correlator of
five scalar fields
h1 2 3 4 5 i

41

and fix the ope decomposition as in figure 2
this correlator can be be written schematically as
i 

h1 2 3 4 5 i  5
i 

where 5

xi  i  u1      u5 

42

xi  is a prefactor that takes into account the covariance of the correlator with respect to

conformal transformations while  i  u1      u5  is a conformally invariant function which depends
on five cross ratios and admits a conformal block decomposition in order to obtain differential
equations for 5point conformal blocks one first needs to determine which casimir and vertex operators
characterize these blocks and then compute their action on the space of cross ratios ui 
for the ope decomposition of figure 2 the recipe of section 2 instructs us to construct four casimir

note that  in agreement with the general recipe  the vertex operator is not uniquely defined and 47
can be shifted by terms proportional to t1  t2 2 t3 2 or to the casimir operators3
to make explicit computations we will use the embedding space formalism of 25 with which one can
efficiently compute the action of the differential operators in cross ratio space we briefly review this
formalism in appendix b note here that the dimension of spacetime only appears in our computations

the first step is the choice of prefactor 5

in physical space coordinates can be easily translated into one in embedding space through the

simple relation

equivalent set of operators

 36 

in comparison with a potentially more natural parameterization using five independent 4point cross
ratios as in eg 31 43 this parameterization of cross ratio space has the advantage of presenting all
of our differential operators with polynomial coefficients in the ui 
using the scalar representation for generators in the embedding space b3 the operators 4347
can be easily expressed as objects dxi  acting on the coordinates xia  to obtain their action on the
space of cross ratios dui   one simply conjugates the dxi  by the prefactor as follows

in practical terms the rhs above is expressed in terms of the generators b3 and the expresi 

sions 49411 of 5

and the ui s in terms of scalar products the lhs is then obtained by

solving 410411 for five different scalar products and substituting them in the rhs after the conjugation has been done the remaining scalar products will drop out and the final answer for the lhs
will be expressed only in terms of the cross ratios
to implement this procedure more concretely we attach to this publication a mathematica notebook4 
where we present the explicit computation of the quadratic casimirs as well as the final expressions
one gets for the fourthorder casimirs and the vertex operator 47 by trivially extending the same
algorithm

conclusions and outlook

in this paper we have initiated the construction of multipoint conformal blocks for correlation functions
of n scalar fields more concretely we constructed a number of independent commuting differential
operators on n point functions that matches the number of conformally invariant cross ratios in
consequence these operators uniquely determine conformal blocks as bases of joint eigenfunctions into
which one can expand any correlation function of n scalar fields the set of commuting differential
operators depends on the choice of an ope channel we constructed them for all channel topologies
extending the results we announced in 1 our construction relies on the identification of these
operators with the hamiltonians of certain ope limits of integrable gaudin models see section 3
let us note that in the special case of d  2 the relation between conformal blocks and gaudin
models is consistent with recent observations in 58 concerning ambitwistor realizations of scattering
5 these

expressions differ with what one would get from 43 and 44 by an overall factor of 2

equations in ads3  given the close connection between conformal blocks and scattering amplitudes in
antide sitter space 59 but it is important to stress that the n site gaudin hamiltonians simplify
significantly in the ope limits relevant to the theory of conformal blocks while the 4site gaudin
system for d  1 is related to the heun equation for example one obtains hypergeometric differential
equations in the ope limits
in any given channel the set of differential operators decomposes into two subsets formed by casimir
differential operators on the one hand and the novel vertex differential operators on the other hand
individual vertices can give rise to multivariable integrable systems with up to nv d independent
commuting hamiltonians in the most generic case all such hamiltonians are of order higher than
two and they have not received much attention in the physics literature so far in order to develop a
theory of these vertex systems it seems reasonable to start with the singlevariable cases according
to formula 116 all vertices that appear in the comb channel of an n point function in d  3 4
contribute one single degree of freedom the same is true for the nontrivial vertices in the comb
channel of n  5 6point functions in any d  2 therefore singlevariable vertex systems already
cover many cases of interest the associated vertex differential operator has already been constructed
in 1 though not for the most general case in the sequel to this work we will revisit this operator
construct it for all singlevariable vertex systems and show that it can be mapped to the fourth order
hamiltonian of an elliptic calogeromosersutherland model that was first discovered about 10 years
ago by etingof felder ma and veselov in 42
there are two important directions that we will address in order to develop the theory of multipoint
blocks the first one concerns the extension of what we described in the previous paragraph to vertices
with more variables such as the central vertex in the snowflake channel of a 6point function in d  2
we will discuss this in a forthcoming paper the second important direction concerns the study of
joint eigenfunctions for the vertex differential operators unlike the single variable of a 4point
function in d  1 for which the casimir differential equation is the ordinary hypergeometric equation
even the single variable case of the vertex system seems to be uncharted let alone its multivariable
extensions we plan to address this challenge in the future before we combine the knowledge about
vertex systems back into a full theory of multipoint conformal blocks in this context it would also be
interesting to examine the relations of our approach with the weight shifting technology of multipoint
blocks with nonscalar exchange recently exhibited in 41
while executing the entire program still requires a significant amount of work applications can be
pursued in parallel this applies in particular to the multipoint bootstrap that was also advocated

 39 

recently in 43 one can expect the study of multipoint correlation functions to give access to new
dynamical information that is not visible in scalar 4point functions the analytic bootstrap study
of 4point functions has provided powerful access to anomalous dimensions of double twist operators
as well as ope coefficients for the operator product of two fundamental scalars into double twist
operators 60 61 similarly crossing symmetry for n  6point functions constrains the anomalous
dimensions of triple twist operators and various opes of the fundamental field with double twist
operators depending on channel topologies that are analyzed

proof of the induction in the limits of gaudin models

in this appendix we detail the induction in the proof of the limit procedure of section 3 we thus refer
to this section for notation and definitions our main goal is to show that for every vertex   v  the
lax matrix of the n sites gaudin model satisfies the limit 36 for the purposes of this appendix
it will be useful to rewrite this limit as
i 
i 
 0
t 2
t 1


n l h z   l z

a1

h z   n z  g 

a2

where we introduced

in the lefthand side of a1 and in all this appendix we fix the sites wi of the gaudin model to
their value wi  fi  prescribed by the limit procedure of subsection 31 recall that  is either the
reference vertex   in v 0 or in v 00  we will treat these three cases separately
a1

reference vertex

let us first consider the reference vertex   the definition of n and g made in subsection 31 can
be simply rewritten as
n  0

and

 40 

h z   z

a3

we then have

n
i
x

t

n l h z   l z 
z  wi
i1

a4

to proceed further we decompose this sum over external edges i  1     n  into three parts
the first part is the contribution from the reference edge

contribution of the reference edge

n  with corresponding site wn  fn   1  according to eq 35 it simply reads
n 

n 

t
 t
0

 0
z  wn
z 1

a5

and thus does not contribute to the limit of a4 when   0
contribution of the subtree t 0 

the second part is the contribution from the subtree t 0 attached

to e0  for which we should distinguish the cases where e0 is external or not if e0 is external in which
case t 0 is trivial and e0 is the only contribution from this subtree recall from the first case of eq
321 that we then have we0  fe0    so that the contribution to a4 simply is
e0 

e0 

t
0 t


z
z

a6
e0 

note that as e0 is external we have e 0  e0  so that the generators t

e 0 

coincide with t



if e0 is intermediate in the initial diagram then the contribution from the subtree t 0 comes from the
edges i  e 0  n  with corresponding sites wi  fi    fi0  as in the second line of eq 321
by construction the functions fi0  associated with the external edges i  e 0 stay finite when   0
indeed as we supposed t 0 nontrivial the edges i  e 0 are not the reference edge e0 of t 0 and are thus
associated with polynomial functions fi0  thus we get that the corresponding sites wi   fi0 
in the initial tree tend to 0 when   0 in this limit the contribution of this subtree t 0 to the sum
a4 then simply becomes
x ti 0 1 x

ti 
z

w

ie

a7

to conclude let us observe that the sum in the righthand side of the above equation is by definition
e 0 

t

 combined with the eq a6 and the discussion that followed it for the case where e0 is

external we thus observe that in both cases e0 external and internal the contribution of the subtree
t 0 in the limit   0 of eq a4 is simply
0

x ti 0 te 


z  wi
z

ie

 41

contribution of the subtree t 00 

a similar argument applies to the contribution of the right

subtree t 00  attached to e00  if the latter is external this contribution is simply equal to
e00 

t

z1

a9

since we then have we00  1  see the first line of eq 322 if e00 is intermediate the corresponding
sites wi  i  e 00  are given by the second line of eq 322 and read wi  fi   1   fi00  which
thus tend to 1 when   0 in both cases we find that the contribution to a4 is given by
e 00 

i

where in the first case t

conclusion

while in the second case t

summing the contributions a5 a8 and a10 in the limit of eq a4 when

  0 we then find

to conclude we observe that the labeling of branches at vertices made in subsection 31 using the
plane rooted tree representation t of the diagram implies that e 0  i 1 and e 00  i 2  this shows
that the limit a1 is satisfied for the reference vertex  
a2

vertices in v 0 

let us now consider the case of a vertex   v 0 in the subtree attached to e0  note that the existence
of this vertex requires the subtree t 0 to be nontrivial and thus the edge e0 to be intermediate in the
initial diagram the definition of n and the recursion relation for g  in the first line of eq 320
can be rewritten as
n  n0  1

and

h z    h0 z 

a12

0

where we have defined h0 z   n z  g0  as the equivalent of h z  for the subtree t 0  we
thus have

 h0 z   wi

a13

we will once again separate this expression in three parts coming from the contributions of the
reference edge n and the two subtrees

 42 

contribution of the reference edge let us start with the edge n  with associated site wn 
fn   1  its contribution to a13 in the limit   0 is then given by
0

a14

let us now consider the contribution coming from the subtree

00

attached to e  if e is external in the initial tree t  then we simply have we00  1 according to

the first line of eq 322 and the contribution to a13 is
e00 

0

n 1 t
0
 0
0
 h z   1

a15

if e00 is initially intermediate then the contribution comes from the external edges i  e 00  n whose
corresponding sites are given by the second line of eq 322 to be wi  fi   1   fi00  in
particular these tend to 1 when   0 thus in this case the contribution of the subtree t 00 to
a13 also vanishes

thus the only nonvanishing contribution to a13 in the limit

  0 comes from the subtree t attached to e0  recall that t 0 is nontrivial since it possesses a
vertex  the external edges i  e 0  n are thus different from e0 and are associated with the sites
wi  fi   fi0  according to the second line of eq 321 the contribution of t 0 to a13
then reads

the gaudin lax matrix of the subtree t 0 the one of the full tree not the ones associated with vertices
is given by eq 323 and thus can be rewritten as

the second term vanishes in the limit   0 moreover by the induction hypothesis 324 for the
subtree t 0  the first term tends to l z in this limit in conclusion we thus get
0

x
ie 0

i

n 1 t

 l z
 h0 z   wi

 43 

a20

conclusion

since the contribution a20 is the only nonvanishing term in the limit of eq a13

when   0 we thus get in the end that
 0
n l h z   l z

a21

as required this indeed shows that the limit a1 is satisfied for vertices   v 0  using the induction
hypothesis 324 that a similar property also holds in the subtree t 0 
a3

vertices in v 00

let us finally consider a vertex   v 00  the procedure here will resemble the one in the previous
subsection so we will not describe it in detail the definition of n and the recursion relation for g 
in the second line of eq 320 can be rewritten as
n  n00  1

and

h z   1   h00 z 

a22

the main difference with the case of a vertex in v 0 is that we introduced a shift by 1 in the expression

of h z  the effect of this shift is that in the computation of the limit of n l h z  when
  0 the only nonvanishing contribution now comes from the subtree t 00 and not from t 0  more
precisely using the fact that the shift by 1 cancels with the 1 in the recursive expression 322 of the
sites wi  i  e 00  we find in the end that


00
lim n l h z   lim n l00 h00 z   l z

0

0

a23

with l00 the lax matrix 325 associated with the subtree t 00  and where the last equality follows from
the induction hypothesis 326 for the subtree t 00  this then completes the proof of the induction

embedding space formalism and indexfree notation

in this section we will briefly review the embedding space formalism of 25 as well as a slight generalization of their indexfree notation that we are going to use in the proof of appendix c we will
in particular focus on scalar and tensorial representations in short the embedding space formalism
makes use of the isomorphism between the conformal group in d dimensions and the lorentz group
in d  2 dimensions  both corresponding to sod  1 1  to map objects from one space to the
other points x  rd are mapped to d  2dimensional vectors x a  x   x   x   here presented
in lightcone coordinates with metric ds2  dx  dx    dx  dx   and to make the degrees of
freedom match these vectors are constrained to the projective lightcone
x a  x  1 x2  x   1 x2  x  

 44 

b1

with this mapping scalar fields become homogeneous objects of degree  with respect to the
coordinates x a they depend on
o x   o x 

b2

this has the big advantage that the conformal generators some of which are nonlinear once mapped
to the embedding space acquire all the same linear form namely the one of lorentz generators
tab  xa b  xb a 

b3

where xa is obtained by lowering the index of x a by contraction with the flat metric ab  this not
only simplifies the analytic expressions that one works with but also allows one to carry out computer
algebra computations in a much faster and general way through the implementation of indices this
proves very useful for the computation of operators for scalar multipoint blocks like those of section 4
when one considers fields in spinning representations labeled by l spins l1  l2      ll

expressions involving these tensorial representations can be further simplified by the use of an indexfree notation in embedding space one can implement this by either making the antisymmetries of
the tensors manifest with fermionic variables as was first done in 62 or by making the symmetries
manifest with bosonic variables in a form like appendix b of 63 in agreement with our choice of
representation for b4 we will keep the symmetries manifest and use the latter formalism the core
idea is to remove indices from the tensorial expressions b4 by converting them to polynomials on
m auxiliary vectors zi  cd2 through the contractions

to keep everything consistent with the conformal covariance tracelessness and transversality of the

note how the zi are not all on equal footing but there is rather a hierarchy of gauge transformations b10 that respects the hierarchy of spins l1      ll  the zi associated to larger spins
are less constrained than the ones for smaller spins in fact a function oli  x zi  satisfying the constraints b10 is a section of a line bundle over the flag manifold so1 d  1pdl 6

using this type of representation for generators and fields it becomes much simpler to obtain casimir

classical embedding space

for the proof in appendix c we are going to need a classical version of the embedding space formalism
for the spinning fields that we have just discussed for this purpose we introduce pa as the conjugate
momentum to x a  and qia as conjugate momenta of the auxiliary variables zia 
to see which constraints are imposed on these classical variables one can check the action of the
operators

relations among vertex differential operators

our goal in this appendix is to justify the relations 223 and 224 for the total symbols of our
vertex differential operators there are many ways to derive these relations here we shall follow a
more pedestrian approach that does not require much background from representation theory
in order to derive the relations 223 224 we first note that these were formulated in terms of the
coordinates and momenta of the external scalar fields the representation of the conformal algebra
that is associated to the index set i decomposes into an infinite number of spinning representations
each of the irreducible components can be prepared in embedding space formalism see appendix
b here we shall study the relations 223 for a given irreducible component so that the coefficients
fs are functions of the associated weight and spins rather than functions of symbols of the casimir
differential operators
after these introductory comments let us approach relation 223 by considering the simplest example
in which the intermediate irreducible representation is scalar we can construct explicitly the first
three matrices t n ab 7 in the classical embedding space that we introduced in appendix b1

and in the discussion below we shall drop the subscript f 

 47 

c1

it is then clear that when considering scalar representations the powers of generators t n with n  3
will be dependent on lower powers of the generators this directly implies that any vertex operator
of the type 221 that contains a power of a scalar generator higher than two will become dependent
on operators of lower order eg
t 3  b  t  b 

c2

we would now like to prove that something analogous to c1 is valid for representations of higher
depth d and higher powers respectively let us then consider the generators for a mixed symmetry
tensor of depth d

we expect the nfold contractions of generators t n to be independent up to power n  2d with the
first dependent object produced at power n  2d  1 to prove this let us focus on a specific matrix
entry t n ab of the powers t n and construct the following submatrix of the jacobian for fixed indices

if what we argued above holds we should be able to see that some 2dminors of c4 are equal to
zero while the same matrix with the last row dropped out has all nonzero 2dminors we checked
this with mathematica symbolically for the case of symmetric traceless tensors and numerically for
mixed symmetry tensors of depth d  6 exhausting all tensorial representations that are allowed in
the range of dimensions of known cfts one can use a similar reasoning to show eq 224
let us finally comment on a more conceptual interpretation of the results of this appendix we
consider first the case of a scalar representation whose generators can be gathered in the matrix
tf ab  x a pb  xb p a in the fundamental representation using the relations x a xa  0 and
x a pa   one can show that the matrix tf is diagonalisable with eigenvalues   and 0 with
multiplicity d it is a standard result of linear algebra that tf is then annihilated by the polynomial
with simple roots equal to these eigenvalues namely t t  t    t 3  2 t  we recover this
way that tf3  2 tf 
a similar argument can be formulated for a representation with higher depth d  l  1 characterized
by a weight  and l spins l1      ll  the symbols of the generators of this representation are
given by eq b14 and can be gathered in a matrix tf valued in the fundamental representation

 48 

the traces of odd powers of tf vanish while the traces of even powers are given by the classical
pd2
casimirs b15 these traces are the newton sums i1 pi of the eigenvalues 1      d2 of tf
and thus determine these eigenvalues uniquely up to permutation more precisely we find that tf
has eigenvalues   l1  l1      ll  ll and 0 with multiplicity d  2l if we suppose that tf is
diagonalizable it is then annihilated by the polynomial with simple roots equal to these eigenvalues
hence

tf tf2  2 tf2  l12    tf2  ll

c5

this shows that the power tf2l3  tf2d1 is expressible in terms of lower power tfn  n  2d as
expected let us finally note that the coefficients in the relation c5 are elementary symmetric
2
polynomials in the variables 2  l12      ll
 by the newton identities these coefficients are then
pl
also polynomials in the newton sums 2p  i1 li2p and thus in the values b15 of the classical
nm

casimirs this ensures that the coefficients f ab in eq 223 are polynomials in the total symbols
of the casimir operators
