supersaturation is the fundamental thermodynamic parameter driving crystal nucleation and growth yet
no method can characterize it during the formation of colloidal nanocrystals ncs here we develop a
framework to experimentally characterize timeresolved profiles of supersaturation throughout nc growth
as demonstrated with au nanocubes our methodology can predict the growth profiles of ncs and reveal
supersaturationassociated shape evolutions by altering supersaturation dynamics we modulate these shape
evolutions and nc features with atomic precision this work paves the way for deeper understanding of the
complex phenomena directing nanoscale crystal growth and provides insight for the rational design of ncs

properties that can be superior or unavailable to bulk

elucidating reaction pathways synthesis methods can grow
ncs with precise size shape elemental composition and
lattice strain 714 facilitating nextgeneration technologies
in heterogenous catalysis chemical processing electronics
photonics energy harvesting chemical and biological
sensing medicine and environmental remediation 161517 nonetheless despite significant interest the growth of
colloidal ncs remains poorly understood based in part on
limited insight into the thermodynamic processes governing
growth 1819
supersaturation is the fundamental thermodynamic
parameter that drives crystal growth and can be defined by

s  ln

d

where c is the bulk monomer concentration c is the bulk
saturation concentration d is the chemical potential and
kbt is the thermodynamic temperature to form ncs
synthesis formulations modulate c above the saturation
enabling growth if nuclei are present or nucleation limits
for substratebound ncs mechanistic experiments use open
reactions and introduce vapor or liquid sources with fixed
supersaturations to uncover insight into growth 2023 in
contrast colloidal nc syntheses typically use closed
conditions and reactions dynamically convert precursor to
monomer throughout crystal formation fig 1a these
processes are complex and supersaturation profiles during
growth have yet to be quantitatively determined hindering
the theoretical modeling as well as mechanistic investigation
of colloidal nc growth since 1950 the lamerdinegar
model as shown in fig 1b has guided qualitative
understanding of how monomer tends to progress during the
nucleation and growth of colloidal ncs 24
in this letter we develop a framework to characterize
supersaturation throughout the synthesis of colloidal ncs
enabling theoretical modeling of and mechanistic insight
into their growth the methodology uses inputs from facile

realtime optical techniques to determine timeresolved
supersaturation profiles to show this we synthesize
colloidal au nanocubes use the framework to characterize
supersaturation throughout growth predict their growth
profile and show how supersaturation mediates and can
modulate the features and shape evolutions of ncs during
growth
to develop the framework we first consider the mass
balance for monomer concentration in closed conditions at
time i  ci  ci 1  ciconv  cinc fig 1a for dti  0  the
supply and consumption concentrations of monomer can be
determined by ci     ri dti  where ri is the intensive form
of the molar rate of conversion from precursor to monomer
for ciconv  or intensive form of the molar rate of monomer
consumption due to nc growth for cinc  colloidal nc
syntheses typically involve precursorlimited reactions
which consume monomer as it is produced  ci  ci 1  0 
1325 hence conversion of precursor to monomer
coincides with colloidal nc growth and rconv t   rnc t

to determine rnc t   we consider the thermodynamic
influences on nanoscale crystallization the local saturation

described by the gibbsthomson equation

where uc is the molar volume of the monomer g is the

where nnc is the number of ncs undergoing growth n a is
avogadros number and vs is the volume of the synthesis
formulation thus the rate of monomer consumption
depends on bulk supersaturation and is modulated by the
gibbsthomson effect based on the distribution of nc size
to characterize supersaturation we use the observation
that colloidal ncs show sizedependent optical properties
such as light scattering extinction and fluorescence 132932 that is rather than directly quantify rconv t   which is
experimentally complex we can use facile realtime optical
techniques to determine rnc t

rearranging eq 6 we find



as crystal formation coincides with monomer consumption
we use this equation to derive the intensive form of the molar
rate of monomer consumption

when syntheses directly introduce monomer or

on 2ucg rt  r  10 nm tends to lead to a small contribution
from the gibbsthomson effect and ncs grow at rates

according to these equations reactions with lowerorder
kinetics result in four optically observable profiles of bulk
monomer progression fig 2 which each resemble sections
of the lamerdinegar plot fig 1b

partially converted to monomer and d in which conversion

thus far we have assumed that ncs undergo layerbylayer lbl growth a classical mode of crystal growth
while ncs can grow nonclassically by attachment 3739
they predominantly grow by the classical modes lbl
normal n or dislocationdriven dd growth 202327284042 each classical growth mode can be
described by its relationship with supersaturation 26 that
is as we derived in the supplemental material note 2
growth kinetics can be linked directly to supersaturation a
thermodynamic parameter through a linear free energy
relationship lfer

where d describes the difference in chemical environments
between reaction series r represents the supersaturationindependent variables of growth mechanisms and e is the
relative supersaturation term defined as

15

with k0 and s 0 as the rate constant and supersaturation
respectively of a reference reaction thus by solely
modulating s in a reaction series 43 this lfer can
distinguish between modes via e or mechanisms based on
the same mode via r eg two facets grow lbl same

mode but monomer deposition is favored on one facet the
mechanism resulting in anisotropic growth
using our framework we investigated the growth of
colloidal au nanocubes to experimentally assess size and
shape evolutions we arrested growth at various times
methods and imaged the ncs using highangle annular
darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy
haadfstem fig 3a cuboctahedra evolved to
truncated cubes and then to cubes fig 3b as shown in
scanning electron sestem images fig 3c
overgrowth occurred on a proportion of cubes and other
shapes including tetrahedra also appeared during synthesis
we analyzed the yields of the nc shapes throughout growth
and found that after evolving from cuboctahedra the total
yield of ncs with cubic shape truncated cubes cubes and
overgrown cubes remained consistent 929 923 921 and
930 at 20 40 70 and 15 min table s1 suggesting that
overgrowth occurred on alreadyformed cubic ncs rather
than during the transition from cuboctahedra to cubes
based on growth kinetics measured via extinction fig
3d progression of the full extinction spectra is shown in
fig s1 we used eqs 10 and 13 to characterize the timeresolve supersaturation profile in the colloidal system fig
3e equation parameters shown in table s2 using this
supersaturation profile we modeled colloidal nanocube
growth using eq 4 notably the theoretical growth profile
predicted the experimental one fig 3f supporting that
supersaturation dynamics were properly interpreted for these
ncs we also characterized supersaturation by imaging the
color development during growth finding agreement
between imaging and spectrophotometry and further
showing utility of this methodology fig s3 furthermore
we compared the shape yields throughout growth to the
supersaturation profile which indicated that overgrowth was
associated with supersaturation fig 3e more
specifically overgrowth occurred predominantly when
supersaturation was high in the early stages of synthesis
based on these cumulative insights we rationalized that
reducing growth kinetics in the early stages of synthesis
would mitigate cube overgrowth as informed by eqs 14
and 15 we decreased supersaturation to reduce growth
rate the synthesis formulation for the ncs shown in fig 3
used 01 molar equivalents eqv relative to au added of
naoh supersaturation was modulated by replacing naoh
with hcl as h and cl are chemically endogenous to the
synthesis formulation are labile ions and should decrease the
bulk monomer concentration fig s4 44
figure 4ac shows the products of these syntheses with
largerarea micrographs shown in fig s5 we characterized
the growth kinetics of these formulation via extinction fig
s6 which indicated that these additions of hcl reduced
supersaturation particularly in the early stages of synthesis
fig 4d this indeed diminished the proportion of
overgrown nanocubes fig 4e shape yields summarized in
table s3 for 01 eqv naoh 171 of the ncs were
overgrown nanocubes for 1 eqv hcl and 2 eqv hcl the
yield of overgrown nanocubes diminished to 75 and 40
respectively concomitantly increasing the amounts of hcl
led to the emergence of tetrahedra fig 4e

the colors in c f experimental and theoretical growth for colloidal nanocubes theoretical growth was modelled using the
supersaturation profile from e dots and bars represent mean and sd
the sharpness of nanocube corners decreased as
increasing amounts of hcl were added fig 4d which
was likely due to the changes in supersaturation 45 with
more hcl the yield of truncated cubes increased while the
yield of cubes decreased fig 4e for 01 eqv naoh
326 of the ncs were truncated nanocubes this proportion
increased to 567 for 1 eqv hcl and then 679 for 2 eqv
hcl
we sized the nanocubes to further evaluate the influence
of the supersaturation profile on their structural features the
nanocubes had similar overall sizes across the three synthesis
formulations table s4 and we measured a sharpness index
for each nc s as described in fig 4f figure s7 shows
measurements by sharpness index which was normalized by
nc size for 01 eqv naoh the mean estimate of s was 163
95 confidence interval ci 159166 nm whereas it
was 153 150156 nm for 1 eqv hcl and 133 129137
nm for 2 eqv hcl these values were equivalent to 689
676702 d111 for 01 eqv naoh 651 638664 d111 for
1 eqv hcl and 563 546580 d111 for 2 eqv hcl where
d111 denotes 111 interplanar distances the corners of facecentered cubic nanocubes point in the 111 direction 42
thus slight modifications in the supersaturation profile
modulated nanocube corners with atomic precision

in summary we developed a thermodynamic framework
and the accompanying methodology to characterize
supersaturation throughout nc synthesis remarkably these
quantitative profiles resemble the qualitative ones originally
conceptualized by lamer and dinegar in 1950 24 based
on these profiles nc growth can be modeled and predicted
theoretically and complex size and shape evolutions can be
associated with supersaturation dynamics these insights
potentiate the rational design of colloidal ncs including
with atomic precision
since ncs generally interact with light as a sizedependent
property our approaches can be employed to broadly study
supersaturation during nc formation the framework also
presents additional opportunities not experimentally
explored here characterizing monomer concentrations
during nucleation may uncover critical nucleation
concentrations fig 2a the lfer in eqs 14 and 15
links nc kinetics with bulk thermodynamics presenting a
way to systematically study the mechanisms and modes of
nc growth moreover the relevance of these findings also
extends beyond nanoscience materials science and physical
chemistry as better understanding the phenomena that direct
nanoscale crystal formation may facilitate the development
of key technologies in a broad range of fields from medicine
to energy

the growth of colloidal ncs was arrested via ligand

samples were left at room temperature overnight to allow
the colloidal ncs to settle in the vial after this most of the

were placed under reduced pressure until the liquid had
evaporated 2 h next 1 ml toluene was added to each
sample followed by sonication to resuspend the ncs
samples were then twice centrifuged at 21000xg for 25 min
the first and second resuspensions were with 10 and 01 ml
of toluene respectively

nc sizing and counting
for sizing two representative largearea haadfstem
images were analyzed using imagej version 151s national
institutes of health usa yielding n  40 ncs for each time
point each nc that could be clearly delineated in its
haadfstem image was sized for cubes four
measurements were taken for each nc two cornertocorner
c and two edgetoedge e measurements fig s3a for
cuboctahedra three sidetoside d measurements were
taken fig s3b the data were presented as mean for each
time point

to characterize the shape yields at each time point each
nc was assessed for its shape in four representative largearea haadfstem images for a perfect nanocube c 
e2 based on the parameters described in fig s3 where c
 maxc1c2 and e  mine1e2 to delineate truncated
cubes from cubes 1 we applied a factor threshold of 13
that is truncated cubes c  13e were below this threshold
whereas cubes c  13e were equal to or above it the
count for each shape was summed from these images and
yields were presented as percentages of the overall number
of ncs counted

ii linear free energy
relationship
we formulated a linear free energy relationship lfer to
delineate the modes as well as mechanisms of classical
crystal growth based on the relationship between
supersaturation and growth kinetics this supplementary
note summarizes the three modes of classical crystal growth
in the diffusion regime based on their descriptions in 3
and describes the formulation of a lfer that
comprehensively describe classical crystal growth
normal growth
normal n growth occurs above the roughening
temperature of a metal above this threshold entropy effects
cause crystal surfaces to be atomically rough presenting an
abundance of kink sites in which monomer can directly
incorporate hence the rate of normal growth depends on the
probability of finding a kink and the monomer flux and in
solution can be described by
r   v c  c

where v is the molar volume of a au atom in the crystal c
is the monomer concentration and  is the kinetic
coefficient for normal crystallization in solution that in the
case of lower supersaturations is approximated by

k t

s2

in which a is the lattice parameter  is the vibrational
frequency of an adatom a  represents the geometric
probability that a monomer finds a kink site on the crystal
surface from solution u is the kinetic barrier for the
incorporation of monomer into a kink site and k t is the
thermodynamic temperature as seen in eq s1 when
supersaturation is small   c  c  it forms a linear
relationship with the rate of n growth

crystal surface in these modes steps are oriented parallel to
the crystal facet and spread laterally as monomer
incorporates that is growth occurs as steps fill laminarly
hence the growth rate is based on the rate of step advance v
and the density of steps p

dislocations generate steps on a crystal surface into which
monomer incorporates screw dislocations the predominant
dislocation driving dd growth present perpetuating steps
with height equal to their burgers vector monomer
advances the step forming a secondary step normal to it but
still along the crystal facet above the critical edge length for
twodimensional nucleation monomer incorporates into the
secondary step advancing it and leading to the formation of
a tertiary step when it reaches the critical edge length this
process leads to the characteristic spiral growth profile and

nuclei on crystal surfaces to present steps for growth the
mononuclear lbl growth rate is described by

formulation of the linear free energy relationship
lfers are semiempirical equations that relate
logarithmic forms of the thermodynamics and kinetics of
reaction series 4 supersaturation a thermodynamic
parameter modulates the rate of crystal growth a kinetic
quantity and we hypothesized that classical crystal growth
could be comprehensively described by a lfer to
formulate it we first considered the forms of their growth
equations as we derived above at low supersaturations r
has a linear relationship with  that is r    where 
represents the supersaturationindependent terms for dd
growth r has a parabolic relationship with  r 
    whereas r has a linear relationship with 
r    as described in 5 r  and hence r0 
has an exponential relationship with supersaturation within
the range typical for nc growth r   e3 
to expand this framework we consider the difference
between crystal growth reactions one reference reaction and
one or more other reactions with the supersaturation
modified after taking the logarithm of the difference in this
reaction series we formulate and postulate our lfer
logkk   
s13
where  describes the difference in chemical environments
between reaction series  represents the supersaturationindependent parameters that can delineate growth
mechanisms and  is the relative supersaturation term
described by

a

dd and n

s14

with k and  as the rate constant and supersaturation of
crystal growth reaction respectively and k and  as the
parameters from the reference reaction note that both
limiting cases of dd growth result in   log    based
on the application of the logarithm and these two cases can
be differentiated based on  for mathematical consistency
we typically take  to be negative
according to eqs s13 and s14 by solely modulating
supersaturation the modes of classical crystal growth can be
distinguished by  while mechanisms can be additionally
differentiated by  moreover the n and dd modes of
growth can be distinguished based on the local temperature
relative to the roughening temperature 3 as nanoscale
crystal growth often occurs via classical modes the lfer
becomes a powerful tool to investigate how ncs grow in
addition to how macroscopic crystals grow as this study
develops a method to characterize the timeresolved profile
of supersaturation throughout colloidal nc growth the
lfer can also be applied to colloidal systems moreover as
shown in fig 1a the general reaction pathways of colloidal
nc growth appear similar suggesting that supersaturation
modulation paired with our lfer can be applied to study
how many different types of ncs grow

iii kinetics of nanocrystal
growth via nanoplasmonic
extinction and color
we characterized the growth kinetics of the colloidal au
nanocubes via their extinction or colorimetric profiles as
the nc growth had an initial induction period we used eq
10 and the kinetics based on extinction were analyzed by
 yield au 4 

e4  mine

maxe  mine

s15

where e4 represents the peak extinction at time i and
max e and min e represent the maximum and minimum
peak extinction throughout growth the extinction spectra
were collected using the inline spectrometer methods and
the peak extinction refers to the highest extinction value at
the peak wavelength between 500600 nm the full spectra
along time are shown in fig s2
as the nanoplasmonic color of the colloidal ncs was red
fig s4 we used the g value after redgreenblue rgb
analysis using imagej version 151s national institutes of
health usa to characterize growth kinetics via color to
normalize the intrinsic variation among images in white
balance we used g4  g  g  where g4 represents
the normalized g value g represents the g value from
the colloidal nc solution and g represents the g value

from the background for the ith image the kinetics of
colloidal nc growth were then analyzed by
 yield au 4

where max g  and min g  represent the maximum and
minimum normalized g values for the array of images
respectively the color images were collected as described
in the methods

iv theoretical modeling of
nanocrystal growth
we used the thermodynamic framework developed in this
study to model the theoretical growth of the colloidal ncs
the timeresolved supersaturation profile for a sample was
estimated using eq 13 with the equation parameters
summarized in table s2 eq 6 was then used to model the
growth of the colloidal nanocrystals since the molar ratio of
nabr and haucl4 was low in the growth formulation c
was estimated based on the equilibrium concentration of
aucl2 5 we approximated n56 assuming spherical
nanoseeds with a size of 25 nm after the initial nucleation
step in nanoseed synthesis after the secondary growth step
in nanoseed synthesis methods the size of the nanoseeds
d4  which was the initial size of the colloidal ncs in
nanocube growth was taken to be 4 nm
