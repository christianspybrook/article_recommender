introduction

from a classical perspective all dynamical variables commute but in quantum mechanics the uncertainty relations are fundamental the seminal work of epr 1 reports
that if two systems are correlated and the physical quantities pertaining to one system
are determined then uncertainty in their prediction for the second system is zero the
compatibility between any two observables  and b is usually understood in terms of the
robertson relation 2

where the dispersion in the measurement reduces for small lower bounds on the other
hand observables over a bipartite quantum state were analysed for uncertainty in their
measurement by evaluating the upper bound in terms of entropies3 and it was observed
that uncertainty in the predictions is reduced if both parties are maximally entangled and
they strongly agree on the measurement thus a measure of uncertainty in the prediction can be obtained by a measure of the entanglement between the systems quantum
entanglement and uncertainty relations are therefore strongly related and have wide applications in quantum information and computing 4 5 and so on an effort to study
the effect of quantum correlation on the uncertainty was made in ref6 which presented
a generalized uncertainty principle gup for bipartite and tripartite entangled states
it was observed that the lower bound in gup deviates from the heisenberg uncertainty
principle hup and leads to a reduced uncertainty for quantum correlated particles it
is interesting to explore these issues in the framework of constrained quantum theory
the hamiltonian formulation of systems in the presence of first and second class constraints has been reported in literature extensively since the inception of the idea 7
ref8 presents a similar study for the dynamics of a single particle constrained on a circle the hamiltonian formulation is obtained from lagrangian mechanics as pi  l i 
expressing the velocities this way makes the hamiltonian to be independent of i and the
hessian of lagrangian is given by

the equality holds for the case of degenerate lagrangian where the constrained dynamics
of the system can not be obtained in usual way by evaluating the poisson brackets but
by hamiltons equations that contain dirac brackets 78

refs 911 deal with the problem of assigning geometric meanings to the hamiltonian
dynamics or designing of a proper quantum framework for the dynamics of particle on
curved spaces diracs approach for handling these problems is presented in 11 where the
dynamics in the presence of second class constraints is described by defining a symplectic
structure a similar study in this direction was made in 12 for the dirac quantization of
particle constrained on a helicoid and in 13 for quantizing the dynamics of a free particle
on a ddimensional sphere a different approach to dualize quantum with geometry in
the pilotwave limit is presented in 1416 and with topological properties in 17 dirac
quantization on curved spaces adds some additional terms in the schrdinger equation
that can be linked with the curvature of the space or distortion in the energy spectrum it
will be interesting to discuss such energy terms for two maximally entangled subsystems
in connection with the particles constrained on curved spaces 18
the purpose of this paper is to study a bipartite quantum system in which the degrees
of freedom of the system are reduced by constraining them on s 1  for this we consider
an inseparable spatial wavefunction like the one considered in ref16

taking such a two particle composite state we will analyse the compatibility between

in connection with the quantization on curved manifolds 18
the paper is organized as sectionii deals with studying the classical dynamics of
two particles constrained on s 1  in sectioniii we present dirac quantization of the
classical dynamics assuming the two particles as two maximally entangled subsystems and
comment on the uncertainty between observables in sectioniv we establish hermitian

constrained classical dynamics of two particles on s 1

we consider a two particle lagrangian in scalar and vector potential given by

 is the vector potential e and m are the charge and mass
where v is the scalar potential a
of the particle respectively and k represents the particle velocity k  1 2 is the particle
index and k2  12  22  21  12  22  22  we assume these particles to be under the effect
 directed along the normal to the plane containing
of a uniform external magnetic field b
them and as a result these particles retain their motion on s 1 ie gx y  x2k  yk2  rk2 
applying the constraint gx y  0 on the system the resulting lagrangian is

the hamiltonian in eq7 is not independent of velocities and therefore it is not
possible to implement the standard approach to obtain equations of motion therefore
we need to use diracs method for singular lagrangians 7 according to this one must
generalize the hamiltonian to incorporate the constraints this generalized hamiltonian
is obtained by multiplying the primary constraint with an arbitrary function of time say
u1  and adding the resulting term in hamiltonian eq7

as it is derived directly from the lagrangian we will denote it by 1  p 
if a constraint is initially zero it must be zero for all times this consistency condition
   h  0 yields a set of equations7 if the resulting equation contains only x or p 
it is treated as another constraint the consistency condition on 1 yields an equation of
the following form

this equation will serve as the secondary constraint where rk2  r12  r22  2a2  the
particles are moving on the same circle so r1  r2  a and since 2  0 it must be zero
during its evolution in time which leads to

this equation is of the form r p  0 and it will lead to another such consistency
condition so we continue to evaluate these equations until another type of equation like

using diracs approach we arrive at following brackets describing the classical dynam

ics of two constrained particles

where k  1 2 the results of these classical brackets are different from those of
standard canonical brackets in that the information on the constrained dynamics of the
particles is apparent one can see instead of the usual translation along xaxis by p in
eq15 the motion of particle 1 is shifted by an amount

x21
rk2

towards yaxis then eq16

shifts the motion slightly towards xaxis this series of shifts renders a circular trajectory
the same is true for particle 2 the dirac brackets for the coordinates of one particle and
momenta of the other particle are given by

xj  pxk d 

xj xk

yj  pyk d

2a2

19

where j  k  1 2 and j 6 k also note that all the brackets in eqs1719
vanish in classical mechanics since momentum is not a generator of translations along a
direction perpendicular to the particle position but in diracs formalism the brackets
x py   y px  6 0 which is due to the constraint which forces the particle to remain on
s 1  the dirac brackets detailing translations in p space are the following
6

xj  xk d  yj  yk d  xk  yk d  xj  yk d  0

20

since x and y generate translations in momentum space the brackets in eq20 are
equivalent to the corresponding poisson brackets this is because there is no such m
whose time evolution results in an equation containing only p  there is thus no constraint
imposed on the particles momentum this is why these results are just analogous to
those obtained for a classical hamiltonian with no constraint on the particle dynamics
the dirac brackets for momenta of both the particles are

where j  k  1 2 and j 6 k eqs 2124 clearly reflect the rotational dynamics
of particle due to explicit presence of lz or by writing momentum in terms of angular
momentum as discussed in the next section one can see when dealing with degenerate
lagrangian the poisson brackets are generalized to dirac brackets 7

iii

dirac quantization for two entangled subsystems

to quantize the classical dynamics discussed above the system with k  2 two particles is partitioned into two subsystems 1 and 2 containing i and j particles respectively
such that k  ij with ij1 ie each particle is treated as a subsystem the basis for
subsystem 1 are chosen to be 1  2  corresponding to the hilbert space h1 and 1  2 
for the subsystem 2 corresponding to the hilbert space h2  the composite space for the
bipartite quantum state is a tensor product

h  h1  h2
7

25

a pure state with respect to this partitioning can be defined as

x1  x2   1 x1 1 x2   1 x1 2 x2   2 x2 1 x1   2 x1 2 x2 

26

one can consider the concurrence as a measure of the entanglement of a pure bipartite
quantum state21 which should be equal to unity for a maximally entangled state and
is defined as c  2     
we choose     0 and the pure bipartite state is maximally entangled with equal
probability of collapse upon measurement to one of the product state 1 x1 1 x2  or
2 x1 2 x2  ie 2  2  1 1920 the quantum state of two entangled particles
on a circle of radius a is chosen to be

1  2   ei1 2 ei1 2  
where  



27

2a2 and k gives the angular position of the particles the classical

to quantum transition of the system of two entangled particles is achieved by using the
dirac quantization rule

  where   1 the following commutation rela

where j  k  1 2 and j 6 k the quantum commutation relations in eqs2833
are obtained for the quantum state in eq27 from ref6 we note that for a system
of entangled particles the uncertainty relation between the operators x and p diverges
from the standard hup in a way that the precision of simultaneous measurement of x and
p is increased further note that eqs2832 illustrate a reduced uncertainty between
position and momentum in comparison to the results of 8 as expected for maximally
entangled subsystems described in 36
as an example one can see that the lower bound evaluated for eq28 using robertson
relation for the parameters values a2  10 with a2  x21 y12 and the choice x1  1 y1  3
gives

x1 2 px1 2  005

34

the product of dispersion reduces in comparison to 8 where x2 px 2  02025
calculated for the same a similarly one can see the lower bounds in the set eqs2832 reduces in comparison to 8
this uncertainty is inversely related to k the number of particles such that in a system
with several particles k   the standard deviation in the measurement of observables
is significantly reduced in this case the uncertainty in the prediction of observables in
the set eqs2832 can approach zero and in this limit these commutators tend to the
poisson brackets of classical mechanics
the commutation relation between momentum of each particles is obtained via dirac
quantizing the classical bracket in eq21 which yields

we get

37

the numerical bounds in eqs3637 are computed in view of the single particle case
px 2 py 2  00225 evaluated for the same a clearly one can see that the lower
bound between the momenta of each particle is reduced if 1 the position of the second
particle is known and 2 the external field is properly tuned in order to keep the state
maximally entangled between particle 1 and particle 2 we arrive at these results using
  2aa  032 tesla the correlation is not
a uniform magnetic field of strength b
 upper  103 tesla and thus the state 1  2 
affected by this field for strengths up to b
 b
 upper  one can see theres no reduction in the
remains inseperable however for b
  1126 tesla there is no reduction in uncertainty
uncertainty for particle 2 and at b
for both particles we may denote this field strength as the cutoff and represent this
 cutoff  1126 tesla this is because the interaction between the particles and the
as b
field destroys the correlation between both subsystems above this cutoff which results
in the loss of entanglement and the usual uncertainty relation for momentum is restored
 b
 cutoff  there exists a direct relationship between uncertainty of the
8 hence for b
composite system and the external field
 upper of a constrained bipartite entangled system for any k  2 with
we can obtain b
parameters x2  y2  via equations of the following form
x2  n2  y2  n2  r 2

38

where x2  31 y2  065 and n  0 1 2 3  the vector potential that gives
 upper can be obtained as
b
aupper  a0  p122

39

with a0  163 p  k  2 where k is the number of particles one can see that
inserting any value of k in eq39 yields the value of aupper  also from eqs3839
aupper can be obtained for any k and any x2  n y2  n with n  0 1 2 3  and
x2  31 and y2  065 we have used the coordinates of subsystem 2 this is because at
 upper  entanglement reduces due to the interaction between particles and the field and
b
no reduction in the dispersion of observables is possible for subsystem 2 however for
subsystem 1 the lower bound of robertson relation still reduces similarly for equations
of the following form
x1  n2  y1  n2  r 2
10

40

 cutoff  can be written as
where x1  2 and y1  245 the vector potential that leads to b
acutoff  0  p67

41

where 0  178 and we have used the coordinates of subsystem 1 because at the cutoff
value the entanglement dies and no reduction in the dispersion is possible for subsystem
1 eq41 gives the cutoff value of the external magnetic field such that for a  acutoff 
the two subsystems are unentangled and the lower bound of robertson relation increases
 above the cutoff we arrive at eq39 and eq41 by inspection ie
with increasing b
by varying the value of vector potential a and computing the lower bounds in eqs3637 proceeding this way we can obtain the value of acutof f and aupper at which no
reduction in the lower bound is obtained for eq36 and eq37 in view of the single
particle case respectively however the choice of subsystem 1 and 2 is arbitrary and one
only needs to consider the initial values x1  y1 x2  y2  to obtain upper bound and cutoff
 for any k from eq39 and eq41 respectively
value of b

to comment on the lower bounds in eqs4548 one needs to consider the same set
of equations for the case of three entangled particles constrained on s 1  we assume
these three particles live in three subsystems with basis 1  2  1  2  and 1  2
corresponding to the hilbert space h1  h2 and h3 respectively such that the composite
state is a member of h where

with x1  2 x2  31x3  26 y1  245 y2  065 y3  18 charge e  1 and a  050
the upper bound and cutoff value of the external field for k  3 can be obtained from
eq35 the lower bound of subsystem 1 is computed via the following equation
px1 2 py1 2 

2  e2 3  eax1  y1 2
2k2 a4

56

and for subsystem 2 by the following equation
px2 2 py2 2 

2  e1 3  eax2  y2 2
2k2 a4
12

57

we observe that the lower bound for eq56 and eq57 is the same as obtained for the
single particle case at acutof f  245 and aupper  285 respectively continuing this way
one can see that the computed values of aupper and acutof f for a bipartite system with
k  2 can be inserted into a relation of the form given in eq39 and eq41 it is easy
to see that the lower bound is reduced by increasing the number of maximally entangled
particles if the external field is appropriately tuned as discussed above also it is observed
 is increased ie b
 upper  180 tesla and thus the
that for k  3 the upper bound on b
system is more robust against changes in the external field the generalization to k  3
for eq35 and eqs4244 is nontrivial in contrast to the eqs2832 because for k
particles one needs to split the global system into two blocks and the subsystems within
these blocks may also be entangled with each other one therefore needs to consider all
possible bipartitions to quantify entanglement of kpartite system23

iv

hermiticity of momentum operators

even though the classical brackets are generalized to quantum commutation relations
using dirac quantization one must note that the operator ordering problem arises in
eq35 and in eqs4244 also the operators appearing in these commutators must
be hermitian so following 8 we try to fix the operator ordering problem by requiring
the operators to be hermitian the zcomponent of angular momentum is

note that the energy expression cant be split into e1  e2 because hamiltonian is an
observable of the quantum state eq 27 in the hilbert space h1  h2 and it is not
possible to split the two particles the equation involves the position of both entangled
particles if 1 changes 2 also changes due to the correlation between them such that

the total momentum and total energy of the system remains conserved also one can see

the energy equation 78 involves an additional term e   this additional term e  arises
due to the dirac quantization and hermiticity of the momentum operator however
in comparison with 8 the additional energy term is not a constant and both energies
are connected since the particle positions are also involved in the additional energy term
implying that any change in particle positions simultaneously effect both the energy terms
since e  is not a constant the term represents a shift in energy levels due to the applied
magnetic field in view of similar terms arising in quantization on curved manifolds 18
also note that the term

different from the one obtained for the hamiltonian in 80 this is due to the requirement
that p must be hermitian and the expression for momenta involves orbitorbit interaction
between the two particles and their projection along zaxis is given by

the interaction between the momenta of two particles results in a total orbital angular
momentum vector about zaxis at an angle with the direction of the external field for
which the projection along zaxis is the scalar sum as given in the following equation

hence the total energy of the system experiences a shift due to dirac quantization and
orbitorbit coupling between both particles

summary

in this paper we present a measure of uncertainty for a maximally entangled constrained bipartite system by calculating the lower bounds using robertson relation and
16

discussed the presence of additional energy terms for this system in connection to terms
arising during quantization on curved spaces 18 in view of the work reported in 6 we
emphasize that the quantum correlations also effect the lower bound when particles are

constrained on s 1 under the influence of an external field b
we started with a classical system of two particles constrained on s 1 under the in we used diracs method for handling degenerate
fluence of a uniform external field b
lagrangians and a set of dirac brackets between canonical variables was obtained for
this system later we quantized this constrained classical system via diracs canonical
quantization rule for this constrained quantum system we presented a measure of uncertainty between observables by calculating the lower bounds using robertson relation
for this we partitioned the system into two subsystems with k  2 and chose an inseparable entangled state over a composite space h1  h2 with concurrence c  1 ie a
maximally entangled state on account of 8 we showed that when observables p and
x act on a maximally entangled pure bipartite state the uncertainty between the two
is reduced the reduction in uncertainty is also observed between different p and the
commutation relations in eq4244 are analysed for a ghz state
we show that the uncertainty is not only effected by the number of particles k but
 and we explicitly give an expression for
also by the strength of the external field b
 upper and a
 cutoff that quantifies the measure of uncertainty as a function of the external
a
 we show that for k  2 b
 upper  103 tesla and for b
 b
 upper no
magnetic field b
  b
 cutoff  the
reduction in uncertainty is possible for atleast one subsystem and for b
bipartite entanglement is lost and there exists a direct relationship between uncertainty
 it is therefore possible to appropriately tune the external field
and the external field b
 to preserve or destroy the correlation entanglement between the two subsystems
b
increasing k also reduces uncertainty between the observables by 1k times in eqs2832 as in 6 but its generalization for k  3 to the brackets containing different p
eqs4244 is nontrivial due to the partition of kpartite system into two blocks for
which the number of bipartition measures increases with k 23
we also addressed the operator ordering problem arising due to the canonical quantization via weyl ordering prescription and by requiring the hermitian expressions for
operators finally we comment that the schrdinger equation for a pure bipartite entangled state contains additional energy terms arising due to the hermiticity of p that
contains orbitorbit interaction between the particles this additional term e  is con

17

nected with e due to eq27 and in view of 18 it represents a shift in the energy
levels any changes made in particle position is reflected in the simultaneous change in
both e and e
