abstract
using the renormalization group approach we consider the on om  model in four and more dimensions
we find that independently on n and m  for n  m  2 a transition can be of both the first and second
order in d  4 we also cannot exclude a pseudofirstorder behavior as specific physically interesting
cases we consider the lattice version of the o2  o2 o3  o2 and o3  o3 sigma models on a
four dimensional hypercubic lattice in all these cases we find a distinct firstorder transition
keywords phase transitions renormalization group lattice theory monte carlo simulations
topological defects

the distinction between firstorder and continuous
phase transitions is obvious and consists in the presence or absence of a jump in an order parameter
p  gh and the internal energy the phenomenological landau theory formulates conditions based on
group theoretical properties of an order parameter
when a transition can be continuous 1 2 the most
famous condition is that the symmetric part of the
cubic term of an order parameter should not contain
the unit representation of the full symmetry group g
however accounting for critical fluctuations usually
based on the renormalization group rg approach
makes these conditions necessary but not sufficient
in particular in three dimensions d  3 and generally in 2  d  4 a continuous transition corresponds to an attractive stable fixed point of rg
equations but such a point may be absent in this
case one commonly says about a fluctuationinduced
firstorder transition at first time 3 see also 4
it has been observed in the abelian higgs model 5

in four dimensions the fluctuational theory of
phase transitions predicts that a continuous transition is described by the gaussian fixed point with
distinctive critical exponents independent on group
theoretical properties of an order parameter these
exponents are perturbed by logarithmical corrections
arising in the upper critical dimension d  4 below four dimensions a critical point of a continuous
transition may correspond to a nontrivial not free
conformal field theory 6 but in d  4 the theory of
critical phenomena at least without supersymmetry
predicts only free theories there are rigorous proofs
of the triviality of the 4 theory for d  4 7 8 9
while for d  4 such a proof is not exist and the role
of perturbative logarithmic corrections is discussed
see eg 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
recently 17 using the specific nonperturbative
rg approach socalled higherorder tensor rg it
has been found the weak firstorder transition in the
fourdimensional ising model the hidden heat of the
transition is so small that it is necessary to consider
huge size lattices up to 10244  to discover it this
makes it very difficult to check the result with other
may 4 2021

methods for example with monte carlo simulations
offhand one can propose two ways to explain this
result the first way is that a transition is of pseudofirst order ie the sings of a firstorder transition
eg a jump in the internal energy are observed only
on finitesize lattices and disappear in the thermodynamic limit in terms of rg the pseudofirst order
behavior corresponds to the situation when a rgtrajectory starting in the stability region where the
potential is stable passes through the region boundary but tends to the fixed point locating inside the
region or on the boundary to stabilize the potential one should add next terms resolved by symmetry in the order parameter expansion like 6  it is
these terms in accordance with the landau theory
that correspond to the appearance of the observed
jump in the internal energy on finitesize lattices but
actually such a situation cannot be realized in the
fourdimensional on  model or other models with
unique 4 term where the boundary of the stability
region is a single point namely the gaussian fixed
point
if the transition is indeed of the first order then
one can expect the presence of any nonperturbative
effects remind it is believed that perturbative corrections keep the theory trivial the most obvious
nonperturbative aspect of the ising model is that
fluctuations are topological defects domain walls
of cause the presence of topological defects in itself does not guarantee the appearance of new effects
in the critical behavior eg monopolelike defects
in the threedimensional o3 model are not relevant 18 19 and in general the 3d on  model
is successfully described by perturbative approaches
although it can contains topological defects of any
types nevertheless topological defects may affect
the critical behavior and to test such a possibility
it is useful to consider at least two cases a system
with the order parameter space gh  z2  m
where m is a connected homogeneous space and a
system with topological defects of another type affecting the critical behavior both cases are present
in the on   om  model
the order parameter space in this model is a stiefel
manifold vnm  on on  m  corresponding to
a set of orientations of m n dimensional vectors in

the particular case m  n  the order parameter contains the discrete part equivalent to the parameter of
the ising model gh  on   z2  son  so one
should expect that a transition is of the first order
another interesting feature of this model is that in
the cases n  m and n  m  1 the fundamental group is nontrivial 1 vnm   z2 for m  1
and socalled z2 vortices are present remind that
usual vortices play a crucial role in the critical behavior of systems from the universality class of the o2
model in this case perturbative fluctuations can be
linearized by the berezinskii  villain transformation 20 21 22 and integrated out so the resulting
system has a transition from the same universality
class of course this is due to the fact that so2 is
abelian
the influence of nonabelian z2 vortices on the
thermal and critical behavior is observable in all dimensions 2  d  4 thus in two dimensions these
defects lead to a rather sharp change in the behavior
of the v32 model from lowtemperature describing
by the o4 sigma model to some hightemperature
23 24 25 26 in the v33 model vortices changes
an isinglike transition to a firstorder one 27 28
in 2   dimensions a transition of the v32 model
belongs to the class universality of the o4 model
29 30 31 but close to   1 a transition becomes
of the first order 32 in three dimensions the vnn
model has a distinct firstorder transition but the
situation for the v32 model is still controversial so
the 4   33 34 35 36 1n 37 38 expansions
and the nonperturbative rg 39 40 41 42 43 44
predict the first order while the perturbative fixeddimensional rg 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 and the
conformal bootstrap 52 53 54 declare a secondorder transition
monte carlo simulations for threedimensional
models from the universality class of the v32 model
also give controversial results a firstorder transition in a heisenberg antiferromagnet on a stackedtriangular lattice 55 and helimagnets 56 see however the recent work 57 nevertheless direct simulations of the lattice version of the on   om 
sigma model predict a distinct firstorder transition
for the v22 58 59 v32 60 and v33 61 62 cases
these results are not a defect of the model for
