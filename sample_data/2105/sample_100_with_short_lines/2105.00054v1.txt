introduction

under expected utility eu there exist various intimately related measures to evaluate the
degree of risk aversion of a decisionmaker dm these measures include the risk premium
the probability premium and the local index of absolute risk aversion originally developed
independently by pratt 28 and arrow 2 3 a little more than 50 years ago1 since then they
have played highly versatile and important roles in the theoretical and experimental analysis
of risky choices under eu and have seen widespread applications across many fields
among these measures and despite its appealing nature the probability premium has for
a long time been by far the least popular only in recent years it starts receiving increased
attention jindapon 17 liu and meyer 18 eeckhoudt and laeven 10 and liu and neilson
20 the probability premium which contrary to the risk premium has been developed only
for a binary symmetric zeromean risk may be given a simple interpretation it answers the
question of by how much the probability of the adverse payoff in a binary zeromean risk needs to
be reducedand the probability of the prosperous payoff needs to be increased accordingly
to make the dm indifferent between bearing and not bearing the risk
in this paper we start by generalizing pratts 28 definition of the probability premium
such that it becomes applicable also to meanpreserving risk changes with probability mass less
than unity while maintaining its simple interpretation2 next we employ this general definition
of the probability premium to introduce a new concept of attitude towards probability we say
that a dm displays attitude towards probability of order 1 and order 2 if for risk changes with
small probability mass the associated probability premium is linear in the probability mass
and proportional to the square of the probability mass respectively these orders of attitude
towards probability can be seen to represent the probability counterparts of the wellknown
orders of attitude towards risk introduced by segal and spivak 37
we show that whether attitude towards probability is a first or secondorder phenomenon
has important economic applications we illustrate in particular the implications of firstand secondorder probability aversion in a problem of risk sharing we reveal that a firstorder
probability averse dm facing a risk with a small loss probability may opt for risk sharing among
individuals even when the other individuals loss probability is larger than the individuals own
loss probability by contrast a secondorder probability averse individual facing the same risk
engages only in actuarially fair risk sharing our results on risk sharing can be viewed as
dual to the wellknown mossins 25 theorem on the suboptimality of full insurance in the
presence of a positive safety loading in mossins theorem there is a tradeoff between the
degree of risk aversion and a positive safety loading in the payoff plane in our result there

allow for random starting wealth and to risk aversion of higher degrees

is a tradeoff between the degree of probability aversion and actuarially unfair loss probabilities
in the probability plane
measures of risk aversion have also received much attention outside eu in particular in
the dual theory dt yaari 42 and under rankdependent utility rdu quiggin 31 a rich
literature has proposed several measures of risk aversion and has established the associated
results on comparative risk aversion see yaari 41 42 chew karni and safra 5 roll 32
chateauneuf cohen and meilijson 4 ryan 35 and eeckhoudt and laeven 12 this does
however not apply to the probability premium which has almost never been considered in
noneu3 as a contribution of independent interest we provide a local approximation to the
probability premium under rdu and establish the corresponding global results as is wellknown rdu encompasses eu and dt as special cases and is the main building block of
cumulative prospect theory tversky and kahneman 384
we exploit our local approximation to the probability premium to show that rdu and eu
dms usually exhibit firstorder attitude towards probability whereas a dt dm with smooth
probability weighting function displays secondorder probability attitude our results apply to
quite general utility and probability weighting functions under rdu in particular we allow
for inverse sshaped probability weighting functions such as those in prelec 30 and wu and
gonzalez 43 which are relevant for descriptive purposes abdellaoui 1 that is we allow
for violations of eg global risk aversion
our paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide our generalized definition of the
probability premium in section 3 we introduce first and secondorder probability aversion
section 4 applies first and secondorder probability aversion to explore a risk sharing problem
in section 5 we develop our local approximation to the probability premium under rdu
analyze the degree of probability aversion under rdu and establish the corresponding global
results proofs are relegated to appendix a appendix b generalizes the definition of the
probability premium and our local approximation results to cover nonbinary risks

probability premium

we start by considering a risk c yielding outcomes 2 and 2 with probabilities p0 and 1  p0 

respectively as represented in figure 156

to our best knowledge the only exception is the note by eeckhoudt and laeven 10 providing graphical
illustrations

see schmidt and zank 36 for global measures of risk aversion under prospect theory

henceforth in all figures values alongside the arrows represent probabilities while values at the end of the
arrows represent outcomes

we assume 0  p0  1 and 2  0

we obtain d from c by moving a probability 1 from both states of c to a new intermediate
state with outcome 0 of course d is a meanpreserving contraction of c in the sense of
rothschild and stiglitz 34 and is thus viewed as an improvement by any strongly riskaverse dm8
we can adapt the probability of the occurrence of the unfavorable state in c from p0 to
p0   and adapt the probability of the occurrence of the favorable state in c from 1  p0 to

1  p0   accordingly such that the dm becomes indifferent between the resulting risk c
represented in figure 3 and the risk d of figure 2
7

we assume 0  1  minp0  1  p0 
conventionally risk aversion is often defined as a preference for a sure wealth level to a risky wealth position
with the same expectation this definition of risk aversion is sometimes referred to as weak risk aversion a
stronger definition of risk aversion consists in requiring a preference for meanpreserving contractions rothschild
and stiglitz 34 of payoff distributions also when the resulting payoff distribution is nondegenerate yet
another more elementary definition of risk aversion requires that preferences are payoff or outcome convex
yaari 40 under eu all three definitions agree but this is no longer the case in noneu see eg chew and
mao 6 cohen 7 nau 27 and machina 23 we will henceforth adopt the second definition of risk aversion
that draws upon rothschild and stiglitz 34

of course c0  c naturally the difference  between the initial probability of the

unfavorable state p0  and the adapted probability of the unfavorable state p0   represents
the probability premium corresponding to the risk change from c to d the probability

premium may be positive or negative depending on whether the dm is risk averse or risk
seeking
from the perspective of income inequality the transformation from c to d may be interpreted to reduce the proportion of rich and poor people and to increase the proportion of
middle class people the probability premium may then be interpreted as the increase in the
proportion of rich people and reduction of the proportion of poor people accordingly in c
that makes it equivalent to d
we note that  occurs as a natural generalization of pratts 28 probability premium to the
situation of risk changes with probability mass less than unity indeed this becomes readily
apparent upon omitting the common components of c and d yielding c  c  d
and d  c  d represented in figures 4 and 5 respectively

we show in section 54 that our definition of the probability premium satisfies

cases appendix b further generalizes the definition of the probability premium to apply to
nonbinary risks

first and secondorder probability aversion

employing the probability premium thus defined we state the following definition
definition 31 a dm is firstorder probability averse seeking at the point w0  p0  if

and is secondorder probability averse seeking at w0  p0  if

in other words we say that a dms attitude towards probability is of order 1 if his probability premium 1  is not of smaller order than 1  ie 1  is not o1  similarly a dms
attitude towards probability is of order 2 if his probability premium is of smaller order than 1
but not of smaller order than 21  ie 1  is o1  but not o21 
the strict signs of the partial derivatives in 31 and 32 determining whether attitude
towards probability is of order 1 or of order 2 have important economic applications see
section 4 where these concepts are applied to analyze risk sharing
we state the following theorem which is instrumental to our results that follow recall c
d and c defined in figures 13
theorem 32 let m  0 a secondorder probabilityaverse dm prefers cm1  to d for
sufficiently small 1  if m  0 is small enough a firstorder probabilityaverse dm prefers d
to cm1  for sufficiently small 1 
theorem 32 reveals that a firstorder probability averter facing risk c may reject to replace
it by the actuarially more favorable risk cm1  and opt for the meanpreserving contraction
d instead even when the probability mass associated with the contraction is very small
9

while the comparison between c and d is a comparison between two risks like in ross 33 machina and
schmeidler 26 and pratt 29 figures 4 and 5 show that it is essentially a prattarrowcomparison between
a risk and a fixed wealth level with the same probability mass which we now allow to be less than unity

6

the orders of probability aversion can be viewed as the probability equivalents of the
orders of risk aversion indeed in important work segal and spivak 37 introduce firstand secondorder risk aversion they consider the risk premium of pratt 28 and arrow
2 3 and analyze its limiting behavior for a zeromean risk with payoff tending to zero if
the risk premium behaves proportionally to the size of the squared payoff of the risk the
dm exhibits first secondorder risk aversion whether attitude towards risk is a first or
secondorder phenomenon is shown to have important implications for insurance coverage and
portfolio choice indeed a firstorder riskaverse dm may buy full insurance coverage even if
the insurance premium carries a positive safety loading contrary to a secondorder riskaverse
dm who only prefers actuarially fair full insurance coverage likewise under firstorder risk
aversion an investor may choose not to invest in a risky asset despite its mean being positive
contrary to under secondorder risk aversion
the two measures given by the risk premium andour generalization ofthe probability
premium both evaluate how to counteract the effect of a meanpreserving contraction that
is both measures capture the intensity of the aversion to meanpreserving spreads the orders
of probability aversion introduced in this paper describe how to counteract a meanpreserving
contraction marginally through the probability lens ie by a shift in probabilities while the
orders of risk aversion describe how a meanpreserving contraction can be offset marginally
by a change in outcome

risk sharing

this section presents an application of first and secondorder probability aversion to a simple
risk sharing problem it reveals that a firstorder probabilityaverse individual facing a risk
with a small loss probability may prefer to share his risk in a pool of individuals instead of
bearing the risk himself even when the other individuals loss probability is larger than the
probability of occurrence of the individuals own loss by contrast a secondorder probabilityaverse individual facing this risk only prefers to engage in actuarially fair risk sharing
this result may be viewed as a dual version of mossins 25 theorem10 indeed this
wellknown and seminal result entails that a secondorder riskaverse individual only prefers
actuarially fair full insurance and opts for a partial insurance contract if the insurance premium
carries a positive safety loading a firstorder riskaverse individual however may prefer full
insurance even in the presence of a small positive safety loading
in mossins theorem the tradeoff between risk aversion and a positive safety loading occurs
in the payoff plane in our result the tradeoff between probability aversion and actuarially
unfair loss probabilities occurs in the probability plane

we refer to segal and spivak 37 and machina 23 for an insightful exposition of mossins theorem as well

consider an individual who faces a risk a of losing   0 with probability 1  0

risk b can be interpreted as the result of a risk sharing contract between two individuals both
facing a mutually exclusive risk of losing  with probability 1  the two individuals form a
pool and share the possible loss with probability of occurrence 21 equally each bearing

because 1 is assumed to be small the same situation occurs up to the leading order in 1
when the risks of the two individuals are independent instead of mutually exclusive indeed
under independence equal risk sharing leads to an allotted risk

where n  2 indeed while b is a meanpreserving contraction of a b n is a meanpreserving

contraction of both a and b the preference of b n to a can be interpreted as a preference
for risk sharing among individuals facing risks with the same binary loss distribution ie
actuarially fair risk sharing
theorem 32 now implies that for sufficiently small m  0 a firstorder probabilityaverse
individual even prefers to replace the risk a represented in figure 9

which is more favorable when compared to a by the previous risk sharing contract yielding
b n  n  2 in figure 8 the preference of b n to a can be given the interpretation of a
preference for risk sharing among individuals even when other individuals losses are slightly
more likely to occur than the individuals own loss11
by contrast a secondorder probabilityaverse individual prefers a to b whenever m  0
in fact under secondorder probability aversion a is even preferred to b n as soon as m  0
that is when other individuals losses are more likely to occur than the individuals own loss
there is no longer a preference for risk sharing a secondorder probabilityaverse individual
will only engage in risk sharing when other individuals losses have at most the same probability
of occurrence as the individuals own loss12
11

indeed the probability of a loss in risk b n  which is n1  is larger than n times the probability of a loss in
risk a  which is 1  m 1  that is n1  n 1  m 1 
12
formally this follows from the fact that under secondorder probability aversion the probability premium
that achieves indifference between a and b n is of order o21  while the probability shift from a to a is
of order o1 

9

summarizing we have shown that under firstorder probability aversion a preference for risk
sharing exists even when other individuals losses have slightly larger probability of occurrence
under secondorder probability aversion there is merely a preference for actuarially fair risk
sharing

a graphical representation

we now provide a graphical representation of the risk sharing problem figure 10 displays
preferences over changes in probabilities and is an appropriate modification of a marschakmachina triangle 24 21 better suited for our purposes it can be viewed as the dual
counterpart of a classic hirshleiferyaari diagram 15 16 39 40 that displays preferences
over changes in outcomes

of course the point 0 p0  indicated by a in figure 10 represents the situation of no risk
sharing whereas the point 21  p0  1  indicated by b represents risk sharing13 the solid

chord ab in figure 10 represents an isoexpected value line it can be viewed as the dms
initial budget line when sharing risk
we also illustrate in figure 10 the indifference curves of a firstorder probability averter
dashed and a secondorder probability averter dasheddotted that touch the no risk sharing
point 0 p0  such an indifference curve describes the set of points q p that make the dm
equally well off as the no risk sharing situation
to determine these indifference curves without imposing additional assumptions on the
preference functional we proceed as follows exploiting geometric selfsimilarity14 for given
p0  1 and arbitrary q with 0  q  21  we find p  with 0  p  p  p0   1  such
that

the exposition and analysis have so far focused on the situation in which p0  1  hence p0 is small just
like 1  we now consider the more general case in which we allow for arbitrary p0 with 0  p0  1 and
0  1  minp0  1  p0  that is a and b in figure 10 are the analogs of risks a and b in figures 6 and 7
but p0 is no longer restricted to equal 1 
14
if the functional form of the preference representation were known one could easily compute its total
differential by taking the partial derivatives with respect to q and p and equate it to zero the slope of the
indifference curve would then be given by minus the ratio of the representations partial derivatives with respect
to q and p

11

see figure 12 where this procedure of constructing the indifference curve by geometric selfsimilarity is illustrated for the firstorder risk averter the analogous figure for the secondorder risk averter is similar

notes starting from the given values of p0 and 1  we determine p and the associated probability premium
 1  such that p   1   p0  and consider the blue solid triangle note that by the definition of the
probability premium  1  the dm is indifferent between the points 0 p0  and 21  p  1  next for

the arbitrarily given value of q we determine p and the associated probability premium  12 q such that

p   12 q  p   1   p0  the dm is now indifferent between the points 0 p0  q p  12 q and
21  p  1  see the blue dotted triangle which is geometrically selfsimilar to the blue solid triangle

hence when the dm exhibits attitude towards probability of order 2 the indifference curve
is tangent to the isoexpected value line at 0 p0  see the dasheddotted curve in figure 10
however when the dms attitude towards probability is of order 1 the indifference curve at
0 p0  is not tangent to but departs faster from the isoexpected value line see the dashed
curve in figure 10
the dm seeks to move the indifference curve southwestward as indicated by the arrow
towards the origin where he is better off but is subject to the budget restriction therefore
when the choice menu consists of a and b both the first and secondorder risk averter prefer
b see figure 13

now imagine a change in the budget line from ab to a b see figure 14 of course the
risk a is more favorable than the risk a in this new situation risk a corresponds to no risk
sharing whereas risk b corresponds to risk sharing with an individual who has a larger loss
probability figure 14 now reveals that a firstorder probability averter may still prefer the risk
sharing contract 21  p0  1  as long as a does not become too favorable

indeed after moving his indifference curve dashed southwestward as far as possible in the new
13

situation it lies below the new budget line except at the point 21  p0  1  by contrast the
secondorder probability averter will always opt to bear the risk himself instead of engaging in
actuarially unfavorable risk sharing indeed after moving his indifference curve southwestward
towards the origin his indifference curve dasheddotted lies below the new budget line except
in a 
thus even when others have more unfavorable loss probabilities than the individual himself
firstorder probability aversion may induce a preference for risk sharing when facing a risk with
a small loss probability by contrast a secondorder probability averter facing the same risk
does not engage in actuarially unfavorable risk sharing

43

risk sharing conclusion

of course when the probability mass associated with the unfavorable outcome of the risk to be
shared is sufficiently large and the discrepancy between the individuals own loss probability
and that of the other individuals is not too large both a first and a secondorder risk averter
benefit from actuarially unfavorable risk sharing the analysis in the section therefore quite
naturally restricts attention to the case of small loss probabilities which are also practically
most relevant
our analysis reveals that in this setting a firstorder probability averter may immediately
start to share his risk whenever the opportunity arises even when the individuals own loss
probability is smaller than that of the other individuals as long as the discrepancy between
the individuals own loss probability and that of the other individuals does not become too
large by contrast a secondorder probability averter only engages in actuarially fair risk
sharing

rankdependent utility

in this section we analyze the probability premium and attitude towards probability under
yaaris 42 dual theory of choice under risk dt and more generally and behaviorally more
relevant under the rankdependent utility model rdu quiggin 31
under dt a risk with cumulative distribution function f is evaluated according to
z
x dh f x 

51

where here and in the sequel the integral runs over the support of f 15 the probability
weighting distortion function h maps the unit interval onto itself satisfies h0  0 and
h1  1 and is supposed to be nondecreasing for nstate risks with payoffs x1      xn

formally 51 is a riemannstieltjes integral

the dt evaluation occurs as a special case of the rdu model which evaluates a risk with

52

the utility function u is unique up to positive affine transformations and is supposed to be
nondecreasing and h is as above16 henceforth unless otherwise stated we assume u and
h to be twice continuously differentiable with u 0  0 and h0  0 of course the eu model
occurs as a special case when h is the identity while the dt model arises when u is affine17

51

under dt the probability premium  defined in section 2 figure 3 occurs as the solution

note that h0  0 h1  1 that h is nondecreasing and that h00  0 is equivalent to h00  0 the condition

the terms associated with the low and high wealth level states partially cancel those terms that cancel

53

eqn 53 does not in general admit an explicit solution as in the local risk aversion
approach of pratt 28 and arrow 2 3 a very insightful dissection of the probability premium
can be obtained by considering small risks the resulting local approximation disentangles
the complex interplay between the probability distribution of the risk change and the dms
preferences that the probability premium depends on throughout our designation small
in small risks will refer to risks that have small unconditional probabilities under dt and
both small payoffs ie outcomes and small unconditional probabilities under rdu
indeed from 53 a firstorder taylor series expansion of hp0   around p0  and a

secondorder taylor series expansion of hp0  1  around p0  yield

eqn 56 reveals that the interplay between the ratios of second and first derivatives of the
utility function and probability weighting function are central in dictating the local approximation to the probability premium as we will see in section 54 the local indexes

maxiance and variance

to fully appreciate the local approximations 54 and 56 to the probability premium under
the dt and rdu models we introduce the maxiance or second dual moment about the mean
of course for a risk  with cumulative distribution function f  the first primal and dual
moment can be expressed as

z
m  e  

x df x

57

whereas the second primal moment about the mean or variance is given by
h
i z
m2  e   m2  x  m2 df x

58

the second dual moment about the mean or maxiance is defined by
i
h

m2  e max 1  2  e  

59

where 1 and 2 are two independent copies of 
the maxiance represents the expectation of the largest among two independent draws of

z
m2 

x  m d f x2 

510

comparing 58 and 510 shows that the maxiance is a measure of risk in the probability
plane contrary to the variance which is a measure of risk in the payoff plane
for a zeromean risk one may verify that
i
h

e min 1  2  m2 

511

arguably the miniance in 511 ie the worst among two independent draws of  is a more
natural measure of risk but from 511 we observe that for zeromean risks the miniance
coincides with the maxiance up to a change of sign
dual moments play the same role in inverse or dual stochastic dominance as primal
moments in stochastic dominance see muliere and scarsini 26 and eeckhoudt laeven and
schlesinger 11 we also note that the first and second primal moments are generated by linear
and quadratic utility functions in eu while the first and second dual moments correspond to
linear and quadratic probability weighting functions in dt we refer to eeckhoudt and laeven
12 and the references therein for further details about the maxiance
employing the variance and the maxiance we can rewrite 56 as follows

where m2 and m2 are the unconditional variance and maxiance of the risk 12 describing the

each with probability 1  see figure 15 which shows that c is obtained from d by attaching
the binary zeromean risk 12 taking the values 2 to the intermediate branch of d

note that when 1  21  the first term in 512 agrees with pratts 28 local approximation
to the probability premium in the eu model20 furthermore the second term in 512 can be
recognized as the local approximation to the probability premium in the dt model see 54
thus the local approximation to the probability premium under the rdu model occurs as the
suitably scaled sum of the eu and dt probability premia where the variance and maxiance
are on equal footing
in appendix b we show that the local approximation to the rdu probability premium in
512 also generalizes naturally to nonbinary risks appendix b focuses on the rdu model of
which both the eu and dt models are special cases we note that both the local approximation
in 512 and the results in appendix b are novel already when restricted to the eu model
indeed pratt 28 only considers the eu model with p0  1  12 

53

attitude towards probability

under the standing assumption that u and h are twice continuously differentiable with u 0  0
and h0  0 we state the following theorem
theorem 51 a dt dm has attitude towards probability of second order at the points where
19

one readily verifies that for 12  unconditionally m2  21 22  m2  221 2  and py  22 
we note that in pratt 28 the probability premium is originally defined as the ex post difference between the
probability of the favorable outcome and the probability of the unfavorable outcome ie 2 pratts convention
is not followed in the recent literature where the probability premium is the ex post shift in the probability from
the unfavorable outcome to the favorable outcome ie  see eg liu and neilson 20
20

18

h00 6 0 an eu and rdu dm has attitude towards probability of first order at the points where

u 00 6 0 for almost every 2 

now consider the dt model and suppose that the probability weighting function h  0 1 

0 1 is nondecreasing and not differentiable at p0  but has left and right derivatives h0 p0 
and h0 p0  with h0 p0  6 h0 p0  then we state the following result
theorem 52 a dt dm has attitude towards probability of first order at the points where the
probability weighting function is not differentiable but has left and right derivatives
an example of such a probability weighting function is given by

in financial risk management this probability weighting function gives rise to that averagevalueatrisk avr
we thus find that rdu and eu maximizers usually exhibit firstorder probability aversion while dt dms with smooth probability weighting function are secondorder probability
averters from segal and spivak 37 we already know that rdu and dt maximizers usually
exhibit firstorder risk aversion while eu dms with smooth utility function are risk averse of
order 2 that is under the rdu model both probability aversion and risk aversion are usually
firstorder phenomena
we note also that expected value maximizationpopular in operations research eg in
optimal stopping lawinvariant comonotonic coherent risk measurespopular in financial
risk management eg fllmer and schied 14 chapter 4 and linear or affine utility
modelspopular in economics especially for small stakes usually induce secondorder probability aversion

54

comparative risk aversion

in this subsection we show that the local approximation to the rdu probability premium can
be naturally linked to global results on comparative risk aversion under rdu note first that
512 reveals that for small zeromean risks the probability premium  is affine in the primal
and dual local indexes of absolute risk aversion

theorem 53 consider two rdu maximizers with utility function ui and probability weighting

the statements apply mutatis mutandis when the domain of the utility functions is only a

from pratt 28 yaari 41 and eeckhoudt and laeven 12 statement i is known to be
equivalent to u2 and h2 being concavifications of u1 and h1  ie there exist functions  and

theorem 53 generalizes pratts results on the probability premium in two directions to risk

changes with probability mass less than unity and more significantly to rdu furthermore
as the dt model occurs as a special case of the rdu model it is also covered by the results
in theorem 53 the generality of the results in theorem 53 and in particular the joint
presence of both the utility function and the probability weighting function makes its proof
more complex than that in pratt 28 the proof of theorem 53 is in appendix a and relies
on analyzing the total differential of the rdu functional
global results on comparative risk aversion under rdu are already in yaari 41 chew
karni and safra 5 and roll 32 as d is a meanpreserving contraction of c these existing
global results may in principle be invoked to imply iii although none of the existing results
under rdu refers to the probability premium the implication iii is new it establishes
the formal connection between a local approach to the probability premium and global risk
aversion within rdu an analog of theorem 53 for the risk premium is in eeckhoudt and
laeven 12

55

comparison to the risk premium

as an alternative to the construction of the probability premium in section 2 figure 3 we
could have adapted the outcome of the intermediate state of d from 0 to  such that the
dm becomes indifferent between c and d see figure 16

of course d0  d this would naturally gives rise to the risk premium  associated to

the risk change from c to d see eeckhoudt and laeven 12 one easily verifies that the risk
premium of pratt 28 and arrow 2 3 occurs as a special case in the comparison between
c and d when p0  1

then one compares a risk to a sure loss equal to the risk

premium
eeckhoudt and laeven 12 develop a local approximation to the risk premium  their
approximation takes the form

where pr is the total unconditional probability mass associated to 12 22 just like in 512 the
local approximations to the eu and dt risk premia follow as special cases by setting hp  p
for eu and u x  x for dt

upon comparing 512 and 514 we obtain the following link between the risk and prob

conclusion

for many years and despite its appeal the probability premium of pratt 28 has been overshadowed by its more prevalent siblings given by the risk premium and the local index of
absolute risk aversion
22

observe that for 12  pr  21 

21

in this paper we have generalized pratts construction of the probability premium and have
used it to introduce and analyze attitudes towards probability by developing a local approximation to the probability premium under rankdependent utility as a byproduct of significant
interest in its own right we have shown that rankdependent and expected utility maximizers
usually display attitude towards probability of order 1 whereas dual theory maximizersas
well as expected value maximizers investors using lawinvariant comonotonic coherent risk
measures and economic agents using affine utility modelstypically exhibit attitude towards
probability of order 2
we have illustrated the relevance of first and secondorder probability aversion in a problem
of risk sharing our results reveal that for a firstorder risk averter facing a risk with a small
loss probability there are immediately significant benefits to risk sharing opportunities he may
therefore opt for risk sharing even when actuarially unfavorable by contrast for a secondorder risk averter the initial benefits of risk sharing opportunities are negligible a secondorder
risk averter likes actuarially fair risk sharing however when facing a risk with a small loss
probability he always avoids actuarially unfavorable risk sharing that is only firstorder
probability averters like to engage in risk sharing if the probability of the occurrence of other
individuals losses is more unfavorable than that of the individuals own loss when faced with
a risk with a small loss probability
we hope that our approach and results contribute to a widespread analysis and use of the
appealing concept of the probability premium

proof of theorem 53 we first note that due to pratt 28 yaari 41 and eeckhoudt and
laeven 12 statement i is equivalent to

and

h2 sh2 r

for all v  w  x  y and all

next we will prove that the equivalent statements i and iii imply statement ii consider eqn 55 and fix an arbitrary 2  0 clearly if 1  0 in 55 then i  0 define

24

the function
wi i  1   hi p0  1   hi p0  1  ui w0 
 hi p0  i   hi p0  1  ui w0  2 
 hi p0  1   hi p0  i  ui w0  2  

i  1 2

and consider its total differential
dwi 

wi
wi
di 
d1 
i

it takes the form
dwi  h0i p0  i  ui w0  2   ui w0  2  di


 h0i p0  1  ui w0   ui w0  2   h0i p0  1  ui w0  2   ui w0  d1 

we equate the total differential to zero we thus obtain
di
ui w0   ui w0  2  h0i p0  1 
ui w0  2   ui w0  h0i p0  1 


 a1
d1
ui w0  2   ui w0  2  h0i p0  i  ui w0  2   ui w0  2  h0i p0  i 
using statements i and iii we will show that for rdu dm i  2 the first two fractions on
the righthand side of a1 are larger than or equal to the corresponding fractions for rdu
dm i  1 while the last two fractions are weakly smaller for dm i  2 than for dm i  1
all four fractions are positive for i  1 2
indeed first invoking statement i we obtain as in pratt 28 eqn 20
u10 x
u20 x



u20 w
u10 w

for w  x

a2

and we note that the utility function ui can be replaced by the probability weighting function
hi in a2 with the variables w and x restricted to 0 1 next statement iii yields
u2 y  u2 x
u2 w  u2 v
u1 y  u1 x
u1 w  u1 v




u2 w  u2 v u2 w  u2 v
u1 w  u1 v u1 w  u1 v

for v  w  x  y

in particular when w  x this reduces to
u2 y  u2 v
u1 y  u1 v


u2 w  u2 v
u1 w  u1 v
whence

for v  w  y

u2 w  u2 v
u1 w  u1 v


u2 y  u2 v
u1 y  u1 v

a3

and

u2 y  u2 w
u1 y  u1 w


u2 y  u2 v
u1 y  u1 v

invoking the inequalities in eqn a2 with ui replaced by hi upon restricting the corresponding domains to 0 1 and eqns a3 and a4 we find from a1 that

a5

hence ii
we have thus shown that statement i implies statement ii it remains to show that ii
also implies i or equivalently that not i implies not ii to this end it suffices to note
that if statement i fails to hold on some interval of x or p then due to the arbitrariness of
w0  p0  2  0 and 1 with 0  1  p0  1  p0   1 one can always find feasible w0  p0  2

and 1 such that a5 holds on some interval with the inequality sign strict and reversed and
as a consequence statement ii fails to hold this completes the proof

to the payoffs xi  i  1     n with x1      xn  where

unequal state probabilities we denote by n1 the number of states with negative payoff and let
n2  n  n1  note the generality of this setting
p
we suppose that ni1 xi  0 so the risk has mean equal to zero we also suppose that

in this general setting we define the probability premium of the zeromean nstate risk as
the uniform reduction in the probabilities of the unfavorable ie negative payoff states
inducing a uniform increase in the probabilities of the favorable states accordingly such that
the dm is indifferent between bearing and not bearing the risk note that this definition of
26

the probability premium applies irrespective of whether 1 and 2 are small or large
formally the rdu probability premium  thus solves
