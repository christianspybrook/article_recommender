abstract
context galaxy clusters are an important tool for cosmology and their detection and characterization are key goals for current and future surveys

using data from the widefield infrared survey explorer wise the massive and distant clusters of wise survey madcows located 2839
significant galaxy overdensities at redshifts 07  z  15 which included extensive followup imaging from the spitzer space telescope to
determine cluster richnesses concurrently the atacama cosmology telescope act has produced large area mmwave maps in three frequency
bands along with a large catalog of sunyaevzeldovich sz selected clusters as part of its data release 5 dr5
aims we aim to verify and characterize madcows clusters using measurements of or limits on their thermal sz tsz effect signatures we
also use these detections to establish the scaling relation between sz mass and the madcowsdefined richness
methods using the maps and cluster catalog from dr5 we explore the scaling between sz mass and cluster richness we do this by comparing
cataloged detections and extracting individual and stacked sz signals from the madcows cluster locations we use complementary radio survey
data from the very large array submillimeter data from herschel and act 224 ghz data to assess the impact of contaminating sources on the
sz signals from both act and madcows clusters we use a hierarchical bayesian model to fit the massrichness scaling relation allowing for
clusters to be drawn from two populations one a gaussian centered on the massrichness relation and the other a gaussian centered on zero sz
signal
results we find that madcows clusters have submillimeter contamination which is consistent with a graybody spectrum while the act
clusters are consistent with no submillimeter emission on average additionally the intrinsic radio intensities of act clusters are lower than those
of madcows clusters even when the act clusters are restricted to the same redshift range as the madcows clusters we find the best fit act
015
sz mass vs madcows richness scaling relation has a slope of   184014
 where the slope is defined as m  15 where 15 is the richness we
also find that the act sz signals for a significant fraction  57of the madcows sample can statistically be described as being drawn from a
noiselike distribution indicating that the candidates are possibly dominated by lowmass and unvirialized systems that are below the mass limit
of the act sample further we note that a large portion of the opticallyconfirmed act clusters located in the same volume of the sky as the
madcows survey are not selected by madcows indicating the madcows sample is not complete with respect to sz selection finally we
find that the radio loud fraction rlf of madcows clusters increases with richness while we find no evidence that the submillimeter emission
of the madcows clusters evolves with richness
conclusions we conclude that the original madcows surveys selection function is not well defined and as such reiterate the madcows
collaborations recommendation that the sample is suited for probing cluster and galaxy evolution but not cosmological analyses we find a best
fit massrichness relation slope that agrees with the published madcows preliminary results additionally we find that while the approximate
level of infill of the act and madcows cluster sz signals 1  2 is subdominant to other sources of uncertainty for current generation
experiments characterizing and removing this bias will be critical for next generation experiments hoping to constrain cluster masses at the
subpercent level finally we also find evidence that the madcows and act clusters are drawn from different underlying populations

1 introduction
astronomers have long sought an efficient and effective way to
identify galaxy clusters as well as a convenient observational
proxy for their mass abell 1958 rykoff et al 2012 andreon
2015 saro et al 2015 geach  peacock 2017 simet et al
2017 rettura et al 2018 gonzalez et al 2019a chiu et al
2020 particularly at high redshift where their formation and
distribution are sensitive probes of cosmology

recently the sunyaevzeldovich effect sz effect see sunyaev  zeldovich 1970 1972 as well as birkinshaw 1999 carlstrom et al 2002 mroczkowski et al 2019 for reviews has been
used to uncover large populations of distant clusters in particular the thermal sz tsz effect allows redshift independent detection of clusters due to inversecompton scattering of cmb
photons as they pass through hot gas in the clusters1 cluster

throughout the paper we use sz effect to refer exclusively to the tsz
effect as opposed to the kinetic sz effect

masses can be then estimated from the amplitude of the sz signals under the assumption of a universal pressure profile eg
arnaud et al 2010 we refer to such estimates as sz masses
the planck satellite which provides the only allsky sz survey
to date was limited by both sensitivity and angular resolution
100 at 100 ghz and has identified clusters with z  1 planck
collaboration et al 2016a groundbased surveys such as the
atacama cosmology telescope act fowler et al 2007 swetz
et al 2011 thornton et al 2016 and the south pole telescope
spt carlstrom et al 2011 benson et al 2014 have achieved
1  20 resolution and are sensitive to highredshift clusters but
until recently only surveyed a small fraction of the sky these
surveys are also now more sensitive than planck over large portions of the sky see eg naess et al 2020
meanwhile opticalinfrared ir surveys and analysis methods have progressed offering new data selection techniques
eg weak lensing shear and more advanced richness selection criteria one such survey the massive and distant clusters of wise survey madcows gonzalez et al 2019a relies
on data from the widefield infrared survey explorer wise
madcows provides an infraredselected sample of candidate
clusters at redshifts 07  z  15 the madcows sample aims
to extend richness selection to a higher average redshift than previous surveys
act has observed roughly 40 of the sky in the fifth data release hereafter referred to as dr52  which includes cluster data
taken through the 2018 observing season hilton et al 2021
this data release enables large statistical comparisons between
cluster richness as measured by optical or ir surveys and their
sz mass dr5 provides sz measurements for a large fraction of
the madcows candidates well beyond the handful of systems
targeted for individual sz followup in gonzalez et al 2019a
dicker et al 2020 di mascolo et al 2020 and ruppin et al
2020 for example
in this work we use data from act dr5 to establish how
sz mass scales with the madcows definition of richness for a
large sample of madcows cluster candidates the work presented here complements the recent work by madhavacheril
et al 2020 who report the mean mass determined through
stacked cmb lensing of the madcows candidates located
within the act survey region and above a richness of 20 section 21 additionally this work probes the massrichness scaling relation and hence cluster abundance at a higher redshift
than previous studies eg sehgal et al 2013
the paper is structured as follows an overview of the act
dr5 and madcows samples as well as the ancillary data we
use to test for radio and submillimeter source infill is provided
in section 2 in section 3 we detail the process used to identify
clusters detected in both act and madcows samples and
from this estimate the completeness of the madcows sample
in section 4 we describe the forced photometry process used
to obtain masses for the madcows clusters from the act
maps in section 5 we review the corrections performed on the
forced photometry mass estimates including contamination by
active galactic nuclei agn and dusty submillimeter galaxies
via ancillary radio and submillimeter data in section 6 we
describe the process used to infer the massrichness scaling
relation in section 7 we discuss the inferred scaling relations
and completeness of the madcows catalog as well as the
impact of contamination by ir and submm sources on the sz
mass in section 8 we provide conclusions and give an outlook

the madcows galaxy cluster catalog comprises 2839 cluster
candidates spanning redshifts 07  z  15 selected using
wise wright et al 2010 allsky survey data gonzalez et al
2019a3 to reduce contamination by lower redshift galaxies
madcows uses optical data from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system panstarrs chambers 
panstarrs team 2018 at declination   30  and supercosmos hambly et al 2001abc at   30 to reject low
redshift interlopers madcows also uses data from the sloan
digital sky survey york et al 2000 sdss for the same purpose over sections of the sdss footprint in total 2433 cluster
candidates were identified by the wisepanstarrs search
and 250 by the wisesupercosmos search the madcows
catalog includes photometric redshifts for 1869 of its candidates
derived from spitzer imaging spectroscopic measurements of a
limited subsample of the madcows cluster candidates indicate
that the photometric uncertainty is z 1  z  0036 in addition to photometric redshifts the spitzer followup also enabled
an estimate of cluster richness 15  see section 63 of gonzalez
et al 2019a briefly the madcows richness parameter 15 is
the number of galaxies within a comoving 1 mpc radius aperture for the candidates redshift having a flux density  15 jy
after applying the color selection criteria described in wylezalek
et al 2013 and subtracting the expected number of field galaxies the color selection was designed to select only high redshift
clusters within the madcows catalog 1869 of the 2839 cluster
candidates have both richness and redshift estimates for the purposes of determining a massrichness scaling relationship this
subset was further restricted to those madcows cluster candidates lying in the act footprint which totaled 1035 additionally 70 clusters lie in regions that are masked due to point
source contamination this leaves 965 madcows cluster candidates that were used in the analysis to determine the radio and
submm properties of both the act and madcows clusters
we consider the full act and madcows cluster catalogs necessarily restricted to those clusters for which we have radiosubmm data finally in section 4 we stacked on the madcows
cluster locations to verify that the madcows cluster candidates
did on average produce an sz signal in order to ensure that
known act clusters did not dominate this stacked signal we excluded madcows clusters that were also detected in act from
the stacking analysis we did however include clusters without

throughout this work we assume a flat cdm cosmology
with m  0307   0693 and h0  677 km s1 mpc1

2 data
in this work we primarily use the madcows cluster catalog
gonzalez et al 2019b and the catalog and maps from act
hilton et al 2021 additionally we use data from the herschel
space observatory valiante et al 2016 smith et al 2017 and
the very large array vla condon et al 1998 lacy et al
2020 to constrain dust and radio infill of the sz signal respectively we also use the act 224 ghz maps to assess and
constrain the impact of dust infill

a redshift measurement resulting in the stacking analysis using a slightly different number of clusters 948 from the massrichness fit
22 act

act is a 6meter offaxis gregorian telescope located in the
atacama desert in chile that has been operating since 2007
fowler et al 2007 the advanced actpol advact receiver
which was deployed in 2016 is its latest camera henderson
et al 2016 thornton et al 2016 it performs polarization sensitive observations centered at 98 150 and 224 ghz corresponding to a diffractionlimited resolution of 220  140  and 100  respectively throughout we use f090 f150 and f220 to refer to
the maps made at those frequencies and 98 150 and 224 ghz
when refering specifically to the frequencies act has undertaken a number of large area unbiased cluster surveys using the
sz effect menanteau et al 2010 marriage et al 2011 sehgal
et al 2011 hasselfield et al 2013 menanteau et al 2013 hilton
et al 2018 2021 in this work we use the dr5 cluster catalog
hilton et al 2021 which we refer to as the act cluster catalog and whose members we call act clusters as well as maps
of the central comptonization parameter 20  often referred to as
sz maps in this work see section 23 of hilton et al 2021 to
construct these sz maps we use the act maps filtered at the reference 240 scale to perform forced photometry at the locations
of clusters reported in the madcows catalog this matched filtering essentially reduces the sz detection of given cluster candidate to a single quantity 20  the sz map is constructed such
that each pixel records the 20 value that a cluster would have if it
were detected at a given location in the map therefore we simply extract 20 and snr24 the signaltonoise measured in this
240 scale map values at the coordinates of each madcows
cluster to produce a forced photometry catalog subpixel interpolation is performed using a bivariate 3rdorder spline method
we warn that following section 42 of hilton et al 2021 the
sz masses estimated here from these maps may be underestimated by  5  10 and as such caution should be exercised
when comparing the reported masses here to other cluster catalogs the dr5 catalog contains 4195 szselected optically confirmed clusters with signaltonoise  4 and with redshifts in the
range 004  z  191 over 13211 deg2 of the sky the catalog
has a 90 completeness mass limit of 38  1014 m at z  05
while the act cluster search was conducted using matched
filters with a number of different scales a fixed reference scale
with 500c  r500c da  240 was used for characterizing the sz
signal and its relation to mass this scale is equivalent to a cluster with m500c  2  1014 m at z  04 assuming the arnaud
et al 2010 pressure profile and associated scaling relation in
this work we use the map of the central comptonization parameter 20 at this reference scale and the associated signaltonoise
map to estimate the masses of madcows clusters using forced
photometry see section 4
in addition to the 20 maps we also used the individual frequency maps f090 and f150 as well as 20 maps made with each
frequency 98 and 150 ghz individually we also used the f220
maps constructed from observations at 224 ghz while the f220
maps are noisier 50  60 karcmin than the f090 and f150
data   30 karcmin typical see naess et al 2020 the band
is centered near the null in the sz effect providing a clean band
for quantifying the dust emission in the act and madcows
clusters as is discussed in section 52 for all these maps the
pixel size is 050 

23 herschel

we used the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey hatlas dr1 valiante et al 2016 and dr2 smith
et al 2017 to measure the thermal emission from dust in the
act and madcows clusters within the hatlas footprint
hatlas covers 660 deg2 at 100 160 250 350 and 500 m
using the pacs and spire cameras we used only the 250 350
and 500 m bands all from the spire camera the spire resolution is 18200  25200  and 36300 at 250 350 and 500 m respectively with pixel size equal to the resolution due to the relatively small size of the hatlas field only 34 act and 66
madcows clusters have herschel coverage
24 very large array

in order to determine if radio source infill impacts the sz signals from madcows candidates we examine data from the national radio astronomy observatory nrao vla sky survey
nvss condon et al 1998 and the very large array sky survey vlass lacy et al 2020
nvss is a 14 ghz survey with 4500 fwhm angular resolution 1500 pixels that covers approximately 82 of the sky at
declinations   40  the nvss catalog includes a set of 2326
continuum images made with a large restoring beam to provide
the sensitivity needed for completeness
vlass is an ongoing 3 ghz radio survey producing stokes
i q and u maps with an angular resolution  2500 100 pixel
size like nvss before it the survey covers the entire sky
visible to the vla a 34000 deg2   40  area the surveys first observations began in september 2017 vlass is expected to detect by the projects completion in 2024 5000000
sources and record data with a continuum image rms of 70
jybeam combined and 120 jybeam perepoch the first
epoch survey of the entire vlass footprint has been completed
and data products are available4 quicklook 2d stokes i images covering the entire survey were used to conduct our investigations into madcows radio source infill

3 codetections in the madcows and act
catalogs
in order to understand the completeness of the madcows survey we identify actselected clusters that we consider to be
matches with madcows candidates which we refer to as codetections we consider a madcows candidate and an act
cluster to be a codetection ie the same cluster if the positional difference between the act entry and madcows entry
was less than or equal to 250  the criterion of a 250 matching
scale was chosen as it is approximately the resolution limit given
the act catalog filter reference scale 240  note that hilton
et al 2021 find that 997 of the act cluster centers are within
190 of the optical centers using this criterion we identified 96
codetections we report these 96 cluster codetections in appendix c1 restricting our search to only include matches to
madcows clusters in the panstarrs footprint that number
is reduced to 80
we explored codetections with larger positional difference
values as well increasing the accepted positional difference from
250 to 50  however doing so only resulted in an additional 7

fig 1 offsets in the right ascension and declination of act
clusters hilton et al 2021 and their codetected madcows
counterparts gonzalez et al 2019b the color bar indicates the
redshift of the codetection as recorded by act in the dr5 cluster catalog the blackdotted circle is the radius 120  that includes 89 95 of codetections
codetection candidates which we deemed to be only chance
superpositions in figure 1 we show the typical offsets between
the codetections indicating the match is generally within 070 
given the act cluster catalog the number of codetections
sets an upper limit on the completeness with respect to the act
catalog of the madcows cluster catalog and informs our understanding as to what extent these two surveys probe the same
population of clusters we first consider whether madcows detected all act clusters restricting the act catalog to match
the madcows catalog in redshift 07  z  15 and footprint
  30  corresponding to the panstarrs followup region
yields 712 act clusters compared to 80 codetections restricted
to the panstarrs region relaxing the footprint constraint to
include areas of supercosmos followup yields 1102 act
clusters compared to 96 codetections while this does not put
a hard constraint on the completeness of the madcows survey it does suggest that it is  10 a primary reason for this
low completeness is expected to be the large nongaussian scatter between the mass and detection significance in the madcows search madcows clusters were detected as galaxy excesses traced by the bright tip of the luminosity function with
the strength of the signal significantly affected by both poisson
statistics and blending of galaxies at the resolution of wise
as discussed in section 21 after restricting the madcows
cluster catalog to the act footprint masking point sources and
removing clusters without measured richnesses or redshifts a
total of 965 madcows clusters remain which are used for the
mass richness scaling relation we note that discrepancies in the
redshift determinations existed for several of the codetections
wherever these occurred we used the redshift reported in hilton
et al 2021 since these generally included newer and more complete data and correspondingly smaller uncertainties
we highlight in figure 2 a few prominent codetections additionally we compare the sz masses for a number of act
clusters to those from the literature in appendix b overall the
masses inferred from these targeted observations agree within
1 with the actinferred mass estimates one noteworthy exception is that of moo j11421527 where the mass estimates

using combined array for research in millimeterwave astronomy carma gonzalez et al 2019a new iram kids arrays nika2carma ruppin et al 2020 act and mustang2 dicker et al 2020 differ at approximately the 2 level
we note that moravec et al 2020 report this cluster as an ongoing merger and that it may require multiple sz components to
describe in figure 3 we show the data used to infer scaling relations using carma and mustang2 gonzalez et al 2019a
dicker et al 2020 respectively a notable feature evident in
this figure is that for the act codetections as well as the clusters from the previous sz followup campaigns there appears
to be a bimodal split in the sz mass of the high 15 systems
the effect may be in part due to merging and premerger systems which can have low sz signals for their richness dicker
et al 2020 the suggestion of bimodal behavior in figure 3 becomes more evident in figure 4 in which the sz signals of the
entire madcows catalog as measured with act are plotted
the masses of the high richness 15  55 systems cluster into
two branches one higher 20 and higher slope and one lower 20
and lower slope high resolution followup observations of these
clusters could provide insight into whether the bimodality is in
fact due to merger history

4 forced photometry at madcows cluster
candidate locations
as discussed in section 22 to form the forced photometry catalog we simply record the 20 value in the sz map at a madcows candidate location the resulting distribution of 20 versus 15  for the 965 candidates that have reported richness values is shown in figure 4 the forced photometry catalog has no
snr limit ie it includes all 965 madcows cluster candidates
that fall within the act survey footprint excluding those that
fall within masked regions eg due to the dust mask or point
sources see hilton et al 2021 this means that the catalog is
free from szselection bias and by fitting the 20 values at the
madcows cluster locations through a bayesian approach we
are able to infer the massrichness relation see section 6 while
addressing sample impurity and sources of contamination due
to noise in the map as well as radio or dusty sources in or near
clusters the madcows clusters may have negative 20 values
we account for this in sections 52 53 and 61
conversion from 20 to mass was done following hilton et al
2021 we note that there is a small calibration difference between our masses and those of gonzalez et al 2019a they used
the andersson et al 2011 scaling relation while our work uses
the arnaud et al 2010 scaling relation the difference between
these two should be  5 andersson et al 2011 which is
subdominant to other sources of uncertainty in our main results
section 63
we verified the presence of sz signal on average by stacking the act sz maps on the madcows candidate locations
for this we used the pixell software suite5 we removed candidates outside the act footprint or lacking a richness estimate
as well as codetections to ensure that the signal would not be
dominated by known act clusters after which 984 clusters remained for stacking we divided these clusters into richness bins
as shown in figure 5 starting at a richness of 15  10 there
are only 28 clusters in the remaining 984 with 15  10 and the
signal in this stack is consistent with 0 to within 1 in each bin
we then stacked 200  200 cutout maps centered on the madcows cluster positions the results are shown in figure 5 we

the targeted sz followup in eg gonzalez et al 2019a di
mascolo et al 2020 and dicker et al 2020 mainly probes
the highrichness tail in the distribution and hence may present
both malmquist and eddington biases see eg malmquist 1922
kelly 2007 in the richness selection moreover the carma
sample exhibits a malmquist bias in its sz flux measurements
as noted in gonzalez et al 2019a the carma sample was

fig 4 the 20 15 relation for the forced photometry
actmadcows catalog the color bar on the right indicates
the redshift of each candidate the black points indicate the average 20 in bins of richness note that these are not quite the same
as those computed from stacking in figure 5 as those do not include the codetections see section 4 for a discussion of why
they were not included the binned 20 uncertainties were computed via bootstrapping while the 15 error bars simply show
the bin width the redshift given is the act catalog redshift for
those clusters detected in act otherwise it is the madcows
reported redshift
constructed by performing shallower observations of the higher
richness objects based on the expectation that the integration
times should be shorter and only reported the results for robust
detections correcting for these biases was one of the prime motivations of this paper since the madcows clusters were not
sz selected it is unnecessary to deboost our 20 or mass estimates however three primary effects still need to be corrected
in the forced photometry mass estimates

firstly the cluster locations that madcows reports are the
peaks of a smoothed galaxy density map the identified cluster
location can be offset from the center of the cluster mass and
hence the center of the sz signal george et al 2012 sehgal
et al 2013 viola et al 2015 which leads to a suppression of
the sz signal this scatter can be due to measurement uncertainty of the clusters madcows centroid  1500 in each of ra
and dec gonzalez et al 2019a section 53 or sz peak 150
total hilton et al 2021 or it can be due to astrophysical reasons
ie the hot virialized gas which is responsible for the sz signal
may not have the same spatial distribution as the galaxy number
density used to determine the madcows centroid george et al
2012 sehgal et al 2013 viola et al 2015 either way the result
is that for a set of clusters stacking on the optical centroids produces a signal which is suppressed as compared to stacking on
their sz peak locations which ge et al 2019 have found to be
around the  10 level this agrees with the typical suppression
that we find in section 51
secondly the matched filter used in the forced photometry
method as described in section 4 cannot account for compact
sources at cluster locations if emission from compact sources
such as radio sources or dust reduces the 98 andor the 150 ghz
emission the effect will be to bias the 20 estimate low the emission infills the sz decrement causing the mass estimate from
forced photometry to be biased low the significantly negative
20 clusters see figure 4 suggest that this might be occurring
further stacking the f220 maps on the madcows candidate locations produces a significant positive signal which is not present
when stacking on the act cluster locations we ascribe this
excess to dusty submm emission spatially correlated with the
madcows cluster locations stacks on act and madcows
cluster locations at radio frequencies show that the act clusters have higher observed radio flux density on average section 53 as such the source of the excess madcows 224 ghz
emission is likely not radio from the f220 stacks and similar
stacks on the hatlas maps we find that the madcows candidates have more significant infill at submm wavelengths than
the general population of act clusters further we find that the
spectral form of the submm emission in the madcows cluster
stacks is well described by a graybody equation 5 such infill is typically due to dusty submillimeter galaxies eg casey
et al 2014 we combined the stacks on the f220 and hatlas
data set to estimate this contamination and remove it from the
massrichness scaling relation see section 52
thirdly and finally in section 53 we consider the effect of
contamination at radio wavelengths on the madcows cluster
candidates bright radio contamination while declining at mm
wavelengths could potentially remain relatively significant at 98

to the order of magnitude difference in scale maximum between bins the scaling is not consistent between plots while there is no

to correct for suppression of the sz signals due to positional offsets in madcowsdetermined cluster centroids as compared to
the act determined centroids we stacked the 20 maps on the 96
actmadcows codetections twice once on the act identified cluster locations and once on the madcows identified location at each cluster location we created a 200 square submap of
the 20 map centered on the cluster location we normalized each
submap to have unity amplitude so that the suppression was not
dominated by the particular scatter of the brightest clusters we
performed this stacking analysis on clusters with measured richness greater than 20 divided into 5 bins of even richness range
this left only about 15 clusters in each bin leading to relatively
large uncertainties as shown in figure 6
to compute the suppression for each of the stacks above we
computed the aperture t cmb within a 120 radius of the stack
center for a given richness bin the ratio of this statistic for the
madcows centered stacks to the act centered ones sets the
suppression we computed the variance via bootstrapping we
then fit the richnesssuppression relation to a sigmoid model of

fig 7 average 224 ghz emission for madcows blue and
act orange clusters madcows clusters were binned in richness while the act clusters were binned in mass richness is
plotted on the lower xaxis while mass is plotted on the upper
the two scales are not equivalent and are simply coplotted for
convenience error bars were estimated via bootstrapping the
madcows clusters show a statistically significant excess emission at 224 ghz on the whole while the act clusters show a
small decrement in neither the act nor the madcows clusters
is there a trend with mass or richness the dashed lines indicate
the average 224 ghz emission across all madcows blue and
act orange clusters we attribute the signal from the madcows cluster candidates at 224 ghz to ir emission and follow
up with herschel data section 52
a richness dependent prior on that suppression parameter section 62
52 submm emission

since the sz effect at the frequencies of interest 98 and
150 ghz manifests as a decrement of the cmb temperature
there is the potential that dusty submm sources could fill in
or partially suppress the sz signal it is also known that dusty
submm galaxies eg erler et al 2018 as well as radio agn
considered in the next section frequently reside within the centers of clusters where feedback processes are strongest see eg
coble et al 2007 sayers et al 2013 gralla et al 2014 zakamska et al 2019 gralla et al 2020
to determine if the sz signals of the madcows candidates
are suppressed by a dusty contribution we stacked the f220 maps
on the madcows centers the f220 map was matched filtered in
the same way as the 20 map to remove point sources maintaining
consistency we then stacked the f220 maps on both the act all
4195 and madcows all 1572 in the act footprint cluster
positions and computed the aperture flux density in units of t cmb
within the 120 radius of the stack center corresponding to the
act cluster finder reference filter scale of 240 
we used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainty in this
measure we found that for the madcows clusters the signal
was 89  12 k while for the stack on act clusters the signal was 23  06 k where the units are t cmb  additionally
we binned both the madcows and act data into 6 bins for
the madcows clusters we binned them in richness while for
the act we binned them in cluster mass we then repeated the
analysis using these bins the results are shown in figure 7 for
article number page 8 of 25

both the madcows and act clusters there is no obvious trend
in 224 ghz flux density with richness or mass respectively the
excess emission in the madcows clusters we attribute to dust
emission the decrement in 224 ghz emission from the act
clusters may be due to a small bias in the cluster finder algorithm since the cmb serves as a source of noise when searching
for the sz signal the algorithm preferentially finds clusters in
regions of lower primary cmb signal ie cold spots therefore when stacking on the f220 maps the result is a preferential
stack on regions of low 224 ghz emission leading to a decrement
to quantify the dust emission we stacked on the madcows
cluster locations in the hatlas maps valiante et al 2016
smith et al 2017 for comparison we also stacked the maps
on act cluster locations and a sample of random locations generated by offsetting each madcows cluster location by 50 in a
random direction due to the small size of the hatlas survey
we were only able to perform this analysis for 34 act clusters and 66 madcows cluster candidates limiting our ability
to determine if the infill has a richness or mass dependence in
order to compare with the emission at 224 ghz we first converted each of the 250 350 and 500 m maps to mjypixel and
then smoothed to 100 ie the act 220 ghz resolution using
a gaussian kernel with the integral normalized to unity we then
stacked these maps on the madcows and act cluster locations using inversenoise weighting and calculated the aperture
flux density within 120 of the stack center ie in the central
240 diameter corresponding to the reference filter scale used in
hilton et al 2021 we computed the uncertainty in each stack
via bootstrapping for the act and randoms stack the signal
was consistent with zero for the madcows there was a statistically significant excess see figure 8 we converted the average fluctuation of t cmb in the 224 ghz stack described above
to emission in mjy sr1  using the derivative of the blackbody

along with the higher emission in the act 224 ghz channel figure 7 indicates the madcows clusters may be contaminated by
dusty sources
blackbody function to account for the effect of redshift we fit
using the rest frame frequencies which we converted from the
observed frequencies by multiplying by 1  hzi  208 with
hzi the average z for the subsample of madcows clusters in the
hatlas region for which there are photometric redshifts we
assumed a gaussian function for the likelihood and estimated the
uncertainties in our fit parameters using a markov chain monte
carlo mcmc method implemented in the emcee foremanmackey et al 2013 package we placed flat uninformative priors on t  a and  enforcing 0 k  t  200 k 1  a  1
and 5    10 results of the fit are presented in figure 9
subfigure 9a shows the data with error bars in black the best fit

we show constraints on the fit parameters t rest   and a
we find that for the madcows clusters in the hatlas
footprint the best fit temperature is t  284
3 k this is in
good agreement with other measurements of the dust properties
of iroptical selected clusters see eg smith et al 2013 erler

is somewhat higher than other measurements but
does agree within uncertainties see eg magnelli et al 2012
smith et al 2013 sayers et al 2019
when performing the massrichness scaling relation fit we
repeated the analysis above by including the dust model in the
full joint probability distribution this allowed for accounting
of degeneracies between the dust model parameters and other
parameters see section 61
to get an estimate of the level of bias due to dusty emission infilling the sz signal in madcows cluster candidates
we converted the modeled emission at 98 ghz 77  3 jy and
150 ghz 370  50 jy to compton y via

we then weighted the computed 20 at 98 and 150 ghz by their
average relative contributions to 20  66 and 33 respectively
and compared that weighted average to the 20 signal for a 2 
1014 m cluster at redshift of 1 following hilton et al 2021
we find that the infill is 15  05 for the average madcows

cluster candidate the above computation ignores the effects of
the matched filter which will in general suppress the infill for a
source not centered on the cluster and should be considered an
approximation only
53 radio emission

in order to assess and quantify low frequency radio source infill strong enough to impact our 98 and 150 ghz measurements
of the sz signal we require constraints on the radio flux density and spectral indices of the source population using both
nvss 14 ghz and vlass nominally 3 ghz allows us to
estimate both from these surveys section 24 we evaluate the
distribution of radio infill associated with members of the act
and madcows samples for each cluster there are two statistics with which we are concerned 1 the intrinsic luminosity of
sources within the cluster in its frame of reference and 2 the observed flux density in our frame of reference we are concerned
with the intrinsic radio luminosities as they tell us whether the
act and madcows clusters were drawn from populations with
the same intrinsic radio properties we must also consider the observed fluxes as they set the level of radio infill in the cluster
for clarity whenever we refer to fluxes or surface brightness or
use units of flux density or surface brightness jy or jysr we
are referring to the observed flux density or surface brightness in
our frame of reference whenever we refer to radio luminosities or use units of luminosity whz we are referring to the
intrinsic radio luminosity our process is to first compute the observed flux density for each cluster and then convert that into
intrinsic radio luminosity
to compute the radio flux for each cluster we produced a
cutout image postage stamp of the nvss map centered at the
cluster position and smoothed it to 10 to match the act 224 ghz
beam scale in order to account for the effect of smoothing by the
act beam on the f220 maps we then calculate the aperture flux
density in the central 120 radius of the smoothed stamps additionally for each stamp we estimate the local background flux
density by computing the 120 radius aperture flux density at 20
random locations in the stamp lying outside the central aperture
and taking the median we then subtracted the background flux
density from the central flux density to form an estimate of the

same data cut at the aperture noise of 03 mjy to better illustrate the difference in infill between the two samples the fluxes
shown are all for a 120 radius aperture while the percentage infill is the approximate infill of the sz signal as described in section 712 note that due to differences in average redshift and
spectral index of the act and madcows clusters the same
measured flux density at 14 ghz does not correspond to the
same percentage infill the act clusters show on average significantly more radio infill at 14 ghz than their madcows
analogues

orlowskischerer sz effect confirmation of madcows candidates using act

confusion limit of 25 mjy in both data sets we proceed to compute a spectral index  however in order to compute  one
requires more precise knowledge of the fluxweighted band center vlass for the wide bandwidth 24 ghz vlass data for
example if the measured flux density in vlass is lower than
the flux density one would find by assuming a fiducial spectral
index the resulting  is steeper and vlass will shift lower than
that initially assumed if the flux density is higher  is flatter and
vlass shifts higher this leads us to rely on a recursive or iterative
approach when estimating vlass and the resulting  assuming a
flat instrument passband from 24 ghz and emission of the form
s   c0  for c0 the amplitude and  the spectral index we
compute the fluxweighted band average as

note that we assume the passband to be flat for simplicity
for a given cluster with a measured radio flux density in both
the nvss and vlass surveys we first computed the spectral
index using the nominal vlass band center of 3 ghz6 using
that spectral index and equation 7 we computed a new vlass
band center we then calculated a new spectral index using this
band center and repeated the process until the difference between consecutive spectral indices was  01 the uncertainty
on the spectral index was computed from the fluxes s  and uncertainties  following for example zajaek et al 2019 as

the population of spectral indices and fluxes that was generated
in this manner was then used to correct the massrichness
scaling relation as described in section 62 for both the act
and madcows clusters we find a fairly broad distribution
of spectral indices computed between 14 and 3 ghz with
mean for the madcows candidates of hmadcows i  09 and
standard deviation   07 and mean for the act clusters of
hact i  12 and standard deviation   08 these mean
spectral indices are broadly consistent with values typically
found for radio agn coble et al 2007 sayers et al 2013
though we note our spectral index is also consistent with that
found for starforming regions typically   06 see calistro
rivera et al 2017 so we cannot conclude whether agn or star
formation dominates the observed radio spectra
similarly to section 52 we computed the bias in the measured sz signal due to radio infill of the act and madcows
clusters we computed the infill percentage twice once assuming our measured average spectral index of meas  091 and the
other assuming a typical radio spectra of typ  07 we refer to
the infill percentages assuming their respective spectral indices
as smeas and styp  respectively the high uncertainty on this number and strong dependence of the 98 and 150 ghz flux density
on  mean that the bias for a specific cluster can vary quite a bit
depending on its spectral index for example a 100 mjy source
at 14 ghz with a spectral index of 091 produces a decrement
of about 10 while one with a spectral index of 12 produces
only about 3 and one with a spectral index of 07 produces
6

here we define spectral index such that negative values for  show
the typical behavior of declining at higher frequencies ie the flux density s   0  

a 26 infill assuming m  2  1014 m  z  1 for the madcows clusters we continue to use the reference cluster with
m  2  1014 m  z  1 to compute the infill for the act
clusters we use their individual measured masses and redshifts
extrapolating flux density using spectral indices derived at 14
and 30 ghz out to 98 and 150 ghz can be risky not only due
to the uncertainty in the spectral index but also because it is not
assured that the index is consistent between those two frequency
ranges sayers et al 2013 found that spectral indices for radio
galaxies in large clusters were generally consistent when computed between 14 and 30 ghz and 30 and 140 ghz so that as
an estimate it is justified to use the measured spectral indices to
extrapolate our flux densities from 14 to 98 and 150 ghz for
precise determination of the radio infill multifrequency observations near 98 and 150 ghz will be required to determine the
effective spectral index of sources near the sz frequencies
the average infill for an act cluster is smeas  08  003
and styp  20  01 while for the madcows cluster candidates the average infill is smeas  045  005 and styp 
083  005 however while the average bias is quite low for
an appreciable number of the clusters the bias is nonnegligible
for the 95th percentile of act clusters smeas  70  05 and
styp  181 we note that of the nine madcows clusters with
20  05 5 had significant radio infill flux density  20 mjy
at 14 ghz including five of the top six with most negative 20 
suggesting that the significantly negative 20 measurements could
be due to radio infill for example one such cluster with very
negative 20  moo j22470507 has a flux density at 14 ghz of
160  1 mjy and   061  08 its measured  and z  102
assuming it has a mass of 2  1014 m  the bias at 98 ghz is
sj2247  70  17 where the uncertainties have been propagated
from the flux density uncertainty only
we emphasize that we have not included the effect of the
matched filter so the numbers presented above represent only an
approximation of the effect of the infill further since our radio
fluxes were computed using aperture photometry the measured
fluxes and spectral indices are averages for all compact sources
in the cluster high resolution multifrequency followup of
cluster candidates would be required to precisely remove this

fig 11 intrinsic radio luminosities at 14 ghz for act blue
3341 clusters and madcows orange 1780 clusters the red
line shows a 03 mjy flux density at 14 ghz in the observed
frame of reference converted to 14 ghz in the emitted frame of
reference for the given z according to equation 9 and assuming
a spectral index of 091 the choice of 03 mjy corresponds to
the variance of the background aperture flux density in the nvss
maps for a 120 radius aperture and thus roughly corresponds to
the noise floor for our background subtracted fluxes therefore
the red line should guide the eye as to which radio luminosities
are above the noise note that many clusters are not shown as
they have very low or negative values for their radio fluxes due
to subtraction of the background
the act clusters to the same redshift range as the madcows
07  z  15 raises the average luminosity of act clusters
to 65  07  1024 w hz1  suggesting that even accounting for
redshift the madcows clusters are on average more radio loud
than their act counterparts although the average redshift of the
act clusters after this restriction hzi  089 is still lower than
that of the madcows sample hzi  101

6 the sz massrichness scaling
given the results above we attempt to investigate the madcows massrichness scaling relation in doing so we hope to
understand if richness provides a good proxy for mass in the
madcows cluster catalog additionally we address whether
the preliminary massrichness scaling relation found in gonzalez et al 2019a is consistent with the scaling relation of the
entire madcows catalog and whether the full scaling relation
follows selfsimilarity
61 regression technique

we adopt a hierarchical bayesian approach that builds upon the
work of kelly 2007 and sereno 2016 to which we refer for a
thorough discussion of the fitting technique here we provide a
summary of key details central to our analysis
at each step of the modeling process and for each of the clusters within the considered sample we consider an independent
variable  drawn from a mixture of gaussian probability distributions kelly 2007 this corresponds to the true value of the
logarithm of the cluster richness ln  we therefore fit richness
article number page 12 of 25

as ln  which is related to the observed richness obs through a
poisson probability distribution pobs   pe 
in a similar manner to richness we fit the mass as ln m we
define the dependent quantity  as the true value of the logarithm
of the cluster mass ln m which we assume to be connected to
the independent variable  through a normal probability distribution p with mean
hi  p0  p1 

10

and variance corresponding to the intrinsic scatter of the true
quantities about the mean scaling relation given the definition
of the variables  and  our choice of probability distribution
is equivalent to using a lognormal model for describing the relation between the true mass and richness for a given cluster
following eg evrard et al 2014 and simet et al 2017 it is
hence possible to express the variance due to intrinsic scatter as
varln m  2int 

p21
 2ln m 


11

here the first term on the righthand side accounts for the contribution to the total scatter due to poisson noise on richness
while the second term describes the scatter inherent to the independent variable   ln m this is introduced to account for any
additional deviation from the reconstructed scaling that is not
accounted for in the observational uncertainties or intrinsic variable properties eg due to unknown biases in the considered
observables
in principle it should be possible to define a relation between the measured masses and the scattered dependent variable
 through a normal distribution centered on e and with variance
equal to the observational uncertainties on the measured mass

however figure 12 shows that multiple data points from the
compiled forced photometry catalog manifest negative values for
the central compton 20  corresponding to an unphysical negative
cluster mass in the case of lowmass clusters with sz signal
below the sensitivity threshold of the act maps noise fluctuations can cause this negative 20  however as discussed in previous sections radio sources as well as dust are found to contaminate the sz signal of the clusters leading to clusters with
significantly negative 20  further in section 51 we show that
miscentering effects may provide a significant suppression of the
measured central compton 20 with respect to the true value in
order to properly account for such contributions we compare the
true scattered quantities  to the central compton parameter 20
computed separately from the f090 and f150 maps in particular
we assume the joint probability distribution to be described by a
bivariate normal distribution

the first term on the right hand side is the product of the miscentering suppression factor c section 51 and the masstocompton 2 conversion m  in equation 5 of hilton et al
2021 all the factors entering equation 15 ie the relativistic
sz correction and the filter mismatch factor are computed from
the specific sets of cluster masses at each step of the modeling
process the terms in parentheses d dust  a  t rest  and
r radio  c0   provide the estimates of the level of dust and
radio infill at the considered frequency based on the respective
spectral properties discussed in section 52 and section 53 the
function g is the nonrelativistic spectral dependence of the sz
effect sunyaev  zeldovich 1970 mroczkowski et al 2019
which we adopt to convert the radio and dust surface brightness
values to units of compton 2 we note that in order to compute
the infill components as in equation 15 shown above we are
assuming the radio and dust sources to be described by pointlike
signals centered on the cluster centroids
finally we account for possible elements of the madcows
cluster sample which are not well described by a massrichness
scaling relation ie for which richness is not a good proxy
for mass by integrating the probability term described in equation 13 into a mixture model aimed at evaluating how likely
well each point is to be drawn from a gaussian centered on
the massrichness scaling relation versus a gaussian centered on
zero for each given point the total posterior probability distribution can then be written as
pobs  w  ptrue  1  w  pnoise 

16

where the weight w is the probability that a data point is drawn
by the massrichness scaling relation versus the noiselike population and ptrue  p2f090  2f150   radio  dust  is the joint probability distribution introduced in equation 14 for a data point that
follows the massrichness scaling relation we instead assume
the noiselike measurements to be drawn from pnoise  for which
we assume a normal distribution centered around zero and with
standard deviation equal to the observational uncertainty associated with the c value of the considered measurement

parameters of the scaling relation except for the slope p1  for
which we consider a studentt distribution with one degree of
freedom following andreon  hurn 2010 and sereno 2016
as the studentt does not bias the slope to high values we then
assume the probability weight w to be distributed uniformly in
the range 0 1
the suppression factor due to miscentering for each of the
considered clusters is modeled as a truncated normal distribution bound between
p 0 and 1 with mode equal to 1 and standard

prefactor 2 is introduced so that the mean of the prior distribution equals the average suppression c0  c1 e for a given true
richness e  
for the clusters with a clear identification of radio sources
in the nvss and vlass fields we employ normal priors on
the estimated normalization c0 and spectral index  parameters
with mean and standard deviation set to the values derived for the
specific cluster otherwise we draw for each cluster a realization
of c0 from an exponential distribution with mean equal to the
average flux density measured from all the sources in the nvss
catalog an analogous approach is considered for  but used a
normal prior with mean and standard deviations measured from
the distribution of spectral indices estimated in section 53
instead of introducing priors on the single parameters of the
dust spectrum section 52 which would have neglected information on their degeneracy we reanalyze the act 224 ghz
and herschel stacked measurements jointly with the mass and
richness data for full consistency we consider exactly the same
priors employed in section 52

64 cluster weights

from the results of the massrichness fit including the probability term it is clear that an appreciable fraction of the madcows candidates are not well described by the massrichness
scaling relation figure 13 in other words for a large subset of
the madcows catalog richness is not a good proxy for mass
of the 965 candidates used in the fitting only 419 had a weight
greater than 50 only 131 have a weight greater than 65 the
mean weight is 502 since we do not have an estimate of the
uncertainties on individual weights we do not place an uncertainty on these statistics moreover while the mean does not
fully encapsulate the bimodal distribution of the cluster probabilities it does indicate that the madcows sample is likely
comprised largely of cluster candidates which are well below
the sz detection limit of the act survey examining the distribution of the probabilities we see a clearly bimodal distribution figure 13 one population containing the majority of the
clusters is roughly normally distributed centered on a probability of  50 the other is centered at a higher probability of
 70 with a much narrower distribution in general clusters
with high significance 20  and richness are given higher probabilities while those with lower 20  and specifically high richness
and low 20  are given lower probabilities further examining figure 13 it is evident that the madcows sample is well described
by a massrichness scaling relation above 15  55 with 50
of such clusters having a weight w  07 and an average weight
for clusters above that richness of 063 additionally all the
high weight w  70 clusters have 15  27 interestingly examining the probabilities of individual cluster candidates reveals
that the fitter identifies a number of the very negative 20 clusters
seen in the right hand panel of figure 12 as having high weight
these clusters have significant  25 mjy flux density at 14 or
30 ghz

63 scaling relation results

in figure 12 we show the massrichness scaling relation reconstructed from the actmadcows sample as the selection of
the clusters is unbiased with respect to the eddington bias we
consider here the cluster masses without any correction for the
steepness of the halo mass function we note that in this case
the reported masses represent an upper limit for the actual distribution as the correction would deboost the highmass end of
the sample
for the model including the weight parameter from equation 16 we find that the best fit slope to be   184015
014  where
m  15  this slope is consistent with gonzalez et al 2019a
although with an overall offset towards lower masses setting
all the weights to unity that is assuming all clusters are drawn
from the massrichness scaling relation leads to a slightly higher
slope estimate 195017
016  as well as a greater overall offset as
compared to gonzalez et al 2019a
regarding the intrinsic scatter of the forced photometry data
points see equation 11 and related description we estimate
ln m  021008
011 when including the weight parameter of equation 16 to account for sample contamination although already
evident from the distribution of the act data points in the massrichness distribution in relation to the scaling relation by gonzalez et al 2019a such a large scatter provides a quantitative
view of the limited capabilities of the madcows richness to
provide a robust proxy for cluster masses a similar scatter of
031003
003 is found even when removing the negative compton 20
measurements from the fit

7 discussion
71 population differences

the madcows sample comprises 2839 candidate highz clusters while the act dr5 sample comprises a nearly masslimited opticallyconfirmed sample of 4195 clusters from across
all redshifts as noted in section 3 our crossmatching criteria
leads to a catalog of 96 codetected clusters at the intersection of
the act and madcows samples reported in table c1
we compared both richness and m500 measurements at different redshift ranges between the act and madcows populations in figure 14 we plot the distribution of codetections and
madcows across four redshift ranges we can see that there
is no preferred redshift for the codetected clusters with high
richness figure 15 shows that act clusters are mostly found
at z  09 regardless of mass we also see that madcows clusters as a whole tend to be lower in richness and hence mass
than codetected clusters but are found more frequently at higher
redshifts than act clusters this is not unexpected as the lower
average mass of clusters at higher redshifts means that they are
detected relatively less frequently the madcows masses are
from forced photometry and we have cut off clusters with 20
 0
the low rate by act of codetections of madcows cluster
candidates is due to the low sz signal of many of those candidates which is reflected in their correspondingly low weight we
discuss possible sources of this low weight in section 731 as
for the low rate by madcows of codetections of act clus

fig 14 comparisons of richness populations for the codetected

at higher richness 15  60 there is no preferred redshift for
the codetections this indicates that the disparity between the
number of madcows in the act region and the number of codetections is not a product of survey biases
ters it is likely that the madcows catalog is missing them simply due to the madcows selection function by construction
the madcows selection function does not precisely trace the

first selected from smoothed galaxy density maps created using

fig 15 m500 of act clusters vs madcows in the same redshift ranges these distributions suggest that act clusters are
skewed towards lower redshifts while the madcows distribution is even across higher redshifts in addition madcows clusters tend to be less massive than act clusters at a given redshift
ited meaning that even under the assumption of some relation
between mass and richness the madcows cluster catalog cannot strictly be masslimited in any case the madcows cluster
catalog while astrophysically interesting should be approached
with caution for computing cosmological parameters
711 ir and dusty emission

the herschel data in combination with the act 224 ghz data
suggest that the act and madcows cluster catalogs comprise
clusters with different properties and are potentially drawn from
different populations one dustier population is preferentially
sampled by the madcows survey and the other more virialized is preferentially sampled by act as described below as
was discussed in section 52 the stacked hatlas data on
madcows clusters show a clear signal in each frequency band
whereas there is no obvious signal when stacking on the act
clusters see figure 16 in addition to the stacked emission we
also considered the emission for individual clusters for each
cluster in the hatlas footprint in each of the act 34 clusters in the hatlas footprint madcows 66 clusters and
randoms 66 clusters catalog see section 52 we calculated
emission within 120 radius of the cluster location at each of 250
350 and 500 m a histogram of those values is shown in figure 8
a twosample kolmogorovsmirnov ks test was applied
to determine whether the central emission of act and madcows data sets was consistent with the central emission at random points and with each other at all herschel frequencies the
distribution of madcows cluster central emissions is statistically inconsistent with that of the randomly offset central emissions and with that of the act clusters the distribution of act
cluster central emissions is statistically consistent with the randomly offset central emissions at 500 m while it is inconsistent
at a pvalue of 0018 and 0016 at 250 and 350 m respectively
the average central emission of the madcows cluster samples
is more than one standard deviation higher than the average central emission of the randomly offset clusters at all frequencies
for the act clusters at all wavelengths the central emission is
statistically consistent with the randomly offset clusters as evidenced by the goodnessoffit of the graybody model as shown

in section 52 we attribute this emission to the madcows clusters being dustier on average than the act clusters and identify
two causes for this effect firstly in general clusters at high redshift have a greater proportion of blue galaxies in their cores than
those at low redshift butcher  oemler 1978 dressler 1980
brodwin et al 2013 as blue galaxies tend to be dustier casey
et al 2014 and the mean redshift of the act clusters is lower
than that of the madcows  05 vs  101 the madcows
clusters should be dustier on average secondly at a given redshift act preferentially finds clusters that contain more virialized gas as virialized gas contributes most strongly to the integrated sz effect signal motl et al 2005 poole et al 2006 2007
wik et al 2008 krause et al 2012
712 radio emission

the radio data provides additional evidence that the act and
madcows cluster catalogs preferentially sample from two difarticle number page 16 of 25

ferent populations as discussed in section 53 the madcows
clusters have higher intrinsic radio luminosity at 14 ghz as
compared to the act clusters even when the act clusters are
restricted to the same redshift range as the madcows candidates moreover performing a twosample ks test on the act
and madcows radio fluxes at 14 ghz confirms that they are
drawn from different populations to compare the populations
we first cut the act catalog to the same redshift range as the
madcows catalog 07  z  15 we then restricted both cluster catalogs to an intrinsic luminosity corresponding to the standard deviation of the background aperture fluxes 03 mjy using equation 9 which roughly represents the noise floor for our
background subtracted fluxes since the fluxes for both catalogs
are taken from the same survey they should have on average
the same noise properties so that if the non detections are not
removed they will bias the ks test towards high pvalues ie
towards determining that the two samples were drawn from the
same underlying population when we perform the twosample

finally we briefly consider the richness evolution of radio
luminosity fraction following mo et al 2020 we define a
cluster to be radio loud if the intrinsic luminosity associated with
the cluster is l14 ghz  1025 w hz1  and the radio loud fraction
rlf as the fraction of total clusters that are radio loud for
simplicity we continue to use our 120 radial aperture which corresponds to about 530 to 625 kpc compared to 500kpc used in
mo et al 2020 the effect of this will generally be to raise the
rlf as field radio sources are associated to clusters when they
lie along the lineofsight of that cluster which will in turn flatten the richnessrlf relation we binned the cluster radio luminosities into 8 bins of richness and calculated the rlf in those
bins with the uncertainties calculated via bootstrapping we fit
the resulting data to a linear model using a maximum likelihood

ks test on the act and madcows catalogs with the flux density cut we obtain pvalue of 0025 which suggests that the
madcows and act clusters with radio sources represent different underlying populations the above analysis ignores what
proportion of clusters host radio sources we also consider the
intrinsic luminosities of the act and madcows clusters we
simply consider the percentage of clusters still restricted to
07  z  15 which have intrinsic luminosities greater than the
reference aperture flux density 03 mjy converted to luminosity
as described above we used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainties on this number which is 672  17 for the act
catalog and 586  10 for the madcows catalog
in summary this analysis suggests that restricting the act
catalog optical photoredshifts to match those of the madcows
clusters the act clusters host radio sources slightly more frequently than the madcows clusters while the radio sources
hosted by the madcows clusters are stronger by a factor of
 2 we again note that the mean redshift of the act clusters
is still somewhat lower than that of the madcows z  089 vs
z  101 further any contamination of the madcows catalog section 64 would in principle bias both the number density of radio sources and accordingly also the average inferred
intrinsic luminosity to lower values as radio sources are preferentially found in clusters as opposed to the field coble et al
2007 assuming an unrealistically high contamination of 10
to set an upper bound on the percentage of clusters with contamination and that contaminating candidates have radio sources at
the rate of the field which we take to be 10 the rate of the true
candidates we calculate the corrected percentage of madcows
clusters with aperture flux density  03 mjy as

fig 17 best fit of a linear model to the radio loud fraction rlf
of the madcows clusters determined using nvss 14 ghz
fluxes section 53 vs richness the best fit is inconsistent with
the null hypothesis of no evolution of the rlf with richness
at 59 in comparison to mo et al 2020 we favor a higher
slope for the relation at 12 although see the discussion in section 712
is at a low level in both cases the samples include high infill
tails for example 94 act clusters show radio emission consistent with a greater than 5 bias interestingly that number of
clusters 28 of the 3 335 act clusters with nvss fluxes is
consistent with the best fit differential source counts near clusters found in coble et al 2007 25 of course the level
of infill of the act identified clusters is a biased measure of
the true infill as clusters with less infill are more likely to meet
the act detection threshold for a given intrinsic mass 20  for
example gupta et al 2017 estimated that 05 and 14 of
clusters with mass 3  1014 m at redshift of 025 had their sz
signal completely suppressed by infill at 150 and 98 ghz respectively moreover accurately computing the infill correction
is difficult propagating the flux density from lower frequencies
means accepting the uncertainty of extrapolating the spectral index across wide frequency ranges while cmb measurements at
90 and 150 ghz frequently lack the spacial resolution to distinguish point sources in clusters from the sz signal of that cluster
high resolution measurements of the point source flux densities
at or near 90 and 150 ghz offer the best path forward dicker
et al in prep undertook such a measurement using the mustang2 instrument dicker et al 2014 on the 100meter green
bank telescope to perform 900 resolution imaging of the sz effect for a sample of galaxy clusters this high resolution also
allowed them to identify compact sources in the clusters which
would not be resolved by act and to measure their flux density contributions at 90 ghz in order to assess the impact on sz
measurements they found a similar distribution of infill with
85 of clusters showing a change in the integrated sz flux less
than 5 but 10 of the sample had very high  10 infill
further the level of dust infill of the madcows cluster candidates may be biasing their measured sz signal from the model
we developed in section 52 we predict that the average dust infill of the sz signal is 15  05 this result is limited by the
limited ir followup available for the madcows cluster candidates with herschel data for only 66 candidates while the
distribution of the 66 candidates appears normal we do not have
enough data to rule out deviations from that distribution eg a
article number page 17 of 25

aa proofs manuscript no madcows

high flux density tail while the effect is subdominant to other
sources of uncertainty in this work future large optical and ir
surveys eg the vera c rubin observatory ivezi et al 2019
and the euclid telescope euclid collaboration et al 2020 as
well as next generation cmb experiments which aim to place
subpercent constraints on cosmology from cluster abundance
counts will need to use methods that either address or are insensitive to this infill in the near term higher resolution measurements both of the point source flux densities and of their
spectral indices in the frequency ranges of interest using eg
mustang2 nika2 toltec and atacama large millimeter
array alma would enable improved constraints on the infill
of the sz signal by submm and radio sources
73 massrichness scaling

as noted in section 63 our massrichness scaling relation differs significantly from selfsimilarity although it is consistent
with the previous measurement from gonzalez et al 2019a we
identify several issues which may bias the massrichness scaling relation to higher slopes firstly at low richness a portion of
the madcows sample is not well described by a massrichness
scaling relation if some number of low richness candidates are
either unvirilialized systems with low sz signal or lineofsight
chance superpositions with no intrinsic sz signal then the effect
would be to bias the massrichness relation to higher slopes as
these candidates would tilt the lower end of the relation downward see section 63 in a similar vein if the richness measure is systematically biased to higher values due to lineofsight
interlopers then the effect would also be to steepen the massrichness relation this effect would be especially apparent as a
constant bias in richness is a larger relative effect at lower values for the richness again having the effect of tilting the scaling
relation slope to steeper values
we also assessed the impact of infill from submm and radio sources on the massrichness scaling relation as discussed
in section 52 we did not have enough herschel submm data to
infer if infill scales with richness or mass therefore it is possible that the proportionate infill of the sz signal is higher at low
richness than at high richness we do however have 224 ghz
data of many madcows clusters which was used to quantify
the submmmm source infill we binned the madcows clusters in richness and stacked the f220 maps in these bins there
was no trend with richness in the 224 ghz emission which suggests that the level of submmmm source infill is not strongly
correlated with richness
finally the higher ir emission of the madcows cluster
candidates is consistent with a graybody dusty emission profile
and in general correlates with higher star formation rates sfr
see eg devlin et al 2009these high sfr clusters may deviate from selfsimilarity and as such we would not a priori expect
the slope of the massrichness scaling relation to be unity
731 weights

as discussed in section 64 the weights for the madcows candidates are split into two populations with a few high weight
clusters 73 with weight  07 and a large number 544 of candidates with low weights  05 the high weight clusters are
well characterized by a massrichness scaling relation the low
weight clusters are not at very low richness 15  20 some of
these candidates may be structures smaller than clusters such as
groups or lineofsight superpositions
article number page 18 of 25

additionally at higher richness low weight candidates may
be mergers or premergers or otherwise unvirialized but massive systems unvirialized gas in these mergers has been shown
to suppress the sz signal from these clusters both in simulations
 eg wik et al 2008 battaglia et al 2012 nelson et al 2014
and observations eg hilton et al 2018 while the merger can
briefly enhance the sz signal the period during which it suppresses it is in general longer than that in which it enhances
it during the merger process the sz signal in a merging system can be suppressed  40 dicker et al 2020 compared
to a virialized cluster of the same total mass this has the effect of making the observed sz mass of the candidate less consistent with the massrichness scaling relation and more consistent with noise ie the effect is to reduce the weight of the
cluster in dicker et al 2020 which reports on sz followup
of high richness madcows candidates  25 of the madcows clusters observed were determined to be mergers this ratio is significantly affected by malmquist bias however as nonmergers have higher sz brightness than merging systems further dicker et al 2020 clusters are generally higher richness
systems 15  50 and it is not clear how the fraction of systems
that are undergoing a merger or are premerger changes with
richness targeted follow up is warranted to investigate further
additionally stacked measurements of the weak lensing of the
cmb in the vein of madhavacheril et al 2020 are indifferent
to clusters that are undergoing mergers as such comparing the
lensing inferred masses of low and high weight clusters would
allow one to put constraints on the fraction of low weight clusters
that are undergoing mergers similarly the agreement between
the average mass of the madcows cluster sample above richness of 20 as determined using the massrichness scaling relation
derived in this paper and in madhavacheril et al 2020 suggests
that mergers and premergers do not dominate the madcows
cluster sample
it is also possible that some fraction of the madcows clusters have very low fractional gas mass and as such are undetectable via the sz effect such clusters have occasionally been
reported in the literature see castellano et al 2011 andreon 
moretti 2011 trejoalonso et al 2014 with xray luminosities about 1020 times lower than would be expected for their
masses castellano et al 2011 however low gasfraction is
not the only explanation for their low xray luminosity instead
these clusters may be embedded in filaments aligned with our
lineofsight and galaxies situated along that lineofsight could
be contaminating the measurements which was the case for the
underluminous cluster in castellano et al 2011 such a scenario was proposed in bower et al 1997 and favored by more
recent evidence giles et al 2015 even if such low gas mass
fraction clusters do exist the relative fraction of these clusters is
likely low andreon  moretti 2011 reports only about 11 of
their sample were xray underluminous the redshift range of
andreon  moretti 2011 01  z  03 is far from that of this
work and moreover the fraction of underluminous clusters is of
course sensitive to the selection function of the larger sample
so andreon  moretti 2011 may not be directly comparable
to our work however andreon  moretti 2011 does suggest
that the issue of sz nondetections of madcows clusters can
not be entirely resolved by a large population of gaspoor or
low gas mass clusters ge et al 2019 also found evidence that
the number of xray underluminous clusters is not significant at
high richness although again their redshift range 01  z  03
is significantly lower than that of the madcows sample
finally at low richnesses chance superpositions of galaxies
may be causing spurious detections such spurious objects are

orlowskischerer sz effect confirmation of madcows candidates using act

hard to differentiate from low mass groups in this analysis in any
case caution must be exercised when using the low weight clusters for cosmology inaccurate cluster masses from both spurious
clusters and clusters with low sz signal for their mass either due
to merger history lowgas fraction or unvirialized components
along the lineofsight will bias cosmological parameters

8 conclusions
in this work we identified codetections of the act and madcows cluster catalogs we note the very low rate of codetections both with respect to the size of the act and the madcows cluster catalogs we used forced photometry to evaluate the massrichness scaling relation of the madcows cluster
catalog we quantified infill of the sample by radio and submm emission we find that the best fit scaling relation has slope
184015
014  higher than the unitary value one would expect for selfsimilar clusters andreon  hurn 2010 but comparable to the
preliminary work of gonzalez et al 2019a we offer some possible reasons for this deviation in section 73 these include
potentially a bias in the richness measure and some amount
of sample impurity with respect to mass instead of mass the
madcows selection function may preferentially include starforming systems leading to deviations from selfsimilarity as
part of the massrichness scaling relation we fit a weight to
each cluster which describes the relative probability that the
sz measurement associated with that cluster was drawn from
a normal distribution centered on the massrichness scaling relation vs a normal distribution centered on zero we found that a
large fraction of the madcows cluster candidates had weights
lower than 50 we ascribe the low weight of these clusters and
correspondingly their nondetection in the act cluster catalog
to a variety of factors including suppression of the sz signal
by merger history and other unvirialized components along the
lineofsight as well as to the madcows catalog containing
very small clusters with sz signals too low to detect as for the
madcows nondetections of act clusters we conclude that
the madcows selection function is not mass limited and thus
the overlap of the madcows catalog with a catalog like act
can be very incomplete
additionally by investigating their submm and radio properties we find evidence that the madcows candidates have
higher average submm flux density and higher average intrinsic radio luminosity than their act counterparts even when the
act clusters are restricted to the same redshift range as the
madcows cluster candidates although the madcows clusters
do have lower average radio flux density in the observed frame
of reference so that the act clusters have high radio infill on
average we interpret this as the systems selected by madcows
being on average dustier while act clusters are less dusty and
radio loud we find no evidence that the submm flux density of
madcows clusters evolves with richness although due to the
paucity of herschel data this is only based on 220 ghz stacks
we find that the rlf of the madcows clusters does increase
with increasing richness and we find that the relation agrees with
prior studies mo et al 2020
looking to the future the next generation of madcows
madcows2 will use the deeper catwise2020 eisenhardt
et al 2020 wise photometry in combination with deeper optical imaging madcows2 is designed to extend from z  05  2
with an improved selection function at all redshifts more indepth studies of the radio and submm properties of the madcows clusters in the short term will allow us to better understand the population differences between ir and sz selected

clusters and will allow us to better correct the massrichness
scaling relations continuing act operations and further data
releases will increase the depth of sz observations allowing the
survey to probe to lower masses and over larger regions
looking further in the first half of the decade data from simons observatory so zhu et al 2021 the simons observatory collaboration et al 2019 ade et al 2019 and the cmbs4
experiment abitbol et al 2017 abazajian et al 2016 2019 and
the cerro chajnantor atacama telescopeprime ccatprime
vavagiakis et al 2018 aravena et al 2019 choi et al 2020
will provide deeper and higher resolution sz and submm maps
over a larger portion of the sky additionally the vera c rubin
observatory ivezi et al 2019 spectrophotometer for the history of the universe epoch of reionization and ices explorer
spherex bock  spherex science team 2018 cooray
 spherex science team 2018 crill et al 2020 and euclid

in the 2030s the next generation cmbs4 experiment
abazajian et al 2016 abitbol et al 2017 cmbhd experiment sehgal et al 2019 2020 and the atacama large aperture submillimeter telescope atlast klaassen et al 2020
will potentially provide orders of magnitude increases in sz map
depth over significant fractions of the extragalactic sky with the
latter two providing a transformative leap in subarcminute resolution sz and submm studies at a significantly lower confusion

appendix a bootstrapping
throughout the paper we are presented with a situation in which
we have a data set d which we are interested in computing some
statistic on and for which we would like to estimate the uncertainty in that statistic we use the boostrapping method to do
so given d we resample from that data set with replacement k
times resulting in a superset of data sets d1  di  dk  where
the di are the resampled data sets for each di  we compute a
statistic on di  which we will call i  generally the mean or in
the case where the data are maps the central emission we then
have a set of statistics   1  i  k  we then take the average and standard deviation of  as the average and standard
deviation of that statistic on d

notes a di mascolo et al 2020 b gonzalez et al 2019a c dicker et al 2020 a full treatment of the uncertainty is available in the publication
d
the nika2 measurement as reported in ruppin et al 2020 relied on a strong informative prior on the integrated sz signal from carma
gonzalez et al 2019a and hence should likely not be regarded as an independent constraint we include it for completeness and note they
include a large 56 systematic uncertainty all three surveys assumed the arnaud et al 2010 scaling relation
