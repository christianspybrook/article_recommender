abstract the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has an anomalous number of globular clusters five for its stellar mass there is a longstanding debate about a potential sixth globular cluster fornax 6 that has recently been rediscovered in decam imaging we present new magellanm2fs spectroscopy of the fornax 6 cluster and fornax dsph combined with literature data we identify 15 17 members of the fornax 6 cluster that this overdensity is indeed a star cluster and associated with the fornax dsph the cluster is significantly more metalrich mean metallicity of feh 071 005 than the other five fornax globular clusters 25 f eh 14 and more metalrich than the bulk of fornax we measure a velocity dispersion of 5620 corresponding to anomalously 16 km s high masstolight of 15ml258 at 90 confidence when calculated assuming equilibrium two stars inflate this dispersion and may be either fornax field stars or as yet unresolved binary stars alternatively the fornax 6 cluster may be undergoing tidal disruption based on its metalrich nature the fornax 6 cluster is likely younger than the other fornax clusters with an estimated age of 2 gyr when compared to stellar isochrones the chemodynamics and star formation history of fornax shows imprints of major events such as infall into the milky way multiple pericenter passages star formation bursts andor potential mergers or interactions any of these events may have triggered the formation of the fornax 6 cluster keywords dwarf spheroidal galaxies globular star clusters 1 introduction the fornax dsph hereafter fornax is the fourth most massive satellite galaxy of the milky way in terms of stellar mass it has an extended star formation history with major star formation at old ages 10 gyr ago a subsequent burst at 46 gyr and recent intermittent episodes rusakov et al 2021 the chemodycorresponding author andrew b pace apaceandrewcmuedu this paper presents data gathered with the magellan telescopes at las campanas observatory chile namics of redgiant branch stars show that a relatively metalrich stellar population is centrally concentrated and kinematically cold and a metalpoor population is more spatially extended and dynamically hot battaglia et al 2006 walker pearrubia 2011 there is evidence for mergers in the kinematics and spatial distribution amorisco evans 2012 del pino et al 2017 fornax is unusual in its large number of globular clusters gc and mass in gcs compared to other galaxies of similar stellar mass m 2 107 m huang  koposov 2021 in particular the relation between number of gcs and dwarf galaxy host mass becomes stochastic for galaxies slightly larger than fornax eg ab pace et al forbes et al 2018 there are 5 bright gcs in fornax that have received significant study of their structural profiles mackey gilmore 2003 chemistry and metallicity strader et al 2003 hendricks et al 2016 and ages de boer fraser 2016 a sixth fornax gc was first noted by shapley 1939 however subsequent studies debated its nature and whether it was composed of stars or background galaxies verner et al 1981 demers et al 1994 stetson et al 1998 and it fell out of the literature for some time recent decam imaging and gaia astrometric data have shown that the fornax 6 gc f6 is clearly resolved into an overdensity of stars wang et al 2019a besides the large number of gcs in fornax their survival and lack of sinking to the center of fornax is an open question that has implications for the dark matter halo of fornax if the fornax gcs formed at their current positions they would sink to the center of fornax in several gyr from dynamical fiction in a cuspy dark matter halo goerdt et al 2006 in contrast if fornax has a cored dark matter halo the sinking time increases to 10 gyr there is other evidence from the chemodynamics and multiple stellar populations that suggests that fornax contains a cored dark matter halo walker  pearrubia 2011 amorisco et al 2013 however the unknown formation location of the gcs can relax constraints on the underlying dark matter halo and cuspy solutions are not excluded shao et al 2020 the peculiar radial distribution of the gcs may be evidence for a dwarfdwarf merger in fornax leung et al 2020 here we present magellanm2fs spectroscopy that confirms that the f6 globular cluster is a coherent stellar structure distinct from the fornax dsph and whose kinematics and chemistry we measure in section 2 we present our observations and auxiliary data and also present our velocity and metallicity measurements with the magellanm2fs spectroscopy in section 3 we discuss fornax membership the membership kinematics and metallicity of f6 and discuss the nature of f6 and compare it to other gcs in section 4 we conclude and summarize our results 2 data 21 m2fs spectroscopy we present results from new spectroscopic observations of fornax stars that we obtained using the michiganmagellan fiber system m2fs mateo et al 2012 at the 65m magellanclay telescope at las campanas observatory chile m2fs is a dualchannel multiobject echelle spectrograph that offers various options for spectral resolution and wavelength coverage and is fed by up to 256 fibers that can be deployed over a field figure 1 legacy survey sky viewer false color grz coadded image of 80 by 80 centered on the fornax 6 cluster the green circled stars are spectroscopic members of the fornax 6 cluster identified in this work of diameter 05 we used a configuration that covered the approximate range 5130 5190 at resolution r 24 000 211 target selection we used photometry from the dark energy survey year 1 des collaboration et al 2018 combined with astrometry from gaia dr2 gaia collaboration et al 2018a to select red giant branch rgb candidates along the line of sight to fornax in figure 1 we show a 80 by 80 false color grz coadded image centered on the f6 cluster made with the legacy survey sky viewer1 dey et al 2019 the f6 members identified in this work are denoted with green circles see section 32 we considered a given star to be an rgb candidate if its rband magnitude and g r color both corrected for extinction using the dust maps of schlegel et al 1998 with extinction coefficients from des collaboration et al 2018 placed it within magnitudes of an old age 12 gyr metalpoor feh15 theoretical isochrone computed using the parsec package bressan et al 2012 we adopted a tolerance of 022 gr where gr is the colors observational error we then filtered these rgb candidates according to the parallax httpswwwlegacysurveyorgviewer magellanm2fs spectroscopy of fornax 6 measured by gaia discarding those with nonzero parallax detected at 3 significance for the remaining rgb candidates we assigned targeting priority based on proximity of the gaiaobserved proper motion to the fornax mean reported by the gaia collaboration et al 2018b 0376 0413 in units of mas yr1 specifically we awarded points to stars according to the following 5 points for having proper motion within 12 km s1 fornaxs lineofsight velocity dispersion of fornaxs mean assuming distance 150 kpc plus three two one additional points if the proper motion is within one three five times the stars proper motion uncertainty from fornaxs mean proper motion when allocating fibers within a given m2fs field we randomly selected amongst the rgb candidates having the largest available point total up to a maximum of 232 targets leaving up to 24 fibers to observe regions of blank sky for the purpose of background subtraction 212 observations and data reduction between the years 2018 and 2020 we observed 8 fornax fields with m2fs table 1 lists central coordinates which coincide with the location of a bright star used for wavefront sensing for each field along with the date of observation total exposure time number of targeted stars and number of stars with successful measurements four fields targeted the f6 cluster and surrounding fornax dsph and four targeted the outskirts of the galaxy we process all m2fs spectra using a custombuilt pythonbased pipeline that where applicable incorporates modules that are publicly available as part of the astropy software package astropy collaboration et al 2013 2018 complete details will be provided by walker et al in preparation briefly we use standard procedures to perform overscan bias dark current and gain corrections we identify and trace the 2d aperture corresponding to each spectrum and then extract the onedimensional spectra by taking the weighted averages of pixel counts along the direction approximately orthogonal to the dispersion axis we use spectra acquired during twilight to perform flatfield and wavelengthdependent throughput corrections and we use spectra of a thoriumargonneon arc lamp acquired before and after each science exposure to perform wavelength calibration we propagate the variance in each pixel through all processing steps following the procedure of walker et al 2015ba 2016 we model each spectrum using a library of synthetic templates that cover a grid with dimensions of effective temperature teff surface gravity log g and feh metallicity in addition to these stellar atmospheric parameters we also obtain estimates of the lineofsight velocity vlos after imposing a quality control filter that requires median signaltonoise ratio sn 0 sky oversubtraction can result in unphysically negative sn and velocity error v 5 km s1 the m2fs sample includes 980 observations of 804 unique fornax stars the resulting m2fs catalog for fornax is listed in table 2 22 systematic errors in order to determine systematic errors for the velocities and metallicities determined from m2fs spectra we use repeat measurements of all stars observed with m2fs using the same instrument configuration as for fornax walker et al in preparation will provide the complete catalog resulting from these observations the targets are primarily dsphs but also include several globular clusters overall there are 14437 pairs and 5646 pairs where both measurement passes our quality cuts we model the pairwise velocity differences as a mixture of a gaussian with an outlier model section 41 of li et al 2019 the final uncertainty is treated as a systematic error plus a scaling parame2 ter vcalib systematic kv vobs where vobs is taken from the previous section for the velocity and metallicity systematic errors we find kv 095 002 v systematic 059 002 km s1 kfeh 108 003 and feh systematic 004 001 we adopt the median values for our analysis 23 additional data we use photometric and astrometric data from the gaia edr3 catalog gaia collaboration et al 2020 we only utilize astrometric data that passed the following cuts ruwe 14 lindegren et al 2020 and c 3c g riello et al 2020 we include additional magellanmmfs spectroscopic data from walker et al 2009a which increases the number of fornax members by 2400 stars this data is ideal improving the fornax dsph velocity distribution near f6 to assist with the separation between the dsph and f6 stars 24 final spectroscopic sample in order to combine the mmfs and m2fs samples we must correct for zero point velocity shifts and verify that the velocity errors of the two samples are not biased relative to one another finding a small velocity offset between two different catalogs is not uncommon given different instruments and methodology for velocity measurements furthermore previous analysis has concluded that the errors in the fornax mmfs data set are underestimated minor 2013 there are 4113 velocity

scaling the errors by a factor of 1355 to the mmfs data we find v 0 and v 1 km s1 out increase in error of the mmfs fornax velocities by a factor of 1355 is similar to the correction applied by minor 2013 to determine the systematic velocity and error of stars with multiple measurements we fit the multiepoch data with a normal distribution with a free mean and dispersion parameter the mean parameter and statistics on its posterior distribution are used for combined velocity measurement we use the median and the 84 16 confidence intervals for the measurement and error respec tively this process will account for stars with evidence of velocity variation as the mean will have a larger error than the individual measurements representing our ignorance of where it has been observed in its period in the case of binaries we have compared this to other common methods for combined velocity measurements such as computing the weighted mean velocity and either the variance of the weighted mean or standard deviation of the mean velocity for the measurement error 2 12 the variance of the weighted mean i vi  underestimates the measurement error if there is velocity variability in this manner our combined measurements are more robust to velocity variation many mw stars can be immediately identified with gaia edr3 astrometry eg pace li 2019 in particular stars with nonzero parallax 4

fornax dsph and f6 stars the first is a mixture model between the mw and the fornax system section 31 it is clear from figure 2 that the f6 radial velocity does not have a large offset relative to the

3 show evidence for chemodynamical subpopulations in fornax the metalrich component is more centrally concentrated and kinematically colder whereas the metalpoor component is more extended and kinematically hot this has been previously observed in fornax eg battaglia et al 2006 walker pearrubia 2011 and will be explored further in furture works our proper motion measurements agrees within errors with mcconnachie venn 2020 but is discrepant with vitral 2021 both of which are based on gaia edr3 proper motions our results differ within the statistical errors to previous gaia dr2 measurements gaia collaboration et al 2018b fritz et al 2018 with the offset likely due to proper motion zeropoint systematic errors in the dr2 catalog these systematic errors have decreased by at

v 50912 08 km s and if we exclude both we find v 51709 km s v 2709  the exclusion of these two stars 06 km s then changes the kinematics by v 03 20 km s1 and v 17 30 km s1 when star1 is excluded it is a 32 outlier 44 when both star1 and star2 are excluded from fornax 6 and sigmaclipping algorithms typically exclude stars at greater than 258 3 when both star1 and star2 are excluded star2 is a 29 outlier right on the boundary for inclusionexclusion from the kinematics for both stars their spatial position and metallicity favor their membership in f6 however their velocities are either inconsistent star1 or only marginally consistent star2 while we did not use the tef f or log g in our membership model we have verified that all f6 members including star1 and star2 are consistent with being on the redgiant branch due to the nonuniform spatial sampling of the spectroscopy we explore an additional mixture model instead of modeling the entirety of the fornax dsph member we limit our modeling to a localized sample of stars near the fornax 6 cluster specifically r 10 rhfor6 in this mixture model we consider the spatial distribution of the fornax members to be approximately constant within this small region with this model we find the properties of f6 to be 008 v 52109 27 v 2322 feh 071009 and 016 feh 007005 in this case the velocity dispersion is not fully resolved and contains a tail in the posterior that extends to zero we find a total membership of  102 in the cluster with 10 and 4 stars having membership larger than 05 and 09 respectively in this model both star1 and star2 are considered fornax dsph members instead of f6 members with both models we find feh 07 and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion the velocity dispersions disagree due to the membership of the outlier stars including or excluding these stars changes the velocity dispersion and inferred masstolight ratio but the not the mean metallicity if these stars are members it is possible that they are binary stars and have inflated the velocity disper ab pace et al 33 permutation tests to assess the significance of the detection of the f6 cluster and its properties relative to the fornax dsph feh sion similar cases of inflated velocity dispersion have been seen in the botes ii and triangulum ii ultrafaint dwarf galaxies koch et al 2009 ji et al 2016 kirby et al 2015 2017 in both cases small sample sizes and single epoch data led to inflated results unfortunately we only have one epoch for both star1 and star2 one of the main differences between the two f6 mixture models is how the fornax spatial density is modeled this difference results in 5 7 fewer stars considered members this change in modelprior is effectively a different manner to account for the spectroscopic selection function which is difficult to model and characterize we estimate the dynamical mass of f6 using the mass estimator m 18rh 35 18rh los g1 from errani et al 2018 with v 5616 km s1 this gives m 18rh 5226  105 m and dynamical masstolight ratio 18rh m 18rh lv 18rh 9678 48 lv 18rh 076lvt ot for a plummer profile in the cases of removing the outlier stars we find 18rh 49 and 18rh 22 when removing star1 and both stars respectively based on the f6 projected position relative to fornax r 270 pc and its radial velocity v 4 km s1 it is clear that f6 is associated with the fornax dsph while the majority of its derived properties size luminosity metallicity and metallicity spread are consistent with a globular cluster type system its velocity dispersion is larger than expected if f6 is a globular cluster ie dark matter free the predicted velocity dispersion is v 08 12 km s1 for stellar masstolight ratio between 1 to 2 this is a factor of 5 less than the value we measure in our mixture model v is typical for ultrafaint dwarf galaxies however their masstolight ratios tend to be larger 12 100 eg simon 2019 the other properties of f6 are not characteristic of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies in particular all ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are much more metalpoor all have feh 2 simon 2019 this suggests that the large velocity dispersion and masstolight ratio may be due to fornax dsph interlopers tidal disruption andor unresolved binaries based on these properties we classify f6 as a globular cluster and it is the sixth globular cluster of the fornax dsph this confirmation increases the globular cluster specific frequency of fornax which was already large for its luminosity the globular cluster specific frequency is defined as sn ngc 1004mv 15 harris van den bergh 1981 we find sn 248 for fornax without f6 it is sn 207 vlos kms figure 6 velocity dispersion and metallicity dispersion distribution of the 1000 permutation tests each test has 12 random fornax members with metallicity measurements and 3 additional members only with velocity measurements mirroring the f6 sample kinematic and metallicity properties similar to a globular cluster ie f6 are highly unlikely to arise from a chance alignment we performed a number of data permutation tests we concentrate on whether we can match the low velocity and metallicity dispersions of f6 which are properties that are characteristic of globular clusters for these tests we randomly drew without replacement a subset of stars from the fornax dsph sample excluding all stars within 10 rhf 6 of f6 and computed the kinematics and metallicity of this subset to match the properties of the f6 sample we selected 12 stars with metallicity measurements we additionally excluded stars with feh 05 to match the quality of the fornax 6 members and then 3 stars without metallicity measurements we additionally limited the fornax sample to the central pointings we then computed the kinematic and metallicity properties of this subset and repeated this 1000 times in figure 6 we examine the velocity dispersion and metallicity dispersion distributions from the permutations results and compare them to the best fit f6 properties orange point while there are a number of samples that are consistent within 1sigma of the metallicity dispersion 91 or velocity dispersion 1 of f6 only 1 permutation 01 is consistent with both a low velocity and metallicity dispersion similar to f6 in summary in the fornax dsph it is extremely unlikely to find by chance a clustering of stars with properties similar to f6 in addition the f6 members are spatially concentrated r 10 in contrast to the permutation tests explored a related question is how likely is it to find a fornax star with f6like velocity and metallicity properties magellanm2fs spectroscopy of fornax 6 near f6 the probability to find a f6like star drawn from a fornax dsphlike distribution is 24 a f6like star is defined as 079 feh 063 and either 468 vlos 542 km s1 or 432 vlos 578 km s1 where the difference in percentage accounts for the potential nonzero velocity dispersion in the current sample there are 5 fornax members within 3 halflight radii of f6 if the outlier stars star1 and star2 are considered fornax stars and not f6 stars this would increase to 7 if 5 stars are drawn from a fornaxlike distribution the probability that no stars have f6like properties is 8290 and for 7 stars the probability is 7686 it is unlikely to have a fornax star that has the f6like properties located near the cluster but it is not excluded as there are two outlier f6 stars it is possible that this has occurred 34 tidal disruption of fornax 6 depending on the lineofsight distance to the f6 cluster relative to the fornax dsph there may be strong tidal forces on the cluster one potential signature of tidal disruption is the presence of a velocity gradient the disrupting mw satellite tucana iii contains a large velocity gradient 8 km s1 deg1 along its short tidal tails li et al 2018 to search for a velocity gradient we modify the mean parameter of the velocity component of the likelihood v v vg g here vg is the velocity gradient magnitude and g is the distance along the velocity gradient axis which is rotated by an angle g this adds two additional velocity parameters vg g we apply this model to stars identified as f6 members and weight each star by its membership probability for simplicity we only model the velocity distribution we use the mcmc code emcee to sample the posterior foremanmackey et al 2013 with the f6 stars identified above we find a gradient that is consistent with zero vg 27 44 km s1 arcmin1 if we remove the two outlier stars the significance increases vg 26 27 km s1 arcmin1 but is still consistent with no gradient if we use the members identified with the second f6 mixture model we find vg 4521 arcmin1 22 km s with g 36 20 we do not find any strong evidence for the presence of a velocity gradient if there is a velocity gradient a larger spectroscopic sample is required to identify it to estimate the tidal force of fornax on f6 we compute the jacobi radius rj mf 6 mdsph rf 6 313 rf 6 binney tremaine 2008 assuming an nfw halo for fornax with a scale radius of 3 kpc and a scale density of 0044 m pc3 we find rj 17 29 pc if f6 is a purely stellar system with  2 and rj 60 100 pc if instead the measured velocity dispersion is representative of the mass profile of f6 100 in both cases the range denotes a lineofsight distance between 01 kpc and a projected distance of 270 pc for a purely stellar f6 the jacobi radius is smaller than the size of the system suggesting that f6 should be undergoing tidal disruption which may explain its larger elongation compared to the other fornax gcs if the larger velocity dispersion is representative of f6 than the cluster should be bound as the jacobi radius is larger than the cluster any conclusions drawn about the jacobi radii and potential tidal disruption depend on the membership of the two outlier candidates star1 and star2 we note that rj will be larger if fornax has a cored profile wang et al 2019a if the true velocity dispersion is on the low end or there is some inflation of the velocity dispersion due to a velocity gradient then f6 could be disrupting but if the high velocity dispersion is representative then the cluster members would be bound it has been found that in the fornax system a large fraction of the metalpoor stars belong to the 4 metalpoor globular clusters up to 2025 larsen et al 2012b it is therefore interesting to determine the fraction of the metalrich stars feh 1 located in f6 compared to the number of metalrich stars in the fornax dsph to account for the sampling bias we compare the stellar mass in f6 to the fraction of stellar mass in fornax that is metalrich in our m2fs sample we find 57 of the fornax stars have feh 1 using the mv values in table 4 and assuming that both f6 and fornax have the same stellar ml we find that 06 of the metalrich stars in the fornax system are located within the f6 cluster this estimation may be biased if the m2fs metallicity distribution is not representative of the fornax metallicity distribution due to spatial sampling in summary we find that just 06 of the metalrich stars belong to the f6 cluster which is a much lower than the fraction of metalpoor stars that belong to the metalpoor globular clusters one possible reason for the difference in globular cluster stellar fraction between f6 and the metalpoor clusters is that more f6 stars have been tidally stripped we have examined the spatial distribution of stars with metallicity similar to f6 09 feh 05 in the m2fs sample to search for direct evidence of mass loss we see no obvious concentration of metalrich stars around the f6 cluster nor tidal tail like features originating from the cluster the f6like stars are more centrally concentrated than the bulk of the fornax sample but this subset of stars follows the general trend of observing more metalrich stars in the central regions of ab pace et al 180 185 190 195 200 gbp f6 members fornax dsph feh 07 age1 gyr feh 07 age2 gyr

more precise metallicities or light element abundance measurements are required to identify them for example a tidally stripped m54 star has been identified in the sagittarius dsph based on its nitrogen and aluminum abundances fernndeztrincado et al 2021 35 age one of the last remaining pieces of the f6 properties is the age of the system in figure 7 we compare the colors and magnitudes of f6 members in gbp grp vs g to several theoretical isochrones from the mesa isochrones and stellar tracks mist dotter 2016 choi et al 2016 all isochrones are fixed to feh07 the bestfit metallicity measured from the f6 members and we vary the age of the isochrone 1 2 4 6 and 10 gyr for comparison nearby fornax dsph stars are included though isochrones for their measured metallicities are not plotted the isochrone with an age of 2 gyr provides the best approximate fit for the f6 stars if we use g grp instead of gbp grp we reach a similar conclusion work on the star formation history of the fornax dsph measured with deep hst photometry found a major star formation episode at old ages 10 gyr with a second recent burst at 46 gyr and intermittent star formation in recent times 02 2 gyr rusakov et al 2021 the age estimation based on the comparison to the isochrones matches the more recent intermittent star formation in addition the photometric metallicity from the star formation histories of rusakov et al 2021 roughly matches f eh 07 at 2 gyr the fornax dsph star formation episode at 2 gyr may have triggered the conditions necessary to form the f6 cluster the most recent pericenter of fornax based on gaia dr2 proper motions is tp 1717 03 gyr which corresponds to the most recent star formation rusakov et al 2021 the previous pericenter time corresponds roughly to the 4 6 gyr burst there is evidence of past mergers in the kinematics and chemistry of the fornax stars for example the redgiant branch split is split into 23 chemodynamic populations battaglia et al 2006 walker pearrubia 2011 amorisco evans 2012 these three groups have feh 18 1 065 which may correspond to the inital old star formation episode 10 gyr the second burst 46 gyr and the most recent burst 02 2 gyr rusakov et al 2021 amorisco evans 2012 found that the intermediate population and the metalrich population have a misalignment between their angular momentum vectors suggesting that fornax is a merger of a bound pair del pino et al 2017 find rotating subpopulations in the fornax chemodynamics and a change in direction for stars of 8 gyr suggests that a dwarf galaxy merger occurred around this time similar evidence is found by the misalignment between the youngest stars in fornax and the old stellar population wang et al 2019b the history of the fornax dsph is complex with multiple episodes of star formation some evidence of mergers and pericenter passages that may correspond to the formation time of f6 while we have provided a simple estimate of the age future more accurate age measurements are required to conclusively identify any of these events with f6 36 comparison to other globular clusters the main peculiarity of f6 compared to other fornax gcs is that it is much more metalrich than the other five fornax clusters in figure 8 we compare the luminosity metallicity and halflight radius of f6 to other gcs in the local group this includes the other five fornax gcs

gc located in the trailing arm of the sgr stream the sgr dsph has three more metalrich clusters palomar 12 whiting 1 and terzan 7 similar to f6 excluding the sgr gcs the other dwarf galaxy gcs are generally more metalpoor than the mw distribution in contrast to f6 in figure 9 we show the agemetallicity distribution of globular clusters in the fornax dsph sagittarius dsph and mw age measurements are from de boer fraser 2016 kruijssen et al 2019 the f6 globular cluster lacks an age measurement and we instead displays its metallicity as a horizontal line the mw gcs form two tracks an old metalrich clump insitu upper right and an accretted track where the gcs are correlated in their age and metallicity if we assume f6 follows the same agemetallicity accretted relation as the mw we predict it to be 6 10 gyr in particular palomar 12 has an age 91 gyr we note that all three metalrich sgr gcs have ages 91 gyr or younger this age range overlaps with the infall time of the fornax dsph tinfall 10708 31 fillingham et al 2019 suggesting that there could be a relation between the formation of f6 and the infall of the dsph this formation time is older than what we estimated based on the gaia colormagnitude diagram and more precise photometry is required to accurately measure age and determine when in the evolutionary history of fornax the f6 cluster was formed 4 conclusion ab pace et al we present magellanm2fs spectroscopy of the fornax dsph and the fornax 6 f6 globular cluster we measure 980 new radial velocities and metallicities of stars which we combined with previous mmfs spectroscopy walker et al 2009a and gaia edr3 astrometry with this spectroscopic sample we are able to identify members of the f6 cluster and fornax dsph our main findings are as follows  we identify 2989 members of the fornax dsph and measure a velocity dispersion of 121 km s1 a mean metallicity of 122 a metallicity dispersion of 048 and a metallicity gradient of 028 dex r1 h with an efficient gaia dr2 target selection a number of these stars 165 are at large radii rrh 2 this is one of the largest fornax samples and will be useful for future kinematic analyses  we identify 1517 members of the f6 cluster and confirm that f6 is distinct in velocity and metallicity from fornax dsph stars see figure 5 we measure v f6 50517 and vf6 17 km s 5616 km s the small offset in radial velocity between f6 and the fornax dsph combined with its spatial location confirms that the f6 is associated with the fornax dsph there are two velocity outlier stars that may be inflating vf6 if they are excluded from the fornax 6 sample the velocity dispersion is consistent with zero we measure 005 fehf6 071005 and fehf6 003006 002 which is more metalrich than the bulk of the fornax dsph stars and the other five fornax gcs we estimate that 06 of the metalrich stars are located within the f6 cluster whereas a much larger percentage of the metalpoor stars in the fornax system are located within the other gcs 2025 are located within f1f2f3f5 larsen et al 2012b excluding the velocity dispersion the metallicity size rhf 6 113 pc and luminosity mv 48 of f6 suggest that it is a gc  we have compared f6 to other gcs in the mw and other dwarf galaxy systems see figure 8 when compared to other metalrich gcs f6 has the largest physical size however its size and luminosity is similar to other metalpoor gcs in the mw and dwarf galaxy gcs f6 has properties similar to the metalrich gcs of sagittarius in particular palomar 12 is an excellent analog based on feh rh and mv  given the metalrich nature of the f6 cluster feh 07 it is almost certainly younger than the other fornax gcs age 10 gyr which places the formation after infall into the mw tif 107 gyr fillingham et al 2019 from gaia photometry and mist isochrones we estimated an age of 2 gyr fornax has an extended star formation history rusakov et al 2021 and potential dwarf galaxy mergers amorisco evans 2012 del pino et al 2017 there are star bursts at 2 4 gyr that correspond to the two most recent pericenter passages rusakov et al 2021 fritz et al 2018 any of these events could have triggered the necessary conditions for the formation of the f6 cluster more precise photometry is required to improve the measurement of the age and identify the origin of the cluster the survival of the fornax globular cluster system is arguably at odds with dynamical fictions arguments and has been used as evidence for a cored dark matter halo of the fornax dsph future analysis of this problem should include f6 as the inner clusters f3f4f6 are the most impacted by different dark matter halos while the systemic proper motion of f6 relative to fornax is currently not well constrained in future gaia data releases the proper motions will be more informative and assist with addressing the fornax timing problem acknowledgments abp is supported by nsf grant ast1813881 mgw acknowledges support from nsf grants ast1813881 and
