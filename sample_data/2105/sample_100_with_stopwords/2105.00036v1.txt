arxiv210500036v1 astrophsr 30 apr 2021 2 european accepted xxx received yyy in original form zzz abstract many characteristics of dwarf carbon stars are broadly consistent with a binary origin including mass transfer from an evolved companion while the population overall appears to have olddisc or halo kinematics roughly 2 per cent of these stars exhibit h emission which in lowmass mainsequence stars is generally associated with rotation and relative youth its presence in an older population therefore suggests either irradiation or spinup this study presents timeseries analyses of photometric and radialvelocity data for seven dwarf carbon stars with h emission all are shown to have photometric periods in the range 0252 d and orbital periods of similar length consistent with tidal synchronisation it is hypothesised that dwarf carbon stars with emission lines are the result of closebinary evolution indicating that lowmass metalweak or metalpoor stars can accrete substantial material prior to entering a commonenvelope phase key words binaries general stars carbon stars activity stars chemically peculiar stars rotation white dwarfs introduction binarystar evolution is responsible for a wide array of astrophysical phenomena including blue stragglers typeia supernovae and gravitational waves maeder 1987 webbink 1984 abbott et al 2016 interactions between binary components may result in deviations from the course of typical singlestar evolution through mass transfer or mergers leading to changes in stellar structure and atmospheric chemistry hurley et al 2002 temmink et al 2020 a prime example of how binary interactions can influence stellar evolution is given by dwarf carbon dc stars these lowmass mainsequence stars exhibit spectra analogous to those of evolved carbon stars found at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch agb dahn et al 1977 but in advance of dredgeup processes being able to modify surface chemistry the peculiar atmospheric chemistry co 1 in the prototype dc star g7761 is thought to originate through mass transfer from an evolved highermass companion dearborn et al 1986 in this picture as the former primary star ascends the agb cnoprocessed material is dredged to its surface before stellar winds liberate the consequently carbonenhanced outer layers iben renzini 1983 enriched material is then transferred to the mainsequence companion polluting its atmosphere and creating a dc star while the original primary becomes a white dwarf the exact email lewiswhitehouse16uclacuk  0000 the authors physical means of mass transfer in these systems remain unknown but possibilities include classical processes of stellarwind capture and rochelobe overflow and morerecent models such as wind rochelobe overflow abate et al 2013 regardless of the detailed mechanisms metalpoor stars are significantly more susceptible to atmospheric pollution through external carbon enrichment processes de kool green 1995 there is little optical evidence for whitedwarf companions to dc stars where only 1 per cent of systems exhibit flux consistent with a white dwarf at blue wavelengths eg heber et al 1993 liebert et al 1994 green 2013 nonetheless recent observational evidence supports a binary formation channel for dc stars a radialvelocity study of 28 dc stars each with typically 35 measurements obtained over several years suggests a dc binary fraction of at least 75 per cent whitehouse et al 2018 a larger survey of 240 dc stars at a lower resolution also found a high binary fraction possibly as large as 95 per cent with a mean orbital period on the order of 1 yr roulston et al 2019 the first four wellcharacterised dc binaries all have orbital periods on the order of years as established by radialvelocity or astrometric monitoring dearborn et al 1986 harris et al 2018 g7761 067 yr lspm 07424659 123 yr lp 25512 321 yr and lp 75843 114 yr these systems are all singlelined spectroscopic binaries or their astrometric equivalent with neither optical nor ultraviolet indications of flux from their suspected evolved companions l j whitehouse et al the existence of long orbital periods 100 d among dc stars is commensurate with betterstudied classes of carbonenhanced binary systems such as ch ba and carbonenhanced metalpoor cemp stars which are all thought to follow analogous evolutionary pathways and which have orbital periods of hundreds to thousands of days jorissen et al 2016 mcclure et al 1980 lucatello et al 2005 in contrast shortperiod binaries are not necessarily expected as rochelobe overflow tends to be unstable in the case of mass transfer from a higher to a lowermass star and the sole populationsynthesis study for dc stars verifies that shortperiod systems fail to result if accretion is inefficient during a commonenvelope phase de kool green 1995 however in the same year that three of the longperiod orbits were published the dc star sdss j125017902524276 hereafter j1250 was reported to have a photometric period of 29 d and radialvelocity measurements folded on this period appear to provide a good orbital solution margon et al 2018 this system has two notable features photometric variability on a period potentially identical to the orbital period and prominent emission in the balmer lines and in ca ii h k all of which are photospheric margon et al 2018 such emission features are rare among dc stars with only a handful known among the 1200 confirmed and suspected candidates in the sloan digital sky survey green 2013 furthermore a chandra study of six emissionline dc stars detected each of them in xrays a clear indication of stellar activity green et al 2019 such activity was not anticipated for dc stars as they are expected to be drawn from populations of older metalweak disc stars as well as truly metalpoor halo stars including the prototype g7761 with feh 4 plez cohen 2005 on the bases of their kinematics harris et al 1998 plant et al 2016 farihi et al 2018 and populationsynthesis modelling de kool green 1995 motivated by these findings this study investigates the possibility that emission lines observed in some dc stars arise because of unexpectedly rapid rotation associated with tidal synchronisation in shortperiod binaries or with spinup due to mass transfer this paper presents the results of radialvelocity and photometric timeseries analyses conducted for seven dc stars with h emission and finds that six stars in the sample are binaries with orbital periods in the range 0244 d all seven sources show photometric variability on periods that are either orbital or are similarly short the radialvelocity and photometric observations are summarised in section 2 the methods and period analyses are discussed in section 3 the results for each individual target are presented in section 4 and a discussion follows in section 5 observations and data reduction target selection the literature was searched to identify dc stars known to exhibit h emission eg lowrance et al 2003 green 2013 with six selected for further study based on brightness visibility as well as proper motion consistent with

telescope at the roque de los muchachos observatory some of the observations are reported in a previous paper whitehouse et al 2018 and further observing runs have since been carried out in 2018 aug 2019 feb and apr and 2020 feb all observations prior to 2020 were carried out using only the blue arm of the spectrograph without any dichroic in combination with the r1200b grating an eev12 detector was employed without binning providing wavelength coverage of approximately 50006000 and a resolving power r 6700 at the central wavelength 1 arcsec slit the wavelength range encompasses many strong atomic and molecular lines including the mg i b triplet na i d doublet and two prominent c2 swan bands see table 2 in 2020 feb both the blue and red arms of the isis spectrograph were used with the gg495 dichroic the blue arm was equipped with the r600b grating to provide wavelength coverage of 35105340 achieving a resolving power r 2700 at the central wavelength these data were obtained using the eev12 detector without binning the red arm of the spectrograph was employed with the r1200r grating covering a wavelength range of 5770 6770 where a resolving power of r 7400 was achieved these data were obtained using the red detector with no binning together these more recent data cover h and the higher balmer lines beginning in 2019 each star was observed a number of times typically two to four during each night to probe for shortterm changes in radial velocity each observation consisted of at least three separate exposures of the science target with wavelengthcalibration frames taken immediately before and after individual exposure times for the stars varied between 180 and 600 s typically for the brighter and fainter sources respectively standard stars and other calibration data were taken at least once per night all science exposures were bias subtracted flat fielded and extracted using standard methods in iraf for extraction the 2dimensional spectral trace was established using the standard star observation with the highest signaltonoise sn of the night and was recentred for the extraction of each target spectrum individual exposures were wavelength calibrated using the appropriate arc frames for each target finally all consecutive target exposures were combined using inverse variance weighting to create a single spectrum with sn 10 for analysis

in this study was sourced primarily from the public data releases of the palomar transient factory ptf intermediatepalomar transient factory and zwicky transient facility ztf surveys law et al 2009 kulkarni 2013 bellm 2014 the primary science goals of these projects are to monitor the sky for transient events using the palomar 48in oschin schmidt telescope with widefield imagers surveying the entire available northern sky roughly every three days the detection limit of the survey is r 206 mag rau et al 2009 and all data are fully reduced and calibrated by the dedicated facility pipelines ofek et al 2012 masci et al 2019 data were retrieved for j0901 j1015 and cbs 311 by querying the ptf dr3 and ztf dr5 databases using their gaia edr3 astrometry gaia collaboration et al 2020 for each target a cone search was made using a 15arcsec radius centred on the 20155 gaia positions only matches within 05 arcsec of the expected position were selected for analysis this is well within the typical diameter of the point spread function of the surveys all photometric data with poor quality flags were rejected photometric monitoring of the dc star j0842 was conducted by kepler during k2 campaign 18 with continuous measurements for two months at a cadence of 30 min howell et al 2014 other sources of photometry were not used for this target as the kepler data are of superior quality finally cls 29 and sbss 1310 were observed with the transiting exoplanet survey satellite tess ricker et al 2015 and are sufficiently bright and isolated that useful data were obtained cls 29 was observed in sector 22 and sbss 1310 in sectors 15 16 and 22 with an interval of 139 days between sectors 16 and 22 the duration of each tess sector is approximately 25 d with photometric observations taken every 30 min methods and period analysis velocity error by around 50 per cent compared to a determination of absolute velocity using the few available weak atomic lines these more precise but relative velocity measurements are then used to determine the orbital parameters for each target to establish an absolute velocity scale for these data the highest sn spectrum of each target was crosscorrelated against a continuumnormalised synthetic spectrum template these spectra were synthesised using autokur which is a wrapper for the kurucz spectral synthesis codes kurucz 2005 with the underlying atmospheric structures based on marcs models gustafsson et al 2008 stellar parameters were chosen to be representative of lowmass mainsequence stars ie appropriate for latek to earlym dwarfs and to reflect the older kinematical ages of the dc population as a whole templates were generated for teff 35004500 k in steps of 250 k and metallicities feh from 2 to 0 in integer steps with the surface gravity and microturbulence kept fixed at log g cm s2 50 and v t 20 km s1 respectively the synthetic spectra were generated at resolving powers of r 6700 and 7900 to match the instrumental resolution achieved under standard and best observing conditions at the telescope respectively because stellaratmosphere models are not currently available for cool carbonrich dwarf stars the synthetic spectra were generated for stars with solar carbon abundances at gravities and effective temperatures similar to those expected for a typical dc star the c2 swan bands which contain myriad individual transitions and are useful for relative velocity measurements are not present in the solarabundance templates and would lead to increased measurement errors in velocity if used as the primary source of crosscorrelation therefore to minimise the measurement errors restricted wavelength regions of the synthetic templates those containing the strongest atomic lines were selected for crosscorrelation using these restricted regions significantly improved the quality of each crosscorrelation albeit while still not as precise as the relative velocity measurements by mitigating spectral mismatches the wavelength regions used for the synthetic templates are listed in table 2 to determine the best synthetic template to measure absolute velocities each synthetic template was crosscorrelated against the highest sn spectrum of each observed dc star the template that achieved the strongest crosscorrelation function was therefore deemed as the most suitable in general templates at cooler temperatures achieved a stronger crosscorrelation function than templates at higher temperatures those with teff 6 4000 k consistently outperformed their warmer counterparts across the whole metallicity range furthermore templates with metallicity feh  0 typically performed worse when compared to lower metallicity templates overall the resolving power of the templates exhibited no performance trend in crosscorrelations the stellar parameters of the best performing synthetic spectral template were feh 1 teff 3750 k and r 6700 this template was therefore adopted to measure absolute velocities as it consistently possessed strong crosscorrelation metrics with high sn observed spectra radialvelocity crosscorrelation the most precise measurements of radialvelocity changes are achieved by crosscorrelating individual spectra of a given target against its highest sn counterpart such measurements benefit from the strong molecular carbon absorption features eg c2 swan bands in dc stars to achieve the best crosscorrelation possible all spectra were first continuumnormalised by fitting a cubic spline the crosscorrelation was performed using the iraf fxcor package tonry davis 1979 this crosscorrelation method reduces the mnras 000 000000 0000 radialvelocity period determinations the joker is software designed to determine orbital periods from radialvelocity data under the assumption that all variability is the product of twobody gravitational interactions pricewhelan et al 2017 2020 for a given number of samples drawn from the prior probability distribution function pdf it uses the method of rejection sampling to eliminate lowlikelihood solutions generating a random value for each posterior sample r j between 0 and the maxi l j whitehouse et al mum likelihood in the posterior distribution l max if the likelihood of a specific sample l j does not meet the condition that r j l j then the sample is rejected this approach guarantees at least one surviving sample and is particularly useful where radialvelocity data are sparse because the joker analysis is performed on the more precise relative radialvelocity data the systemic velocity returned from the analysis is offset from the true value this was corrected by applying the absolute velocity offsets as determined by the synthetic spectral templates while propagating the errors in the offset measurement which are assumed to be gaussian with the systemic velocity posterior distribution the orbital parameters for each target are quoted as the median of the final posterior distribution whether through the joker or mcmc and presented in table 3 the median was selected due to the nongaussian nature of some of the distributions the uncertainties in the orbital parameters for each target are quoted as the 16 per cent and 84 per cent confidence limit in the posterior distribution this analysis was completed for the six targets discussed in this paper as well as j1250 the radialvelocity curves corresponding to the median orbital parameters derived through this analysis are shown in figure 1 with the posterior pdfs of each target displayed in figure a1 100 cls 29 j1250 100 to ensure that an adequate number of posterior samples survive the joker analysis 109 prior samples are generated for each target with the maximum posterior sample size set to 8192 however the number of posterior samples removed during the rejection sampling algorithm in the joker is a function of the maximum likelihood of those posterior samples therefore for targets possessing more constraining data fewer posterior samples survive in the scenario where few samples survive rejection sampling the posterior distribution returned from the joker is typically unimodal with fewer than 100 samples owing to the small number of surviving samples in order to explore the posterior distribution fully these surviving samples are used as prior samples to initialise a markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation the pymc3 nouturn sampler was used with four chains and a tuning length of 1000 yielding a total of 2500 posterior samples per chain salvatier et al 2016 hoffman gelman 2011 this further analysis with mcmc was necessary for the dc stars cls 29 and sbss 1310 as only 10 and 74 samples survived rejection sampling respectively all other targets possess sufficiently large posterior distributions from the joker such that this additional analysis was obviated j1015 absolute radial velocity km s1 prior pdfs were selected for orbital eccentricity velocity semiamplitude and systemic velocity as follows only circular orbits were considered both for simplicity and because the available radialvelocity sampling is insufficient to robustly characterise eccentric orbits should a shortperiod solution result for any given system then the circular orbit assumption is retrospectively well justified for postcommonenvelope binaries paczynski 1976 podsiadlowski 2001 velocity semiamplitudes were sampled from a gaussian pdf for each target the mean was set to zero with the standard deviation set to 110 km s1 taking the absolute value the adopted standard deviation is based on the expected velocity semiamplitude for a binary with a total mass of 11m a 5 d period and 60 inclination the width of the prior pdf on velocity semiamplitude is intended to avoid biasing the posterior distributions finally systemic velocities were sampled from a gaussian distribution also centred at zero with a standard deviation of 100 km s1 again this prior pdf is uninformative and should not bias against any actual velocities j0901 sbss 1310 cbs 311 000 025 050 075 100 125 150 175 200 phase figure 1 radialvelocity curves corresponding to the median posterior parameter values

highlighted with an orange vertical bar right the phasefolded lightcurves corresponding to the strongest periodogram peak for each target the ls periodogram is a method to derive the period of oscillation for a recurrent signal in unevenly sampled timeseries data through the construction of a fourierlike power spectrum vanderplas 2018 it is almost equivalent to performing a leastsquare fit of a sine wave cf zechmeister krster 2009 such a periodogram can be relatively difficult to interpret as the fourier transform of any continuous signal in the data is convolved with the window function it can therefore be challenging to identify which periodogram peaks represent real signals in the timeseries data to break the degeneracy between the true and aliased peaks an ls periodogram was computed for the window function for each target and the windowfunction periodogram compared to the periodogram computed from the actual fluxes all peaks surviving these quality checks were then considered to be real periodic signals in the data to calculate the error in the photometric period corresponding to the best ls periodogram signal for a particular target a random number of data points were dropped from the dataset and replaced by randomly sampling the original dataset this new dataset was then analysed as outlined above and the process was repeated 103 times to generate a distribution of most likely photometric periods where the final error is quoted as the standard deviation of this distribution the ls periodograms for the seven targets and their most significant frequency peaks are shown in figure 2 for an ls periodogram peak to be considered real it must be sufficiently separate in frequency from a significant peak in the periodogram of the window function quantitatively a significant peak in the window function was defined as any peak with power above 20 per cent of the strongest peak in the window function the minimum separation in frequency space between a window function peak and an ls peak was chosen to be 0001 d1 finally a falsealarm probability was calculated by performing a bootstrap on the photometric data for the top five peaks that satisfied these conditions mnras 000 000000 0000 multiharmonic analysis of photometry the mhaov method was then used as an independent check on the ls periodograms in principle this method differs from the ls analysis in terms of the model fitted to the data and the statistic calculated from that fit whereas the ls method assumes the data are well modelled by a sine wave the mhaov method instead uses orthogonal szeg polynomials it should be noted that the first harmonics of the szeg polynomials simplify to a sine wave and l j whitehouse et al table 3 summary of period and close binary

variability notes errors for the period determinations are nongaussian and discussed in detail for all stars in section 4 with posterior distributions shown in the appendix the third column lists a model binary inclination based on the adopted or suspected radialvelocity period and velocity semiamplitude or upper limit under the assumptions of 04 m for the dc star and 06 m for a whitedwarf companion the fourth column lists the reduced 2 for each of the orbital solutions fitted in figure 1 the final column gives a positive or negative indication as to whether the observed photometric variability amplitude could plausibly result from modulation due to tidal distortion t a heating effect from irradiation i or rotation r thus in this work both the ls and mhaov method are fitting sine waves to the photometric data the advantage of using mhaov therefore comes from how the goodness of fit statistic is calculated lachowicz et al 2006 the statistic used in the ls method is simply 2 however because the true data variance is not actually known the statistic and variance estimations cannot be independent the mhaov method circumvents this problem by using the fisher analysisofvariance statistic instead of a 2 thus breaking the dependency between the statistic and the variance this has the benefit of suppressing the significance of periodogram peaks that are due to aliasing in the data therefore allowing for the determination of real peaks to be significantly easier than in the ls analysis furthermore the mhaov analysis is capable of detecting periodic signals at lower sn than the ls analysis while also assigning real signals with a higher significance than the ls analysis schwarzenbergczerny 1996 based on these statistical advantages the mhaov method was used in parallel to the ls method and in particular to verify the five strongest peaks identified from the ls analysis for each target the mhaov analysis agreed with the strongest peak identified through the ls analysis for all targets in this study and hence only the ls periodograms are shown in figure 2 all photometric periods quoted in this study are the most significant peak in both analyses results for individual stars the results of both the photometric and radialvelocity analyses are presented here in detail for each target with a brief summary provided in table 3 j0842 the dc star j0842 has an unusual spectrum compared to its siblings as is shown in figure 3 while the spectrum exhibits clear cn features in the red below roughly 7000 the flux is broadly consistent with a latek dwarf however there are subtle but convincing signs of c2 swan bands in the blue especially when compared side by side with an appropriate stellar template of solar abundance eg the late sdk stars sdss j110140903852302 or sdss j142617530737492 also noteworthy is the cah band a hallmark of metalpoor cool subdwarfs reid gizis 2005 lpine et al 2007 in addition to h close inspection also reveals emission in h and h without the clear cn features the spectrum might easily be mistaken for that of a k dwarf although the emission lines would remain remarkable interestingly the source is detected with galex in both the far and nearultraviolet bandpasses there are three and four separate detections respectively with weighted averages of m fuv 220 ab mag m nuv 214 ab mag it is possible that these ultraviolet detections are a result of strong coolstar line emission at these wavelengths but there are few transitions that could be responsible in the nearultraviolet galex band the mg ii 2800 doublet is a candidate but this is highly unlikely it is near the red cutoff of the bandpass and furthermore the emission would have to be three orders of magnitude brighter than the stellar continuum the corresponding farultraviolet detection cannot be due to any common stellar emission features as the bandpass cuts off before ly therefore the observed ultraviolet flux is almost certainly not intrinsic to the dc star the ultraviolet fluxes appear to be consistent with a white dwarf and in figure 3 the ultraviolet and optical photometry for j0842 is approximated using models solarabundance models castelli kurucz 2003 were used for the dc star as there are currently no atmospheric models for carbonenhanced cool dwarfs while whitedwarf atmospheric models were taken from koester 2010 a reasonable fit to the ultravioletoptical photometry is achieved using a teff 12 000 k hydrogenatmosphere whitedwarf model together with a teff 4000 k mainsequence stellar template where a modestly metalpoor model atmosphere provides a somewhat better fit than one with solar metallicity if the white dwarf is at the gaia parallax distance of d 680 50 pc then for the observed temperature and luminosity evolutionary models1 suggest a surface gravity close to a canonical value of log g cm s2 80 with a corresponding mass and radius of 061 m and 0013 r and cooling age of around 40 myr fontaine et al 2001 it is noteworthy that the sdss uband photometry appears to be consistent with the composite stellar fluxes and the gaia distance indicates clearly that this is a mainsequence star with mr 80 ab mag this target was observed during k2 campaign 18 the ls periodogram analysis yields a clearlydefined photometric period of 0945 0001 d with a mean semiamplitude of 0014 mag figure 2 nine radialvelocity observations were obtained over three httpwwwastroumontrealca bergeroncoolingmodels mnras 000 000000 0000 active dc stars with short orbital periods nights in 2019 with two to four measurements per night additionally five further radialvelocity measurements were taken in 2020 feb perhaps surprisingly these data do not reveal any radialvelocity variations exceeding the error bars typically 5 km s1 thus if j0842 is binary with the suspected whitedwarf companion described above and its orbital period is similar to the observed photometric period of 095 d then the inclination must be 6 61 3 for masses of mdc 04 m and mwd 06 m j0901 this source exhibits a dc optical spectrum with no evidence for a luminous companion and is therefore a more typical example of its class albeit with the exception of the h and likely h emission features it is detected in xrays by chandra green et al 2019 but galex observations do not exist for this region of the sky this study is the first to address its potential binarity and all radialvelocity observations reported are new the joker radialvelocity analysis indicates that the orbital period distribution is approximately bimodal with one larger peak at 211 d and a second smaller peak at around 209 d the median 00 d and a of the posterior distribution yields a period of 212003 velocity semiamplitude of 244916 km s a modest number of additional radialvelocity measurements at around a phase of 07 would likely precisely constrain the orbital period the photometric analysis for j0901 was conducted on both ztf and tess data because of the target faintness the tess photometry are not useful but the ztf data indicate a possible photometric period of 212 d however this photometric period remains relatively uncertain j1015 this source does not appear in any compendium of dc stars published to date but is flagged as having carbon lines by the sdss spectroscopic reduction pipeline in data release 9 the sdss spectrum appears to be a composite of a dc star and a datype white dwarf that contributes continuum flux and broad absorption at h h and h it is a binary suspect reported by whitehouse et al 2018 based on only two radialvelocity measurements which differ by nearly 7 the white dwarf is detected clearly in galex ultraviolet photometry where the weighted average of two observations yield m fuv 176 ab mag m nuv 180 ab mag the ultraviolet colour alone suggests an effective temperature between 20 000 and 25 000 k for a typical whitedwarf surface gravity the inclusion of the sdss uband photometry and the d 480 pc gaia parallax distance then favours teff closer to but not quite 25 000 k to best match the expected absolute ultraviolet magnitudes for a carbon oxygen core white dwarf while j1015 is one of the six dc stars detected in xrays by chandra green et al 2019 the white dwarf cannot be the source of hard xrays owing to the low sn in the spectra of j1015 it was not immediately possible to crosscorrelate each spectrum with the relative velocity template therefore each observed spectrum of j1015 was rebinned to lower resolution with each bin consisting of three pixels these rebinned spectra were then crosscorrelated against the relative velocity template to yield precise velocities for determining the orbital period before being crosscorrelated against the synthetic template to determine absolute velocities the joker radialvelocity analysis finds that the orbital period mnras 000 000000 0000 is strongly peaked at 020 d there are a modest number of posterior samples discretely scattered at either side of this peak though these samples are very few compared to the peak the velocity semiamplitude of j1015 is measured to be 18527 km s1 and thus the system inclination is likely to be low the photometric analysis reveals a strong frequency peak corresponding to a period of 0196 0003 d where two smaller flanking peaks in the power spectrum are the result of windowing relatively large photometric errors averaging 007 mag for this source give rise to the broadened structures in the periodogram this photometric period is strongest in both the ls and mhaov analyses and the phasefolded lightcurve at this period shows an amplitude near 2 per cent cls 29 the optical spectrum of this dc star is relatively unremarkable except for the presence of h and h emission the source is possibly marginally detected in the nearultraviolet with galex at m nuv 229 06 ab mag but too uncertain to warrant further analysis the tess data yield a clear peak in the periodogram corresponding to a period of 362 d the amplitude of the photometric variation is around 14 per cent this study is the first to report radialvelocity variations in cls 29 the radialvelocity analysis is highly constraining with only 1 in 108 posterior samples surviving the mcmc analysis yields a bimodal distribution in the orbital parameters where both peaks in the orbital period are within 1 per cent of 314 d owing to incomplete phase coverage during the radialvelocity monitoring the period cannot be uniquely determined additional velocity measurements for phases 0405 should break the degeneracy between the two solutions j1250 this dc star is a known singlelined binary and the first shown to have a shortperiod orbit margon et al 2018 where both photometric and radialvelocity variations are observed it is included here for context and discussed later as it belongs to the subgroup of stars exhibiting h emission lines and is detected in xrays green et al 2019 there are galex observations for this region of the sky but no detection near the location of j1250 in either ultraviolet band placing a rough upper limit at either wavelength of m 220 ab mag for a whitedwarf companion at the gaia parallax distance this would imply a star no brighter than around m 15 ab mag in the ultraviolet and for a typical mass and radius this would translate to teff 8000 k the publicly available photometric data from ztf for j1250 were analysed using the ls and mhaov analyses the photometric period of 292 d identified by margon et al 2018 was successfully recovered while the radialvelocity measurements of j1250 taken by margon et al 2018 do appear consistent with the photometric period no dedicated radialvelocity analysis was performed in that study here the reported radialvelocity data are analysed using the joker where the median posterior distribution for the orbital period is found to be 256013 d and is notably 12 per cent shorter than 011 the reported photometric period l j whitehouse et al figure 3 left the spectrum of sdss j084259792257298 which exhibits both carbonnormal and carbonenhanced features this may suggest co 1 as in stype carbon giants this star may therefore be an example of an stype dwarf the most prominent feature is the mgh band near 5100 while other notable absorption lines include na i d the k i doublet near 7700 and the ca ii red triplet the spectrum also shows a depression near 6800 due to cah which is a typical sign of metal poverty in cool dwarf stars right the ultraviolet through optical spectral energy distribution of j0842 the sdss spectrum is shown in solid grey with photometric fluxes shown as blue and purple error bars two scaled 4000 k synthetic spectra are shown in dashed orange and red for different metallicities the addition of a 12 000 k hydrogenatmosphere white dwarf is shown in dashed black and the resulting composite spectra are traced in solid orange and red sbss 1310 this is one of the nearest and brightest dc stars known and among only three or four objects within or just outside 100 pc harris et al 2018 the optical spectrum is spectacular and shows emission from higher balmer lines as well as ca ii h and k rossi et al 2011 there is a detection of this source in galex in the nearultraviolet only with m nuv 203 ab mag similar to the more detailed argument above for j0842 it is unlikely that emission from the dc star is responsible for nearultraviolet flux detection and in this case stellar emission lines would need to be roughly 400 times brighter than the expected continuum based solely on the absolute magnitude of this ultraviolet detection and assuming it was due to a typical surface gravity white dwarf at the gaia parallax distance to this target it would imply teff 7500 k whitehouse et al 2018 reported several radialvelocity observations of this star that strongly indicate binarity at a significance just above 7 analysis of the previous and newer radialvelocity data with the joker yields only 70 surviving samples the subsequent mcmc posterior distribution for sbss 1310 is unimodal for all parameters with the orbital period tightly constrained at 443 d with a velocity semiamplitude of 465 084 km s1 the tess data reveal a strong periodic signal corresponding to a photometric period of 526001 d unexpectedly the photometric analysis on the individual cleaned lightcurves from each tess sector reveals a clear change in the photometric period sectors 15 16 and 22 individually yield periods of 517 001 524 001 and 530 001 d respectively also serendipitously the amplitude of the photometric variation changes significantly between sector 16 and 22 by around a factor of five these data are discussed in more detail in section 523 cbs 311 this system is a previously known binary with a composite spectrum liebert et al 1994 consisting of the dc star and a teff 31 000 k da strongest spectral lines are hydrogen white dwarf the region of the sky occupied by this target lacks any galex observations that could further constrain the luminosity of the companion cbs 311 is one of the dc stars detected in xrays by chandra green et al 2019 but it should be noted again that the white dwarf cannot be the source of the highenergy emission this target was also imaged at high spatial resolution using the hubble space telescope where the binary remained unresolved to at least 25 mas farihi et al 2010 corresponding to a projected separation on the sky of roughly 10 au at the 440 pc gaia dr2 parallax distance the dc star in this binary is fainter than suggested by the rband brightness due to some flux contribution from the white dwarf this diminishes the effective sn of the absorption lines used for crosscorrelation when measuring relative and absolute velocities therefore each spectrum of cbs 311 was rebinned to a lower resolution by taking the mean of every 3 pixels the radialvelocity analysis identifies one prominent peak in the posterior distribution of the orbital parameters at 019 d with small peaks to either side where the velocity semiamplitude is constrained to be 29220 km s1 the photometric analysis was conducted on the available ztf data for this target a clear periodic signal corresponding to the strongest periodogram peak is located at 0302 0001 d with a semiamplitude near 3 per cent discussion spectroscopic and photometric periods are closely similar for all six systems for which both have been established but are indistinguishable for only two table 3 for those two orbital variability is ostensibly a plausible mechanism for the photometric changes for the remaining stars at least the working hypothesis is that the photometric variability must arise through rotational modulation with the close similarities between orbital and rotational periods arising through tidal synchronisation in this section binary lightcurve simulations are presented in order to provide context for the observed photometric variability potential sources of the periodic flux changes and their implications mnras 000 000000 0000 active dc stars with short orbital periods figure 4 representative rband lightcurve simulations detailed in section 51 for orbital periods representative of the shortest yet measured or suggested for dc stars the grey bar in each panel represents the range of peaktopeak variations observed in the dcstar sample 00280060 mag the topleft panel demonstrates the influence of tidal distortion alone while the models represented at top right have identical parameters but include heating irradiation the lowerleft panel explores the effect of reduced heating ie from cooler whitedwarf companions and the bottomright panel shows the effects of decreasing inclination for the observed emissionline activity are then explored finally the origin and evolution of these binaries are discussed in a wider context of carbonenhanced stars binary lightcurve simulations as an aid to interpreting the observed photometric variability a range of orbital lightcurves are simulated in order to gauge the possible effects of closebinary interaction the goal is to distinguish purely orbital photometric effects from the rotation of the dc star itself in particular the aim is to characterise tidaldistortion and heating irradiation or daynight effects arising from a whitedwarf companion and thereby to characterise the parameter space where these effects may be significant a standard roche model is adopted with simple deep heating using the current version of a code originally described by howarth 1982 these illustrative calculations are carried out for the cousins r band as a rough match to the observed photometry with the dc component modelled as a star with tdc 4000 k mdc 044 m and rdc 042 r if the lobe size allows lobefilling otherwise which are approximately the values expected for a star near the bottom of the kdwarf sequence for a metallicity feh 10 and an age of 1 gyr or older dotter et al 2008 the choice of metallicity has a strong influence on the inferred mass and radius for a fixed effective temperature where going from solar metallicity to feh 20 changes the implied stellar mass from roughly 06 to 03 m at 4000 k the metallicity of dc stars remains poorly determined except in a single case of extreme metal mnras 000 000000 0000 poverty g7761 with feh 40 plez cohen 2005 yet the kinematics of dc stars clearly indicates that the population includes a large fraction of metalpoor members the chosen conservative decrement from solar yields mr 86 ab mag and this compares favourably with the stars studied here whose absolute magnitudes span mr 8092 ab mag see table 3 the adopted default whitedwarf parameters are twd 30 000 k mwd 060 m rwd 0014 r based on parameters for the whitedwarf companion to cbs 311 liebert et al 1994 one of only two known hot bright companions to any dc star the implied massradius ratio is fairly typical of single white dwarfs as well as those found binaries although in the models the adopted radius is of consequence only for its role in determining the luminosity ll 014 which determines the magnitude of the irradiation a white dwarf of this nature gives rise to a significant heating or daynight effect on its companion in order to explore the effect of fainter white dwarfs each simulation at a given orbital period was run for a range of heating efficiencies from 100 per cent down to 20 per cent where the latter roughly corresponds to twd 20 000 k for the same whitedwarf mass and radius the models incorporate a number of simplifications that are inconsequential for the purposes of this study the dc surface intensities are calculated using a constant linear limbdarkening coefficient of 06 roughly appropriate for the range of temperatures found a gravitydarkening exponent of 008 and emergent fluxes from howarth 2011 interpolated at fixed log g cm s2 50 while the white dwarf is bolometrically luminous giving rise to heating of the dcstar atmosphere it contributes no flux directly to the simulated lightcurves orbital periods are taken from the l j whitehouse et al range porb 0210 d the shortest measured or suggested periods known in steps 01 d with inclinations i 1090 in steps of 10 figure 4 shows a representative sample of the simulated lightcurves each panel holding some parameters fixed while varying others notably for these parameters the dc star fills its roche lobe just below the simulation range at a period of 01 d r 033r at 02 d the tidal distortion of the star results in a photometric semiamplitude near 015 mag and with the characteristic doublepeaked nonsinusoidal pattern adding heating at the shortest simulated period results in a single peak and semiamplitude just over 030 mag at longer periods ie wider separations both of these orbitalmotioninduced effects diminish rapidly their full combined effect at 04 d is less than half that at 02 d for periods approaching and exceeding 10 d both tidal distortion and irradiation have a negligible impact on the emergent flux the magnitude of these calculated effects are taken here only as a representative guide and they are accurate only to a degree for the tidal distortion a classical roche lobe is used for the equipotential surface without the influence of asynchronous rotation the atmosphere of the irradiated star is only changed insofar as a local effective temperature modification and without any calculation of the actual atmospheric structure despite these potential shortcomings the simulations should be sufficient to determine whether an observed photometric variation can plausibly be attributable to orbital motion as opposed to stellar rotation source of photometric variability here the discussion pursues the question of whether the observed photometric variability in any given system can be attributed to orbital motion or to rotation of the dc star 521 rotation versus orbit the seven dc stars listed in table 3 exhibit photometric variability amplitudes falling between 0014 and 0030 mag with no apparent correlations with orbital period or with crudely estimated inclination each system is compared with the lightcurve simulations fig 4 for the appropriate orbital period or range and none are consistent with ellipsoidal variations induced by tidal distortion there are two elements to this inference first the amplitudes of the predicted changes are significantly smaller than those observed and secondly the dominant photometric period of ellipsoidal variations should be exactly half the orbital period while ellipsoidal variations would occur more readily in systems with shorter orbital periods neither j1015 nor cbs 311 each with porb 02 d exhibit such lightcurve characteristics as a result of having wellconstrained radialvelocity periods for six of the targets it can be securely stated that none of their lightcurves are consistent with an origin in tidaldistortions next the observed photometric changes are compared with those that might be induced due to irradiation from a relatively hot and luminous whitedwarf component the daynight or heating effect the predicted amplitudes can match or exceed the observed ranges and so a more detailed examination is needed the simulations suggest cbs 311 might experience a 015 mag modulation in its lightcurve due to irradiation and the observed value is around fives times smaller than this and thus is unlikely for j1015 the companion appears to be roughly three times less luminous see below and because the irradiated flux scales with luminosity the photometric period d sbss 1310 cls 29 j1250 j0901 mode j0901 cbs 311 j1015 j0842 orbital period d figure 5 the orbital period compared to the photometric period for the seven stars studied in this sample the error bars are shown as the 16 per cent and 84 per cent confidence limits due to the highly nongaussian errors in the photometric period of j0901 the mode of the photometric period is also shown the solid black line represents the identity line between the orbital and photometric periods as there are no constraints on the orbital period of j0842 the photometric period is plotted as a green dashed line across all possible orbital periods each point is labelled with the corresponding name heating effect will commensurately decrease in this case the simulations indicate that a mildly doublepeaked structure is expected with a semiamplitude near 007 mag and thus a possibility there are two additional effects that would mitigate the magnitude of any orbitalinduced photometric changes first in the simulations the white dwarf contributes no flux to the lightcurve and thus in cases where the white dwarf is visible in the optical spectrum there will be a corresponding dilution factor from the contribution of its flux in cbs 311 the two stars contribute nearly equal flux in the r band liebert et al 1994 and thus the predicted amplitude of the heating effect on the dc star will be diluted by a factor 2 for j1015 the ultraviolet through optical spectra and photometry are decently fit by the addition of a teff 23 500 k datype white dwarf whose flux in the r band is approximately 25 per cent of the total and the amplitude of any heating effect will be reduced accordingly secondly for an i 0 faceon binary there is no expected flux modulation from either tidal distortion or irradiation as both binary components are in full view for the entire orbit the amplitude of both these orbital effects on the lightcurve should increase to first order as sin i figure 4 and thus in real observations where present these effects will typically be modestly decreased taking into account all of these factors as the data permit the lightcurves of both cbs 311 and j1015 become inconsistent with irradiation for relatively low inclinations specifically for i 42 the observed photometric variation of cbs 311 is more consistent with rotation and similarly for j1015 for i 25 for the stars j0842 j0901 cls 29 j1250 and sbss 1310 the only realistic source of photometric variability is rotation this is next considered as the primary or exclusive cause of the observed lightcurve variations in the sample of dc stars is axial rotation 522 tidal synchronisation figure 5 shows the relationship between the photometric and orbital periods for the six targets with wellconstrained radialvelocity periods including j1250 two systems have essentially identical mnras 000 000000 0000 active dc stars with short orbital periods photometric and radialvelocity periods while the remaining four have photometric periods that are modestly longer than the radialvelocity periods further undermining the possibility that the photometric variations are orbital those systems with matching photometric and radialvelocity periods j0901 and j1015 are neither the shortest period systems nor those with the most luminous companions as might be expected if tidal distortion or irradiation were responsible for the photometric variability the stars j1250 cls 29 sbss 1310 and cbs 311 possess photometric periods on average around 15 per cent longer than their orbital periods which is strictly inconsistent with orbital motion the collective data on these emissionline dc stars therefore broadly support a rotational origin for the photometric changes however magnetic braking causes spindown with age for isolated convective stars assuming a crude and probably conservative age estimate for dc stars of a few to several gyr farihi et al 2018 the empirical agerotation relationship for single m dwarfs predicts spin periods on the order of 20100 d engle guinan 2018 significantly longer than any of the photometric periods measured in this study implying an additional source of spin angular momentum tidally induced rotational synchronisation is an appealing mechanism for the implied spinup and relatively rapid rotation particularly since the radialvelocity data are consistent with circular orbits and rotational synchronisation is expected to take place on shorter timescales than orbital circularisation theoretical timescales for synchronisation depend mainly on the ratio of the radius of the star experiencing tidal forces here the dc star to the orbital separation between the binary components adopting canonical values for mdwarf radii along with the orbital separations determined from this study it is found that synchronisation timescales are a few myr up to no more than a gyr zahn 1989 2008 assuming that all of the binary companions are now white dwarfs their cooling timescales can be estimated and provide a window over which tidal synchronisation could have occurred attributing all galex ultraviolet flux in these systems to white dwarfs  and upper limits for nondetections at the gaia distances to the dc stars and assuming a fixed whitedwarf surface gravity of log g cm s2 80 coolingage estimates and lower limits can be derived from models bdard et al 2020 the resulting cooling ages range from approximately 10 myr cbs 311 to over 1 gyr but in all cases are broadly consistent with the predicted synchronisation timescale 523 differential rotation of course for fully synchronised rotation the photometric signal should exactly match the radialvelocity period as assumed in the analysis of j1250 by margon et al 2018 however there are modest offsets between the orbital and photometric periods for much of the sample with the photometric period never shorter than the radialvelocity period to reconcile this result with fully synchronised equatorial rotation the dc star must rotate differentially with starspots or other surfacebrightness inhomogeneities at relatively high latitudes for example solar differential rotation implies a 15 per cent longer period at latitudes of 2035 than at the equator the plausibility of differential rotation is best illustrated by sbss 1310 as noted in section 46 the photometric period of this star shows modest but significant changes between tess sectors 15 16 and 22 517 524 and 530 d respectively with 001 d mnras 000 000000 0000 uncertainties the individual sector periodograms are presented in figure 6 together with the sector lightcurves phasefolded to the mean 526 d period evidently the lightcurve changes not only in period but also in shape and amplitude the simplest interpretation of these characteristics is changes in the geometry of starspots resulting in the variable lightcurve shape and amplitude and in their latitude accompanied by differential rotation resulting in the variable period differential rotation also accommodates the difference between the radialvelocity and mean photometric periods 44 d vs 526 d suggesting a starspot latitude of 20 assuming solartype differential rotation and equatorial synchronisation if sbss 1310 is representative of its spectral subclass then the targets appear to be differentially rotating tidally synchronised stars source of stellar activity there are two basic possibilities for the source of stellar activity in dc stars as manifested by h and similar emission features an intrinsic source via relatively rapid stellar rotation and an extrinsic source via irradiation in order to heat a lowmass star to sufficiently high local surface temperatures that emission lines are excited a whitedwarf companion must be close to the irradiated star and fairly luminous based on a comprehensive study of stellar activity as traced by h emission in m dwarf companions to white dwarfs rebassamansergas et al 2013 it was found that activity is nearly always intrinsic for both partly and fully convective stars furthermore while the influence of magnetic braking is seen for partly convective stars in wide binaries those m dwarfs in shortperiod orbits resulting from a common envelope all remain active this fact alone argues that irradiation is not the cause of stellar activity in lowmass stars closely orbiting white dwarfs and the study furthermore demonstrates that only white dwarfs with an irradiating flux that is at least 3 higher than the intrinsic m dwarf flux can result in emission rebassamansergas et al 2013 none of the seven shortperiod dc stars in this study approaches this level of irradiation eg the 30 000 k white dwarf in cbs 311 is only 15 more luminous than its companion and thus falls drastically short of this criterion at the surface of the dc star therefore irradiation cannot be responsible for the observed activity in dc stars the remaining possibility requires relatively rapid rotation to generate a solartype dynamo parker 1955 and an active chromosphere boro saikia et al 2018 the fact that dc stars with emission lines are relatively rapid rotators is clearly evidenced by xray detections in six out of six observed cases green et al 2019 including four of the stars analysed here there are three potential angular momentum sources for the rapid rotation observed in dc stars intrinsic spin of formation spinup owing to mass transfer and tidal synchronisation in a binary three lines of evidence discount the idea that dc stars are relatively young and hence still rotating rapidly due to their youth one is their overall kinematical properties that suggest a mixture of old disc and halo stars farihi et al 2018 second is the indication from population synthesis that metalpoor stars are more readily polluted to co 1 than solar abundance stars de kool green 1995 and third is through estimating the cooling ages of their whitedwarf companions the actual masses and temperatures of dc stars are certainly not well constrained and not established yet at any level of confidence but based on their positions on the hr diagram they should be partly convective stars with parameters comparable to latetype dwarfs and because of inevitable magnetic l j whitehouse et al 008 sector 15 pphot 517 d sector 16 pphot 526 d sector 22 pphot 531 d 006 m mag normalised lombscargle power 004 002 000 002 004 frequency d 006 phase figure 6 left the normalised ls periodograms computed from the individual tess sectors for sbss 1310 right the lightcurves of each sector phasefolded to the 526 d period determined from the analysis of all tess sectors combined and using the time of the first observation as the arbitrary phase zero there is a clear increase in amplitude for sector 22 relative to the first two observed sectors completed 139 days prior changes in the lightcurve shape and period result in the offsets in phase of maximum brightness braking skumanich 1972 mcquillan et al 2013 they require an extrinsic origin to their current spins assuming their total ages are at least a few gyr thus only mass transfer or tidal synchronisation remain as possibilities for the observed spininduced stellar activity and it should be noted that both can occur that is they are not mutually exclusive however it is noteworthy that the latter can erase any evidence of the former eg in the case the dc was once spinning faster than the orbital period if some fraction of the emissionline dc stars are the product of spinup through mass transfer and not the result of tidal synchronisation in shortperiod binaries the observed rotation rate would be an indication of how much mass the system has accreted therefore measurements of the rotation rates in any systems that are not shortperiod binaries would provide constraints on the amount of mass and angular momentum accreted and thus inform mass transfer models izzard et al 2010 matrozis et al 2017 period distribution the overall results indicate clearly that h emission in dc stars is linked to shortperiod binarity in fact of the ten dc stars with constrained orbital parameters there are two distinct families those with h emission all have orbital periods of a few days or less those without detectable h emission have orbital periods of several months or longer dearborn et al 1986 harris et al 2018 margon et al 2018 the data at hand suggest that the orbital period distribution of the dc star population may be bimodal and thus consistent in some key aspects with the vastly more commonly occurring mtype dwarf companions to white dwarfs in general such bimodal populations are consistent with the postmain sequence removal of intermediateperiod orbits via a combination of commonenvelope evolution for shorter periods and the reduction of gravitational binding energy due to mass loss for longer periods however there is a notable difference in the dc star binary population and that is the orbital periods on the order of years which are absent in the carbonnormal mdwarf companion population orbiting white dwarfs farihi et al 2010 nebot gmezmorn et al 2011 ashley et al 2019 it is tempting to speculate that the dc companion orbits may differ from dm companion orbits owing to mass transfer but that is beyond the scope of the current study nevertheless it is clear that the shortperiod dc binaries have experienced a common envelope izzard et al 2012 ivanova et al 2013 if the emissionline dc stars have evolved through a commonenvelope phase and assuming their carbon enhancement is extrinsic then this suggests relatively stable mass transfer prior to the common envelope extrinsically carbonenhanced binaries possessing shortorbital periods are rare amongst the ba ch and cemps populations which typically possess orbital periods of many months or years lucatello et al 2005 jorissen et al 2019 only two stars are known to have orbital periods shorter than ten days one of these is the central binary in the necklace nebula with a 12 d orbital period and whose exact link to other carbonenhanced populations remains to be determined miszalski et al 2013 the other is he 00242523 a 09 m mainsequence star with a 34 d orbital period measured through radialvelocity monitoring lucatello et al 2003 and a ch spectral class similar to the shortperiod binaries found here he 00242523 is suspected of receiving mass transfer from an evolved companion before evolving through a common envelope however there is no evidence of shortperiod photometric variability or rotation in he 00242523 despite decent quality tess data and the star lacks emission lines the lack of shortorbital period ba ch and cemps stars could be due to their earlier spectral classes and advanced evolutionary stages compared to dc stars these other carbonenhanced binaries are typically fgk stars that have evolved onto the first ascent giant branch in the case that evolved carbonenhanced stars can potentially experience two commonenvelope phases this may observationally select against shortperiod systems as they may have resulted in cataclysmic variables or a mergers escorza et al 2017 in contrast the dc stars with short orbital periods found todate will remain detached for up to a hubble time until the lowmass dc star itself leaves the main sequence it is almost certain that dc stars far outnumber their evolved counterparts and those with short periods should prove fruitful in aiding mass transfer models for all extrinsically carbonenhanced systems mnras 000 000000 0000 active dc stars with short orbital periods conclusions this study analyses timeseries radialvelocity and photometric data for seven dc stars with h emission lines six of the dc stars analysed here are found to possess orbital periods in the range 02 44 d along with photometric periods that are either identical in the case of j0901 and j1015 or within a few tens of per cent of the orbital period the seventh dc star j0842 lacks significant radialvelocity variations but possesses a 0945 d photometric period and if these periods are similar it would be difficult to detect through groundbased radialvelocity measurements binary lightcurve simulations suggest that the origin of the photometric variations observed in these emissionline dc stars is consistent with rotation none of the lightcurves show any evidence for a day and nightside effect or tidal distortion and while irradiation is physically plausible in two of the seven systems it is unlikely based on binary inclination and companion brightness estimates thus rotation is the most likely cause for the observed photometric variations the mostly sinusoidal behavior of the best observed light curves is not necessarily expected for a random assortment of starspot latitudes and stellar spin inclinations but both the lightcurve data quality and the number of shortspin period dc stars are insufficient to determine further constraints on the geometry and number of starspots the expectations of magnetic braking are such that the dc stars should be spinning an order of magnitude more slowly than observed and their ages are consistent with sufficient time to have become tidally synchronised to their visible or unseen and presumed to be whitedwarf companions tidal synchronisation provides the most consistent picture for these shortperiod dc star binaries and provides the additional angular momentum needed for spinup which in turn powers the emission lines through a solartype dynamo however mass transfer cannot be ruled out but in the sample studied here mass transfer is only necessary for the extrinsic source of pollution and not for spinup lastly at least a few of the dc stars appear to be differentially rotating as evidenced by photometric periods that are similar to but somewhat longer than their orbital periods as well as at least one system with changing photometric period and variability amplitude this study more than doubles the number of dc stars with constrained orbital periods and increases those known to be in shortperiod orbits from one to six it appears the dc binary period distribution may be bimodal with a postcommonenvelope population as studied here and a wider population with periods on the order of months to years interestingly the other wellstudied carbonenhanced stellar populations lack a shortperiod postcommonenvelope population and it is likely the dc stars will provide key insight into mass transfer models on the basis of these and future orbital period determinations acknowledgements lw would like to thank p
