presence of a stellar companion can place constraints on occurrence and orbital evolution of satellites orbiting exoplanets ie exomoons in this work we revise earlier orbital stability limits for retrograde orbits in the case of a three body system consisting of starplanetsatellite the latter reads acrit sat 066811236ep for ep 08 in units of the hill radius and represents the lower critical orbit as a function of the planetary eccentricity ep a similar formula is determined for exomoons hosted by planets in binary star systems where ep is replaced with the components of free and forced eccentricity from secular orbit evolution theory by exploring the dynamics of putative exomoons in centauri ab we find that the outer stability limit can be much less than half the hill radius due to oscillations in the planetary orbital eccentricity caused by the gravitational interaction with the binary star we show furthermore how the resulting truncation of the outer stability limit can affect the outward tidal migration and potential observability of exomoons through transit timing variations ttvs typical ttv rms amplitudes induced by exomoons in binary systems are 10 min and appear more likely for planets orbiting the less massive stellar component 1 introduction the detection of the first exoplanets wolszczan frail 1992 mayor queloz 1995 established unequivocally that planets like those in the solar system can form around other stars and be detected using existing technology however there are more moons satellites within the solar system than planets and if planets are abundant then moons should be as well the detection of exomoons is the next frontier after the first planets the method of transits was identified as a viable detection method for them sartoretti schneider 1999 later holman murray 2005 and agol et al corresponding author billy quarles billylquarlesgmailcom quarles et al 2005 showed the detection of earthlike planets was possible using transittiming methods which implied that the era of exomoon detection could also be forthcoming cabrera schneider 2007 kipping 2009ab showed the architectures of planetmoon pairs that would produce the strongest observational signatures through transit timing and duration variations recently kipping teachey 2020 and kipping 2021 detailed the expected limitations on observational signatures using transit timing variations finding such signatures would theoretically be possible through observations with the kepler space telescope but an extensive analysis of its data did not readily confirm any exomoons kipping et al 2012 2013ba 2014 2015b careful analysis did rule out several false positives including one candidate for kepler90g kipping et al 2015a alternative methods from transit timing were also proposed for the detection of exomoons including using the averaged light curves simon et al 2012 optimizing with respect to the orbital sampling effect heller 2014 heller et al 2016 hippke 2015 doppler monitoring of directly imaged exoplanets agol et al 2015 vanderburg et al 2018 or examining the radio emissions from giant exoplanets noyola et al 2014 2016 the stability of exomoons is also a major concern when prescribing the various means of detection although largely unconstrained tidal interactions play a significant role in determining the lifetimes of solar system moons and those orbiting exoplanets barnes obrien 2002 lainey et al 2020 however sasaki et al 2012 sasaki barnes 2014 placed constraints on the longterm evolution of exomoons by exploring a wide range of tidal parameters eg tidal love number and tidal quality factors moreover namouni 2010 and trani et al 2020 tracked the fates of exomoons that could have formed prior to substantial inward migration of their host planets and found the shrinking planetary hill radius rh to cause such moons to become unstable spalding et al 2016 expanded this analysis to identify a mechanism within the evection resonance that causes significant eccentricity growth where collisions can occur with the host planet or eventual tidal breakup due to crossings inside the roche limit eccentricity growth can also be induced through interactions with neighboring planets where the strength of the interactions can be scaled by the host planets hill radius payne et al 2013 furthermore lidovkozai oscillations with a tilted exomoon orbit can promote eccentricity growth of the host planet where the precession rate from short range forces must greatly exceed the precession from the lidovkozai interaction to ensure exomoon stability grishin et al 2018 sucerquia et al 2019 showed that exomoons can be captured by the host star as a ploonet where the moons can escape instead of collapsing onto their host planet during migration and can complicate the detection of exoplanets domingos et al 2006 produced estimates for the outer stability boundary for prograde and retrograde exomoons based upon numerical simulations and scaled their results relative to the planetary hill radius rh but those results overestimate the outer stability boundary by 20 for prograde orbits rosariofranco et al 2020 and represent the upper boundary of a transition region for stability dvorak 1986 exoplanet searches have also uncovered planets that orbit two stars in either a circumstellar eg  cep campbell et al 1988 hatzes et al 2003 or circumbinary configuration ie kepler16 doyle et al 2011 kepler34 35 welsh et al 2012 kepler38 orosz et al 2012a kepler47 orosz et al 2012b 2019 kepler64 schwamb et al 2013 kepler413 kostov et al 2013 kepler453 welsh et al 2012 kepler1647 kostov et al 2016 kepler1661 socia et al 2020 toi1338 kostov et al 2020 each of these systems hosts a giant planet in terms of its bulk composition ie planetary mass and radius those planets range from neptunelike to jupiterlike quarles et al 2012 and hamers et al 2018 showed the potential for the circumbinary giant planets to host moons however an equivalent studied has not been performed for circumstellar systems which is the focus of this work the formation of exomoons around circumstellar planets in binaries could proceed through similar processes put forward for the solar system ie canup ward 2006 or potentially through tidal capture as has been proposed for the exomoon candidate kepler1625bi hamers portegies zwart 2018 the stability of the circumstellar host planets can also be influenced on the secular forcing from the secondary star andradeines eggl 2017 or mean motion resonances that can eject the planet from the system quarles et al 2020a due to the formation scenarios and constraints for orbital stability the exomoons orbiting these giant planets can do so in a prograde or retrograde direction relative to the orbital direction of the host planet jupiter has captured many moons and their retrograde orbits are taken as a telltale sign of this evolution jewitt haghighipour 2007 in this work we apply an analytic framework for the stability of exomoons that orbit planets in binary star systems using the secular forced eccentricity and overlap of mean motion resonances in section 2 in section 3 we present the results of nbody simulations of a hypothetical planetmoon system in centauri ab and compare the numerical result to the predictions of the theoretical framework in addition we test whether the outward tidal migration is affected by the stellar companion in section 34 section 4 explores the observational signature of exomoons through transit timing variations for exomoons in binary systems and estimates the number of potential systems using the statistics for the stellar binary population section 5 summarizes the key findings of our work 2 analytic criteria for exomoon stability with a strong perturber 21 secular forced eccentricity the secular forced eccentricity from the three body problem can provide a simple analytical estimate on the region of stability around a planet orbiting one star of a binary star system in such a system the exomoon exists in a three body hierarchy where it orbits a planet that in turn orbits its host star in addition a secondary star orbits the center of mass of three body system at such a distance so that the planetary orbit remains stable to produce a hierarchical four body configuration various aspects of the stability of hierarchical four body configurations have been investigated in some detail eg milani nobili 1983 liu gong 2019 and references therein most approaches are based on jacobi quasi integrals c2 e where c is the angular momentum and e the total energy of the system ie marchal bozis 1982 jacobi integrals are constants of motion in the circular restricted three body problem related to zero velocity curves in order for a three body configuration to be hill stable the value of c2 e must be less than the critical value at the lagrange point l1 if that is the case the zero velocity surface prevents a massless exomoon from escaping its orbit around the planet although this concept can be shown to yield rigorous and sufficient criteria derived expressions for stability limits are often lengthy and cumbersome to use especially in the general three and four body problems where the jacobi integrals are not constant we consider the hierarchical four body problem as two coupled three body problems 1 planetmoonhost star and 2 planetmoon barycenterhost starstellar companion in the first three body hierarchy the planetary semimajor axis ap relative to the host star is much larger than the moons semimajor axis asat relative to the host planet ie ap fl asat then the radius of the hill sphere around the planet depends on the planetary semimajor axis and masses through mp msat rh ap quarles et al where mp msat and m are the masses of the host planet moon and host star respectively the above definition corresponds to the hill radius for a circular planetary orbit in a more general formula ap is replaced by rp which also includes the planetary eccentricity ep as a consequence rh depends on the position of the planet on its orbit with a minimum at  1 ep rh since the planet moon and host star form a hierarchical triple the semimajor axis of the moon around the planet remains approximately constant over time to guarantee hill stability of a moon around the planet we have to identify pathways for the moon to escape the hill sphere around the planet which typically occurs when the planet is at periastron under an external perturbation the hill radius rh is modified as the planetary eccentricity evolves georgakarakos 2003 where a simple model for the planetary orbital eccentricity evolution in a hierarchical system dates back to heppenheimer 1978 in essence the eccentricity of the planetary orbit can be decomposed into forced and free components andradeines eggl 2017 the former is determined by system parameters such as the ratio of semimajor axes and the eccentricity of the stellar binary and can be derived from initial conditions in their simplest form the equations for the forced and free amplitudes of the eccentricity vector read as 5 ap ebin 4 abin 1 e2bin and p epo p where epo and ap are the initial eccentricity and semimajor axis of the planet p the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the stellar binary are denoted by abin and ebin respectively the maximum planetary eccentricity epmax can be estimated by adding the amplitudes of the forced and free components of the respective eccentricity vector epmax p p in our four body configuration the influence of the secondary star induces variations in the planetary eccentricity as the the system evolves as a result we determine the smallest extent of the planets hill radius as mp msat rhmin ap 1 epmax to become unbound a moons orbital energy h must exceed the gravitational potential u where this can occur when rsat rhmin 2 we ignore the moons eccentricity esat because the amplitude of its forced eccentricity is small sat asat ap fi 1 thus we can construct a simple stability criterion for moons around planets that orbit one star of a binary star system namely 1 0 acrit 1 p p rh sat rhmin where p and p are the forced and free eccentricities of the planet see equations 3 and 4 and rh is the hill radius for a circular planetary orbit moons on stable orbits would have semimajor axes crit asat acrit sat note that in equation 7 asat is given in units of distance for the remained of this article we will measure acrit sat in units of rh 22 stability limitations from mean motion resonances for moderate planetary eccentricity ep 03 n1 mean motion resonances mmrs between the planetary and satellite orbits add an additional component to the eccentricity evolution of the satellite for example the 81 mmr occurs for asat 036 rh and the 91 mmr occurs for asat 03 2 13 rh kipping 2009a rosariofranco et al 2020 the libration width rh following an sat 3n of mmrs grows with the perturbers eccentricity ie ep which can allow for the overlap of mmrs to destabilize a significant range in asat murray dermott 1999 mudryk wu 2006 morais giuppone 2012 from mardling 2013 we calculate the libration width n of the n1 mmrs using the following 6h22 214 sat sat  n 23 23 1 e2sat 1 e2p 38 n 34 en ep 2 mt mp msat 43 ep where h22 071 is a scale factor from the spherical harmonic expansion of a pendulum model for resonance m is the mass ofpthe host star mt is the total mass of the starplanetsatellite system and ep cosh1 1ep 1 e2p note that n 0 for esat 0 which implies that circular satellite orbits are always stable in this model and this is not the case as noted by mardling 2013 when calculating n for circular orbits we use esat 103 or ep 103 to avoid the complication noted by mardling or the singularity for ep 0 respectively using an earthmass moon on a circular orbit around a jupitermass planet we produce figure 1 to illustrate the locations of the n1 mmrs for such exomoons the host star is assumed to equal  cen a in terms of its mass 1133 m and luminosity 1519 l the white curves in fig 1 are determined through an sat n and the colorcode denotes the order n of the mmr the black regions represent configurations between the mmrs and the light green solid curve in figure 1 traces the first intersection points between adjacent mmrs and can be calculated numerically using n 1 a root finding function for an sat n asat n 1 an initial condition to the right of the light green curve becomes unstable due to the overlap in the mmrs and this process can be slow due to the eccentricity growth timescale of the satellite however in our four body configuration the planetary eccentricity undergoes oscillations due to secular forcing by the secondary stellar companion as a result the light green curve can shift leftward and more efficiently destabilize prograde satellites retrograde satellites are less affected and can survive for a longer timescale at a much larger satellite separation henon 1970 but chaotic diffusion within the mmr overlap can lead to instabilities on longer timescales 3 numerical determination of exomoon stability in this section we numerically investigate the limits for the stability of satellites in a hierarchical four body problem the general setup of our simulation is detailed in section 31 the retrograde satellite stability limit domingos et al 2006 is revisited in section 32 to identify the lower critical orbit boundary that was previously overlooked section 33 examines the limits to exomoon orbital stability using the cen ab system finally the effects of the planetary and stellar tides on earthmoon analogs are explored in section 34 31 simulation setup initial conditions quarles et al nbody simulations provide a direct test of exomoon stability and we use the orbital integration package rebound rein liu 2012 rein spiegel 2015 because it is a versatile tool for the evolution of complex nbody systems we use the whfast and ias15 integration schemes within rebound to evaluate the stability of exomoons ie rosariofranco et al 2020 on 105 or 106 year timescales using an initial timestep that is 25 of the exomoons initial orbital period since our initial timestep is very small compared to the period of stellar binary the whfast integration scheme maintains sufficient accuracy we verified this using the ias15 adaptive integration scheme at high planetary eccentricity the 105 year timescale is sufficient for the most cases because the typical orbital timescale for an exomoon is much shorter 01 yr and the secular timescale for perturbations from the stellar companion is 104 years eg centauri ab quarles et al 2018a quarles lissauer 2018 quarles et al 2019 perturbations from the stellar companion on retrogradeorbiting exomoons are weaker especially in the habitable zone of each star and require the longer 106 year integrations our definition of stability is for an exomoon that begins on a circular coplanar orbit to survive for the full integration time unstable conditions are those that cause the exomoon separation rsat to exceed the host planets hill radius rsat rh or crash into the host planet rsat rp our simulations use the centauri ab cen ab binary to identify the extent of exomoon stability because the stellar masses separation and eccentricity are wellknown which is important for our criteria in section 2 pourbaix boffin 2016 provide values for cen ab based on analysis of archival data from harps the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher at the eso la silla 36 m telescope pourbaix boffin find the masses of star a and b are 1133 m and 0972 m respectively while the binary orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity are 237 au 1766 arcsec and 0524 respectively these values update the previous analysis pourbaix et al 2002 and find good agreement with estimates from asteroseismology lundkvist et al 2014 in our simulations the binary companion is coplanar begins at periastron and is nodally aligned see table 1 our choice for the binary initial phase affects the stability of planetary orbits sufficiently near the stability limit quarles et al 2018b 2020a where the initial separation of the host planets in this work are in a regime that is longterm stable considering a wide range of initial phases for both the binary and planetary orbit quarles et al 2020a since the existence of planets in cen ab is currently unknown much less their atmospheric composition we choose an initial condition close to the inner edge of the conservative habitable zone eggl et al 2020 the habitable zone hz is commonly defined as the region where liquid water could potentially exist on the surface of a rocky planet and depends among other things on the properties of the incident radiation and composition of the planets atmosphere kasting et al 1993 kopparapu et al 2014 eggl et al 2020 we place the planet at 1232 au around star a and 0707 au around star b terrestrial planets on circular orbits at these semimajor axes receive one solar constants worth of radiative flux annually for a planet orbiting cen a the planets semimajor axis ap is sampled at 1232 au 2 au 225 au or 25 au as star a has a greater chance to host planets as far out as 225 au quarles lissauer 2016 for a planet orbiting cen b the planets semimajor axis begins at 0707 au or at 2 au respectively in both cases the planetary orbit starts coplanar ip 0 with the binary orbit with zero obliquity p 0 and is nodally aligned p p 0 most of the observed circumstellar planets in binary systems are jupiterlike giants schwarz et al 2016 for the planetary mass mp and radius rp we use values identical to jupiters in our orbital stability simulations prior studies of the satellites in

ward 2006 suggested that insitu formation of moons from circumplanetary disks around giant planets are limited to 104 mp due to the estimated flux of infall material from the circumstellar disk but this prediction awaits confirmation from exoplanet observations we use an earthmass exomoon msat in our simulations due to the potential of tidal capture through scattering events and the flux of smaller infall material could be larger than was for the solar system due to the formation environment of the binary stars however we switch to an earthmoon analog for the planetmoon system when considering the possible effects of tidal evolution see section 34 this is motivated by observational constraints for cen ab zhao et al 2018 and the comparisons that we make with the solar system for the exomoons we explore prograde and retrograde orbits because both are ubiquitous within the solar system jewitt haghighipour 2007 where there could be a higher incidence of scattering during the early stages of planet formation quintana et al 2002 2007 haghighipour raymond 2007 since we are investigating longlived exomoons we expect that the tidal dissipation in the host planet to efficiently align the exomoons orbit with the planetary equator ie coplanar with the planetary and binary orbits and circularize the exomoons orbit as a result our numerical model begins the exomoons on circular esat 0 orbits that are nodally aligned sat sat 0 with the planet and binary orbits we vary the planetsatellite separation asat as a fraction of the planets hill radius starting at 025 rh and up to 07 rh in 001 rh steps where the 025 rh is just interior to planetsatellite mmrs and 07 rh is the theoretical limit for stability for retrograde small bodies in the circular restricted three body problem quarles et al 2020a following rosariofranco et al 2020 we evaluate 20 initial phases fsat that are randomly drawn between 0 180 from a uniform distribution for each exomoon semimajor axis asat when constructing our initial conditions we use the above prescribed orbital elements and convert pairwise eg apsatb to the cartesian positions and velocities the center of mass between the planet and satellite typically resides within the planet and thus our results are indistinguishable from a jacobian construction of initial conditions table 2 summarizes the parameter ranges that we explore for the orbital stability simulations 32 revised retrograde stability limit previous studies henon 1970 innanen 1979 hamilton burns 1991 domingos et al 2006 show that the extent of stable orbits for retrogradeorbiting moons is substantially larger than for a prograde moon domingos et al 2006 explored how the stability limit for retrograde satellites varied with the planet and satellite eccentricity however the simulations by domingos et al evaluated only a single initial phase fsat 0 to formulate the stability boundary as a result the empirically determined retrograde stability limit was actually the upper critical orbit dvorak 1986 this distinction to their study was discussed recently for the case of progradeorbiting satellites rosariofranco et al 2020 moreover quarles et al 2020a numerically expanded the jacobi constant quarles et al table 2 parameter ranges used in orbital stability simulations parameter unit rangevalue 318 l 2 225 25 000 060 msat asat 025 070 0 180

simulations of retrograde earthmass exomoons hosted by jupitermass planet that orbits 1 au from its solarmass host star see section 31 the exomoon begins on a circular orbit where the host planets eccentricity is varied from 006 in 001 steps we test initial exomoon semimajor axis values starting within 025070 rh where the outer limit is the determined from the jacobi constant criterion eberle et al 2008 quarles et al 2020a the planet and satellite orbits begin nodally aligned where we evaluate 20 random values for the initial satellite orbital phase fsat figure 2 illustrates the relation between the initial satellite separation asat and the planetary eccentricity ep using a colorcode for the fraction of initial phases fstab that are stable for the full integration timescale of 105 years since these simulations lack a stellar companion the longer 106 timescale described in section 31 is unnecessary but will be used for retrograde systems in section the white cells in figure 2 mark when all 20 trials either collide with or are stripped from the host planet the black cells mark when all 20 trials are stable where the colored cells show the transition the black dashed curve marks the prediction from the fitting formula by domingos et al 2006 where the red solid curve denotes our fitted stability boundary using a linear function in the planetary eccentricity in units of the hill radius rh acrit sat c1 1 c2 ep and the gray curves show the uncertainty in our estimate equation 9 has a similar structure as equation 7 where the planetary eccentricity is used directly instead of the maximum eccentricity because the planetary eccentricity is nearly constant in time for these sunjupitersatellite systems with negligible tidal interactions figure 2 demonstrates that the boundary from domingos et al 2006 and our boundary represents the upper and lower critical orbits dvorak 1986 respectively our stability boundary recovers the limit set by the jacobi constant criterion eberle et al 2008 quarles et al 2020a for circular planetary orbits the red solid curve is fit by the coefficients c1 0668 0006rh and c2 1236 0019 using our outer stability limit coefficient c1 is 132 important because it significantly affects the limiting satellite mass msat c1 through tidal migration barnes obrien 2002 33 orbital stability in centauri ab table 3 stability coefficients

but the perturbation strength scales with the pericenter distance of the secondary star and the initial semimajor axis of the planet eg david et al 2003 quarles et al 2018b we perform numerical simulations see 31 of prograde and retrograde orbiting satellites using the cen ab binary and consider host planets whose orbits begin at the inner edge of their respective hzs 1232 au or 0707 au or closer to their respective stability limits ap 225 au cen ab is representative of moderately wide binary systems raghavan et al 2010 moe di stefano 2017 in terms of its eccentricity and binary orbital period which makes it important as a case study the distribution of binary eccentricity and orbital period is quite broad and we explore the possible impacts on our results in section 42 starting with planets and moons in the respective hz of their host star in cen ab we numerically determine the outer stability boundary for satellites figure 3 we also plot two gray curves that represent the upper or lower critical orbit using the formalism derived in section 2 in units of the planetary hill radius relative to the host star table 2 acrit sat csat 1 p p rh where csat is a scale factor for rh in equation 7 the coefficient csat corresponds to values determined for exomoons in single star systems domingos et al 2006 rosariofranco et al 2020 for prograde and retrograde orbits for the solid gray curve representing the upper critical orbit csat is 05 prograde or 095 retrograde for the dashed gray curve representing the lower critical orbit csat is 04 prograde or 065 retrograde due to the absolute value imposed in equation 3 the gray curves have a peak at the forced eccentricity p similar to figure 2 the colorcode in figure 3 illustrates the transition between stable and unstable orbits in each panel the solid curve encapsulates nearly all the potentially stable cells while the dashed curve marks the more conservative inner boundary the curves fit reasonably well because the eccentricity growth of the satellite which is the main driver for instabilities grows secularly in this regime moderately eccentric planets ep 03 undergo eccentricity oscillations and mmr overlap causes significant eccentricity growth for the satellite the light green solid curves in figure 3 lower panels mark the boundary where mmr overlap begins in the host starplanetsatellite system those curves shift left and right as the system evolves there are a handful of stellar binaries with a separation of 20 au that are known to host jovian exoplanets near the stability limit eg hd 196885ab chauvin et al 2007 correia et al 2008 fischer et al 2009 chauvin et al 2011 cephei ab hatzes et al 2003 torres 2007 with extensive dynamical studies focusing on the stability of the planet thebault 2011 giuppone et al 2011 2012 satyal et al 2013 2014 we perform numerical simulations of similar conditions for a putative jupiterlike exoplanet orbiting either star in cen ab at 2 225 or 25 au from the host star to investigate the stability of moons under more significant perturbations from the stellar companion zhao et al 2018 may have already excluded jupitersized planets at these distances quarles et al using archival radial velocity measurements but our results are scaled by the planetary hill radius and would still be applicable for lower mass planetsatellite pairs as long as msat fi mp figure 4 illustrates our results for prograde orbiting satellites and is similar to figure 3 top row satellites can be stable at larger separations when the host planet orbits its star at the forced eccentricity p see 2 and is apsidally aligned p bin with the binary orbit andradeines  eggl 2017 quarles et al 2018b apsidal alignment is important because it limits the degree of precession for the planetary orbit and minimizes the planets eccentricity oscillations where the maximum planetary eccentricity ep can reach 02 when starting from a circular orbit quarles et al 2018b for an eccentric planetary orbit in the hz of cen ab ep can also vary by 02 over a secular cycle quarles et al 2018b but the magnitude depends on the proximity to the forced eccentricity at the maximum of the planetary eccentricity oscillation the truncation of the planetary hill radius is more significant and significant overlap with mmrs can occur where an ejection of the satellite becomes more probable figure 4 demonstrates this effect through 1 the gray curves marking the upper and lower critical satellite orbits and 2 the light green curves denoting the boundary for overlapping mmrs the dashed light green curves represent a shift of the mmr based curves solid to smaller initial planetary eccentricities by about 02 which is representative of the maximum oscillation of the planetary eccentricity that permits planetary stability from previous studies quarles lissauer 2016 quarles et al 2018b figure 5 illustrates the planetary eccentricity oscillations fig 5ac for three different initial values of ep where the remaining initial conditions are drawn from fig 4c and asat begins at 03 rh figs 5a 5c show a higher variation due to their relative distance from the planetary forced eccentricity p 008 when ap 225 au figure 5df demonstrate the evolution of the satellites apocenter qsat black dots in response to the planets eccentricity variation where the gray dashed curve marks the lower critical orbit boundary light green solid curve denotes the boundary for mmr overlap when esat 0 and the magenta dashed shows the shift of the mmr overlap boundary at the maximum satellite eccentricity the boundary for mmr overlap depends on ep and esat see eqn 8 where increases in esat lead to shifts in the mmr overlap boundary to lower ep values and increases in ep relative to p correlates with a higher likelihood of reaching the new boundary instability can then ensue once the satellite enters the mmr overlap region but this process is chaotic mudryk wu 2006 figure 6 illustrates similar calculations as fig 4 but for retrograde orbiting satellites the overall area is greater due to the enhancement to stability from retrograde orbits and the possible truncation due to planetary eccentricity oscillations is less severe even though more of the parameter space is stable for retrograde satellites the maximum satellite eccentricity is also larger and the possible existence of multiple satellites would constrain the parameter space further giuppone et al 2013 34 tidal migration lifetimes in centauri ab in our solar system the lifetime of moons is significantly constrained by tidal interactions barnes  obrien 2002 sucerquia et al 2019 lainey et al 2020 while constraints have been placed on the longterm tidal evolution of exomoons in single stellar systems sasaki et al 2012 sasaki barnes 2014 this has yet to be established for exomoons in stellar binary systems to obtain a full picture of orbital stability of exomoons in stellar binary systems it is necessary to consider the contribution of planetary and stellar tides in this section we apply a secular constant time lag ctl tidal model and evaluate the migration lifetimes of exomoons within the hzs of each stellar binary component in cen ab analyses of observational surveys zhao et al 2018 have largely excluded jupitermass exoplanets from the hzs of cen ab where the detection thresholds are 53 m and 84 m for star a and b respectively additionally the low tidal time lag in jupiterlike planets k2j tj 102 s or qj 106 see leconte et al 2010 greatly reduces the outward migration of satellites and prevents us from placing a strong constraint using tidal migration on possible exomoons although recent results for saturn suggest substantially faster migration rates could be possible lainey et al 2020 more complicated models for the tidal dissipation in gas dominated exoplanets could be employed eg guenel et al 2014 alvaradomontes et al 2017 but such considerations are beyond the scope of this work as a consequence we use an earthmoon analog in our tidal model instead due to its potential to place meaningful constraints on exomoons in cen ab and because the earthmoon system has tidal parameters that are better understood similar to section 33 the planetary orbits are sampled from the inner edge of their hz but values for exomoons semimajor axis begin at 864 r three times the roche radius of an earthmoon analog we implement a constant time lag secular model leconte et al 2010 hut 1981 and evaluate the tidal evolution up to 10 gyrs this model calculates the secular changes to the semimajor axes ap and asat eccentricities ep and esat and mean motion np and nsat averaged over an orbit the model is scaled by the tidal love number k2 and the time lag t where the latter is proportional to nq1 in the constant phase lag ie constant q tidal models leconte et al 2010 piro 2018 a reasonable time lag for the earthmoon system is 100 s and we assume tp 100 s unless stated otherwise the initial rotation period of the host planet is 5 hours which is consistent with expectations from terrestrial planet formation kokubo ida 2007 the external perturbations from the secondary star on the exomoon are weak compared to the planetary gravitational interactions and a tidal model considering the interactions between the host starplanetmoon are sufficient we use a new module called tidesconstanttimelag from reboundx baronett et al 2021 to test this assumption which is based upon the wellestablished code mercuryt bolmont et al 2015 our implementation of the tidesconstanttimelag module evaluates the instantaneous torques at each timestep using the ias15 integrator and the nbody simulations are evolved for 10 myrs which is an appropriate timescale to see the effects on the satellite orbit due to tides at the time of this writing the tidesconstanttimelag module does not evolve the changes to primary bodys spin due to outward tidal migration of a secondary body therefore we update the spin rate of the primary body periodically using interpolated values of the host planets spin rate from the afore mentioned secular model figure 7 illustrates the results from reboundx solid black and the corresponding secular model dashed red where the two approaches are in agreement to a high degree in both models the exomoons eccentricity grows at similar rates and orbital energy exchanges between the planet and moon become possible since the nbody method is more computationally expensive 12 cpudays we use the secular model for the remainder of this section the outward migration of a satellite varies with both the assumed time lag and with the mass of the satellite we evaluate the outward tidal migration using a broad range in the time lag 10600 s and the satellite mass 0001005 mp over a 1010 year timescale ie main sequence lifetime of a g dwarf figure 8 shows variation in outcomes due to these parameters for an earthmoon analog orbiting either stellar host in cen ab the colorcode delineates the assumed parameter in each quarles et al panel figures 8a and 8b evolve a moonlike satellite 00123 m satellites are stable for the full range of time lags considered for cen a but exomoons can escape after 1 gyr when their host planet orbits cen b for a time lag 100 s for cen b the inner edge of the hz is closer to the host star and the tidal despinning of the host planet is faster which can accelerate the outward migration figures 8c and 8d consider a range of satellite masses where the time lag is held fixed at 100 s there is a smaller range of outcomes when the satellite mass is varied where larger planetsatellite mass fractions 002 msat mp shorten the despinning timescale for the host planet once the host planet is despun the migration changes direction and the satellite begins to fall towards the planet in this case the stellar tide on the host planet is weak enough so that the infall rate is slow as is shown by the flattening of the 005 m curves in figures 8c and 8d if the host planets orbit was 05 smaller then a putative satellite would collide with the host planet within 10 gyrs eg sasaki et al 2012 sasaki barnes 2014 previous studies have historically used tidal migration to place upper limits on satellite masses using a constant phase lag ie constant qp tidal model goldreich soter 1966 barnes obrien 2002 domingos et al 2006 however these efforts are usually limited to cases where the satellite mass is much smaller than the planet ie msat mrmp fi 1 so that the satellite mass is neglected in the formulation of the satellites mean motion nsat additionally the final expression is determined in terms of a fraction of the planets hill radius f see their equation 8 barnes obrien 2002 in the constant phase lag model the satellites semimajor axis changes via the following differential equation murray dermott 1999 3k2p gmp msat msat rp sat asat mp mp asat where g is the gravitational constant rp is the planetary radius k2p is the planetary love number and qp is the tidal quality factor when the initial planetary rotation period is sufficiently short piro 2018 the satellite migrates past the stability limit equation 10 on a timescale t that is determined through the integral of equation 11 resulting in 2 132 af a132 3k2p rp5 msat msat gmp 1 mp mp where af and ao are the final and initial semimajor axes of the satellite respectively for moons that form close to the host planet the term proportional to ao can be neglected because af fl ao to determine the limiting mass ratio we make the substitution xm msat mp and set af equal to f rh where f csat 1 p p from equation 10 rewriting rh in terms of xm as rh ap 1 xm mp 3m 13 and inserting af into equation 12 yields the following expression after straight forward algebraic manipulation 13 132 f ap 1 xm 3k2p t rp5 gmp equation 13 represents the upper limit in the mass ratio xm between the satellite and the planet for a given configuration after a set time t for the range of parameters considered in this work equation 13 has only one real root which is most easily found numerically using a rootfinding algorithm such as the rootscalar function in numpy harris et al 2020 equation 13 reduces to equation 8 from barnes obrien 2002 in the low mass ratio limit ie xm fi 1 as pointed out by piro 2018 equation 13 will hold as long as sufficient spin angular momentum in the host planet is available for the outward migration once the planetary rotation synchronizes with the satellites mean motion the outward migration stops and inward migration towards the roche limit can occur we test the validity of this equation 13 using an earthmass host planet in cen ab over 10 gyr in a constant time lag model tp 100 s following the system setup in fig 8 where the outer stability limit acrit sat is truncated by the planetary eccentricity ep in addition we evaluate a comparable constant q tidal model for a more direct comparison figure 9 shows that equation 13 black curve fits the boundary between stable colored cells and unstable gray cells for planetsatellite mass ratios 102 where the assumption for only outward migration remains valid above this curve there are solutions where the infall timescale after synchronization is longer than 10 gyrs the colorcode denotes how far the satellite migrates outward over 10 gyrs relative to the respective critical semimajor axis and the symbol denotes parameters for an earthmoon analog at the planets forced eccentricity the constant time lag models figs 9a and 9b allow for a smoother transition when the migration direction changes outward to inward migration as compared to the respective constant q models figs 9c and 9d we find that equation 13 is more applicable for planets orbiting cen b because its hz is closer to the host star and when the planetsatellite mass ratio is 23 different assumptions on the dissipation parameter tp or qp can affect the outcome but those also run into limits for plausibility since we are considering earthlike values estimated from the terrestrial planets in the solar system quarles et al 2020b 4 observational consequences for planets in binary systems 41 potentially observing exomoons in centauri through ttvs the presence of exomoons for single star systems can be deduced using transit timing variations ttvs and transit duration variations of the planet as it crosses its host star kipping 2009ab where these measurements also depend on the planetsatellite mass ratio msat mp and separation asat these factors affect the maximum ttv rms amplitude through the displacement of the host planet from the center of mass sartoretti schneider 1999 where the larger planetsatellite separations increase the ttv magnitude for a given msat mp we examine a hypothetical case of an earthanalog near the inner edge of the conservative hz of each star in cen see fig 3 and how the presence of the stellar companion affects the maximum ttv amplitude for the putative transiting planet due to a prograde orbiting satellite the earthanalog is assumed to be at its forced eccentricity to set the outer stability limit the binary companion primarily affects potential exomoons through the truncation of the outer stability limit planetary tides could also limit the allowed parameters but the tidal dissipation could be plausibly adjusted to allow for longlived exomoons and thus cannot place a meaningful constraint for earthanalogs in cen ab however satellites of earthanalogs in other binary systems with less luminous secondary stars can be meaningfully constrained sasaki et al 2012 quarles et al 2020b figure 10 shows the parameters that can produce 1 2 5 10 20 and 40 min ttvs colorcoded induced by prograde or retrograde satellites an analog of the current earthmoon system in terms of mass ratio and separation is denoted by the symbol which would produce a 2 min quarles et al ttv much larger ttvs 40 min are possible for retrograde orbiting satellites because the outer stability limit is farther from the host planet an instrument similar to the kepler space telescope is ideal for observing circumstellar planets and measuring potential ttvs ford et al 2011 the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ricker et al 2016 has already detected a transiting planet within a stellar triple consisting of mstars ltt 1445abc winters et al 2019 however the planet is likely already tidally locked which may limit its chances to host longlived moons sasaki et al 2012 42 exomoons in other binary systems although an earthanalog in cen ab is a good case study results based on the latter may not translate to other populations of binary star systems in this section we therefore examine the frequency of earthanalogs hosting moons in binary systems more generally through a monte carlo experiment1 in our previous work quarles et al 2019 2020a we used empirically derived probability density functions pdfs from surveys of binary stars with a solartype primary raghavan et al 2010 moe di stefano 2017 the pdf for the binary period distribution is a lognormal distribution for the binary period p in days plogp elogp 2 where 503 228 and 4 logp 7 for the mass ratio q mb ma we use a broken power law pdf pq q n where 1 03 for q 03 and 2 05 for q 03 following moe di stefano 2017 we add to the pdf an excess twin fraction of 01 for q 095 to account for the observed stellar twins an additional power law pdf pe e04 bin is included to account for the binary eccentricity coefficients for these pdfs are numerically determined so that the total probability is equal to unity px dp 1 in contrast to our previous work we ignore the uncertainty in power law exponents as they do not substantially alter the results to generate random binary system parameters we numerically determine the cumulative distribution function cdf for each of the pdfs described above use a draw from a uniform distribution u0 1 and then numerically determine the random variate by parallel array matching the planetary semimajor axis ap is calculated at 1 earth flux s 1l 1au2 and can vary depending on which star is hosting the planet as the pdf for the binary mass ratio varies we adjust the secondary stars luminosity using the common power law approximation of the massluminosity relation for main sequence stars we also assume that the planet begins at its forced eccentricity see equation 3 our final results use the semimajor axis ratio ap abin where the planetary semimajor axis max is normalized by the binary semimajor axis abin we calculate the maximum satellite mass msat assuming an earthmoon analog for tides with a 10 gyr lifetime see section 34 and normalize by the planetary mass mp m we choose 50 random values for the satellite mass and semimajor axis max using uniform distributions within the ranges 3 log msat logmsat  and 005rh asat acrit sat we then use the interpolation map technique quarles et al 2020a to verify that the generated host planet orbit is stable and our formalism from section 2 to determine the outer stability boundary for the exomoon acrit sat once the stability of the planetary and exomoon orbits are validated the ttv rms amplitude is calculated kipping 2009a see their eqn a27 overall we perform 10000 draws from the pdfs representing the binary system parameters and 50 draws of the exomoon parameters mass and separation assuming an earthanalog orbiting the processed data and python scripts underlying this article are available on github the raw data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author primary star with a prograde orbiting satellite the corresponding results are shown in the top left panel of figure 11 the process is repeated under the same condition but with a retrograde orbiting satellite and prograderetrograde satellites for an earthanalog orbiting the secondary star to generate the results presented in the other three panels figure 11 illustrates the estimated number of earthmass planets that could host satellites for a given ttv assuming a solarmass primary star the highest number of systems occurs for widely separated binary systems ap abin 0001 and low ttv amplitudes 03 min higher ttv amplitudes are possible but a large survey would likely be necessary to ensure a detection a retrograde orbiting exomoon around the primary star could produce a larger ttv amplitude 30 min due to the a larger outer stability limit while the maximum ttv amplitude in the other cases is 10 min counterintuitively planets orbiting the secondary star b have a slightly better chance of hosting exomoons because a distance of 1 earth flux is closer to the host star and less likely to be significantly perturbed by the more massive star a these results scale with the primary star mass where more massive primaries 12 m allow for larger ttv amplitudes and less massive primaries 08 m restrict the parameter space due to more significant tidal interactions between the exomoon and host star the primary star of cen ab would be a good candidate for searching for ttv inducing exomoons if transiting earthanalogs were present however surveys of cen ab for planets are difficult because of pixel saturation in photometric observations demory et al 2015 and astrophysical noise in radial velocity observations zhao et al 2018 5 conclusions moons are ubiquitous within our solar system where we expect similar bodies to exist in other planetary systems including those with stellar companions an exomoon is influenced by a strong perturber through free and forced eccentricity of its host planet at the minimum of the host planets eccentricity oscillation the planets gravitational range of influence is truncated which restricts the largest stable semimajor axis for the exomoon additionally overlap in the mmrs between the satellite and planetary orbits allow for putative satellites to escape on relatively short timescales other studies domingos et al 2006 rosariofranco et al 2020 deduced the outer stability limit for prograde exomoons in single star systems we revise the stability formula for retrograde satellites as acrit sat 066841 1236ep in units of hill radii to represent the lower critical orbit we augment previous findings domingos et al 2006 rosariofranco et al 2020 to include a correction using the forced eccentricity see equation 10 determined from secular perturbation theory andradeines eggl 2017 and thus increase the applicability to planets in binary star systems constant time lag hut 1981 and phase lag goldreich soter 1966 models predict that tidal dissipation can cause outward migration to free a satellite from its host planet we apply these models to hypothetical earthmoon analogs in cen ab the eccentricity forcing from cen a on moons hosted by an earthanalog orbiting cen b can destabilize moons on a 10 gyr timescale that have moderate to strong tidal dissipation tp 100 s in the opposite case moons can maintain stable orbits despite strong tidal dissipation tp 600 s although we examine coplanar orbits grishin et al 2018 showed that tilted exomoon orbits can persist if the short range interactions are stronger than those from the lidovkozai mechanism we revise the analytic limit for planetsatellite mass fractions see equation 13 in a constant phase lag ie constant q and compare its validity with an equivalent constant time lag model the maximum planetsatellite mass fraction is most applicable to systems where the host planets semimajor axis is more strongly influenced by quarles et al the host star in cen ab the conservative hzs are distant enough from the host star so that a tidal constraint is less meaningful and the formalism would be more useful for considering exomoons orbiting proxima b angladaescud et al 2016 the truncation of the hill radius through secular eccentricity oscillations and outward tidal migration can influence potential observations of exomoons through ttvs kipping 2009ab the ttv rms amplitude is largest when satellites are close to their outer stability boundaries these mechanisms limit the outer stability limit and can constrain the range of tidal dissipation allowed the maximum ttv amplitude in a system like cen ab is 40 min where we find that an earthmoon analog would exhibit 2 min ttv signature in other binary systems ttvs 1 min appear to be the most common due to trends in the underlying stellar binary population raghavan et al 2010 moe di stefano 2017 the kepler mission has uncovered small ttv amplitudes 1 min for many planetary systems but the significance of the ttv varies widely the astrophysical noise in transit photometry for circumstellar planets is expected to be similar to planets orbiting single stars as dilution from the stellar companion is less of an issue current space missions like the transiting exoplanet survey satellite tess focus on short period planets which have likely already lost their moons due to the stellar tides future space missions similar to kepler eg european space agencys plato mission that target longer period planets will be ideal in the search for exomoons the search for exoplanets in binary star systems is an active field where many targeted efforts have been applied to cen ab endl et al 2001 2015 bergmann et al 2015 using the radial velocity method new technologies are currently in development that use direct imaging either from a coronagraph belikov et
