375 ghz towards sgr as circumnuclear disk cnd our data comprises 8 individual pointings with significant sio 8 7 7 6 and so 7 6 emission detected towards 98 positions within these pointings additionally we identify h2 cs 9 19 8 18 ocs 25 24 and ch3 oh 2 11 2 02 towards a smaller subset of positions by using the observed peak line flux density together with a bayesian inference technique informed by radiative transfer models we systematically recover the physical gas conditions towards each of these positions we estimate that the bulk of the surveyed gas has temperature tkin 500 k and density nh 106 cm3 consistent with previous studies of similar positions as traced by hcn clumps however we identify an uncharacteristically hot tkin 600 k and dense nh 106 cm3 source in the northeastern arm this position is found to be approximately consistent with a gravitationally bound region dominated by turbulence we also identify a nearby cold tkin 60 k and extremely dense nh 107 cm3 position that is again potentially bound and dominated by turbulence we also determine that the total gas mass contained within the cnd is mcnd 4 104 m furthermore we qualitatively note that the observed chemical enrichment across large scales within the cnd is consistent with bulk grain processing though multiple desorption mechanisms are plausibly responsible further chemical modelling is required to identify the physical origin of the grainprocessing as well as the localised h2 cs and ocs emission keywords astrochemistry galaxies ism ism clouds ism kinematics and dynamics methods observational methods statistical 1 introduction the galactic center and within it the central molecular zone has long been identified as a uniquely extreme environment within the milky way owing to the 41540014106 m supermassive black hole known as sgr a that resides there gillessen et al 2009 abuter et al 2019 such an environment has important consequences for theories of galactic evolution and dynamics as the galactic center can be used as a highresolution laboratory for studying the nuclei of external galaxies however it also has a profound impact on thecorresponding author tomas a james tjamesstaruclacuk ories of both ism physics and chemistry under extreme conditions especially when considering dense molecular gas as precursors to star formation morphologically the inner few pc of the galactic center is chaotic and multifaceted centrally sgr a is situated within a trifecta of ionised gas streams known as the galactic center mini spiral or gcms lacy et al 1980 ekers et al 1983 surrounding the gcms is an extensive torus or ring like structure of turbulent molecular gas known as the circumnuclear ring or circumnuclear disk herein referred to as the cnd eg christopher et al 2005 the diffuse region between sgr a and the cnd known as the central cavity is home to a collection of young and evolved stellar objects including  100 ob stars eckart et al 2004 paumard et al 2006 james et al lu et al 2008 mauerhan et al 2010 that are thought to considerably increase the photoionisation rate within and around sgr a genzel et al 1996 paumard et al 2006 studies of the cnd are complicated by a degree of uncertainty surrounding its exact morphology and kinematics the extent of the cnd is easily identified in low jtransitions of molecules such as cs h2 co and sio martin et al 2012 tsuboi et al 2018 as well as dust continuum emission lau et al 2013 and high jtransitions of molecules like 12co goto et al 2013 such observations identify the cnd as extending radially from 16 pc outwards to 57 pc from sgr a smith mac low 2014 rotating at 110 km s1 between 25 pc ghez et al 2005 genzel et al 2010 however the cnd is not continuous or indeed uniform as occasional regions devoid of emission known as gaps are observed in turn indicating that different molecules are mapping different regions of the cnd notable amongst these gaps is that seen in hcn 10 towards the north of sgr a wright et al 2001 propose that this gap is caused by an infalling arm of the galactic center mini spiral pushing through the cnd as it falls towards sgr a proper producing oh maser emission yusefzadeh et al 1999 in the process it is therefore clear that the gas conditions within the cnd are highly nonuniform and position dependent in addition the interior of the cnd is highly irregular and inhomogeneous exhibiting clump like structures of size 014 043 pc distributed throughout when viewed in the nearir hcn 10 transition guesten et al 1987 jackson et al 1993 christopher et al 2005 a number of theories regarding the physical conditions within these clumps exist and genzel et al 2010 extensively summarises the two prevailing theories as the transient and virial scenarios in summary the transient scenario suggests that the clumps are typically warm 100 k less dense 106 cm3 and tidally unstable with transient lifetimes 105 yrs conversely the virial scenario states that these clumps are cooler 100 k dense 107 108 cm3 and tidally stable with lifetimes 107 yrs crucially this stability affords these clumps the opportunity to begin insitu star formation the tidal instability and therefore shorter lifetime estimate in the transient scenario would not permit any gravitationally bound object formation within the detected clumps tsuboi et al 2018 estimate that some of the relatively low density regions have gas densities in the range 09 6 104 cm3 smith wardle 2014 estimate denser hcn bright cores to have densities in the range 012106 cm3 smith wardle 2014 and independently mills et al 2013 find that the hcn clumps have conditions consistent with that outlined in the transient scenario crucially such studies have not explored kinetic gas temperatures 250 k and thus could fail to highlight hot and dense embedded sources however smith wardle 2014 theorise that the cnd is subject to such large tidal shear that local star formation is unlikely to occur within the cnd in the absence of some triggering event this tidal shear condition could be overcome should selfgravity dominate according to 107 rpc3 cm3 yusefzadeh et al 2017 assuming that the bulk of the cnd is found between 15 2 pc from sgr a as traced by hcn christopher et al 2005 then exceeding the tidal shear condition would require gas density between 2 106 cm3 at r 15 pc dropping to 2105 cm3 at r 2 pc satisfying this criterion is essential for insitu star formation to occur within these clumps ctype shocks originating from clumpclump collisions have been proposed as an efficient heating mechanism within the cnd owing to the high observed temperatures of tkin 200 k bradford et al 2005 harada et al 2015 however star formation as a process also presents multiple opportunities to drive ctype shocks in to the surrounding gas in turn chemically enriching the surrounding ism in a similar manner to clumpclump collisions sio and so as well as other sbearing species such as h2 s are all known shock tracers martinpintado et al 1992 des forts et al 1993 as a result of shockdriven evaporation of grain surface andor mantle subsequent reaction of the evaporated species in the gasphase for example si and s with o can produce molecules such as sio and so previous simulations martinpintado et al 1992 flower et al 2003 holdship et al 2017 james et al 2020 have used these molecules to great effect when tracing star formation related shocks under standard interstellar conditions however as already demonstrated the cnd and its surroundings represent extreme departures from standard interstellar conditions for example the ob star population in the central cavity could increase the photoionisation rate substantially in addition to this the cosmicray ionisation rate within the central molecular zone is much larger than in other regions of the galaxy both yusefzadeh et al 2007 and goto et al 2013 estimate this could extend to an upper limit of between 10 104 s1 assuming a standard galactic ionisation rate of 3 1017 s1 additionally the central molecular zone and its immediate surroundings are known to exhibit large scale distributions of molecules such as ch3 oh gottlieb et al 1979 as well as hcn hnc and hco emission jones et al 2011 detection of these molecules i observations and radiative transfer specifically ch3 oh in abundance is again typical of regions that have undergone grain processing as noted by turner 1998 the gasphase formation routes and efficiencies of ch3 oh in particular cannot account for its measured abundance within the ism instead turner 1998 found that ch3 oh forms readily via successive hydrogenation of co on the grain surface subsequent desorption uv photodesorption being the dominant mechanism in translucent clouds then releases ch3 oh in to the gasphase turner 1998 crucially these formation and desorption pathways are consistent with measured gasphase abundances of ch3 oh yusefzadeh et al 2013 also investigated this phenomenon by comparing chemical models to ch3 oh observations to constrain the mechanism responsible for its gasphase existence as molinari et al 2011 highlight the dust temperature tdust 40 k within the central molecular zone is too low for thermal desorption to be significant they therefore conclude that cosmicray desorption represents the dominant desorption mechanism of ch3 oh within the central molecular zone however on smaller scales applied to the cnd both latvakoski et al 1999 and lau et al 2013 find that the dust temperature can vary positionally from 40 k 200 k in turn showing that thermal desorption could become significant in subregions of the cnd where the dust temperature exceeds 100 k consequently detections of molecules such as sio so and ch3 oh are direct tracers of underlying physical events such as shocks andor regions that have undergone grain processing broadly the detected emission intensity of these molecules is a function of the regions physical gas conditions which are in turn a function of the physical processes occurring within the gas one may derive estimates of the kinetic gas temperature tkin hydrogen number density nh and molecular column densities nspec using radiative transfer codes such as radex van der tak et al 2007 in order to understand these processes in more detail crucially repeating this procedure for each position within and throughout a sample of beam pointings allows mapping of the gas conditions across those pointings permitting a larger scale understanding of the physics and chemistry driving an objects evolution within this paper we present 038 031 spectral observations of sgr as circumnuclear disk and apply the aforementioned radiative transfer methodology to this data we present these observations in section 2 before discussing their implications in section 3 in section 4 we outline our statistical process coupled to radiative transfer that infers the physical gas conditions towards each position

observations project code 2013101242s that target various sio transitions towards the cnd are utilized for this investigation the data presented in figure 1 and table 1 was obtained on 2015 june 8 and consists of 8 pointings with the 12m array each pointing has a total field of view of 1960800 and a synthesized beam of 03800 03100 with pa 72 corresponding to an on sky spatial scale of approximately 00140012 pc we thus assume a beam filling factor of unity the total integration time for each source is 151 s with the relevant baseline tuned at the rest frequency of sio 7 6 303926809 ghz along with a total bandwidth of 9375 mhz corresponding to  900 km s1 the raw data product has a velocity resolution of 05 km s1 3840 channels the data was calibrated with the assistance of standard observatory scripts using casa 470 mcmullin et al 2007 casa was also used to image the data with a 00500 pixel size and 2 km s1 203 hz channel width a briggs robustness parameter of 05 was utilized the result achieved a sensitivity of 5 mjy as shown in table 1 integrated and peak intensity maps were used to visually identify molecular line emission in james et al 28590 29000 declination j2000 010 020

surrounding circumnuclear disk cnd details of the individual pointings can be found in table 1 we follow the naming convention in christopher et al 2005 as well as figure 2 of monterocastao et al 2009 for referring to regions within and around the cnd eg pointing g targets the northeastern arm whilst pointings m and l target the southern extension note the g pointing is distinct and separate from the dust enshrouded sources of g1 and g2 in ciurlo et al 2020 i observations and radiative transfer the data cubes and these identified lines are listed in table 3 within appendix b 21 cnd spectra spatial representations of the 8 pointings that comprise our observations are shown in figure 1 the spectra for each of the 99 positions is shown in appendix a whilst the spectra derived quantities are shown in table 3 of appendix b the circular regions shown in figure 1 represent the approximate field of view of each pointing corresponding to 2100 at 300 ghz within this we follow the naming convention adopted in christopher et al 2005 as well as monterocastao et al 2009 for surveying regions of the cnd as such the g pointing surveys the northeastern arm of sgr a whilst all other pointings survey the interior of the cnd we note that the gpointing and its sources within are distinct and separate from the dust enshrouded sources g1 and g2 highlighted by ciurlo et al 2020 within these pointings each position contains at least either an sio 7 6 or so 8 7 7 6 line only 2 observations n3 irs7  contain only sio 7 6 and so 8 7 7 6 respectively 96 observations within the data contain both sio 7 6 and so 8 7 7 6 transitions the exception is the m4 source in which we do not detect sio 7 6 but do detect both so 8 7 7 6 and ch3 oh 2 11 1 02 transitions whilst sio and so are the most commonly detected molecules ch3 oh forms the third most commonly detected species being present towards 16 different positions ch3 oh 2 11 1 02 is not detected in any l pointing in fact it is most commonly observed within the n pointing additionally our detections of h2 cs 9 19 8 18 are only found within a small grouping of observations within the g pointing furthermore we find ocs 25 24 to have even further localisation being present in only two sources g2 and k13a curiously g2 and k13a are located in two opposite distinct regions within the cnd and do not appear to be causally or spatially related to one another 3 qualitative gas characteristics given the commonality of sio and so emission the ratio isio iso is a useful diagnostic of the most intense emission regions figure 2 shows this ratio as a function of each positions location and extent each aperture within this plot represents the onsky location of a detection described in section 2 with the size of the aperture being approximately equivalent to the total extent in beams as given in appendix b the colour scale employed to fill these apertures is representative of the isio iso ratio as indicated by the vertical colour bar the underlying image represents hcn emission of the cnd its flux density is defined according to the horizontal colour bar within panel 1 the observations g1 g2 g3a and g3b sit along a filament of hcn emission whilst g4 and g5 are situated outside of this structure as noted previously we highlight that these positions and separate and distinct from the g1 and g2 sources identified in ciurlo et al 2020 however the presence of the filament appears to have negligible effect on the isio iso ratio as all sources 1 g1 is found to have a low isio iso ratio of 08 whilst g2 is observed to be slightly lower at 075 the ratio at g3a is consistent with g1 whilst g3b is found to be slightly lower again at 07 however g4 has a ratio approximately consistent with g2 whilst g5 has ratio consistent with that of g1 nevertheless the isio iso ratio implies that the gas in this region has marginally greater so emission than sio in turn indicating a higher density of so than sio within this region when considering panel 2 it is immediately evident that there is again very little variation in the isio iso ratio across the area covered with the exception of k15a and k17 every other observation in this inset plot shows isio iso 1 interestingly k12 k13a and k13b sit along a ridge that demarcates a bright hcn emission cloud from its surrounding background it is this region that is subject to close interaction between the galactic center mini spiral and the molecular gas within the cnd from the isio iso ratio it would appear that this ridge shows stronger so emission than sio emission panel 3 much like panel 2 shows very little variation in ratio the only exception to this uniformity is the multicomponent gas at l19 and l30 l19s surrounding gas shows only single component behaviour making the multicomponent nature of l19 puzzling unfortunately l30 does not have any nearby observation to compare with though it is worth noting than the isio iso ratio for the second component here is the largest ratio seen in the data at 12 this stands in stark contrast to the rest of the observations in panel 3 whose ratios are significantly lower and much more uniform at 1 moreover in addition to l19 and l30 we find 2 further sources in our observations d3 and k8b that exhibit multicomponent behaviour curiously each of these sources contains only sio and so lines broadly figure 2 seemingly indicates that the energetics of the cnd do not vary significantly throughout its extent or from region to region however isio iso is inherently degenerate as the ratio when iso 1 can also be the same as when isio 1 we therefore utilise james et al panel 1 panel 2 k20 k21b k21a k22 k23 k24 k19 k18 2859 g3a g3b k4 k5bk5a k5c k6ak6b k7a k7b k10 k15a k14 k11 k15b k8a k12

identified each circle represents the extent of each position in approximate synthesised beam sizes and its colour denotes the ratio isio iso towards that region as per the vertical colour bar inset plots are labelled as panel 1 3 and show groupings of observations and their observational designations key here is the uniformity in isio iso throughout the dataset most positions show isio iso 15 i observations and radiative transfer a quantitative approach to deriving the gas conditions within each observation 4 gas condition inference procedure both the physics and chemistry of interstellar gas are entangled and thus form a system that is extremely nonlinear and nontrivial to model we simplify this modelling challenge by approaching the problem with nonlte radiative transfer in radex van der tak et al 2007 coupled to a bayesian inference procedure within this scheme we may inform the radiative transfer with a set of independent random variables that define the physical gas conditions monte carlo methods can then be used to explore the physical condition parameter space in turn converging on the most likely gas conditions for each region additionally this approach minimises the number of variables required to model the cnd gas in turn allowing us to determine the physical gas conditions with a minimal number of assumptions a key assumption for applying radex is however that the transitions under consideration are optically thin as is likely the case 41 radiative transfer using this approach we utilise the radiative transfer code radex van der tak et al 2007 to compute the emitted line flux density of the relevant transition for a parcel of gas with physical conditions described by the set of parameters s tkin nh nspec tkin is the gas temperature nh is the molecular hydrogen gas number density and nspec is the column density of the relevant species under consideration owing to the strong uv heating supplied by the ob star population as well as the high temperatures inf erred in the cnd from previous observations we explore temperatures up to 1000 k we used radex owing to its nonlte molecular excitation capabilities as well as its widespread use in studies that model interstellar spectra eg beuther et al 2008 lique et al 2009 van dishoeck et al 2021 including towards the galactic center eg wirstrm et al 2010 amobaladrn et al 2011 armijosabendao et al 2020 we intend to apply more detailed chemical modelling to these regions in future in order to further understand their phenomenology all species within this study utilise temperature dependent collisional data from the lamda database schier et al 2010 for temperatures outside of the calculated temperature range that lamda reports radex fixes the collisional rate constant to the rate constant at the nearest temperature for sio the collisional data has been calculated up to and including collisional temperatures of 1000 k inspecting the rate constants for sio 8 7 7 6 reveals relatively uniform within a factor of 2 behaviour across the apriori temperature range considering a similar process for so 7 6 we note that the collisional rates have been determined up to 300 k much like sio the collisional data for so is similarly constant within the calculated temperature range we therefore assume that given the similar chemical compositions and masses of sio and so the same uniformity in collisional rates is evident beyond 300 k we note similar behaviour within the collisional data for the other molecular transitions detected in our data and we therefore apply the same assumption to all molecules and transitions detected in our observations additionally each observation presented in section 2 has been normalised to units of mjybeam and thus assumes that each observation fills the beam this renders radex computed flux densities as radex assumes a beam filling factor of 1 directly comparable to the observational flux densities presented the assumption of a beam filling factor of unity is further justified as the linear scale of our observations is sufficient to guarantee that the only emission within the beam is from the targeted gas each source is also fully resolved in turn ensuring they fill each beam repeating this procedure for each species and each transition in a given observation allows us to construct a model that represents the synthetic flux density emitted from a region of gas at temperature tkin and gas density nh comprising species column densities nspec constructing the model in this manner assumes that all emission lines contained within it originate from the same thermal component as section 2 showed our observations are consistent with a single component where not it is clear and distinct that 2 components are present either through distinctly different linewidths or bimodal line profiles and they are thus treated as essentially two separate sources in turn being analysed with 2 distinct models however given the complexity of the underlying physics and chemistry and indeed their associated degeneracy it is useful to statistically survey the entire parameter space across each dimension in order to better understand and identify the probable conditions within each observation an ideal process with which to do this utilises bayesian inference 42 bayesian inference bayesian inference is a method of using conditional probability to build statistical parameter distributions james et al for multidimensional data unsurprisingly it utilises bayes theorem defined in equation 1 p d p dp p d p d is defined as the probability of the model fitting the data d given that the data is correct known as the posterior probability p d is the probability of having obtained the data d given a particular model  known as the likelihood p is defined as the probability of the model being correct the prior and p d is the probability that the data is correct the evidence we define the data as being the observed flux densities whilst the model is the equivalent line flux density determined from radex as defined in section we assume flat priors in log space such that within each dimension any value is equally as likely as any other providing that such a value falls within the nonzero prior range the nonzero ranges used for these priors and in turn the extent of parameter spaces explored are shown in table 2 table 2 the preconstrained parameter spaces surveyed in this preliminary study for each explored dimension tkin represents the gas kinetic temperature nh is the hydrogen gas number density and nspec is the species column density corresponding to the species spec parameter tkin nsio nso nch3 oh nh2 cs nocs range unit 601000 103 107 1012 1016 1012 1016 1014 1017 1012 1015 1012 1015 cm3 cm2 cm2 cm2 cm2 cm2 we constrain the upper and lower limits of column density for each molecule to explore by estimating the lte derived column density for the upper and lower limits of temperature shown in table 2 this makes use of molecular data provided by splatalogue remijan et al 2007 we compute the likelihood using the likelihood function defined in equation 2 1 x di i 2 p d exp 2 i where the summation term represents the chisquared statistic within equation 2 di is the ith value of the data i is the ith value of the model corresponding to di and i is the error associated with di by implementing this bayesian procedure we sample from the underlying posterior distribution using randomly sampled variables that define the gas condition these variables thus form the set s to perform this sampling we use the affineinvariant mcmc sampler emcee foremanmackey et al 2013 emcee uses a numbers of walkers to systematically sample the parameter space across a number of steps in turn constructing a series of markov chains all walkers therefore define a representation of the underlying posterior distribution allowing us to identify statistically informed estimates of the most likely gas condition towards each observation we use an ensemble of 500 walkers and we run each walker for a maximum of 1 104 steps every 100 steps we assess convergence in each dimension using the gelmanrubin statistic gelman rubin 1991 we halt our sampling if convergence is judged to have been achieved across all dimensions we follow brooks gelman 1998 in judging successful convergence when the gelmanrubin diagnostic for each dimension 12 for additional confidence we select a cutoff of 115 for achieving sample convergence in addition and where relevant we also visualise our chains using chainconsumer hinton 2016 this approach has a number of distinct advantages when deriving physical gas conditions firstly the number of variables required to define the gas is limited to those required by radex resulting in a relatively low number of dimensions overall additionally within this scheme each dimension is entirely free and is not causally related to any other as such we derive the gas conditions with almost no apriori knowledge of the local chemistry the affineinvariant nature of the emcee sampler thus allows convergence to be achieved independently of the underlying physics andor chemistry beyond radiative transfer thus reducing uncertainty and bias 5 inference results corner plots for individual sources figure 3 shows an example of the corner plot for the g2 source g2 contains the largest number of lines in our sample that our detected towards one region i observations and radiative transfer figure 3 an example corner plot for the g2 source that shows the sampled distributions for each parameter known as dimensions in the model each dimension is shown on the x axis the distributions on the diagonal represents the posterior distributions for the relevant dimension eg the posterior on the top left is the t posterior all other plots in the matrix show the joint distributions of parameters as per their x and y axes that contribute to the associated posterior tight constraints are observed in the joint distributions within all dimensions except t which exhibits broad behaviour along its domain and highlights the broad errors associated with this dimension james et al within this matrix the marginalised posterior distributions for each parameter are found on the diagonal the peak of each of these distributions represents the point of highest posterior density hpd and it this value that is taken to be the most likely model given the data the plots found within the remaining cells represent the joint distributions for the parameters defined by their relevant x and y axes any pair of parameters that are bounded by a dark blue region is within 2 of the hpd whilst everything bounded within the light blue region is within 3 of the hpd considering the marginalised posterior distributions we see that each dimension peaks to a maximum though not without a degree of skewness in the case of t inspecting the joint distributions of all dimensions except t shows roughly symmetrical tight groupings that in general extend to 05 orders of magnitude this produces posteriors that peak strongly though both sio and ocs peak towards the lower boundary of the distributions in this case whilst estimates of t are broad its hpd is reliably constrained in the case of g2 however the skewness in this distribution does serve to highlight the assymetrical errors that we find are often associated with this dimension in this instance the possible values t 350 k become exponentially less likely at t 350 k we observe a small plateau of equal likelihood until t 600 k whereby an approximately linear decrease in likelihood until t 1000 k is encountered unfortunately the large errors and associated systematic uncertainties in temperature are a consequence of the limited number of spectral lines detected and used in this analysis in the majority of cases within this study we require fitting for at least 4 different dimensions using just 2 spectral lines an example corner plot for this scheme is shown in figure 4 which exhibits only sio and so lines as a result figure 4 shows broader constraints in all dimensions and less symmetry in the posterior distributions therein though t does peak despite 3 errors spanning the entire parameter space subsequent inspection of the temperature column of table 4 shows wide asymmetrical errors on almost every constrained temperature serving to highlight the challenge in drawing a discrete conclusion from a continuous asymmetrical and weakly peaked distribution the errors on each parameter become both smaller and more symmetrical in nature when afforded more line detections though the effect on constraining t is slight additionally the broad temperature distributions may be reflective of the weak temperature dependence that is observed in the lamda collisional data for the detected molecular transitions further constraints could be ap plied if additional observations of molecular transitions that exhibit strong temperature dependent behaviour are incorporated 6 inference results gas conditions in the cnd the derived hpd of the physical parameters for each position are shown in figures 5 8 these plots are similar to that in figure 2 however the colour scale employed to fill the apertures here is indicative of the hpd of the relevant dimension under consideration as computed from our inference routine for instance figure 5 shows the hpd of gas temperature tkin towards each observation similarly figures 6 7 and 8 show the hpds of nh nsio and nso respectively semitransparent hatched apertures represent sources that have not achieved reliable convergence within the maximum number of steps available we define nonreliable convergence as any source that has converged to an hpd but without an associated 1 error range table 4 within appendix c shows the hpd for each source and each dimension therein together with their associated error ranges thus considering each image allows the dataset wide distribution of physical conditions to be investigated and quantified 61 temperature the distribution of hpd temperatures thpd across the entirety of figure 5 shows minor correlation on a local level as expected sources in close proximity to one another have broadly similar temperatures in general this behaviour manifests as 50 k between neighbouring sources an example of this is found in panel 1 which shows that g3a and g3b are almost identical in temperature of 100 k both g3a and g3b as well as g1 and g2 are found within a long filamentary structure of hcn emission that extends along the left vertical edge of panel 1 this structure can be regarded as sitting outside of the main cnd structure and represents the 50 km s1 molecular cloud identified in previous studies however both g1 and g2 are warmer than g3a and g3b with tg1 350 k and tg2 600 k additionally panel 1 also shows g5 which is external to the hcn filament g5 is similar in temperature to g3a and g3b with tg5 100 k there is also an unconstrained source on the boundary of the filament that is of similar temperature to g3a g3b and g5 though this sources temperature estimate is likely unreliable nevertheless it would appear that the g3a and g3b observations capture the same gas component whilst g1 and g2 capture colder and warmer extremes of the filament respectively when considering panel 2 we see that the main grouping of observations in the centre of the panel are i observations and radiative transfer figure 4 corner plot for the k1 source as per figure 3 this shows much broader spread in all dimensions owing to the limited number of data points available consistent with temperatures 400 thpd 700 k though there is a significant number of positions that have not achieved reliable temperature convergence additionally 5 of the converged positions are identified as having thpd 500 k interestingly this is consistent with the bulk of the gas being close to the upper limit of the cnd clump temperature as identified by requenatorres et al 2012 there are however 2 constrained hot sources within panel 2 that exceed this limit k15b and k24 of these k24 is the hottest at tk24 800 k whilst k15b is moderately cooler at tk15b 700 k k24 is isolated and much further north than k15b and does not appear to correlate with the underlying hcn emission conversely k15b sits embedded within the cnd and is much closer to cooler sources this therefore indicates that in general the gas temperature is increasing towards the south of panel 2 and in turn to the south of the cnd this is also consistent with the underlying hcn emission becoming brighter towards the south of panel 2 panel 3 shows a similar trend to that observed in the main grouping of panel 2 in that almost every source in panel 3 has temperature within the range 350 thpd 550 k in this instance there are only 2 sources l15 and l25 that deviate significantly from  550 k l25 sits at the furthest extremity of the observation grouping whilst l15 sits centrally within that grouping however we observe that thpd increases from l15 along and down the line of observations towards l6 with l3 and l6 being of comparable temperature the 2 sources either side of l6 l10a and l1  are again of comparable temperatures to l3 and l6 continuing along and up from l15 towards l20 shows that the tight grouping of observations in l20 l21 and l24 are all of similar temperature again thpd 550 k however l25s temperature of thpd 350 k stands in contrast to its warmer surroundings additionally l19 is the observation that showed the largest isio iso ratio in panel 3 as well as globally across all observations panel 3 shows that its temperature is unconstrained though if we consider the estimate in relation to its surroundings then we see no significant deviation from the average thpd of its surrounding observations james et al panel 1 panel 2 k21b k24 900 k6a 2859 g3a

circular regions indicate a position whose chain has not reliably converged g2 in panel 1 is noticeably warmer than its surroundings which are much lower in their recovered temperatures panels 2 and 3 show more agreement between neighbouring positions i observations and radiative transfer 62 gas density when considering the distribution of hpd densities nhpd in figure 6 we see a similar local trend to that observed in temperature in figure 5 such that neighbouring sources are within 02 orders of magnitude of one another additionally we also observe far fewer unconstrained sources than were noted in figure 5 however more uniformity is seen in the determined values of nhpd throughout the cnd as a whole with less than 2 orders of magnitude variation throughout panel 1 shows that in general colder sources are found to be at higher density for example g5 was identified as being 100 k and is in turn here noted to have density ng5 107 cm3 the most dense of any position in our sample whilst g1 and g2 were noted for their different temperatures g1 becoming cooler than g2 panel 1 shows that they are broadly similar in density within their associated error ranges furthermore the same density behaviour is seen in g3a g3b and g4 which were all identified as having similar temperatures when considering panel 2 almost every source sits within the range 1056 nhpd 1062 cm3 even those outside of the main grouping identified in panel 2 of figure 5 the main grouping is found within an hcn bright region that defines the southern extent of the cnd we note that the density range derived here is consistent with the density of hcn bright cores estimated by smith wardle 2014 additionally the hot sources identified in k15b and k24 sit within this range and have densities nk15b 1062 cm3 and nk24 1058 cm3 respectively k13a is identified as having a density towards the upper limit ie nhpd 1062 cm3 though its surroundings are of lesser density when considered in conjunction with k9 and k10 it would appear that this region is tracing the dense innermost ridge of the cnd outside of this grouping we identify that k18 exhibits a large density of nhpd 1064 cm3 this is not consistent with the underlying hcn emission and is not reflected in the density of its nearest neighbour k19 whose density is nhpd 1058 cm3 k18 is therefore regarding as an anomalous position within panel 3 we observe that the l16 source acts as a dividing boundary such that everything north of l16  and thus the northernmost cluster of observations all exist at almost exactly the same density of nhpd 1060 cm3 south of l16 we note that the sources show slightly more variety with l3 being more dense than the average of nhpd 1058 cm3 and l16 being less dense at nhpd 1055 cm3 l12 is a unique outlier in that its density is significantly larger than any other source in panel 3 at nhpd 1064 cm3 within figure 5 l12 does not have a reliable temperature estimate however if we consider the temperature identified we observe that it is 800 k thus potentially forming another nonquiescent region additionally observations that sit within hcn regions or filaments are found to broadly exhibit higher densities than those observations outside of these locations given that hcn emission traces dense gas this is unsurprising though it does lend additional weight to the hot dense sources being embedded nonquiescent regions such as a yso 63 column density much like figure 6 the sio column density in figure 7 shows little variance across the dataset figure 7 shows just over an order of magnitudes variation the effects of temperature and density also appear to be negligible in this case as the regional and local variation seen in figures 5 and 6 are not observed or indeed reflected here for example panel 1 in figure 7 shows almost uniform nsio in the range 10134 nsio 10138 cm2 despite the temperature and density varying widely a noticeable feature of panel 1 is the additional uniformity in nsio for sources within the hcn filament sources outside of this filament eg g5 are found to exhibit a different larger column density notable features within panel 2 show that a tentative trend indicating the brighter the underlying hcn emission then the larger the sio column density for example the upper half of the panel where hcn emission is less intense showing marginally lower column densities than the lower half where hcn emission is more intense curiously k5a k5b and k5c are observed to have lower column density of nsio 10133 cm2 than their surrounding observations this could indicate that the surrounding gas acts to shield the k5 sources and thereby inhibit the emission of sio this is further confirmed when noting that the gas density of k5a k5b and k5c are consistent with their surroundings the lower half of panel 2 is much more uniform of nsio 10136 cm2 with the exception of k8a which has column density nsio 10140 cm2 the inner cnd ridge k9 to k13b all show uniform and consistent column density of nsio 10136 cm2 with this agreement extending behind the ridge until k8a uniquely the previously identified ridge indicated by k12 k13a and k13b shows no distinct sio behaviour relative to its surroundings thus indicating that any interaction between the galactic centre mini spiral and the cnd towards this region is not having an effect on the sio chemistry panel 3 is not dissimilar in broad trend to panel 2 in that it shows the same agreement trends the larger james et al panel 1 panel 2 k20 k23 k24 k19 k18 k6b k4 k5bk5a k5c k6ak6b k5c 2859

jybeam kms figure 7 as per figure 6 but here the colour of the circular regions represents sio column density nsio towards each observation outlined in section 2 james et al nsio is located towards the observations northernmost tip with the column density decreasing towards the south of this complex interestingly this region of relatively large nsio sits within an hcn dark region by application hcn traces dense molecular gas and thus shows that at least in this region that regions of large sio column density are found in dense regions of gas directly north of panel 2 is another grouping of observations that houses the largest derived value of nsio at 10142 cm2 the surrounding observations are also observed to have nsio towards the upperhalf of the derived scale though these observations are consistent with the values of nsio derived towards the series of observations in panels 2 and 3 this is again consistent with the underlying hcn emission tracing dense regions within the cnd ergo grainprocessing as described in section 1 figure 8 shows that almost all sources can be considered to have nso 1014 cm2 a grouping of 3 observations immediately south of sgr a houses the lowest value of nso within our data at 1014 cm2 panel 1 echoes a similar trend to its sio column densities with the largest column density in this panel g5  residing outside of the main hcn filament interestingly g3b is here shown to be nso 1015 cm2 larger than its surroundings in g1 and g2 that show consistent column densities of nso 10145 cm2 g3a and g4 are also consistent with nso 10147 cm2 panel 2 again shows a number of interesting trends specifically a degree of nonuniformity throughout the derived values in the main grouping we observe that whilst the local agreement between neighbouring observations is again evident here it is more evident in the upper half of the panel than in the lower half for instance the collection of sources from k1 to k6b all show nso 10148 cm2 to the south of this complex we find that the observations along the inner boundary ridge k9 to k13b of the cnd show large column densities towards k9 and k13b with the column density in general decreasing towards the centre of this line towards k11 k8a also stands out as a high column density source especially in relation to its lesser column density neighbours however the derived column densities for these sources span around 1 order of magnitude making the individual variation from observation to observation slight this is also true when applied to the interaction ridge which is here observed to be less uniform than in sio however this behaviour is consistent with the isio iso ratio being consistent across the ridge panel 3 again exhibits a similar trend to that seen in figure 7 though there is even less variation in nso throughout this region the hcn dark region towards the northernmost tip of this grouping may again be considered to house the largest values of nso 1015 cm2 the dense nsio observation to the north of panel 2 in figure 7 now shows almost unanimous agreement in nso with its neighbours indicating that whatever mechanism is driving its excess sio chemistry relative to its surroundings is not reflected in its so chemistry when considering the trends in both figures 7 and 8 we see variation in both nsio and nso throughout the data though this variation is slight in both dimensions and likely not large enough to indicate any localised energetic events acting as vectors for excess emission in the vast majority of cases importantly the derived sio and so column densities are larger than the expected quiescent column densities the cnd wide nature of this enhancement suggests that the mechanism driving this excess is universal and likely grainprocessing andor desorption 7 formation mechanisms it is clear that all sources in our data show enhancement of so and sio as already discussed each of these molecules is a known tracer of grainprocessing activity owing to both si and s being far more abundant on the grain surfaces than they are in the gasphase indeed sio and so do not form readily in the gasphase without si or s trapped inon the grains being released in to the gas phase for subsequent reaction with o eg si o sio conversely ch3 oh is thought to form readily on grain surfaces via successive hydrogenation of co where it is subsequently desorbed in to the gasphase by an energetic mechanism such as shock activity eg james et al 2020 or photodesorption eg bertin et al 2016 previous studies of the galactic center on large scales such as those by molinari et al 2011 and yusefzadeh et al 2013 have shown that the gas and dust are uncoupled and that the dust temperature tdust 40 k well below the temperature at which thermal desorption becomes significant when considering smaller scales such as the cnd latvakoski et al 1999 theorise that the dust temperature varies positionally from 40 k to 200 k with the variation likely a result of heating by the ob star population furthermore our analysis has also shown that the density of the most dense clumps to be nh 107 cm3 a density at which the gas and dust are likely coupled either fully or partially goldsmith 2001 as a result thermal desorption could also be dominant within subregions of the cnd this naturally poses the question what physical events are dominant in driving this grainprocessing and are these events associated with specific events such as star formation or is it in i observations and radiative transfer panel 1 panel 2 k20 k22 k23 k24 k19 k18 k6b k4 k5bk5a k5c

circular regions represents so column density nso towards each observation outlined in section 2 james et al stead energetic activity associated with sgr a and its surroundings in the context of star formation driven shock action is an efficient and ubiquitous processor of grains so much so that molecules like sio and so are often used exclusively as tracers of shocks in star forming regions martinpintado et al 1992 des forts et al 1993 as already noted the ob star population in the central cavity could raise the photoionisation rate towards the inner edge of the disc making photodesorption of grain mantle species an efficient desorption mechanism here dense regions further in to the disc may also be subject to photodesorption via secondary photons crucially such widespread desorption activity could act to preprocess the grain mantles rendering molecules such as sio and so unreliable shock tracers in the cnd furthermore the uniform enhancement of sio and so observed throughout our observations is indicative of a large scale process driving this desorption star formation would be expected to occur in a structured manner to the extent that its signatures would be concentrated to relatively small regions of the cnd these signatures are dependent on the evolutionary state of the object they could manifest as cold and dense selfgravitating regions or hot and dense gas swept up in outflows k13a is however one of only 2 observations in our sample that shows significant ocs emission k13as surroundings do not exhibit similar ocs lines indicating highly localised phenomena to the k13a locale the only other ocs positive source is g2 which unlike k13a exhibits ch3 oh and h2 cs emission within k13a we note that the measured linewidth of the ocs line is a factor of 2 less than the measured linewidths of the sio and so lines this is in spite of all lines towards k13a having consistent measured velocities such behaviour could indicate that the sio and so lines are tracing a different thermal component to the ocs line hence we disregard the ocs line towards the position when fitting for k13a as a result the assumption of lte should be cautioned towards this region interestingly when considering the gpointing we find that g2 does not exhibit similar behaviour though there is minor variation in measured linewidth across the detected lines ch3 oh and h2 cs emission are widespread throughout the g pointing creating a unique subset of observations within our sample unfortunately the temperature towards k13a remains unconstrained however if we consider the point of highest posterior density towards k13a as absolute then tk13a 500 k g2 has temperature tg2 600 k as such the presence of ocs could indicate hightemperature chemistry occurring within these regions the nondetections of ch3 oh and h2 cs in k13a is puzzling though k13a is known to sit along the galactic center mini spiral cnd ridge and thus could be indicative of locally different chemistry conversely ocs tracing a separate thermal component towards k13a and the absence of this towards g2 potentially alludes to this interaction nevertheless both of these regions require further chemical follow up study to confirm one may broadly estimate whether the derived conditions towards the positions in this study are indicative of star formation by considering density mass and pressure estimates considering g2 we note that the roche density chandrasekhar 1987 assuming an approximate distance from sgr a of 30 pc is 6 106 cm3 which is marginally smaller than the derived gas density towards g2 thus implying tidal stability considering an estimate of the mass assuming that g2 is spherical and uniform with average density nh 106 cm3 and radius equivalent to 3 beams we find its mass muniform 22 103 m for g2 to be gravitationally bound with linewidth v 20 km s1 then its mass would need to exceed the virial mass mvir using the same process as christopher et al 2005 we find that mvir towards g2 is mvir 40 103 m only marginally larger than muniform as a result g2 could very well be gravitationally bound within the limits of the assumptions applied additionally another potentially bound source is l28 within the l pointing l28 has uniform mass muniform 40 103 m and virial mass mvir 48 103 m and shows the closest agreement between uniform and virial masses within our sample for g5 we note muniform 1 103 m and virial mass mvir 4 103 m however the recovered gas density for g5 of nh 107 cm3 is therefore larger than the equivalent roche density at 30 pc implying that g5 could be able to overcome the tidal barrier to bind itself gravitationally this assumes that g5 is one discrete monolithic clump given that g5s physical conditions render it such an outlier amongst our observed regions it is possible that this region is actually multiple clumps along the line of sight whose spectra sum to produce a single spectra in turn creating the illusion of a spectra consistent with one unified clump we apply a similar process in order to estimate the total molecular gas mass contained within the cnd this can be expressed as mcnd rout  rin h where h represents the height of the cnd based on the underlying hcn maps in figure 2 we assume that this is on average 05 pc for comparison we utilise the same cnd radii reported in tsuboi et al 2018 rin 15 pc and rout 20 pc additionally we assume that the average cnd density is equivalent to the modal density i observations and radiative transfer determined previously 5 105 cm3 this yields a total mass of mcnd 4 104 m tsuboi et al 2018 estimate the molecular gas mass of the cnd based on lte assumptions to be 3 104 m marginally smaller than our estimate however we caution that our observations do not sample the full extent of the cnd especially towards hcn faint regions such as those to the north of sgr a in this instance the use of the modal density derived from our observations which deliberately target dense gas could result in us overestimating the mean density of the cnd in turn biasing our mass estimate when considering both thermal and turbulent pressure one may express the thermal pressure as ptherm kb nt and the turbulent pressure as pturb kb v 2 kb for t 600 k nh 106 cm3 and v 20 km s1 then ptherm kb 109 cm3 k and pturb kb 1011 cm3 k therefore for g2 the turbulent pressure dominates over the thermal pressure in spite of the high estimated temperature towards this region in fact all positions within the g k and l pointings are dominated by turbulence despite their wide range of estimated temperatures additionally this is seemingly independent of their potentially bound states though a more rigorous determination of mass based on lte assumptions and chemical abundances is required to identify more accurate clump masses to compare to their virial counterparts 8 conclusions in this paper we have presented subarcsecond observations from 8 alma band 7 272 375 ghz pointings towards the circumnuclear disk cnd of sgr a we detect clear and distinct sio 8 7 7 6 and so 7 6 emission towards 98 positions within these pointings additionally we observe widespread ch3 oh 2 11 2 02 emission as well as more localised emission of h2 cs 9 19 8 18 and ocs 25 24 towards a subset of these 98 positions we have used a bayesian inference routine coupled to radiative transfer to infer the physical conditions towards each observation based on the detected line fluxes based on these results we find the following  the temperature of the regions probed by the observations is in general t 500 k approximately consistent with that derived previously towards similar clumps most of the estimated densities within this work are in good agreement with the previously reported values towards clumps within the cnd at nh 106 cm3  the ubiquity of sio and so detections including their large derived column densities is consistent with large scale grainprocessing occurring within the cnd however we find that multiple desorption mechanisms both thermal and nonthermal eg uv or cosmicray photodesorption are plausible engines with which to drive grainprocessing in the cnd further chemical modelling is required to identify which processes are efficient towards the cnd  the g2 source within the northeastern arm is identified as being hot tkin 600 k and dense nh 106 cm3 sio 8 7 7 6 and so 7 6 emission is identified towards it as well as ch3 oh 2 11 2 02 h2 cs 9 19 8 18 and ocs 25 24 lines basic calculations indicate that this region is potentially gravitationally bound and is turbulent pressure dominated it is therefore a source of immense interest for follow up observations and study  l28 is identified as having mass almost exactly consistent with that required for binding to occur though turbulence dominates here as well l28 does not show any outstanding feature in terms of its line detections or its recovered physical quantities rendering it somewhat of an outlier amongst the potentially bound sources identified nevertheless more accurate mass estimates in follow up studies based on complex chemistry can help constrain whether this region is indeed bound or not  similarly g5 is found to have the largest recovered density within our data of nh 107 cm3 whilst also exhibiting one of the lowest recovered temperatures at tkin 60 k g5s high density is sufficient to overcome tidal effects prohibiting the object from being gravitational bound basic mass estimates also support this finding  another position of chemical interest is k13a k13a shows detections of sio 8 7 7 6 and so 7 6 as well as ocs 25 24 the only other position other than g2 to exhibit the ocs line k13a is located along a ridge of the cnd that is interacting with the galactic centre mini spiral further follow up study is required to understand the role that the ionised gas within the galactic centre mini spiral plays in the chemistry of this ridge  using a similar mass derivation approach we find that the total molecular gas mass contained within james et al the cnd between 15 20 pc is mcnd 4 104 acknowledgments
