dated 4 may 2021 in superconductors the motion of vortices introduces unwanted dissipation that is disruptive to applications fortunately material defects can immobilize vortices acting as vortex pinning centers which engenders dramatic improvements in superconductor material properties and device operation this has motivated decades of research into developing methods of tailoring the disorder landscape in superconductors to increase the strength of vortex pinning yet efficacious materials engineering still alludes us the electromagnetic properties of real disordered superconducting materials cannot yet be reliably predicted such that designing superconductors for applications remains a largely inefficient process of trial and error this is ultimately due to large gaps in our knowledge of vortex dynamics the field is challenged by the extremely complex interplay between vortex elasticity vortexvortex interactions and material disorder in this perspective we review obstacles and recent successes in understanding and controlling vortex dynamics in superconducting materials and devices we further identify major open questions and discuss opportunities for transformative research in the field this includes improving our understanding of vortex creep determining and reaching the ceiling for the critical current advanced microscopy to garner accurate structureproperty relationships frontiers in predictive simulations and the benefits of artificial intelligence as well as controlling and exploiting vortices in quantum information applications introduction distinguished for their ability to carry high dissipationless currents below a critical temperature tc superconductors are used in motors generators faultcurrent limiters and particle accelerator magnets their impact spans beyond these examples of largescale applications also affecting nanoscale devices perhaps most renown for their key role in the quantum revolution superconductors constitute building blocks in current and nextgeneration devices for computing and sensing for example superconducting photons detectors feature highresolutions due to high kinetic inductance and a sharp superconductortonormal phase transition moreover superconductors can be configured to form anharmonic oscillators that can be exploited in quantum computing notwithstanding these successes the performance of superconducting devices is often impaired by the motion of vorticeslines threading a quantum 0 h2e of magnetic flux through the material see fig 1 propelled by electrical currents and thermalquantum fluctuations vortex motion is dissipative such that it limits the currentcarrying capacity in wires causes losses in microwave circuits contributes to decoherence in qubits and can also induce phase transitions understanding vortex dynamics is a formidable challenge because of the complex interplay between moving vortices material disorder that can counteract pin vortex motion and thermal energy that causes vortices to escape from a electronic mail serenaeleyminesedu these pinning sites furthermore as depicted in fig 2 in threedimensional samples bulk crystals or thick films vortices are elastic objects that form complicated shapes as they wind through the disorder landscape reshaping and moving under the influence of currentinduced lorentz forces these complexities encumber predictability we can neither predict technologically important parameters in superconductors nor prescribe an ideal defect landscape that optimizes these parameters for specific applications though modifying the disorder landscape eg using particleirradiation or by incorporating nonsuperconducting inclusions into growth precursors can engender dramatic enhancements in the current carrying capacity these processes are often designed through a trialanderror approach furthermore the optimal defect landscape is highlymaterial dependent this is because the efficacy of pinning centers depends on the relationship between their geometry and the vortex structure the latter being determined by parameters of the superconductor such as the coherence length penetration depth and the anisotropy  see fig 1 for example though particle irradiation has successfully doubled the critical current in cuprates and certain ironbased superconductors the same ions and energies do not even produce universal effects in materials belonging to the same class of superconductors1 though we can indeed tune the disorder landscape we certainly do not have full control of it defects such as stacking faults twin boundaries and dislocations are often intrinsic to materials and their densities are challenging to tune as a further complication to understanding vortexdefect interactions superconductors often have mixed pinning landscapes vortex vortex pinning at the extreme srf cavities and uantum circuits vortex matter genome using ai point defect halfloop vortex structure twin boundary advanced vortex microscopy thermal and uantum creep superconducting density supercurrent fig 1 frontiers in vortex matter research black line represents the vortex core yellow region shows how the density of superconducting electron pairs decays towards the center of the core of size  coherence length blue plane with arrows represents amplitude of supercurrent circulating around the core of radius up to the penetration depth ie containing multiple types of defects though these landscapes immobilize vortices over a broader range of conditions temperatures and fields than landscapes containing only one type of defect it is challenging to infer the vortex structures that form within these materials and no techniques currently exist to fully image these structures and vortexdefect interactions on a microscopic level generally speaking achieving a materialsbydesign approach first entails garnering a sufficient microscopic understanding of vortexdefect and vortexvortex interactions then incorporating these details into simulations significant headway has been made along these lines with the implementation of largescale timedependent ginzburglandau tdgl simulations to study vortex motion through disordered media spearheaded by the argonne national laboratory this effort has accurately modeled critical currents jc in thin films 2d layered and anisotropic 3d materials as well as isotropic superconductors26 additionally it has determined the optimal shape size and dimensionality of defects necessary to maximize jc depending on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field710 backed by good agreement with experimental and analytic results for simple geometries1114 the utility of the numerical routine has successfully been extended to previously unknown territories optimizing pinning geometries outside the scope of analytic methods247101518 in fact these tdgl simulations have columnar defect nanoparticle precipitate abplane doublekink vortex structure staircase vortex structure void stacking fault fig 2 examples of vortex structures curved blue lines that are predicted to form in different defect landscapes under the influence of an applied current imaging these structures and defects would allow us to establish the crucial connection between vortex excitations vortexdefect and vortexvortex interactions lorentz forces and resulting vortex phases that is needed for efficacious defect engineering unveiled new phenomenasuch as a small peak in jc b at high fields that is caused by double vortex occupancy of individual pinning sites19 the argonne team has even deployed mature optimization processes based on targeted evolution using genetic algorithms10 this is a remarkable step towards the goal of criticalcurrentbydesign a criticalcurrentbydesign must consider thermal fluctuations which dramatically impact the critical current due to the effects of rapid thermallyinduced vortex motion thermal creep creep which manifests as a decay in the persistent current over time is rarely problematic in lowtc superconductors as it is typically quite slow consequently nbti solenoids in magnetic resonance imaging systems can operate in persistent mode retaining a fairly constant magnetic field for essentially indefinite time periods however creep is fast in hightc superconductors restricting applications and reducing the effective jc for the sake of power and magnet applications the goals are clearmaximize the critical current and minimize creep regarding the former there is much room for improvement no superconductor containing vortices has ever achieved a jc higher than 25 of its theoretical maximum  which is thought to be the depairing current jd 0 3 3 0 2 regarding creep we are fighting a theoretical lower bound20 this lower bound positively correlates with a materials ginzburg number gi 2 2kb tc sc 2 which is the ratio of the thermal energy to the superconducting condensation energy sc 20 2 0 2 2 3 the implications are grim creep is expected to be so fast in potential yettobediscovered roomtemperature superconductors rendering them unsuitable for applications the caveat is that this lower bound is limited to low temperatures and fields single vortex dynamics and col lective vortex dynamics could be key to achieving slow creep rates though superconducting sensing and computing applications do not require high currents vortices still pose a nuisance by limiting the lifetime of the quantum state in qubits21 inducing microwave energy loss in resonators22 and generally introducing noise it is known that dissipation from vortex motion reduces the quality factor in superconducting microwave resonators which are integral components in certain platforms for quantum sensors and the leading solidstate architecture for quantum computing circuitqed2326 they are used to address and readout qubits as well as mediate coupling between multiple qubits consequently resonator stability can be essential for qubit circuit stability moreover thermally activated vortex motion can contribute to 1 f noise and critical current fluctuations2728 in quantum circuits and is a suspected source of the dark count rate in superconducting nanowire singlephoton detectors2930 in these quantum circuits vortices appear due to pulsed control fields ambient magnetic fields31 and the selffield generated by bias currents30 mitigating the effects of vortices requires heavy shielding to block external fields and careful circuit design to control their motion the latter of which is quite tricky the circuit should include structures to trap vortices away from operational currents and readout as well as narrow conductor linewidths32 to make vortex formation less favorable however these etched structures may exacerbate another major source of decoherenceparasitic twolevel fluctuatorsdefects in which ions tunnel between two almost energetically equivalent sites which act as dipoles and thus interact with oscillating electric fields during device operation26 hence designing quantum circuits that are robust to environment noise is not trivial and has become a topic of intense interest2126 despite all of the aforementioned applicationlimiting problems caused by vortices they are not pervasively detrimental to device performance for example vortices can trap quasiparticlesunpaired electrons that are a third source of decoherence in superconducting quantum circuitsboosting the quality factor of resonators33 and the relaxation time of qubits34 furthermore vortices can host elusive exotic modes that are in fact useful for topological qubits which are predicted to be robust to environmental noise that plagues other quantum device architectures to exploit these modes in computing we must control the dynamics of their vortex hosts hence in general these disparate goals of eliminating or utilizing vortices for applications both require an improved understanding of vortex formation dynamics and ultimately control the goal of this perspective is to present opportunities for transformative advances in vortex physics in particular we start by addressing vortex creep in sec iii a which notes limited knowledge of nonthermal creep processes and how recent increases in computational power will enable full consideration of creep in simulations second in sec iii b we explore the true maximum achievable critical current and the need to simultaneously exploit multiple pinning mechanisms to surpass current records for jc next sec iii c discusses vortexinduced losses in response to ac magnetic fields and currents with a focus on the impact on superconducting rf cavities used in accelerators and quantum circuits we examine how the quantum revolution has handled the vortex problem for computing while sensing applications necessitate further studies as solving the aforementioned problems requires advanced computational algorithms we then proceed to discuss future uses of artificial intelligence to understand the vortex matter genome in sec iii d finally in sec iii e we recognize that most experimental studies use magnetometry and electrical transport studies to infer vortexdefect interactions and discuss the frontiers of microscopy that could lead to observing these interactions as well as accurately determining defect densities background superconductors have the remarkable ability to expel external magnetic fields up to a critical value hc1 a phenomena that is known as the meissner effect though surpassing hc1 quenches superconductivity in some materials the state persists up to a higher field hc2 0 2 2 in typeii superconductors in this class of materials hc1 can be quite small several mt whereas hc2 can be extremely large from a few tesla up to as high as 120 t35 such that the interposing state between the lower and upper critical fields consumes much of the phase diagram and defines the technologically relevant regime this mixed state hosts a lattice of vortices whose density scales with the magnetic field nv b we should also note that in addition to globally applied fields selffields from currents propagating within a superconductor can also locally induce vortices each vortex carries a single flux quantum 0 and the core defines a nanoscale region through which the magnetic field penetrates the material as such the vortex core is nonsuperconducting of diameter 2 t and surrounded by circulating supercurrents of radii up to t as depicted in fig 1 given the dependence of the vortex size on these materialdependent parameters vortices effectively look different in different materialsfor example they are significantly smaller in the hightemperature superconductor yba2 cu3 oy ybco where 0 16 nm than in nb in which 0 38 nm36 vortex motion constitutes a major source of dissipation in superconductors propelled by currents of density j and thermalquantum energy fluctuations vortices experience a lorentz force density fl j bc accompanied by joule heating that weakens superconducting properties it is this cascading process that is responsible for the undesirable impacts on applications for which examples were provided in sec i fundamentals of vortex pinning immobilizing vortices constitutes a major research area in which the most prominent benchmark to assess the

micrographs of defect landscape from refs 20 3840 pinning is the critical current jc 4150 once vortices are present in the bulk crystallographic defects such as point defects precipitates twin boundaries stacking faults and dislocations provide an energy landscape to trap vortices depending on the defect type and density one of two mechanisms are typically responsible for vortex pinning weak collective effects from groups of small defects or strong forces exerted by larger defects originally formulated by larkin and ovchinnikov51 the theory of weak collective pinning describes how atomically small defects alone cannot apply a sufficient force on a vortex line to immobilize it however the collective action of many can indeed pin a vortex in the case of a random arrangement of small weak and uncorrelated pinning centers the average force on a straight flux line vanishes then only fluctuations in the pinning energy higher order correlations are capable of producing a net pinning force considering this weak collective pinning theory phenomenology finds that the resulting critical current should scale quadratically with the pin density n p ie jc n2p see ref 52 on the other hand strong pinning results when larger defects each plastically deform a vortex line and a low density of these defects is sufficient to pin it competition between the bare pinning force f p and the vortex elasticity c generates multivalued solutions because of this a proper averaging of the effective force h fpin i from individual pins is nonzero and results in a critical current jc n p h fpin i here the critical current reached by strong pins depends linearly on the defect density while conceptually simpler than weak collective pinning it has taken significantly longer to develop a strong pinning formalism with its completion in the early 2000s the formalism enabled computing numerous physical observables including the critical current5354 the excesscurrent characteristic5560 and the ac campbell response1114 defects merely trap the vortex state into a metastable min imum thermal and quantum fluctuations release vortices from pinning sites and this activated motion of vortices from a pinned state to a more stable state is called vortex creep in the presence of creep the critical current jc is no longer a distinct boundary separating a dissipationfree regime from a dissipative one experimentally this manifests as a powerlaw transition v j n between the superconducting state in which v 0 and ohmic behavior the creep rate s d lnjd lnt then becomes 1n and can be assessed by fitting the transitional regime in the currentvoltage characteristic or measuring the temporal decay of an induced persistent current measurements of the vortex creep rate also provide access to microscopic details such as the effective energy barriers u t s surmounted and whether single vortices or bundles are creeping various methods of tailoring the disorder landscape in superconductors have proven successful in remarkably enhancing the critical current figure 3 shows examples of cuprates ironbased superconductors and lowtc materials that have all benefited from incorporating inclusions defects can be added postgrowth using techniques such as particle irradiation120376184 or during the growth process by incorporating impurities to the source material388589 though these processes induce markedly different disorder landscapes both can effectuate remarkable increases in jc however the conditions necessary to improve electromagnetic properties are highly materialdependentthis lack of universality renders defect landscape engineering a process of trialanderror particle irradiation can induce point defects vacancies interstitial atoms and substitutional atoms larger random defects or correlated disorder eg amorphous tracks known as columnar defects notably the critical current in commercial yba2 cu3 o7 coated conductors was nearly doubled through irradiation with protons69 oxygenions3739 goldions90 and silverions furthermore ironbased superconductors have also been shown to benefit from particle irradiation1 to incorporate larger defects such as nanoparticle inclusions numerous groups38879194 have introduced excess ba and m where m zr nb sn or hf into growth precursors this results in the formation of randomly distributed 520 nm sized nonsuperconducting bamo3 nanoparticles or nanorods this method has produced critical currents that are up to seven times higher than that in films without inclusions95 therefore has become one of the leading schemes for enhancing jc the enhancement achieved by inclusions and irradiation is often restricted to a narrow temperature and field range partially because and are temperature dependent whereas the defect sizes and densities are fixed another reason for the limited range of the enhancement is that under the right conditions certain fast moving vortex excitations may form for example in materials containing parallel columnar defects doublekink excitations form at low fields and moderate temperatures that result in fast vortex creep concomitant with reduced jc 96 mixed pinning landscapes composed of different types of defects can indeed enhance jc over a broader temperature and field range than inclusions of only one type and one size more work is indeed necessary to optimize this thermally activated vortex motion vortex creep is a very complex phenomenon due to the interplay between vortexvortex interactions vortexdefect interactions vortex elasticity and anisotropy529798 these interactions determine uact t h j a generally unknown regimedependent function the simplest creep model proposed anderson and kim neglects the microscopic details of pinning centers and considers vortices as noninteracting rigid objects hopping out of potential wells of depth uact u p 1 jjc however as elastic objects the length of vortices can increase over time under force from a current and vortexvortex interactions are nonnegligible at high fields as such the andersonkim models relevance is limited to low temperatures and fields at high temperatures and fields collective creep theories which consider vortex elasticity predict an inverse power law form for the currentdependent energy barrier uact j u p jc j 1 where is the socalled glassy exponent that is related to the size and dimensionality of the vortex bundle that hops during the creep process99 to capture behavior across regimes the interpolation formula uact j u p jc j 1 is commonly used where 1 recovers the andersonkim prediction combining this interpolation formula with the creep time t t0 euact jkb t we find the persistent current should decay over time as jt jc0 1 kb t u p lntt0 1 and that the thermal vortex creep rate is d ln j kb t d lnt u p kb t lntt0 where lntt0 2530 because the magnetization m j creep can easily be measured by capturing the decay in the magnetization over time using a magnetometer moreover as seen from eq 1 knowledge of st h provides access to both u p and hence creep measurements are a vital tool for revealing the size of the energy barrier its dependence on current field and temperature and whether the dynamics are glassy or plastic it is important to note that eq 1 is typically used to analyze creep data piecewiseit can rarely be fit to the entire temperature range creep rates are not predictable and no analytic expression exists that broadly captures the temperature and field dependence of creep both u p and have unknown temperature dependencies which is a major gap in our ability to predict vortex creep rates predictive vortex matter simulations simulating the the behavior of vortex matter52100104 has a long history though the value of such simulations was realized long ago105106 the efficacy to produce accurate results in materials containing complex defect landscapes is considered a recent success tied to improvements in computational power specifically we can now numerically solve more realistic models ranging from langevin dynamics to timedependent ginzburglandau tdgl equations to fully microscopic descriptions including usadel and eilenberger bogoliubovde gennes and nonequilibrium keldysheilenberger quantum transport equations while the phenomenological tdgl equations describe vortex matter realistically on lengths scales above the superconducting coherence lengths full microscopic equations are needed to describe eg the vortex core accurately this however means that the system sizes which can be simulated down to the nanoscale using microscopic models are quite limited while tdgl can simulate macroscopic behavior including most dynamical features of vortex matter the langevin approach only considers vortex degrees of freedom while mostly neglecting elasticity and vortexvortex interactions which are nonlocal effects hence its accuracy is limited to when intervortex separations are significantly larger than vortex pinning sites are dilute or the superconducting host is sufficiently thin that vortices can be considered 2d particles nevertheless this simple picture reveals remarkably rich dynamical behavior notably realizing a dependence of jc on the strength and density of pinning centers 105106 thermal activation of vortices from pinning sites107 a crossover between plastic and elastic behavior108109 and dynamic ordering of vortex lattices at large velocities110111 however vortex elasticity is indeed an influential parameter in bulk systems it results in vortex phases that are characterized by complex vortex structures glassy phases that do not exist in 2d systems as well as other interesting characteristics112118 herein lies the strength of the tdgl approach which is a good compromise between complexity and fidelity it describes the full behavior of the superconducting order parameter119 and therefore represents a mesoscopic bridge between microscopic and macroscopic scales notably it surpasses the langevin approach by i describing all essential properties of vortex dynamics including intervortex interac jc jcdp dp 006 069 dy075 jc b

possessing a rigorous connection to the microscopic bardeencooperschrieffer theory in the vicinity of the critical temperature120 and iii considering realistic pinning mechanisms regarding pinning it can specifically account for pinning due to modulation of critical temperature tc pinning or meanfree path  pinning strain magnetic impurities121 geometric pinning through appropriate boundary conditions and generally weak to strong pinning regimesall beyond the reach of the langevin approach consequently the tdgl formulation is arguably one of the most successful physical models describing the behavior of many different physical systems even beyond superconductors122 in its early days the tdgl approach was used to study depinning plastic and elastic steadystate vortex motion in systems containing twin and grain boundaries as well as both regular and irregular arrays of point or columnar defects123124 those simulations were predominately used to illustrate the complex dynamics of individual vortices because computational limitations prohibited the study of largescale systems with collective vortex dynamics only later did simulation of about a hundred vortices in twodimensional systems become possible resulting in predictions for eg the field dependence of jc in thin films with columnar defects125 a 2002 article by winiecki and adams126 deserves credit as one of the first simulationbased studies of vortex matter in threedimensional superconductors that produced a realistic electromagnetic response later in 2015 koshelev et al7 achieved a major technical breakthrough by investigating optimal pinning by monodispersed spherical inclusions the simulated system size of 100 100 50 was much larger than any previously studied system enabling even more realistic simulations of the collective vortex dynamics than previous works their computational approach is based on an optimized parallel solver for the tdgl equation127 which allows for simulating vortex motion and determining the resulting electrical transport properties in applicationrelevant systems the efficacy of this technique is best demonstrated in a study3 that applied the same approach to a real pinning landscape by incorporating scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography data of dydoped yba2 cu3 o7 films128129 and the results showed almost quantitative agreement of the field and angular dependent critical current with experimental transport measurements see fig 4 finally we discuss applying tdgl calculations to commercial hightemperature superconducting tapes which typically consist of rare earth re or yttrium barium copper oxide rebco matrices specifically ref 8 simulated vortex dynamics in rebco coated conductors containing selfassembled bazro3 nanorods and reported good quantitative match to experimental measurements of jc versus the applied magnetic fieldangle most notably the simulations demonstrated the nonadditive effect of defects adding irradiated columnar defects at a 45 angle with the nanorod c axis removes the jc 0 peak of the nanorods and generates a peak at 45 instead this study then went beyond simply reproducing experimental behavior and predicted the optimal concentrations of bazro3 nanorods that are necessary to maximize jc which it found to be 1214 of jd at specific far higher than had been experimentally achieved in similar systems this approach is certainly more efficient than the standard trialanderror approach growing and measuring samples with a large variety of defect landscape these recent successes in accurately predicting jc in super conductors based on the microstructure highlight how close we are to the ultimate goal of tailoring pinning landscapes for specific applications with welldefined critical current requirements constituting the new criticalcurrentbydesign paradigm18104 the routine use of tdgl simulations for efficient defect landscape optimization is a transformative opportunity in vortex physics as is expanding these computational successes to include the use of artificial intelligence algorithms furthermore microscopic and farfromequilibrium simulations of vortex matter beyond the tdgl approach require significant computational resources and are only now becoming feasible we will discuss related developments in sec iii d iii transformative opportunities vortex creep in this section we identify major opportunities to accelerate our understanding of thermallyactivated vortex hopping thermal creep and nonthermal tunneling quantum creep between pinning sites only limited situations are amenable to an analytic treatment of vortex creep these include thermal depinning of single vortices and vortex bundles in the regime of weak collective pinning in the strong pinning regime eg for columnar defects we must consider complicated excitations that form during the depinning process activation occurs via halfloop formation130 which is depicted in fig 2 during this process the vortex nucleates outside of its pinned position and the curved unpinned segment grows over time as a current acts on it until the entire vortex eventually leaves the pinning site because halfloop formation likely occurs in a range of highcurrentcarrying materials which may contain amorphous tracks nanorods or twin boundaries numerical treatment of vortex creep within the strong pinning framework is of significant interest the first task involves studying creep of isolated vortices pinned by a single strong inclusion or columnar defect in accordance with analytic predictions an increase in temperature shifts the characteristic depinning current below jc rounds the iv curves and affects the excesscurrent characteristic far beyond jc 5860 the next steps will involve studying multiple vortices more defects and mixed defect landscapes which will indeed increase the complexity of the problem warranting computational assistance recent advances in computational power and highperformance codes will enable tackling these challenges which involve long simulation times at exponentially low dynamics instead of simulating the thermal relaxation of a metastable configuration in a single linear simulation the same configuration can be simulated in parallel ie experiencing fluctuations along different world lines this accelerates the search for a rare depinning event after which parallel computations are interrupted and restarted from new depinned configurations in a 2017 paper20 we found that the minimum achievable thermal creep rate in a material depends on its ginzburg num ber gi as s gi12 t tc shown in fig 5 our result is limited to the andersonkim regime and considered pinning scenarios with analytically determined pinning energies up it also somewhat gravely predicts that there is a limit to how much creep problem in hightc superconductors which tend to have high gi can be ameliorated such that we may expect the performance of yettobe discovered room temperature superconductors to be irremediably hindered by creep however ybco films containing nanoparticles demonstrate nonmonotonic temperaturedependent creep rates st such that s dips to unexpectedly low values at intermediate temperatures outside of the andersonkim regime20 this dip thought to be induced by strong pinning from nanoparticles suggests that collective pinning regimes may hold the key to inducing slower creep rates that dip below our proposed lower limit in the andersonkim regime a numerical tacking of the vortex creep problem would improve our theoretical understanding of creep and answer a major open question in vortex physics what is indeed the slowest achievable creep rate in different superconductors our finding of the lower limit to the creep rate reduces the guesswork in trialanderror approaches to optimizing the disorder landscape and improves our ability to select a material for applications requiring slow creep yet ultimately a materials quantum creep rate actually sets its minimum achievable creep rate this is a regime that is has received relatively little attentionthere have been few theoretical and experimental studies of quantum creep theoretical models are limited to tunneling barriers induced by weak collective pinning99131 and columnar defects132 though most materials have very complex mixed pinning landscapes most experimental work has focused on cuprates determining a crossover temperature of 8511 k in ybco films133135 152 k in ybco crystals134136 56 k in tl2 ba2 cacu2 o8 films136137 17 k in tlba2 cacu2 o7 133 30 k in hgba2 cacu2o6 133 klein et al138 studied an ironbased superconductor finding crossover around 1 k in fetese no studies have been conducted in materials containing inclusions nor using any systematic tuning of the energy barrier furthermore the crossover between the thermal and quantum creep is unclear as previously mentioned the andersonkim models relevancy is limited to low temperatures kb t fi u p in which s is expected to increase approximately linearly with temperature a linear fit to this regime often extrapolates to nonzero s at t 0 suggestive of nonthermal creep in fact it is common to perfunctorily attribute this extrapolation to quantum creep without conducting measurements in the quantum creep regime however there are compelling discrepancies between typical experimental results in this context and theory for example theory predicts that the tunneling probability should decrease with bundle size whereas experiments often observe the opposite trend positive correlation between low temperature s and field139 theory also predicts a quadratic rather than linear temperaturedependent st 0136139 that is quantum creep may be thermally assisted99 and not simply present itself as a temperatureindependent creep rate at low temperatures an even more confounding result is that nicodemi et al140 predicted non letters 004 nature materials doi

tinely higher for coated conductors rebco films though this at first appears to be a far cry from the ultimate goal some surmise that this is indeed near the maximum that can be achieved by immobilizing vortices by means of core pinning which merely refers to a vortex preferentially sitting in potential wells defined by a defect to minimize the energy of its core wimbush et al36 present a compelling argument that core pinning can obtain a maximum jc jd of only 30a current equivalent to jd would produce a lorentz force fd jd 0 4bc 0 3 60 with bc 0 2 2 the thermodynamic critical field at the same time the condensation energy sc produces a characteristic pinning force f pcore sc 2 b2c 20 such that the ratio of the maximal core pinning force to the depairing lorentz force is f pcore fd 3 316 32 similarly matsushita144 performed a more precise calculation by considering the effects of the geometry of the flux line and found that f pcore fd 28 hence decades of work in designing the defect landscape to pin vortex cores may have indeed nearly accomplished the maximum efficiency achievable by means of core pinning if the ultimate goal of jc jd cannot be obtained by core pinning alone are there other mechanisms to immobilize vortices that could indeed produce jc jd 30 magnetic interactions between vortices themselves or vortices and magnetic inclusions can also restrict the motion of a vortexreferred to as magnetic pinning herein lies a transformative opportunity to make large strides towards approaching jc jd magnetic pinning alone or in combination with core pinning may produce unprecedentedly high values for jc though this mechanism has received considerably less attention than core pinning because it is quite complicated to actualize a high density of vortices tend to arrange themselves into a hexagonal lattice and one pinned to a defect via core pinning may restrict the motion of its neighbors subsequently affecting its neighbors neighbors due to magnetic vortexvortex interactions which occur over a length scale of a magnetic inclusion provides another opportunity for inflicting magnetic and core pinning on a vortex again following the arguments of wimbush36 we can compare the pinning force induced by core pinning to that ofr magnetic pinning the magnetic zeeman energy mag 21 a m b da produced by a strong ferromagnet is much greater than the condensation energy and may be several orders of magnitude greater than the core pinning energy however it is unclear whether the resulting pinning force is greater because it occurs over the longer length scale of versus ie f pmag mag such that f pmag f pcore 2 20 mbc hence the advantage depends on the ratio of the magnetization of the pinning site to the thermodynamic critical field independent of whether f pmag surpasses f pcore concomitant mechanisms would produce an additive effect that may surpass current record values of jc yet ferromagnets in proximity to superconductors can locally degrade superconductivity by inducing pair breaking such that it is challenging to incorporate ferromagnetic vortex pinning centers without compromising the superconducting state this complication combined with the typical materials science considerations of incorporating inclusions that do not induce too much strain on the surrounding superconducting matrix will make this a challenge all but insurmountable in addition to magnetic pinning exploiting geometric pinning provides another potentially transformative opportunity to dramatically boost jc in superconductors in clean narrow submicron superconducting strips geometric restrictions can induce selfarrest of vortices recovering the dissipationfree state at high fields and temperatures due to surfaceedge beanlivingston barrier41 or geometric4245 pinning figure 7 depicts an example of geometric vortex pinning around two superconducting strips moreover at a fixed applied current the magnetoresistance mr shows oscillations with increasing magnetic field indicating the penetration of complete vortex rows into the system16 therefore these mr oscillations are a way to determine the vortex structure in nanoscale superconductors at very high fields the vortex lattice in these strips starts to melt combining magnetoresistance measurements and numerical simulations can then relate those mr oscillations to the penetration of vortex rows with intermediate geometrical pinning where the vortex lattice remains unchanged and uncover the details of geometrical melting this opens the possibility to control vortices in geometrically restricted nanodevices and represents a novel technique of geometrical spectroscopy combined use of mr measurements and largescale simulations would reveal detailed information of the structure of the vortex system a similar reentrant behavior was observed in superconducting strips in a parallel field configuration here high fields lead to vortex crowding in which a higher density of vortex lines starts to straighten therefore reducing the lorenz force on the vortices the result is an intermediate dissipationless state145 introduction 5 fig 7 field

order parameter amplitude computational studies because the cavities operate outofequilibrium a phenomenological description based on tdgl theory can only serve as a rough qualitative guide developing a fundamental theory describing the nonlinear and nonequilibrium current response of srf cavities requires a microscopic description based on quantum transport equations for nonequilibrium superconductors a microscopic description however is challenging because the rf currents under strong drive conditions ie high field frequencies and amplitudes near the breakdownsuperheating field affect both the superconducting order parameter and the kinetics of quasiparticles all of which have to be treated selfconsistently this endeavor requires development of numerical approaches to solve the quantum transport equations based on the keldysh and eilenberger formulations of nonequilibrium superconductivity in the strongcoupling limit the keldysheilenberger quantum transport equations are in general nonlocal in spacetime nonlinear and in many physical situations involve multiple length and time scales solving these equations requires considerable computational resources which are now becoming available with exascale computing facilities herein lies a transformative opportunity to dramatically boost the performance of srf cavities namely researchers are now equipped to develop microscopic theoretical models and incorporate them into computational codes to reveal the origin and mechanisms that limit the accelerating field of srf cavities the acquired knowledge will then guide materials optimization to maximize the critical currents superheating fields and quench fields reaching the theoretical limits for these parameters necessitates suppressing vortex nucleation at high rf magnetic field amplitudes screening currents near the vacuumsuperconductor interface can nucleate abrikosov vortices that can quench the cavity see fig 8c this vortex breakdown depends on i the amplitude and frequency of the surface field ii the cavitys surface roughness and iii the type distribution and size of defects near the interface the impact of nearsurface defects on vortices is diametric they may reduce the potential barrier for vortex nucleation6 but also pin nascent vortices generated by nucleation at the surface preventing a vortex avalanche and substantial dissipation given this there are various possible optimal microstructures for the srf constituent materials i a clean superconductor with a maximum surface barrier ii a superconductor with a thin few defectfree surface and nanoscale defects in its bulk or iii some special spatial gradient in the size andor density of defects largescale tdgl simulation can be applied to study the conditions under which vortex avalanches form devise mechanisms that are effective at mitigating these avalanches and more generally gain insight into the flux penetration under rf field conditions furthermore by coupling the tdgl and heat transport equations this method can study hot spots providing insight on avoiding the formation of these hot spots in srf cavity walls as previously mentioned though tdgl cannot produce quantitative results it can serve as a useful guide to experiments and also provide insight into simulations based on microscopic transport equations lastly though discussed in the context of srf cavities these new computational methods can be applied to superconducting cables for ac power applications vortices in quantum circuits a energy loss due to vortices similar to srf cavities superconducting circuits for quantum information also operate at rfmicrowave frequencies and are affected by vortices specifically along with parasitic twolevel fluctuators and quasiparticles vortices are a considerable source of energy loss in superconducting quantum circuits2126152 these energy loss mechanisms create a noisy environment in which the qubit irreversibly interacts stochastically rather than deterministically consequently the evolution of the quantum state is unpredictable increasingly deviating over time from predictions until the qubit state is eventually lost this is called decoherence which limits the amount of time t1 over which hole density fig 9 a an optical image showing multiple 4 resonators multiplexed to a common feed line and surrounded by a ground plane

2019 american physical society information is retained in qubits to the microsecond range and there is typically a large spread in the t1 times for each qubit in multiqubit systems153 vortices appear in superconducting quantum circuits due to stray magnetic fields selffields generated by bias currents and pulsed control fields in addition to limiting t1 in qubits thermallyactivated vortex motion can cause significant noise in superconducting circuits and reduce the quality factor q of superconducting microwave resonators2231151 to mitigate this techniques have been developed to either prevent vortex formation or trap vortices in regions outside of the path of operating currents shielding circuits from ambient magnetic fields and narrowing linewidths constituting the device154155 significantly reduce the vortex population for example for a line of width w flux will not enter until the field surpasses 0 w2 because of this realization flux qubits typically contain linewidths of 1 m therefore exclude vortex formation up to a threshold magnetic field of roughly 2 mt which is 20 times larger than the earths magnetic field154 though shielding has enabled remarkable headway in improving the stability of superconducting qubits for computing applications it is not a complete solution a reasonable amount of shielding can only suppress the field by a small amount which may be insufficient if devices must operate in highfield environments moreover shielding may render devices useless in quantum sensing applications in which the purpose of the device is to sense the external environment this has sparked research on further modifications to the device design and on understanding the effects of a magnetic field on different architectures of quantum circuits including transmon qubits156 and superconducting resonators151157 which are integral components to readout in addition to shielding another common remedy for the vortex problem in superconducting circuits involves micropatterning arrays of holes in the ground plane to serve as vortex traps and reduce the prevalence of vortex formation within that perforated area22158160 see fig 9 for example bothner et al found that qb 45 mt is a factor of 25 higher in nb resonators containing flux trapping holes in the ground plane158 compared to without the holes however chiaro et al160 showed that without careful design these features can increase the density of and subsequently losses from parasitic twolevel fluctuators thought to primarily form at surfaces and interfaces moreover coplanar waveguide resonators were recently found to be more robust to external magnetic fields when the superconducting ground plane area is reduced which lowers the effective magnetic field inside the cavity and by coupling the resonator inductively instead of capacitively to the microwave feedline shielding the feedline157 the methods we have discussed here engendered tremendous advances in suppressing the vortex problem in superconducting quantum circuits however the details are materialdependent likewise optimal mitigation strategies may be materialdependent for example song et al compared the microwave response of vortices in superconducting re rhenium and al coplanar waveguide resonators with a lattice of fluxtrapping holes in the ground plane generally in both systems vortices shift the resonance frequency f0 broaden the resonance dip s21 f and reduce the quality factor q however vortices in the al resonators induce greater loss and are more sensitive to flux creep effects than in the re resonators the al resonator experienced a far more substantial fractional frequency shift d f f0 with increasing frequency than the re resonator furthermore while the loss 1q due to vortices increased with frequency for re it decreased for al most research on the microwave response of vortices in quantum circuits is limited to al22313334160 nb32158159161162 nbtin151155 and re22 whereas al and nb are used in commercial quantum computers superconducting nitrides tin nbn nitin163172 and re have garnered substantial attention because they may suffer less from parasitic twolevel fluctuators which are particularly problematic in oxides and at interfaces26 nitrides and re are known to develop thinner oxide layers than al and nb and can be grown epitixally on common substrates173175 to develop a generic understanding of how to design quantum circuits that are resilient to ambient magnetic fields and control vortices in circuits made of nextgeneration materials we must study circuits consisting of broader ranges of materials perform further studies on nitridebased circuits investigate different designs for flux trapping and conduct imaging studies that can observe rather than infer the efficacy of vortex pinning sites there have been a few studies that imaged vortices in superconducting strips which provided guidance on appropriate line widths to preclude vortex formation32176 to build upon this imaging studies using eg a scanning squid or magnetic force microscope of devices would inform on the efficacies of flux trapping sites reveal locations in which vortices form and track vortex motion b vortices in topological quantum computing schemes up until now we have discussed vortices exclusively as a nuisance which is indeed the case for a broad range of applications a notable exception lies in the burgeoning field of topological quantum computing in which vortices serve as hosts for majorana modes177 qubits encoded using majorana modes are predicted to be relatively robust to noise thus have long coherence times one way to realize this is to couple a superconductor to a topological insulator induce vortices in the superconductor and majorana states are predicted to nucleate in the vortex core also note that majorana modes have been theorized to exist in other systems178184 initially elusive signatures of majorana vortex modes have been recently observed in a variety of systems including the ironbased superconductor fetex se1x 185186 eus islands overlying gold nanowires187 superconducting al layer encasing an inas nanowire188 and bi2 te3 nbse2 heterostructures189 to exploit these modes for computing we must be able to control their vortex hosts consequently vortex pinning research will be beneficial to vortexbased topological quantum computing applications d vortex matter genome using artificial intelligence criticalcurrentbydesign over the years research in superconductivity and vortex pinning has produced large amounts of experimental and simulation data on microstructures synthesis and critical current behavior more recently artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml approaches have enabled revolutionary advances in the fields of image and speech recognition as well as automatic translation and are now finding an increasing number of applications in scientific research areas that deal with massive data sets like particles physics structural biology astronomy and spectroscopy combining these will enable novel approaches to predict pinning landscapes in superconductors for the future design of materials with tailored properties by using sophisticated ml algorithms and ai models this has become a promising approach within the criticalcurrentbydesign paradigm which refers to designing superconductors with desired properties using sophisticated numerical methods replacing traditional trialanderror approaches these properties include maximizing critical currents achieving robust critical currents with respected to variations of the pinning landscape which is important for largescale commercial applications or attaining uniform critical currents with respect to the magnetic field orientation the next step towards advancing the use of aiml approaches for criticalcurrentbydesign may be to build upon the genetic algorithms implemented in ref 10 to optimize pinning landscapes for maximum jc this approach utilizes the idea of targeted selection inspired by biological natural selection in contrast with conventional optimization techniques such as coordinate descent in which one varies only a few parameters characterizing the entire sample targeted evolution allows variations in each defect individually without any apriori assumptions about the defects configuration this essentially means that one solves an optimization problem with theoretically infinite degrees of freedom ref 10 demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for clean samples as well as ones with preexisting defects eg as found in commercial coated conductors the latter therefore provides a postsynthesis optimization step for existing stateoftheart wires and a promising path toward the design of tailored functional materials however the mutations of the defects required for the genetic algorithm see fig 10a were chosen randomly those mutations generate generations of pinning landscapes of which the best is chosen by targeted selection and then used as a seed for the next generation using a simple machine learning approach could further enhance the convergence of this method by performing only mutations which have higher probabilities of enhancing the critical current besides superconductors this methodology can be used to improve the intrinsic properties of other materials where defects or the topological structure plays an important role such as magnets or nanostructured thermoelectrics going beyond these mlimproved simulations one can build quantitative datadriven ai approaches for superconductors that will enable eg predicting the critical current phase diagram and extracting the defect morphology responsible for its performance directly from the existing accumulated experimental and simulation data without actual dynamics simulations here we will discuss two potentially transformative opportunities summarized in fig 10b the first application is motivated by the need for reliably producing uniform superconductors on macroscopic commercial scales this requires a deep understanding of material synthesis processes eg for selfassembled pinning structures in a superconducting matrix see fig 10b 1 materials at the forefront of a genetic algorithms jc b datadriven ai precursors ci pi ti synthesis sc matrix with defects c

field angle 120 critical current dependencies fig 10 criticalcurrentbydesign using a genetic algorithms to optimize critical currents starting with a superconductor having intrinsic defects genetic algorithms can be used to optimize the defect structure by mutation of defects and targeted selection of landscapes with larger critical currents a mutation of a defect or several defects at once can be done by eg translation resizing deletion or splitting as sketched in the defect sequence on the right overall this procedure creates generations of mutated defect configurations and only the best is selected and chosen to be the seed for the next generation shown in the partial tree on the left circlesdots represent configurations where the large numbered one is the best using neural networks and machine learning ml to predict the best mutations could further improve the targeted selection approach10 b mlartificial intelligence ai to improve and tailor defect landscapes in superconductors 1 illustrates how ai models can be used to predict pinning landscapes from synthesis parameters and vice versa to predict synthesis parameters like precursor concentrations pressures and temperatures in eg vapor deposition methods for a targeted pinning landscape the models need to be trained by experimental or simulation data sets 2 similarly shows how to directly predict critical current dependencies like field orientation dependencies from pinning topologies and vice versa again the underlying model is trained by experimental and simulation data this quest are rebco films with selfassembled oxide inclusions in the form of nanorods and nanopartices104190 for example bazro3 bzo nanorods that nucleate and grow during metal organic chemical vapor deposition mocvd have proven particularly effective for pinning vortices191 the major difficulties in achieving consistent and uniform critical currents in rebco tapes containing bzo nanorods are the interplay of many parameters controlling the deposition process temperature of the substrate and of the precursor gases deposition rate precursor composition etc and strong sensitivity of the microstructure to small variations in these parameters even for the same nominal level of zr additives significant variations in nanorod diameter size distribution spacing distribution and angular splay have been observed physical factors controlling these variations remain poorly understood for example the nanorods diameter may be a mostly equilibrium property resulting from the interplay of strain and surface energies or caused by kinetic effects controlled by surface diffusion of adatoms and deposition rate these complexities have precluded the development of predictive models however making use of the accumulated experimental data sets and possibly synthesiskinetic growth simulation data monte carlo or molecular dynamic simulations which are also still in an exploratory phase allows building mlai models to predict pinning landscapes for given synthesis parameters as described above or more relevant for commercial application the prediction of synthesis parameters for a desired uniform pinning landscape to constitute a complete vortexpinning genome a second notable milestone is using ai to predict jc for a given pinning landscape based solely on data recognition disregarding tdgl simulations and conversely predicting the necessary pinning landscape to produce a desired jc in fact the latter cannot be achieved by direct simulations typical data sets both experimental and simulationbased contain information on defect structures critical currents and other transport characteristics for a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures creating an organized database of this information would enable i quickly accessible critical current values for a wide range of conditions ii an effective mapping of simulation parameters onto experimental measurements and iii using the data as training sets for aidriven predictions of defect structures for desired applications experimentally microstructures are routinely probed by transmission electron microscopy tem and less directly by xray diffraction xrd in contrast to simulation data which contains all information about pinning landscapes the extracted information is usually rather limited since tem only allows imaging of thin slices of the material and only detects relatively large defects a full 3d tomography of defect landscapes cf fig 4a is very time consuming and expensive and therefore currently typically infeasible the resulting aiml models will also allow for a crossvalidation of the simulationbased data with available experimental data on materials properties in superconductors with different defect microstructures overall this aiml approach will directly reduce the cost and development time of commercial superconductors and in particular accelerate their design for targeted applications to estimate the benefit of such an approach one can consider for example a pinning landscape defined by 9 parameters using traditional interpolation in this 9dimensional parameter space one would need to have a certain number of data points per parameter for the modest case of 15 data points per direction one would need to simulate measurements are infeasible 159 4 1010 pinning landscapes which assuming 15 minutes per simulation on a single gpu results in a total simulation time of a million gpu years this simulation time is beyond current capabilities even on the largest supercomputers however surrogate ml models can reduce this to approximately 104 simulations while maintaining the same resulting accuracy see seed studies in eg ref 192 in this section we mentioned the complications associated with 3d tomographic imaging of a superconductors microstructure to supply complete information for simulations in the next section we detail the limitations of tomographic imaging and other advanced microscopy techniques many of which will be revolutionized by improvements in computational power and the application of advanced neural networks this in turn will have a transformative impact on vortex physics e advanced microscopy to better understand vortexdefect interactions quantitative pointdefect spectroscopy we have discussed the role of point defects in suppressing vortex motion via weak collective pinning notably the theory of weak collective pinning51 has attracted significant attention as it can explain the origin of novel vortex phases eg vortex glass193194 and vortex liquid195 phases as well as the associated vortex melting phase transition 196197 it cannot however be used to predict jc in single crystals whose defect landscape is dominated by point defects this limitation is not necessarily reflective of gaps in weak collective pinning theory itself but rather the fact that point defect densities are typically unknown because they are extremely challenging to measure over a broad spatial range consequently point defects are the dark matter of materials herein lies yet another transformative opportunity in vortex physics developing a technique to accurately measure point defect profiles and subsequent systematic studies correlating point defects jc b t and sb t may lead to recipes for predictably tuning the properties of superconductors most directly impacting crystals and epitaxial materials that lack a significant contributions from strong pinning centers the most promising routes for quantitative point defect microscopy include scanning transmission electron microscopy stem atom probe tomography apt atom electron tomography aet and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy pals here we primarily focus on stem combined with aet then will introduce apt and pals as other techniques with atomicscale resolution that are relatively untapped opportunities to reveal structureproperty relationships in superconductors in scanning transmission electron microscopy stem an imaging electron beam is transmitted through a thin specimen such that detectors can construct a realspace image of the microstructure and collect other diffraction data in superconductors stem studies have revealed a panoply of defects including columnar tracks defect clusters dislocations twin boundaries grain boundaries and stacking faults these studies can also provide information on other pertinent microstructural properties including strained regions that induce variations in the superconducting order parameter therefore preferential regions for vortices to sit in an otherwise defectfree landscape to identify dopants eg bahfo3 nanoparticles stem is also often performed in conjunction with analytical techniques such as energy dispersive xray spectroscopy to understand the ability of stem to determine point defect densities in superconductors we must first understand what limits the spatial resolution and throughput older stems cannot resolve point defects due to imperfections aberrations in the objective lenses and other factors that set the resolution higher than the wavelength of the imaging beam atomic resolution was finally achieved upon the advent of transformational aberration correction schemes which were first successfully demonstrated in the late 1990s and have been increasingly widely adopted over the past decade198201 in fact the spatial resolution of an aberrationcorrected stem has now fallen below the bohr radius of 053 pm202205 though point defects can now be imaged in superconductors it is not straightforward to determine point defect densities a single scan captures a small fraction of the sample which may not be representative of defect distributions throughout the entire specimen accordingly low throughput prevents collecting a sufficiently large dataset to provide a reasonably quantitative picture of defect concentrations one of the limiting factors for throughput is the detector speed which has recently improved significantly owing to the development of direct electron detectors such as active pixel sensors aps and hybrid pixel array detectors pad these detectors have higher quantum efficiency operate at faster readout speeds and have a broader dynamic range than con ventional detectorschargecoupled devices ccds coupled with scintillators201 enabled by fast detectors the advent of 4dstem206 is another recent major milestone that is a significant step towards determining point defect densities note that 4dstem involves collecting a 2d raster scan in which 2d diffraction data is collected at each scanned pixel generating a 4d dataset containing vast microstructural information in addition to highspeed direct electron detectors computational power was prerequisite for 4dstem implementation in which massive datasets can be produced see ref 206 for an example in which a single 4dstem image recorded in 164 s consumes 420 gb hence over the past few years this has warranted efforts to develop fast image simulation algorithms201 and schemes to apply deep neural networks to extract information such as defect species and location207 furthermore stems can be used for electron tomography in which images that are collected as the sample is incrementally rotated are combined to create a 3d image of the microstructure208 aberration correction highspeed detectors and the data revolution are transformative advances that will certainly accelerate progress in understanding structureproperty relationships in superconductors nevertheless there are more salient impediments to an atomicscale understanding of the true sample under study including artifacts from sample preparation techniques209 and beam scattering within thick samples to remedy the latter materials are often deposited onto membranes though this may not present a representative picture of the defect landscape when the sample is in a different form eg thicker and on a different substrate atom probe tomography apt is another microscopy technique with atomicscale resolution and it also provides 3d compositional imaging of surface and buried features over the past decade it has become increasingly popular due to the development of a commercial localelectrode atom probe leap for apt the specimen must be shaped as a needle and an applied electric field successively ejects layers of atoms from the surface of the specimen towards a detector by means of timeofflight mass spectroscopy the detector progressively collects information on the position and species of each atom reconstructing a 3d tomographic image of the specimen that can span 02 m 02 m 05 m with resolution of 01 05 nm210 as each atom is individually identifiable it can provide remarkably revealing information on the microstructure similar to stem sample preparation and data processing are bottlenecks apt also currently suffers from limited detection efficiency211 furthermore the analyzed volume field of view is currently too small to be sufficiently representative of the sample to provide accurate quantitative details on point defect concentrations the biggest complication however may be that the defect landscape of the apt specimen shaped as a needle may dramatically differ from the material in the form in which we typically study its electromagnetic properties lastly positron annihilation spectroscopy is a hitherto untapped opportunity to correlate vacancy concentrations with electrical transport properties in superconductors this non destructive technique can determine information about vacancies and larger voids in a material by bombarding it with positrons at 50 ev to 30 kev acceleration energies212213 then measuring the time lapse between the implantation of positrons and emission of annihilation radiation upon implantation positrons thermalize in 10 ps then either interact with an electron and annihilate or form a positronium atom electronpositron pair214 positronium atoms will then ricochet off the walls of voids and eventually annihilate releasing a ray that can be detected with integrated ray detectors the lifetime of the positron can provide information on void sizes and concentration of vacancies longer lifetimes correspond to larger voids and higher vacancy densities pals has been used for decades to sensitively detect vacancies and vacancy clusters in metals and semiconductors212215 as well as probe subnanometer intermolecular voids in polymers212216 depth profiling is possible on the nm to the m scale212217219 by tuning the positron implantation energy and though some systems have beam scanning capabilities enabling lateral resolution spatial resolution is generally quite poor due to large beam spot sizes and positron diffusion in most systems the spot size is typically 1 mm however pals instruments containing microprobes are capable of spot sizes that are smaller than 100 m220221 for example in 2017 gigl et al221 developed a stateoftheart system with a minimum lateral resolution of 33 m and maximum scanning range of 19 19 mm2 regarding speed the system can scan an area of 1 1 mm2 with a resolution of 250 m in less than 2 minutes which is considered to be an exceptionally short time frame221 moreover david et al220 reported a remarkably small spot diameter of 2 m in a setup with a short scanning range of 02 06 mm2 unfortunately further improvements to beam focus may be ineffectual and spatial resolution comparable to electron microscopy is unreachable the spatial resolution is ultimately limited by lateral straggle the positron diffusion length is roughly several hundreds of nanometers in a perfect crystal which limits the spot size even if the beam focus is improved217 ongoing efforts to advance pals include improving theoretical methods for interpretation of experimental results advancing theoretical descriptions of positron physics states thermalization and trapping incorporating sample stages that allow tuning sample environmental conditions eg temperature biasing and improving the efficiency of beam moderators which convert polychromatic positron beams to monochromatic beams217 2 cryogenic microstructural analysis for accurate determination of structureproperty relationships accurately correlating the formation of different vortex structures and intricacies of vortexdefect interactions with electromagnetic response is not trivial typically conventional microscopy is performed under conditions that differ from a materials actual working environment structural characterization of superconductors is routinely conducted at room temperature whereas accessing the superconducting regime requires cryogenic temperatures and is probed using electromagnetic stimuli yet we know that temperature changes significantly impact the microstructure causing straininduced phase separation and altering defects such as dislocations electromagnetic stimuli may similarly impact the defect landscape hence another transformative opportunity in vortex physics is cryogenic structural characterization of superconductors under the influence of electromagnetic stimuli which requires advances in microscopy scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with spectroscopic analysis is one of the most informative methods of gathering structural and chemical analysis at the atomicscale accurate determination of structureproperty relationships require insitu property measurements conducted concommitently with microscopy recent rapid advances in insitu transmission electron microscopy have been fueled by the introduction of a variety of commercial insitu sample holders that allow for electrical biasing heating magnetic response and mechanical deformation of nanomaterials222 these new capabilities have accelerated progress in a variety of fields including battery electrochemistry liquidphase materials growth biasinduced solidstate transformations in eg resistive switching devices for memory and neuromorphic applications gasphase reactions and catalysis solidstate chemical transformations eg at interfaces between semiconductors and metallic contacts and mechanical behavior222 for insitu tem to be beneficial to superconductors samples must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures and studied under the influence of magnetic fields developed in the 1960s liquid helium cooled stages have been used to study superconductors solidified gases and magnetic domains223 initially without the benefit of aberrationcorrected systems with atomicscale resolution more recently cryogenic stem with atomic scale resolution has been used to study quantum materials including lowtemperature spin states however these studies have been limited to a single temperature that was above the boiling point of the choice cryogen liquid helium or liquid nitrogen223 due to thermal load whereas variable temperature capabilities are requisite for probing phase transitions and the effects of thermal energy to this end there has recently been a push to develop advanced sample holders with stable temperature control223224 one of the most promising efforts is led by hummingbird precision machine a company that is developing a doubletilt cryoelectrical biasing holder for tems that allows samples to be concurrently cooled to liquid helium temperatures and electrically biased while undergoing atomicscale structural imaging224 because of such industry involvement in the development and commercialization of cryogenic sample holders and more generally the rapid pace of insitu tem eg the number of insitu tem papers doubled between 2010 and 2012225 we expect to see large advancements in this identified challenge over the next several years crosssectional imaging of vortex structures in sec i we discussed how competition between pinning forces vortex elasticity and currentinduced forces results in complicated vortex structures such as doublekinks halfloops and staircases typically we may conjecture which structures have formed based on the microstructure and applied field orientation subsequent correlations are made between the presumed structures and the magnetization or transport results which may be suggestive of a specific vortex phase however without direct proof of the structures we cannot unequivocally correlate distinct excitations with specific vortex phases for example in a study of a nbse2 crystal containing columnar defects tilted 30 from the caxis magnetization results evinced glassy behavior when the field was aligned with the caxis40 as these conditions are likely to produce vortex staircases the question arose whether and why vortex staircases would create a vortex glass phase direct imaging of vortexdefect interactions in a way that captures the vortex structure overlaid on the atomicscale structure would enable unambiguous determination of the phases produced by specific vortex excitations accordingly development of advanced microscopy techniques that can produce cross sectional images is another transformative opportunity in vortex physics in this section we summarize common techniques for imaging superconducting vortices detail their limitations and describe the features of an advanced instrument that could accelerate progress in understanding and designing materials with predetermined vortex phases lorentz tem ltem which exploits the aharonovbohm effect to capture magnetic contrast was first used by tonomura to image superconducting vortices227 and has played a major role in identifying new materials that host exotic magnetic phases however in ltem the objective lens serves the dual purpose of applying a field and observing the response of the specimen and is therefore limited to planview imaging that is for outofplane magnetic fields applied to a thin film the technique can only image magnetic contrast across the films surfacesuch that the vortex structure itself and interactions with defects within the bulk are outofview building upon tonomuras initial work hitachi228229 developed a unique specialized system containing a multipole magnet that can apply fields up to 50 mt at various orientations with respect to the sample though this system still produces planview images rather than crosssectional images revealing the full vortex structure variations in the contrast of the imaged vortex section has provided remarkable evidence of vortex pinning and useful information on vortexdefect interactions226230232 for example fig 11a shows a ltem image in which a vortex trapped within a columnar defect can be identified by its shape and contrast compared to untrapped vortices the most promising technique for directly imaging vortexdefect interactions may be differential phase contrast microscopy dpc233 conducted in a tem dpc is one of the best tools for quantitatively

vortices play in superconductors and how improving our ability to control vortex dynamics will have an immediate impact on a range of applications herein we discussed major open questions in vortex

image electric and magnetic fields within materials at atomic resolution234235 consequently scanning the beam stem produces spatial maps of nanoscale magnetic field contrast to complement the atomicscale structural information resolved by a transmitting beam accordingly stemdpc is an invaluable tool in nanomagnetism research used to image magnetic domains236237 and canted structures such as skyrmions238240 most notably it is one of few techniques that can unequivocally identify new magnetic phases and exotic magnetic quasiparticles in realspace more generally it can also image nanoscale electric fields241245 in materials and devices to image vortexdefect structures in an stem capable of dpc the sample stage would need to be cryogenically cooled and the chamber should contain a magnet complications will include designing the system in a way in which the magnetic field does not significantly distort the beam  how do thermal and quantum vortex creep depend on material parameters and how can we efficiently consider creep in predictive simulations  what is the highest attainable critical current jc  how do we optimize vortex pinning in quantum circuits and controllably exploit vortices in certain schemes for topological computing  given the multitude of variables that govern jc what computational methods can improve the efficacy of the criticalcurrentbydesign approach  what is the relationship between jc and point defect densities as well as vortex structures and vortex phases to answer these and other identified questions we delineated five major categories of nearterm transformative opportunities the first involves applying recent advances in analytical and computational methods to model vortex creep and performing more extensive experimental investigations into quantum creep second we discussed how critical currents higher than the current record of 30 jd may be obtained by implementing a combination of core pinning and magnetic pinning this is a promising route for dramatic advancements in largescale applicationsachieving higher currents densities enables smaller motors and generators as well as higher field magnets third we noted that vortices do not only hamper largescale applications but also induce losses in nanoscale quantum circuits though shielding circuits has proven effective in minimizing vortex formation quantum senors may require exposure to the environment necessitating a better understanding of vortex dynamics in circuits furthermore vortices are desirable for use in quantum information applications in which case we must study how to manipulate single flux lines to implement braiding and entanglement of majorana bound states fourth the recent advent of highperformance computational tools to study vortex matter numerically has pushed us to the verge of predicting a superconductors electrical transport properties based on the material and microstructure however the quest to automatically tailor a defect landscape for specific applications requires considering a fairly highdimensional parameter space to enable an effective mapping between simulations and experiments and manage the multitude of variables we propose to apply selfadjusting machine learning algorithms that use neural networks fifth and finally to accurately determine structureproperty relationships we need to experimentally measure and routinely consider point defect densities which are challenging to determine we therefore highlighted the prevailing microscopy techniques for point defect measurements which include 4dstem and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy acknowledgments se acknowledges support from the national science foundation dmr1905909 ag was supported by the us
