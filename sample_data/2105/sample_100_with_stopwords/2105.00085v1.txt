quantum systems it is known that if the system and environment are in a product state the evolution of the system is given by a linear completely positive cp hermitian map cp maps are a subset of general linear hermitian maps which also include non completely positive ncp maps ncp maps can arise in evolutions such as nonmarkovian evolution where the cp divisibility of the map writing the overall evolution as a composition of cp maps usually fails positive but ncp maps are also useful as entanglement witnesses in this paper we focus on transforming ncp maps to cp maps through composition with the asymmetric depolarizing map we use separate asymmetric depolarizing maps acting on the individual subsystems previous work have looked at structural physical approximation spa which is a cp approximation of a ncp map using a mixture of the ncp map with a completely depolarizing map we prove that the composition can always be made cp without completely depolarizing in any direction it is often possible to depolarize less in some directions we give the general proof by using the choi matrix and an isomorphism from a maximally entangled two qudit state to qubits we also give measures that describe the amount of disturbance the depolarization introduces to the original map given our measures we show that asymmetric depolarization has many advantages over spa in preserving the structure of the original ncp map finally we give some examples for some measures and examples completely depolarizing while not necessary in some directions can give a better approximation than keeping the depolarizing parameters bounded by the required depolarization if symmetric depolarization is used 1 introduction linear hermitian maps play an important role in many areas of quantum information science the evolution of an open quantum system is often clearly nonunitary and given by a linear hermitian map 1 for quantum technologies knowledge of the error map allows one to construct efficient quantum error correction codes provided that some conditions are met 2 linear hermitian maps can be categorized as completely positive cp or non cp ncp defined below and the latter can be used as entanglement witnesses 3 4 this paper focuses on transforming ncp maps to cp maps via composition with local asymmetric depolarizing maps this transformation is important for research in areas such as entanglement quantum error correction and non markovian evolution when the system and bath are initially uncorrelated the system is known to evolve under a completely positive map this is a map say that is not only positive maps positive operators to positive operators but is also positive when extended by an arbitrary identity map i ie i to act on a larger system however it can be quite difficult to prepare the system such that it starts completely uncorrelated from its environment for such cases it is not known generally how to describe the system evolution with a cp linear hermitian map 59 note that it is possible in specific cases for the evolution of a system with initial correlations to the environment to be cp 1012 there is also the process tensor formalism 13 14 which always results guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution in cp linear hermitian maps but the process tensor acts on input maps and not on density matrices in this paper we are focused on mappings from density matrices to density matrices there is also disagreement on the physicality of ncp evolution maps 15 16 however in the case of nonmarkovian evolution the initial cp map tends to be non cp divisible ie the map cannot be decomposed into cp maps for all arbitrary intermediate time steps 13 this implies that an intermediate evolution map can be ncp 17 for this paper we focus on transforming a given ncp map to a cp map and leave discussions of physicality of ncp maps for future work still we require the domain of the ncp map to be restricted so that the output of the map is positive the composition of the initial ncp map with an asymmetric depolarizing map may or may not be cp divisible depending on the strength of the depolarizer with no depolarizing the composition is equal to the initial ncp map which is trivially not cp divisible and when we depolarize completely the composition is equivalent to the completely depolarizing map which is cp divisible thus this composition may be useful in the study of nonmarkovian evolution positive but ncp maps do not preserve the positivity of some entangled states but they do for all separable states consequently they can be used as entanglement witnesses 18 the most common witness is the negativity of the partial transpose which is a necessary and sufficient condition for detecting entanglement for 22 or 23 systems 3 19 to implement the partial transpose experimentally horodecki and eckert introduced structural physical approximation spa which is a cp approximation of a ncp map 20 in the spa the completely depolarizing map is mixed with the ncp map this allows us to make the overall map cp note that this is equivalent to composing with a symmetric depolarization map symmetric depolarization destroys information equally in all directions which preserves the direction of the bloch or polarization vector given by the original ncp map however if we only focus on getting a cp approximation in many situations it is often unnecessary and worse to use symmetric depolarization for example if the ncp map only changes the state in one direction we likely only need to depolarize in that direction to get a cp approximation in quantum error correction the goal is to correct for the effects of the error map the known necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum error correction require that the error map is cp 21 22 in the case of ncp errors these known cp necessary and sufficient conditions can lead to codes that are not in the domain of the error map which means that the process as described is not physical 23 thus the results of this paper may help with correcting for ncp error maps by transforming them via the asymmetric depolarizing map adm into cp maps regardless the code should still be in the domain of the original ncp map because a valid quantum state is necessary furthermore this process of creating a cp composition via the adm may reduce the amount of errors effecting the system for example if the ncp error map causes a repolarization error ie it extends the bloch vector of the input state the asymmetric guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution depolarizer that creates a cp composition will eliminate the repolarization error in these situations using the adm is better than the symmetric depolarizer because the adm offers more freedom for minimizing the errors occurring on the input state in this paper we investigate composing the asymmetric depolarizing map with a ncp map to get a cp composition we give a novel proof for the complete positivity of the composition by using an isomorphism between a bipartite maximally entangled qudit and its qubit representation from this isomorphism the positivity of the choi matrix is proven in section 42 we determine the amount of disturbance the adm introduces and compare it with symmetric depolarization using certain measures we provide examples that show the advantages of using adm in certain cases while not necessary to achieve complete positivity we can depolarize more in some directions such that complete positivity of the composition is achieved but with an even higher value for a measure that we denote m1 see eq 69 than would have been attained by restricting depolarization in all directions to be less than or equal to the amount required by symmetric depolarization 2 background here we consider a combined initial system and environment state given by se where the system is under our control and the environment is not the initial system state is given by the partial trace s tre se thus the system evolves as es tre u se u where u is a global unitary and e is a superoperator in the case of an uncorrelated system and bath the evolution of the system is given by a completely positive cp map 24 es ei s ei we drop subscripts when it is clear from context which subspace we are considering e is cp iff e is positive for all positive inputs and the map e in is positive for all positive inputs for all positive integers n 24 complete positivity is also given by the choi matrix let e cnn cmm then the map is cp iff its choi matrix ce eiihi jihj ij0 is positive 24 if the system and environment are correlated the system map may be given by a not completely positive map ncp es i ei ei guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution where i 1 and it is necessary that there i 1 59 24 the first representation of maps we gave in eq 2 and eq 4 is called the operator sum representation osr in this paper we also use the smr representation 1 in describing the system evolution in smr the evolution of the system is given by the amatrix a acting on the vectorized form of s this vectorization is given by vecs vec cij i ihj cij i j i where i i and j i are basis vectors multiplication then the action of a is given by matrix 0 a where we dropped the text vec for simplification of notation in index notation this is given by 1 0r0 s0 ar0 s0 rs rs to preserve hermiticity and trace a also satisfies as0 r0 sr ar0 s0 rs and ar0 r0 sr sr respectively there is also the bmatrix b which is related to a by br0 rs0 s ar0 s0 rs the bmatrix is often used because the constraints on the amatrix transfer nicely the conditions are hermiticity br0 rs0 s bs0 sr0 r and trace preserving br0 rs0 r r0 s0 since b is hermitian it has an eigenvectoreigenvalue decomposition br0 rs0 s rs cr0 r rs cs0 s where the c are the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of b one may write the map  b  a a where a c so that 1 this shows us the relation between the osr and smr representation it is known that the map is completely positive if and only if all 1 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution 21 structural physical approximation the problem of converting a ncp map to a cp map has been studied under structural physical approximation spa which was first introduced by horodecki and ekert and expanded upon by several authors 20 2534 spas are often used to approximate the partial transpose map and detect entanglement 3549 in spa the ncp superoperator  is approximated by  plcomp 1 p where lcomp is the completely depolarizing channel ie lcomp trid where d is the dimension of and 0 p 1 notice that spa is equal to the composition e l1p where the l1p is the symmetric depolarization channel which scales the polarization vector n 5053 by the factor 1 p the symmetric depolarization channel for a single qubit can be written in osr as  x x y y z z l1p 1 we study the composition e0 l0 where l0 performs asymmetric depolarization on each local state the asymmetric depolarization channel for a single qubit can be written in osr as l 1 1 x x 1 y y 1 z z where and are the amounts of depolarization in the x y and z directions respectively the asymmetric depolarizer does not generally preserve the direction of e0 can the bloch vector of the input state from the spa we immediately see that be made cp with appropriate symmetric depolarization however in the spa it is necessary that the systems are depolarized symmetrically and equally thus it is not immediately clear that depolarizing the individual local systems differently leads to a cp composition using a qudit to qubit isomorphism we prove that symmetric depolarization is not necessary we also show that when using asymmetric depolarization completely depolarizing is not necessary in any direction for any of the local systems for eq 18 to be cp however we also show that there exist ncp maps that are robust against depolarization and completely depolarizing is almost necessary guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution 3 extending the amatrix to higher dimensions one might think that a valid amatrix a is trivially extensible to higher dimensions in the smr representation by a i however this is not true as we show by a simple counter example below if we want the tensor product of two amatrices a1 a2 to have the correct action when operating on a twoqubit density operator we need to focus our attention to the operatorsum representation by definition when an amatrix acts on the vectorized form of a single qubit density operator the resultant state is the same thing we would have gotten by sending the qubit through a channel expressed in osr that is av d ei ei e where the subscripts d and v represent density and vector forms of an operator respectively an arbitrary twoqubit state has the form i i r i i s tij i j ij1 which when acted upon by a1 a2 becomes  a1 a2 iv iv r v iv iv s v tij i v j v ij1 iv iv a1 r v iv iv a2 s v tij a1 i v a2 j v ij1 the reason we vectorized all of the 2 2 submatrices in this state is that it simulates eq 20 exactly on the subsystems thus it is the same as if we derived the operatorsum decomposition for a1 and a2 and then acted upon the state ab with e1 e2 a really nice structure occurs when calculating the resultant vectorized state for a twoqubit system it turns out that if our state initially has the representation ab c d then the correct vectorized form of it is given by  b  v v  cv therefore we can use the normal extension a1 a2 if we vectorize our twoqubit state locally guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution generally we can simply perform a rotation on some general amatrix w so that its rows act on v the same way a1 a2 does this equates to the exchange of the rows 3 5 4 6 11 13 and 12 14 which is essentially a permutation matrix of the following form 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 therefore if we want to use the same vectorization specifically the one given in eq 24 for v when acted on by w we simply apply the rotation r such that w rwrt by doing this we can always use the vectorization in eq 24 to obtain the correct result for any amount of qubits d there exists a permutation matrix that will always lead to the same vectorization method for any a1 a2 ad hence the twoqubit amatrix of a1 a2 is given by ra1 a2 r note that for this particular permutation matrix r rt and r2 i the following example extends a single qubit amatrix with identity to act on a twoqubit state 31 example 1 let our initial two qubit state be the maximally mixed state ab iab let us perform the maximal depolarization on system a and leave the system b alone we might naturally assume that the global amatrix can be calculated directly as 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 a lcomp i  i 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution then straightforward calculation gives avecab vec this result is obviously wrong the correct output state is i to find the correct amatrix for the extension to higher dimensions we can use the osr let el i ei ei correspond to the osr of lcomp then the extended map is given el i ei iei i using eq 14 we can return to the smr representation and get the bmatrix and the amatrix the correct b and amatrices are b 14

with at least one negative eigenvalue to a final bmatrix with all positive eigenvalues equivalently this is going from eq 4 to eq 2 in osr 41 composition asymmetric depolarization we use composition with the asymmetric depolarization map which is also known as generalized depolarization obviously if we completely depolarize the composition guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution would be a cp map because we always end up with the maximally mixed state asymmetric depolarization has been studied in other contexts in the past 5457 but here we use it to transform a ncp map to a cp map without completely depolarizing note that the adm is doubly stochastic ie it preserves the identity matrix and it is trace preserving we first give the proof for the single qubit amatrix because the general case closely follows the same arguments theorem 1 let the single qubit asymmetric depolarization map be given by l for 1 1 2 0 the asymmetric depolarizer in osr is l 1 1 x x 1 y y 1 z z let a be a single qubit trace preserving ncp map then l a is cp for appropriate nonzero values of and proof this depolarizing map is completely positive when the following fujiwaraalgoet 58 conditions are satisfied  1 we can maximally depolarize by letting 0 we use the choi matrix representation the action of l on the pauli matrices are lx x ly y and lz z the adm leaves the identity matrixedinvariant next note that the unormalized e is given by maximally entangled 2 qubit state e 1 i i x x y y z z we can now get to the main proof the choi matrix for l a is given by l aiihj iihj l ai i l ax x ij0  l ay y l az z guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution we then use the fact that a is trace preserving the pauli matrices are hermitian and a hermitian matrix can be expanded in the basis of all possible tensors of pauli matrices we have ai i ak k 0 and aj ak k j j x y z where the ak s are arbitrary constants substituting eq 33 eq 36 and eq 37 into eq 35 we have l i ak k 0 i l ak k x x l aiihj iihj ij0 ak k y y l ak k z z  ii mk ak k 0 i mk ak k x x mk ak k z z mk ak k y y  i i j where mk corresponds to or and j is everything inside the square braces except the i i term the choi matrix eq 38 becomes positive as j goes to zero we can arbitrarily shrink j asymmetrically by decreasing the values of and independently thus from continuity with nonzero values of and l a is cp for some choice of and before proving the general case we show an isomorphism from maximally entangled qudits to the basis of tensored pauli matrices that we will use this theorem 2 will be used to rewrite the choi matrix in pauli matrix form theorem 2 for the unormalized maximally entangled two qudit state with qudit dimension d 2n where n represents the number of qubits we have the relation iiihjj ij0 wi1 i2 in i1 i2 in 2 1 i2 in 0 wi i 2 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution where i represents the identity or x y or z for the pauli matrix the subscript on the i represents the subspace i i1 i2 in i1 i2 in 2 i1 i2 in 2 and wi1 i2 in 1 for an even number of 2 s in i1 i2 in  1 for an odd number of 2 s in i1 i2 in we refer to the right hand side of eq 39 as the pauli form note that 0 i 1 x 2 y and 3 z proof the proof relies on figuring out the spectral decomposition of the pauli form the ricochet property states m i iii i m t iii acting on the right of the pauli form with d we get wi1 i2 in i1 i2 in i1 i2 in i1 i2 in 0 iii wi1 i2 in i i1 i2 in it1 i2 in i1 i2 in 0 i i i1 i2 in 0 1 n iii iii iii iii note that the signs in the definition of w comes from the relation yt y e is an eigenvector of the pauli form also keep in mind that therefore e d 2n thus we can write our pauli form in its spectral decomposition as wi1 i2 in i1 i2 in 2 1 i2 in 0 i i ihi e are orthogonal eigenvectors next we where i are real eigenvalues and i i show that the pauli form is a pure state and thus the i are all zero taking the square of both sides of eq 44 and then taking the trace we have wi i i i i i 2 tr i i ihi tr d i i i 0 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution since the pauli matrices are traceless eq 45 simplifies to i i tr 2n  tr 2 2i i ihi d i i i 0 1 2 1 n n  n 4 4 4n 4 4  i 0 therefore we must have wi1 i2 in i1 i2 in 2 1 i2 in 0 remark we can find a unitary relation between k pairs of maximally entangled qubits ebits and maximally entangled bipartite qudit state  specifically where u eis a swap operator and d 2k we only need to consider k 2 notice e pd1 iii is isomorphic to the identity pd1 iihi when there is an even that number of ebits eq 48 implies ueven i1 i1 i2 i2 ik2 ik2 ik21 ik21 ik22 ik22 ik ik i i01 and when there is an odd number of ebits uodd i1 i1 i2 i2 ibk2c1 ibk2c1 ibk2c2 ibk2c2 ik ik i i01 where the subscript k represents the k th ebit pair and the two situations require a different form of swap keep in mind that u is done before applying the isomorphism to the state so we can swap any of the systems the idea is to make the string in the ket and the bra equal let n 2k be the number of qubits and the qubits in the outer product be labeled as n ed n  1 n 1 n 1 2 2 2 for an even number of ebits ueven swapn2n1 swapn22n3 swap4n23 swap2n21 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution for an odd number of ebits we first perform u1 swapn21n22n23 n this leads to i1 i1 i2 i2 ibk2c ibk2c ibk2c1 ibk2c2 ibk2c2 ik ik ibk2c1 note that the qubit labels reset after u1 then perform u2 swapn21n2 swapn23n4 swap4n23 swap2n21 thus for an odd number of ebits uodd u2 u1 theorem 2 and the remark might be useful in other problems we can now prove our main theorem theorem 3 any n qubit tracepreserving ncp map ancp can be made cp by composing it with a map that performs asymmetric depolarization on each qubit with appropriate nonzero values of i i and i where i represents the ith qubit being depolarized proof we again make use of the choi matrix for a n qubit system we perform the adm on each qubit individually this action is equivalent to performing l0 ni1 li i where i represents the ith qubit we can maximally depolarize by letting i i i 0 this depolarizing map is completely positive when the following inequalities are satisfied i i 1 i the action of li on the pauli matrices are li x i x li y i y and li z i z the identity matrix is left invariant a is a mapping from n qubits to m qubits m may or may not equal n thus a c2 2 c2 2 let d 2n the choi matrix for the composition is l aiihj iihj wi1 i2 in l0 ai1 i2 in i1 i2 in i1 i2 in 0 wi l0 ai i  l0 ai i wi l0 ai i i60 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution where 0 000 i i1 i2 in we used theorem 2 on the right hand side of the first line and we explicitly separated the identity term on the last line like before since a is trace preserving and hermitian matrices can be expanded in the basis of tensor of pauli matrices including identity ai k i aj j 0 j60 and ai aj j i i 6 0 j60 where k 2n 2m is a positive nonzero constant to preserve the trace a is trace preserving and the aj s are arbitrary constants substituting eq 59 eq 61 and eq 62 into eq 60 we have n 1 wi l0 ai i l0 aiihj iihj l0 ai i i60 wi l0 aj j i i aj j 0 i  l0 i j60 i60 j60 1 x x mj aj j 0 i mj aj j i i  i j60  i i j i60 j60 where the mj s are the products of the appropriate i i and i constants from the local adms and j is everything in between the square braces that is not i i the choi matrix eq 63 becomes positive as j goes to zero we can arbitrarily shrink j asymmetrically by decreasing i i and i independently thus from continuity with nonzero values of i i and i l0 a is cp remark keep in mind that there exist ncp maps that are robust to asymmetric and symmetric depolarizers this means that the parameters and must be extremely close to zero in order to obtain a cp composition with the ncp amatrix for instance if we define a ncp map to be 1 1 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution where 123 5 we see that the parameters of the asymmetric depolarizer must be less than or equal to 1 to get a cp composition l a to see this we completely depolarize in two directions and determine the constraint on the third direction the eigenvalues of the composition with l1 0 0 and l0 0 1 contain one negative value and the composition with l0 0 requires 1 for a cp composition which gives the eigenvalues of 1 1 0 0 for the composition therefore maps where becomes increasingly large certainly do not capture any advantages over the symmetric depolarizer we can look at the individual directions separately because we are depolarizing asymmetrically since there exists initial states outside the domain whose eigenvalues of their resultant states blow up to as we need to check the validity of this map just like the asymmetric depolarizer we can define a translation of the original states bloch vector with the amatrix 2 z0 0 0  x0 iy0 2 0 x0 iy0 t 2 x0 iy0 0 2 x0 iy0 0 0 2 z0 to perform the action x y z x x0 y y0 z z0 on the initial bloch vector 59 this transformation will obviously be ncp for any nonzero translation vector x0 y0 z0 since the image bloch sphere is not fully contained in the initial bloch sphere this translation matrix only has a valid physical domain when the translation vector has a magnitude less than or equal to 2 even though it is a valid amatrix for values outside of this interval this begs the question of whether or not 64 represents a valid mapping of our qubit the answer to this question is yes it is valid figure 1 illustrates the action of this map when 1 when we see that the state i x a i z always leads to a valid state the domain for the output state increases as decreases in the limit as the only valid output is the 1istate given by the transformation in 67 so this valid amatrix can have an operatorsum decomposition with eigenvalues in the limit that blow up to while illustrating true robustness to the asymmetric depolarizing map it is very interesting how there exists a mapping that is so resistant to heavy noise in all directions yet the magnitude of the bloch vector for the istate is left invariant at the end of that mapping future research can look into the physicality of this map such as the global evolution on some correlated state that would induce such a transformation on one of the subsystems guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution figure 1 on top left the length of the initial bloch vector is r 16 and it increases in length by intervals of 16 from left to right so the bottom right bloch sphere has a radius of 1 we fix 1 we see that as the length of the initial bloch vector increases there is more intersection between the bloch sphere and its image thus we only need to consider when r 1 to determine that the transformation is always possible with increasing 42 asymmetric depolarization map measures from this point on we let l ni1 li i or the single qubit adm when we perform adm we generally change the states bloch vector therefore it is important to measure how much the state is changed there are multiple measures we can use first we give our adm measure m1 m1 which is basically just an averaging over the absolute values of the depolarizing parameters the range of m1 is 0 m1 1 at the two extremes we have total loss of the bloch vector and the magnitude of the bloch vector unchanged for the values of 0 and 1 respectively for n qubits this measure generalizes in the obvious way to 1 x m1 ci 3n i1 where the ci s are the depolarization parameters the m1 measure for the symmetric depolarizing channel is simply given by a single depolarizing parameter that we can call  that is between 0 and 1 for single qubits we also have the closed form for measures using fidelity and the diamond norm we can calculate the fidelity between the initial state and the final state for the asymmetric depolarizer when it is composed with some error map a define the matrix  0 0 d 0 0 0 0 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution we can define two fidelity measures the first fidelity is 1 r dr 1 r r1 r 0 d2r 0 f l a where r is the bloch vector of the initial state and r 0 is the bloch vector of the state a this fidelity is good for error correction since we would reduce the effect of the composition while we ensuring complete positivity of the composition for the symmetric depolarizer d i if we are interested in approximating the amatrix while ensuring a cp composition with the asymmetric depolarizer then we want to use the calculation 1 r dr 1 r 0 r 0 1 r 0 d2r 0 f a l a when comparing the gate fidelity of two pauli channels the general equation is given by the diamond norm 60 and has the analytical form of x 1 e1 e2 i i where each channel has the form x j x j ej i i i such that i 1 for j 1 2 in the case where e1 is the asymmetric depolarizing channel and e2 is the symmetric depolarizing channel we have that the diamond norm e1 e2 is equal to  3 75 the parameters and describe the asymmetric depolarizer and the parameter  describes the symmetric one the distance between the asymmetric depolarizer and symmetric depolarizer gives us a measure of the advantage of the asymmetric depolarizer because the performance of the asymmetric depolarizer is generally lower bounded by the symmetric depolarizer 43 adm composition vs spa information loss we would like to show that the composition with the asymmetric depolarizer is generally better than the spa at retaining information as was shown in the introduction the spa is equivalent to composition with a symmetric depolarizer the natural way to compare the two compositions would be to use mutual information and show that il a a ilsymm a a where l is the asymmetric depolarizer lsymm is the symmetric depolarizer a is the input ncp amatrix and ia b is the mutual information for the systems a and b however since this calculates the mutual information for product states ie a and b are not correlated these values are zero instead we bound the linear entropy sl 1 tr2 61 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution lemma 1 let a be a trace preserving ncp map be the depolarization parameter for lsymm ci s be the depolarization parameters for l and l a and lsymm a be cp with the minimum depolarization required minimum depolarization is given by maximizing m1 with ci i then the linear entropy is bounded by sl lsymm a sl l a remark if the depolarization parameters are not constrained by ci i the result does not hold as shown by the counter examples in subsection 52 also note that the linear entropy is a good measure for qubits but can be a misleading measure for higher dimensional states due to the possible distribution of the eigenvalues proof the minimum depolarization for the adm composition la can be bounded by going back to the positivity of the choi matrix of the compositions notice that the choi matrix for the spa is equivalent to the choi matrix for the adm composition when all the depolarizing parameters are equal this must be true because when the depolarizing parameters are all equal we are symmetrically depolarizing then the composition is cp for some optimal symmetric depolarization value c at this value the purity of the output of the two compositions are the same and the symmetric depolarization used for the spa is optimal since ci i the purity of the output of the adm composition must be greater than or equal to the purity of the output of the spa and the bound follows 44 composition with adm as a structural physical approximation can the composition l a be considered a structural physical approximation of the ncp amatrix structural physical approximations should preserve the structure of the original amatrix by preserving the direction of the bloch vector of the output of the original ncp amatrix 25 the adm does not in general preserve the direction of the bloch vector when the adm depolarizes symmetrically the composition is completely equivalent to the spa if local depolarizers are also used for the spa 5 examples we give some examples of ncp maps and their corresponding adms that convert them to cp maps the first two examples are detailed and for the last two examples we just give the corresponding adm note that we let l l and t t x0 y0 z0 the translation matrix defined in eq 65 51 example 2 this example illustrates the advantage of asymmetric over symmetric depolarization with regards to making cp maps in general a single qubit tracepreserving map has guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution the form 1 1 a b b 1 d for this example let us use the ncp translation 1 0 t 0 0 12 4 0 matrix so that the bloch sphere gets shifted up from its initial position along the zaxis by 12 as seen in fig 2 intuitively the asymmetric depolarizer that will work best as given by our measures in section 42 for making this a valid cp map by composition is given by shrinking p the z component of the bloch vector by 23 then the and we get a cp composition when we depolarize p the z components are 23 note thatp component by 23 and 0 23 we obviously would choose 23 because we would like to depolarize by the least amount possible the symmetric depolarizer that will work best for making this a valid cp map by composition is given by shrinking the z component of the bloch vector by 23 which also shrinks the x and y components by the same proportion from our m1 measure we can see that the adm composition performs better than the spa m1 23 for the symmetric depolarizer compared to m1 2 2 69 0767 0667 for the adm in terms of the bloch sphere the adm shrinks the image space of the transpose into an ellipsoid while the symmetric depolarizer retains the image shape of a sphere the volume of the image space for the adm composition is always greater than the volume of the spa image space however the symmetric depolarizer maintains the shape of the image space of the orignal ncp map but the adm does not the eigenvalues of the resultant dynamical bmatrix for l 23 23 23 t 0 0 12 are 53 13 0 0 and for l 23 23 23 are 165 2 6 16 16 165 2 6 for the spa the eigenvalues of the resultant dynamical bmatrix l23 23 23 t 0 0 12 are 165 17 13 165 17 0 and for l23 23 23 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution figure 2 the first picture illustrates the action of the ncp translation map on an arbitrary qubit on the bloch sphere the lighter image represents the original bloch sphere and the darker sphere is the image of the translation map along the zaxis the second image demonstrates how the ellipsoid positivity domain of the final state becomes completely inscribed inside the original bloch sphere after the asymmetric depolarizing map composes with the translation map therefore we have a valid cp map in the end are 32 16 16 16 notice how both the composition map and also the l map must have nonnegative eigenvalues to have a valid implementable protocol in general the minimum degree of depolarization can be obtained in a numerical optimization program that maximizes the m1 measure in eq 68 while leaving both sets of eigenvalues nonnegative a calculation of the fidelity in eq 71 between initial pure states and final states for the adm composition and the spa are given by 8 6 2 cos 2 6 cos2 fadm l t and fspa l t 5 cos which are only dependent on the polar angle the difference of the adm composition and spa fidelity measures is given by 16 6 2sin2 which is always greater than or equal to zero thus the adm is better at state preservation than the symmetric depolarizer as illustrated in figure 3 the gate fidelity in eq 75 between the two depolarizers is 13 6 2 15 interesting enough this value is double the maximum difference of the fidelity of the best adm composition and spa setups 52 example 3 if we allow the asymmetric depolarizer to depolarize more in some directions than the symmetric depolarizer we can get even higher values for the m1 measure in some cases guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution fidelity 100 095 090 085 080 075 070 figure 3 the solid line gives the fidelity with respect to the parameter between the output of the adm composition with the initial state when the initial states are pure the dashed line represents the fidelity for the spa with the initial state the lowest achievable fidelity in each case is 23 which occurs at but for any other value of corresponding to nonunit fidelity we see that the adm composition has a higher fidelity than the spa take for example the following valid ncp map given by 0 1 1 2 1 2  12 1 0 1 2 0 1 1 2  1 2 1 1 2 0 1 2 which has an associated bmatrix with eigenvalues 2 2 2 and 0 the optimal symmetric depolarizer that makes the composition cp is given by the parameter  11 2 2 it turns out that for any for the asymmetric depolarizer and not all equal to  we cannot make the composition cp an optimization shows that we can completely depolarize in the x and z direction while leaving the y direction unchanged that is  0 and 1 the m1 measure is optimal and higher for the asymmetric depolarizer even though we depolarized more than the symmetric depolarizer in two of the directions to maintain complete positivity of the composition map while the magnitude of the depolarizing is less than or equal to the symmetric depolarizer in each direction we must include negative values for one or two of the asymmetric depolarizing parameters depending on what measure you choose to use m1 measure or fidelity you may want to depolarize more in some directions and less in others over the symmetric depolarizer in this next example our m1 measure can only be optimized when we depolarize more than the symmetric depolarizer in two of the directions define the ncp map guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution with the evolutionary operator 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 1 2 which has an associated bmatrix with the eigenvalues 1 2 1 this map will translate the original bloch sphere in the negative x and z directions by 2 so that the original and image spheres touch at one point ie there is only a single state in the domain defined by the state  12i 1 2x z on the domain and y t y on the image if we symmetrically depolarize with parameter  13 then the spa becomes completely positive the m1 measure is equal to 13 in this case but we can obtain a value of 13 1309 when we use an asymmetric depolarizer with parameters  49200 and 8191000 it turns out that we can only achieve an m1 measure of up to 13 when 13 you can see this by slightly bumping the absolute value of each parameter consecutively by a small value above 13 and noticing that the composition map becomes ncp therefore it is necessary to depolarize more than the symmetric depolarizer in two of the directions in order to achieve an advantage for the adm we also achieve a higher fidelity of eq 71 in this case 151400 03775 than we do in the symmetric one 13 53 example 4 let ancp bncp where x 1 then the composition l1x2 1x2 1 ancp is cp where 1x2 0 1x2 0 l1x 1x 1 bl 0 1x2 0 1x2 guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution notice how the initial and final states are left invariant after this transformation due to the fact that l a i i this will always be true if a is invertible and its inversion has a positive dynamical bmatrix this leads to the open question of which fullrank invertible amatrices have nonnegative dynamical bmatrices for the inverse in the case of asymmetric depolarization the initial parameters must be greater than 1 or less than 1 the translation ncp map will always have a negative inversion there exists other a maps that cannot be expressed in terms of translations and asymmetric depolarization generally it is unknown for these maps which will have cp inversions 54 example 5 let ancp 0 32 0 12 bncp 12 0  0 32 0 0 12 0 12 where x 6 2 2 then the composition l1x2 1x2 0 ancp is cp where 0 1x2 12 0  0 1x2 bl l1x 1x 0 0 12 1x2 0 1x2 0 6 conclusion in this paper we studied transforming a ncp map to a cp map through composition with the asymmetric depolarizing map adm the adm acts as a supersuperoperator that maps the input ncp map to a cp map this problem is similar to structural physical approximation however in spa symmetric depolarization is required we found that a trace preserving ncp map on qubits can always be made cp by acting on the individual qubits with local adms the proof uses an isomorphism between a maximally entangled 2 qudit state and n qubits furthermore we prove that these local adms never have to completely depolarize in any direction and are not required to be symmetric note that a global adm can preserve the structure of the input ncp map better than local adms on the individual qubits this is due to the fact that the depolarization factors from the multiple local depolarizers mutiply on the correlation matrix thus the correlation matrix shrinks more rapidly than the local bloch or polarization vectors however experimentally implementing a global adm is very difficult for a large number of qubits next we defined measures of the adm which tells us how much the input state into the adm is disturbed under these measures the adm composition has some guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution advantage over spa in preserving the structure of the original map finally we gave examples one interesting example in eq 64 shows that there exist valid amatrices that are robust against asymmetric depolarization and completely depolarizing becomes almost necessary we also showed with another example in eq 85 that under the measure we called m1 and also the fidelity sometimes completely depolarizing in one direction while not necessary results in a better approximation finally for qutrit maps the task of transforming a ncp map to a cp map via local adms is unproven we leave this for
