this problem by assessing the accessibility of 11397 pdfs published 20102019 sampled across various fields of study finding that only 24 of these pdfs satisfy all of our defined accessibility criteria we introduce the scia11y system to offset some of the issues around inaccessibility scia11y incorporates several machine learning models to extract the content of scientific pdfs and render this content as accessible html with added novel navigational features to support screen reader users an intrinsic evaluation of extraction quality indicates that the majority of html renders 87 produced by our system have no or only some readability issues we perform a qualitative user study to understand the needs of blv researchers when reading papers and to assess whether the scia11y system could address these needs we summarize our user study findings into a set of five design recommendations for accessible scientific reader systems user response to scia11y was positive with all users saying they would be likely to use the system in the future and some stating that the system if available would become their primary workflow we successfully produce html renders for over 12m papers of which

institute for ai seattle wa 98103 university of washington seattle wa 98103 wang ll and cachola i et al introduction scientific literature is most commonly available in the form of pdfs which pose challenges for accessibility 6 34 when researchers students and other individuals who are blind or low vision blv interact with scientific pdfs through screen readers the availability of document structure tags labeled reading order labeled headers and image alttext are necessary to facilitate these interactions however these features must be painstakingly added by authors using proprietary software tools and as a result are often missing from papers low vision or dyslexic readers who interact with pdfs through screen magnification or texttospeech may also find the complexity of certain academic paper pdf formats challenging eg nonlinear layout can interrupt the flow of text in a magnifying tool inaccessible paper pdfs can lead to high cognitive overload frustration and abandonment of reading for blv readers unfortunately we find that the majority of scientific pdfs lack basic accessibility features we estimate based on a sample of 11397 pdfs from multiple fields of study that only around 24 of paper pdfs released in the last decade satisfy all of the aforementioned accessibility requirements accessibility challenges for academic pdfs are largely due to three factors 1 the complexity of the pdf file format which make it less amenable to certain accessibility features 2 the dearth of tools especially nonproprietary tools for creating accessible pdfs and 3 the dependency on volunteerism from the community with minimal support or enforcement 6 the intent of the pdf file format is to support faithful visual representation of a document for printing a goal that is inherently divergent from that of document representation for the purposes of accessibility though some professional organizations like the association for computing machinery acm have encouraged pdf accessibility through standards and writing guidelines1 uptake among academic publishers and disciplines more broadly has been limited while policy changes help the fact remains that most academic pdfs produced today and historically are inaccessible yet remain as the dominant way to read those papers a longrange solution will necessitate buyin from multiple stakeholderspublishers authors readers technologists granting agencies and the like but in the interim there are technological solutions that can be offered as a sort of bandaid to the problem we use this paper to offer an indepth qualitative and quantitative description of the problem as it stands and to introduce one such technological solution the scia11y system that automatically extracts semantic information from paper pdfs and rerenders this content in the form of an accessible html document though the process is imperfect and can introduce errors we demonstrate the ability of the rendered htmls to reduce cognitive load and facilitate inpaper navigation and interactions for blv users the goals and contributions of this paper are threefold 1 we characterize the state of academicpaper pdf accessibility by estimating the degree of adherence to accessibility criteria for papers published in the last decade 20102019 and describe correlations between year field of study pdf typesetting software and pdf accessibility 2 we propose an automated approach for extracting the content of academic pdfs and displaying this content in a more accessible html document format we build a prototype that rerenders 12 million pdfs in html and describe the design decisions features and quality of the renders assessed as faithfulness to the source pdf we perform expert grading of the rendered html and report an error analysis a demo of our system is available at scia11yorg which makes available 15m html renders of open access pdfs 3 we conduct an exploratory user study with six blv scholars to better understand the challenges they experience when reading academic papers and how our proposed tool might augment their current workflow during 1 httpswwwacmorgpublicationsauthorssubmissions improving the accessibility of scientific documents fig 1 a schematic for creating the scia11y html render from a paper pdf starting with the raw twocolumn pdf on the left s2orc 24 is used to extract title authors abstract section headers body text and references s2orc also identifies links between inline citations and references to figures and table objects deepfigures 43 is used to extract figures and tables along with their captions the output of these two models are merged with metadata from the semantic scholar api heuristics are used to construct a table of contents to insert figures and tables in the appropriate places in the text and to repair broken urls we add html headers as illustrated header tags for sections paragraph tags for body text and figure tags for figures and tables highlighted components table of contents and links in references are not in the pdf and novel navigational features that we introduce to the html render an example html render of parts of a paper document is show to the right actual render is single column which is split here for presentation the study we ask users to interact with the prototype and offer feedback for its improvement we perform open coding of interviews to identify existing reading challenges coping mechanisms as well as positive and negative responses to prototype features we summarize the findings of this user study into a set of design recommendations our analysis reveals that pdf accessibility adherence is low across all fields of study of the five accessibility criteria we assess only 24 of the pdfs we assess demonstrate full compliance though compliance for several criteria seems to be increasing over time author awareness and contribution to accessibility remains low as alttext has the lowest compliance of the five criteria at between 510 alttext is the only criterion of the five that requires author intervention in all cases using current tools we also find that typesetting software is strongly associated with accessibility compliance with latex and publishing software like arbortext app producing low compliance pdfs while microsoft word is generally associated with higher compliance to offset the reading challenges of inaccessible papers for blv researchers we propose and test the scia11y system for rendering academic pdfs into accessible html documents as shown in figure 1 our prototype integrates several machine learning text and vision models to extract the structure and semantic content of papers the content is represented as an html document with headings and links for navigation figures and tables as well as other novel features to assist in document structure understanding our evaluation of the scia11y system identifies common classes of extraction problems and finds that though many papers exhibit some extraction errors the majority 55 have no major problems that impact readability and another 32 have only some problems that impact readability wang ll and cachola i et al through our user study we identify numerous challenges faced by blv users when reading paper pdfs including some that affect the whole document or limit navigation and many that affect the ability of the reader to understand text or various elements of a paper like math content or tables responses to scia11y were positive participants especially liked navigation features such as headings the table of contents and bidirectional links between inline citations and references of the extraction errors in scia11y missed or incorrectly extracted headings were the most problematic as these impact the users ability to navigate between sections and fully trust the system all users reported being likely to use the system in the future when asked how the system might be integrated into their workflow one participant replied i think it would become the workflow another participant said for unaccessible pdfs this is lifechanging we condense these findings into a set of recommendations for designing and engineering accessible reading systems section 63 most importantly documents should be structured to match a readers mental model objects should be properly tagged and care should be taken to reduce the readers cognitive load and increase trust in the system features that emulate the external memory that visual layout provides to sighted users can be especially beneficial this paper is organized as follows following a description of related work in section 2 we first provide a metascientific analysis of the current state of academic pdf accessibility in section 3 in section 4 we document our pipeline for converting pdf to html and describe the scia11y prototype for rendering papers an evaluation of html render quality and faithfulness is provided in section 5 section 6 describes our user study and findings we recognize that no pdf extraction system is perfect and many open research challenges remain in improving these systems however based on our findings we believe scia11y can dramatically improve screen reader navigation of most papers compared to pdfs and is wellpositioned to assist blv researchers with many of their most common reading use cases our hope is that a system such as scia11y can improve blv researcher access to the content of academic papers and that these design recommendations can be leveraged by others to create better more faithful and ultimately more usable tools and systems for scholars in the blv community related work accessibility is an essential component of computing which aims to make technology broadly accessible to as many users as possible including those with differing sets of abilities improvements in usability and accessibility falls to the community to better understand the needs of users with differing abilities and to design technologies that play to this spectrum of abilities 48 in computing significant strides have been made to increase the accessibility of web content for example various versions of the web content accessibility guidelines wcag 8 10 and the inprogress working draft for wcag 302 or standards such as aria from the w3cs web accessibility initiative wai3 have been released and used to guide web accessibility design and implementation similarly positive steps have been made to improve the accessibility of user interfaces and user experience 5 35 36 46 as well as various types of media content 19 29 32 we take inspiration from accessibility design principles in our effort to make research publications more accessible to users who are blind and low vision blindness and low vision are some of the most common forms of disability affecting an estimated 310 of americans depending on how visual impairment is defined 18 blv researchers also make up a representative sample of researchers in the united states and worldwide a recent nature editorial pushes the scientific community to better support researchers with visual impairments 41 since existing tools and resources can be limited there are many inherent accessibility challenges to performing research in this paper we engage with one of these challenges that affects all domains of study accessing and reading the content of academic publications 2 httpswwww3orgtrwcag30 3 httpswwww3orgwaistandardsguidelinesaria improving the accessibility of scientific documents blv users interact with papers using screen readers braille displays texttospeech and other assistive tools a webaim survey of screen reader users found that the vast majority 751 of respondents indicate that pdf documents are very or somewhat likely to pose significant accessibility issues4 most paper are published in pdf which is inherently inaccessible due in large part to its conflation of visual layout information with semantic content 6 34 bigham et al 6 describe the historical reasons we use pdf as the standard document format for scientific publications as well as the barriers the format itself presents to accessibility prior work on scientific accessibility have made recommendations for how to make pdfs more accessible 11 38 including greater awareness for what constitutes an accessible pdf and better tooling for generating accessible pdfs some work has focused on addressing components of paper accessibility such as the correct way for screen readers to interpret and read mathematical equations 1 4 16 17 26 44 45 describe charts and figures 1214 automatically generate figure captions 9 37 or automatically classify the content of figures 21 other work applicable to all types of pdf documents aims to improve automatic text and layout detection of scanned documents 31 and extract table content 15 39 in this work we focus on the issue of representing overall document structure and navigation within that structure being able to quickly navigate the contents of a paper through skimming and scanning is an essential reading technique 28 which is currently undersupported by pdf documents and pdf readers when reading these documents by screen reader there also exists a variety of automatic and manual tools that assess and fix accessibility compliance issues in pdfs including the adobe acrobat pro accessibility checker5 common look6 abbyy finereader7 pave8 and pdfa inspector9 to our knowledge pave and pdfa inspector are the only nonproprietary opensource tools for this purpose based on our experiences however all of these tools require some degree of human intervention to properly tag a scientific document and tagging and fixing must be performed for each new version of a pdf regardless of how minor the change may be guidelines and policy changes have been introduced in the past decade to ameliorate some of the issues around scientific pdf accessibility some conferences such as the acm chi virtual conference on human factors in computing systems chi and the acm sigaccess conference on computers and accessibility assets have released guidelines for creating accessible submissions10 the acm digital library11 provides some publications in html format which is easier to make accessible than pdf 20 ribera et al 40 conducted a case study on dsai 2016 software development and technologies for enhancing accessibility and fighting infoexclusion the authors of dsai were responsible for creating accessible proceedings and identified barriers to creating accessible proceedings including lack of sufficient tooling and lack of awareness of accessibility the authors recommended creating a new role in the organizing committee dedicated to accessible publishing these policy changes have led to improvements in localized communities but have not been widely adopted by all academic publishers and conference organizers table 1 lists prior studies that have analyzed pdf accessibility of academic papers and shows how our study compares prior work has primarily focused on papers published in humancomputer interaction and related fields specific to certain publication venues while our analysis tries to quantify paper accessibility more broadly brady et al 7 quantified the accessibility of

prior work has investigated pdf accessibility for papers published in specific venues such as chi assets w4a dsai or various disability journals several of these works were conducted manually and were limited to a small number of papers while the more thorough analysis was conducted for chi and assets two conference venues focused on accessibility and hci our study expands on this prior work to investigate accessibility over 11397 pdfs sampled from across different fields of study document tags headers and language they found that compliance improved over time as a response to conference organizers offering to make papers accessible as a service to any author upon request lazar et al 23 conducted a study quantifying accessibility compliance at chi from 2010 to 2016 as well as assets 2015 confirming the results of brady et al 7 they found that across 5 accessibility criteria the rate of compliance was less than 30 for chi papers in each of the 7 years that were studied the study also analyzed papers from assets 2015 an acm conference explicitly focused on accessibility and found that those papers had significantly higher rates of compliance with over 90 of the papers being tagged for correct reading order and no criteria having less than 50 compliance this finding indicates that community buyin is an important contributor to paper accessibility nganji 33 conducted a study of 200 pdfs of papers published in four disability studies journals finding that accessibility compliance was between 1530 for the four journals analyzed with some publishers having higher adherence than others to date no large scale analysis of scientific pdf accessibility has been conducted outside of disability studies and hci due in part to the challenge of scaling such an analysis we believe such an analysis is useful for establishing a baseline and characterizing routes for future improvement consequently as part of this work we conduct an analysis of scientific pdf accessibility across various fields of study and report our findings relative to prior work analysis of academic pdf accessibility to capture and better characterize the scope and depth of the problems around academic pdf accessibility we perform a broad metascientific analysis we aim to measure the extent of the problem eg what proportion of papers have accessible pdfs whether the state of pdf accessibility is improving over time eg are papers published in 2019 more likely to be accessible than those published in 2010 and whether the typesetting software used to create a paper is associated with the accessibility of its pdf eg are papers created using microsoft word more or less accessible than papers created with other software prior studies on pdf accessibility have been limited to papers from specific publication venues such as chi assets w4a dsai and journals in disability research notably these venues are closer to the field of accessible computing and improving the accessibility of scientific documents are consequently more invested in accessibility12 we expand upon this work by investigating accessibility trends across various fields of study and publication venues our goal is to characterize the overall state of paper pdf accessibility and identify ongoing challenges to accessibility going forward data methods we sample pdfs from the semantic scholar literature corpus 3 for analysis we construct a dataset of papers by sampling pdfs published in the years of 20102019 stratified across the 19 top level fields of study defined by microsoft academic graph 42 47 examples of fields include biology computer science physics sociology and others this dataset allows us to investigate the overall state of pdf accessibility for academic papers and to study the relationship between field of study and pdf accessibility for each field of study we sample papers from the top venues by total citation count along with some documents without venue information which include things like books and book chapters the resulting papers come from 1058 unique publication venues for each field of study between 29 and 110 publication venues are represented with art on the minimum end and economics and computer science on the maximum end each field is represented by an average of 65 different publication venues the vast majority of documents sampled into our dataset are published papers rather than preprints or other nonpeerreviewed manuscripts publication venues represented in our sample are generally highly reputable journals for example the lancet or neurology for medicine the astrophysical journal and physical review letters for physics or various ieee publications for computer science and engineering in some cases the mapping between publication venue and field of study can be unclear for example the publication venue mathematical problems in engineering is associated with mathematics in our sample rather than engineering from an examination of the data classifications seem reasonable and could be justified we estimate that around 22 of the sample are conference papers 61 are book chapters reports or lecture notes less than 05 are preprints and the remaining majority are journal publications we believe this is a reasonably representative sample of paperlike documents available to scholars and researchers we analyze the pdfs in our dataset using the adobe acrobat pro dc pdf accessibility checker13 though this checker is proprietary and requires a paid license it is the most comprehensive accessibility checker available and has been used in prior work on accessibility 23 33 40 alternatively nonproprietary pdf parsers such as pdfbox14 do not consistently extract accessibility criteria from sample pdfs even when the criteria are met we also prefer adobes checker to pdfa inspector used by brady et al 7 because pdfa inspector only analyzes three criteria whereas we are interested in other accessibility attributes as well like the presence of alttext for each pdf the adobe accessibility checker generates a report that includes whether or not the pdf passes or fails tests for certain accessibility features such as the inclusion of figure alttext or properly tagged headings for navigation because there is no api or standalone application for the adobe accessibility checker it can only be accessed through the user interface of a licensed version of adobe acrobat pro we develop an applescript program that enables us to automatically process papers through the adobe checker our program requires a dedicated computer running macos and a licensed version of adobe acrobat pro it takes 10 seconds on average to download and process each pdf which 12 see submission and

conducted by lazar et al 23 on pdfs of papers published in chi showing the percentage of papers that satisfy each of the five accessibility criteria we find similar compliance rates indicating that our automated accessibility checker pipeline is comparable to previous analysis methods we also show the percentage of papers in our full dataset of 11397 pdfs that satisfy each criterion along with the percent that satisfy adobe5 compliance enables us to scale up our analysis to tens of thousands of papers accessibility reports from the checker are saved in html format for subsequent analysis each report contains a total of 32 accessibility criteria marked as passed failed or needs manual check15 following lazar et al 23 we analyze the following five criteria16  alttext figures have alternate text  table headers tables have headers  tagged pdf the document is tagged to specify the correct reading order  default language the document has a specified reading language  tab order the document is tagged with correct reading order used for navigation with the tab key for our analysis we also report total compliance which refers to the sum number of accessibility criteria met eg if a paper has met 3 out of the 5 criteria we specify then total compliance is 3 in some cases we report the normalized total compliance which is computed as the total compliance divided by 5 and can be interpreted as the proportion of the 5 criteria which are satisfied we also report adobe5 compliance a binary value of whether a paper has met all 5 criteria we specify 1 if all 5 criteria are met 0 if any are not met and the rate of adobe5 compliance for papers in our dataset in addition to running the accessibility checker we also extract metadata for each pdf focusing on metadata related to the pdf creation process pdf metadata are generated by the software used to create each file and we analyze the associations between different pdf creation software and the accessibility of the resulting pdf document our hypothesis is that some classes of software such as microsoft word produce more accessible pdfs accuracy of our automated accessibility checker previous work employed different versions of the adobe accessibility checker to generate paper accessibility reports to confirm the accuracy of our checker as well as the automated script we create to perform the analysis we run our checker on chi 2010 papers to reproduce the results of lazar et al 23 we identify chi papers using dois reported by the acm and resolve these to pdfs in the semantic scholar corpus 3 we identify 3248 chi papers in the corpus and generate accessibility reports for these using our automated checker 15 please see httpshelpxadobecomacrobatusingcreateverifypdfaccessibilityhtml for a description of the accessibility report papers containing no tables andor no figures the adobe checker can still return both pass or fail for the table header and alttext criteria respectively when objects in the pdf are not tagged the checker will fail these criteria even when the paper has no tables andor no figures when objects in the pdf are tagged and the pdf is accessible the checker will pass these criteria even when the paper has no tables or no figures 16 for improving the accessibility of scientific documents fig 2 the distribution of numbers of pdfs in our dataset that meet our defined accessibility compliance criteria a large majority 8519 of pdfs in our sample meet 0 out of 5 accessibility criteria of those meeting 1 criterion total compliance 1 the most commonly met criterion is default language 793 of 1010 785 of those meeting 4 criteria total compliance 4 the most common missing criterion is alttext 396 of 494 802 fig 3 percent of papers per field of study that meet all 5 accessibility criteria defined in adobe5 compliance philosophy art and psychology have the highest rates of adobe5 compliance satisfaction while biology mathematics and geology have the lowest rates none of the fields had more than 65 of pdfs satisfying adobe5 compliance our results shows similar rates of compliance compared to what was measured by lazar et al 23 see table 2 for results this indicates that our automated accessibility checker produces comparable results to previous studies wang ll and cachola i et al fig 4 accessibility compliance over time 20102019 the rate of adobe5 compliance has remained relatively stable over the last decade at around 23 compliance along several criteria have improved over time though the largest improvements have been in default language the simplistic criteria to meet modest improvements are seen for table headers tagged pdfs and tab order the presence of alttext has remained stable and lower around 510 proportion of papers with accessible pdfs around 16 of pdfs we attempted to process failed in the adobe checker ie we could not generate an accessibility report the accessibility checker most commonly fails because the pdf file is password protected or the pdf file is corrupt in both of these cases the pdf is inaccessible to the user we exclude these pdfs from subsequent analysis accessibility compliance over all papers is low table 2 shows the percent of papers meeting each of the five criteria as well as the adobe5 compliance rate associated with this sample of papers figure 2 shows that the vast majority of papers do not meet any of the five accessibility criteria 8519 papers 747 do not meet any criteria and very few 275 papers 24 meet all five of those pdfs meeting 1 criterion the most commonly met criterion is default language 793 of 1010 785 of those pdfs meeting 4 criteria the most common missing criterion is alttext 396 of 494 802 in fact only 854 pdfs 75 in the whole dataset have alttext for figures this is intuitive as alttext is the only criterion that always requires author input to achieve while the other four criteria can be derived from the document or automatically inferred depending on the software used to generate the pdf as shown in figure 3 all fields have an adobe5 compliance of less than 7 the fields with the highest rates of compliance are philosophy 63 art 62 business 57 psychology 57 and history 53 while the fields with the lowest rates of compliance are geology 02 mathematics 03 and biology 06 fields associated with higher compliance tend to be closer to the humanities and those with lower levels of compliance tend to be science and engineering fields the prevalence of different document editing and typesetting software by field of study may explain some of these differences and we explore these associations in section 35 trends in paper accessibility over time we show changes in compliance for all fields of study over time in figure 4 with the exception of default language all accessibility criteria demonstrate slowly increasing or stable compliance rates over the past decade with increases seen in tagged pdfs and tab order over time default language compliance is increasing most rapidly from around improving the accessibility of scientific documents typesetting software count adobe indesign latex arbortext app microsoft word printer 1591 140 1431 126 1374 121 1318 116 1021 90 other 4662 409 table 3 count of papers per typesetting software other includes pdfs created with an additional 24 unique software programs each with counts of less than 350 as well as those created with an unknown typesetting software 10 compliance in 2010 to more than 25 in 2019 this may be due to changes in pdf generation defaults in various typesetting software though this improvement is good default language is the easiest of the five criteria to bring into compliance and arguably the least valuable in terms of improving the accessible reading experience the criterion with the lowest rate of compliance is alttext which has remained stable between 510 and has been lower in recent years since alttext is the only criterion of the five which always necessitates author intervention we believe this is a sign that authors have not become more attuned to accessibility needs and that at least some of the improvements we see over time can be attributed to typesetting software or publisherlevel changes association between typesetting software and paper accessibility typesetting software is extracted from pdf metadata and manually canonicalized we extract values for three metadata fields xmpcreatortool pdfdocinfocreatortool and producer all unique pdf creation tools associated with more than 20 pdfs in our dataset are reviewed and mapped to a canonical typesetting software for example the values latex pdftex tex live tex vtex pdf xetex are mapped to the latex cluster while the values microsoft for word word and other variants are mapped to the microsoft word cluster we realize that not all microsoft word versions latex distributions or other versions of typesetting software within a cluster are equal but this normalization allows us to generalize over these software clusters for analysis we compare the five most commonly observed typesetting software clusters in our dataset grouping all others into a cluster called other we report the distribution of typesetting software in table 3 the most popular pdf creators are adobe indesign latex arbortext app microsoft word and printer printer refers to pdfs generated by a printer driver by selecting print save as pdf in most operating systems unfortunately creating a pdf through printing provides no indicator of what software was used to typeset the document and is generally associated with very low accessibility compliance the other category aggregates papers created by all other clusters of typesetting software each of these clusters is associated with less than 350 pdfs ie the falloff is steep after the printer cluster for the following analysis we present a comparison between the five most common pdf creator clusters figure 5 shows histograms of the total compliance score for pdfs in the five most common typesetting software clusters while the vast majority of papers do not meet any accessibility criteria it is clear that microsoft word produces the most accessible pdfs followed by adobe indesign to determine the significance of this difference we compute the anova and kruskalwallace 22 statistics with the pdf typesetting software clusters as the sample groups and the total compliance as the measurements for the groups we compute an anova statistic of 25871 p 0001 and wang ll and cachola i et al fig 5 histograms showing the distribution of total compliance scores for each of the top 5 typesetting software ordered by decreasing mean total compliance microsoft word stands out as producing pdfs with significantly higher total compliance than other typesetting software three of the top five pdf typesetting software clusters arbortext app printer and latex produce pdfs with low total compliance with the majority of pdfs at 0 compliance a kruskalwallace h statistic of 44220 p 0001 this indicates a significant difference in the distribution of total compliance scores between the five most common pdf typesetting software in figure 6 we observe again that usage of microsoft word is highly correlated with accessibility compliance here we plot the proportion of microsoft word usage per field of study and the corresponding mean normalized total compliance rates for those fields higher rates of microsoft word usage are statistically correlated with higher mean normalized total compliance r 089 p 0001 in figure 7 we show the proportion of usage of each of the five typesetting software over time in recent years adobe indesign latex and microsoft word usage are proportionally increasing while the proportion of printercreated pdfs is declining the increase in adobe indesign and microsoft word have likely driven the increase in rates of total compliance over time since these typesetting software are the most associated with higher accessibility compliance improving the accessibility of scientific documents fig 6 there is a strong correlation r 089 p 0001 95 ci shown between the proportion of pdfs typeset using microsoft word and the mean normalized total compliance of papers by field of study fields such as business philosophy sociology materials science and psychology use microsoft word around or over 20 of the time and have correspondingly higher mean accessibility compliance on the other end of the spectrum are fields like mathematics physics and medicine where microsoft word is rarely used and which have very low levels of mean compliance fig 7 the proportion of pdfs typeset by the five most common typesetting software over time software such as adobe indesign latex and microsoft word are increasing in popularity over time summary of analyses overall accessibility compliance over the past decade and across all fields of study have slowly improved full compliance based on adobe5 compliance however has remained around 24 on average and does not show trends towards improving improvements in several compliance criteria are observed with default language being the most improved wang ll and cachola i et al nearing 30 coverage in 2019 however default language is the easiest criteria to meet and arguably produces the least amount of accessibility improvement in user experience criteria such as tagged pdfs tab order and headers show modest improvements over time though only between 1015 of papers in our sample meet any one of these individual criteria alttext compliance is the lowest of our measured criteria and as the only criterion of the five requiring author intervention in all cases the lack of alttext may be indicative of the general lack of author awareness and contribution to accessibility efforts for scientific papers based on our analysis typesetting software plays a large role in document accessibility of the most common pdf creator software microsoft word appears to produce the most accessibilitycompliant pdfs while latex produces pdfs with the lowest compliance microsoft has recently made investments in the accessibility of their office 365 suite17 it is clear that software can help increase accessibility compliance by prioritizing accessibility concerns during document creation and we encourage other developers of typesetting and publishing software to priotize accessibility concerns in their development process improvements in accessibility compliance have stalled over the past decade likely because accessibility concerns are considered marginal and are outside of the awareness of most publishing authors and researchers significant changes in the authorial and publication processes are needed to change this status quo and to increase the accessibility of scientific papers for blv users going forward though we believe and encourage change in the academic paper authorial and publication process in relation to accessibility the likelihood of rapid improvement is low and these changes will not impact the many millions of academic pdfs that have already been published therefore we introduce a technological solution that may mitigate some of the accessibility challenges of existing paper pdfs and aim to understand how this solution and others like it could serve the immediate needs of the blv research community converting pdf to html the scia11y pipeline to address the broad accessibility challenges described in section 3 we propose and prototype a system for extracting semantic content from paper pdfs and rerendering this content as accessible html html is widely accepted as a more accessible document format than pdfs in the 2019 access sigchi report the authors discuss the reasoning behind switching chi publications to a new html5 proceedings format to improve accessibility 27 by rendering the content of paper pdfs as html and introducing proper reading order and accessibility features such as section headings links and figure tags we can offset many of the issues of reading from an inaccessible pdf our pdf to html rendering system is named scia11y after the communityadopted numeronym for digital accessibility18 figure 1 provides a schematic for the approach scia11y leverages the two open source pdf processing projects s2orc 24 and deepfigures 43 the semantic scholar api19 and a custom flask application for rendering the extracted content of the pdf as html the s2orc project 24 integrates the grobid machine learning library 25 and a custom xml to json parser20 to produce a structured representation of paper text we use a version of the s2orc pipeline that is based on grobid v060 the resulting json representation includes metadata fields like title authors and affiliations and paper content fields such as abstract section headers body text organized into paragraphs bibliography entries and figure and table objects though not the figure images themselves the output also contains links between inline citations and figuretable references respectively to bibliography entries and figuretable objects 17 httpswwwmicrosoftcomenusaccessibilitymicrosoft365 18 httpswwwa11yprojectcom 19 httpsapisemanticscholarorg 20 available at httpsgithubcomallenais2orcdoc2json improving the accessibility of scientific documents fig 8 a successfully extracted figure from nascimento and bioucasdias 30 is shown with its corresponding figure caption top left when figures are not extracted and inferred to exist handle mentioned in text or number between two extracted figures a placeholder image is shown along with a message referencing the failed extraction top right similarly when an equation is detected to be present in the pdf and not extracted we insert text signaling the failed extraction and refer the user to the source document bottom deepfigures 43 on the other hand leverages a computer vision model to extract images of figures and tables as well as their corresponding captions from the source pdf the outputs of s2orc and deepfigures are stitched together to form the html render as in figure 1 we place header tags h1h1 h2h2 around the title authors abstract section headings and reference heading paragraphs of body text are enclosed in pp tags in order within their appropriate sections bibliography entries are provided in an unordered list under the reference heading figures and tables are enclosed in figure figure tags and placement is inferred based on mentions in the text a figure or table is placed immediately after the paragraph in which its handle is first mentioned eg in fig 1 we show is the first mention of figure 1 and the figure is placed directly after the paragraph with this mention figure and table captions are attached to their corresponding image objects so that correspondences between the caption text and image are made explicit in pdfs this is usually not the case any figures or tables which are not mentioned in order in the text are placed in order nonetheless in other words if paragraph 1 mentions figure 1 and paragraph 2 mentions figure 3 both figure 1 and 2 will be placed directly following paragraph 1 and figure 3 following paragraph 2 this ensures that the layout for the html render closely approximates the intended reading order we justify this decision based on user feedback from our pilot study which is discussed in section 6 in some cases we are able to successfully process a pdf through s2orc to extract textual content but deepfigures either fails to process the pdf or fails to extract some or all figures from the pdf to mitigate the cognitive dissonance around figure or table mentions without corresponding figure or table objects we insert placeholder objects into the html render as in figure 8 for example if figure 2 is mentioned in the text but is not successfully extracted by deepfigures we would insert a placeholder image for the figure based on the logic described in the previous paragraph along with the text figure 2 not extracted please refer to original document similarly mathematical equations that we cannot currently extract are acknowledged with the same placeholder text wang ll and cachola i et al we add links between inline citations and the corresponding reference entry where possible we insert links at each inline citation in the body text that link to the corresponding bibliography entry following each bibliography entry we provide links back to the first mention of that entry in each section of the paper in which it was mentioned for example if bibliography entry 1 is cited in the ii related works section and the iii methods section we provide two links following the entry in the bibliography to the corresponding citation locations in sections ii and iii as in 1 last name et al paper title venue doi link to return to section ii link to return to section iii this allows users to navigate back to their reading location in the document after clicking through to a bibliography entry a user may otherwise hesitate to resolve a link because it may result in losing their place and train of thought finally we introduce a table of contents near the beginning of the html render to facilitate better understanding of overall document structure the table of contents includes all section titles linked to the corresponding sections as well as figures and tables nested under their respective section headers the table of contents provides a rapid overview of the structure of the document and facilitates rapid navigation to the readers desired sections in the current iteration of the html render we do not display author affiliations footnotes or mathematical equations due to the difficulty of extracting these pieces of information from the pdf though some of the elements are extracted in s2orc the overall quality of the extractions for these elements is lower and is currently insufficient for surfacing in the prototype see section 5 for details future work includes investigating the possibility of extracting and exposing these elements either by improving current models or training new models targeted towards the extraction of specific paper elements we leverage the feedback we received during our pilot studies see section 6 to make improvements prior to the main user study we denote the versions of the prototype as v01 initial version version seen by p1 v02 version seen by p2 and v03 version seen by all other participants in the main user study features implemented in v01 include the primary components of the html render such as title authors abstract body text with section headers figures and tables references and links between inline citations and references in v01 figures and tables were placed in a separate section following the main body of the paper following p1 for version v02 we implemented the table of contents inserted placeholders for objects that we could not extract and began inserting figures and tables into the body text adjacent to their first mentions this last change was made in response to p1s feedback that navigating away to figures caused him to lose his reading location following p2 for version v03 we implemented only minor changes p2 signaled during his session that urls in the bibliography were not being correctly extracted so we patched the data to correctly extract and display urls in bibliography entries based on our evaluation of the quality of these html renders section 5 and user feedback and response section 6 we believe our approach can dramatically increase the screen reader navigability and accessibility of scientific papers across all disciplines by providing an alternate and more accessible html version of these papers properly tagged section headings allow for quick navigation and skimming of a paper links between inline citations and bibliography entries allow users to browse to cited papers without losing their place and figure tags for figure and table objects allow for direct navigation to these inpaper objects we now discuss the quality of our pdf extractions section 5 and user response to the prototype section 6 in detail improving the accessibility of scientific documents html render quality evaluation extracting semantic content from pdf is an imperfect process though rerendering a pdf as html can increase a documents accessibility the process relies on machine learning models that can make mistakes when extracting information as we glean from user studies blv users may have some tolerance for error but there is an inherent tradeoff between errors and perceived trust in the system we conduct a study to estimate the 1 faithfulness of the html renders to the source pdfs and 2 overall readability of the resulting html renders we define faithfulness as how accurately the html render represents different facets of the pdf document such as displaying the correct title section headers and figure captions these facets are measured as the number of errors that are made in rendering eg mistakenly parsing one figure caption into the body text is counted as one error towards that facet readability on the other hand is an ordinal variable meant to capture the overall usability of the parse documents are given one of three grades those with no major problems some problems and many problems impacting readability to evaluate readability and faithfulness we first perform open coding on a small sample of document pdfs and corresponding scia11y html renders the purpose of this exercise is to identify facets of extraction that impact the ability to read a paper a rubric is then designed based on these identified facets the process taken to design the evaluation rubric the rubrics content and annotation instructions are detailed in section 52 we then annotate a sample of 385 papers across different fields of study using this rubric for each category of errors identified during open coding we compute the overall error rates seen in our sample we also present the overall assessed readability reported in aggregate over our sample and by fields of study results of this evaluation are presented in section 53 open coding of document facets one author performed open coding on a sample of papers comparing the pdf and scia11y html renders to identify inconsistencies and facets that impact the faithfulness of document representation papers are sampled from the semantic scholar api21 using various search terms and selecting the top 3 results for each search term for which a pdf and s2orc parse are available search terms were selected to achieve coverage over different domains and the top papers are sampled to select for relevant publications the author stopped sampling papers upon reaching saturation resulting in 8 search terms and 24 papers the search terms used were human computer interaction epilepsy quasars language model influenza epidemiology anabolic steroids social networks and arctic snow cover for each paper the author evaluated the pdf and html render sidebyside scanning through the document to identify points of difference between the two document representations specifically the author looked for any text in the pdf that is not shown in the html any text from the pdf that is mixed into the main text of the html eg figure captions headers or footnotes that should be separate from the main text but are mixed in interrupting the reading flow and other parsing mistakes eg errors with math missing lists and tables etc these observations are detailed qualitatively and each facet is assessed for its faithfulness to the original pdf document as well as its overall impact on readability evaluation rubric observations from open coding are coalesced into an evaluation rubric and form for grading the quality and faithfulness of the html render the evaluation form attempts to capture errors in pdf extraction that affect each of the primary 21 httpsapisemanticscholarorg wang ll and cachola i et al category description common errors title the title and subtitle of the paper missing words extra words authors a list of authors who wrote the paper this includes affiliation though we do not explicitly evaluate affiliation in this study missing authors extra authors misspellings abstract the abstract of the paper some text not extracted other text incorrectly extracted as abstract section headings the text of section headings some headings not extracted part of body text other text incorrectly extracted as headings body text the main text of the paper organized by paragraph under each section heading some paragraphs not extracted missing some text not extracted other text incorrectly extracted as body text figures images captions and alttext of each figure figure not extracted caption text not extracted part of body text other text incorrectly extracted as caption text tables captiontitle and content of each table table not extracted not part of body text table not extracted part of body text caption text not extracted part of body text other text incorrectly extracted as caption text eqations mathematical formulas represented in tex or math ml note our current pipeline does not extract math some equations not extracted some equations incorrectly extracted bibliography bibliography entries in the reference section some bibliography entries not extracted some bibliography entries incorrectly extracted other text incorrectly extracted as bibliography inline citations inline citations from the body text to papers in the bibliography section some inline citations not detected some inline citations incorrectly linked headers footers footnotes page headers and footers footnotes endnotes and other text that is not a part of the main body of the document some headers and footers incorrectly extracted into body text table 4 categories of paper objects identified for evaluation along with the common errors seen for each category semantic categories identified for proper reading these semantic categories and common extraction errors are given in table 4 questions in the form are designed to capture each type of faithfulness error while allowing annotators to qualify their responses we also include a question to capture the overall readability of the html render instructions for completing the annotation form are provided in appendix a1 the final version of the form is replicated in appendix a1 and the rubric for overall readability evaluation is given in appendix a3 three authors iterated twice on the content of the evaluation form until they came to a consensus that all evaluation categories were adequately addressed using a minimum set of questions two authors then participated in pilot annotations where each person independently annotated the same set of five papers sampled from the set labeled by the third author during open coding answers to all numeric questions were within 1 for these five papers when comparing the two authors annotations all three authors discussed discrepancies in overall readability score iterating on the rubric defined in appendix a3 and coming to a consensus the finalized form and rubric are used for evaluation improving the accessibility of scientific documents of the categories and errors described in table 4 our current pipeline does not extract table content and equations tables are extracted as images by deepfigures 43 which do not contain table semantic information regarding equations we distinguish between inline equations math written in the body text and display equations independent line items that can usually be referenced by number for this work we evaluated a small sample of papers for successful extraction of display equations though some display equations are recognized the quality of equation extraction is low usually resulting in missing tokens or improper math formatting therefore we decided to replace display equations in the prototype with the equation placeholder shown in figure 8 since problems with mathematical formulae are among those most mentioned by users in our study equation extraction is among our most urgent future goals and we discuss some options in section 71 evaluation results we start with the dataset of 11397 papers we analyze in section 3 and subsample 535 documents stratified by field of study two expert annotators with undergraduate science training code papers from this sample with an aim of annotating around 20 papers per field of study though we achieve the target number for most fields we missed this target for some fields closer to the humanities because more of these documents are difficult to manually annotate within our time and resource constraints for example documents are deemed unsuitable for annotation if they are not papers ie they are books posters abstracts etc if they are too long or if they are not in english in these cases the annotators can skip the document detailed guidance on suitability is provided in the annotation instructions see appendix a1 the two annotators annotated 385 unique papers and skipped 137 the resulting annotated sample consists of papers from 195 unique publication venues each paper takes 510 minutes to grade documents are skipped primarily due to language paper not in english length or the document is not a paper interannotator agreement is computed over a sample of 20 papers over each of the evaluated facets we report cohens kappa for categorical questions such as those on the extraction of title authors abstract and bibliography for numerical questions such as counting the occurrence of extraction errors related to figures tables section headings and body paragraphs etc we report the intraclass correlation coefficient icc as well as the average difference of values between the two annotators see table 5 for these results agreement was high for most elementlevel annotator questions annotators had the highest levels of disagreement on the evaluation of headerfooterfootnote errors section heading errors and body paragraph errors likely due to these being textbased and the most numerous though the average differences reported between annotators on these questions are only between 12 likewise agreement on overall readability score is modest at 055 we note however that neither annotator labeled any paper as having no major readability problems when the other annotator labeled it as having lots of readability problems all results and statistics are reported on the set of 385 annotated papers figure 9 shows the breakdown of each type of error and the frequency at which it occurs metadata elements like title authors and abstract are successfully extracted the majority of the time for figure and table elements approximately 25 of papers in our evaluation sample do not include figures and around 45 do not have tables of those that have figures the majority 201 691 of 291 do not have extraction or parsing errors around half of documents with errors have errors that only relate to one figure similarly the majority of tables and table captions are correctly identified as tables and table captions and are not incorrectly mixed into the body text we note that the lack of an error here does not indicate that the table is extracted correctly in an accessible manner just that it is not incorrectly parsed as body text wang ll and cachola i et al evaluation criteria number of classes agreement cohens kappa icc mean difference title authors abstract 087 100 095 033 100 064 number of figures figure

and the average difference and standard deviation of the values between the two annotators unsurprisingly errors in text element parsing are the most prevalent especially for headersfootersfootnotes and section headings the most common type of headerfooterfootnote error observed are when these texts are mixed into the body text around page breaks interrupting reading flow these types of errors are also observed frequently during screen reader use when reading directly from an untagged pdf for section headings in particular the majority of papers have errors around 67 of papers have between 15 errors either missed headings or extraneous headings and 9 have more than 5 errors due to the large number of section headings in papers parsing errors are more frequent and unfortunately these errors impact the ability to properly navigate the html parse errors in body text extraction also negatively impact readability in this case select text in the document is being missed completely in the html render we see that though the majority of parses have no body text errors around 33 of papers have between 15 missing paragraphs figure 9d shows grading results for bibliography elements our pipeline is quite good at extracting bibliography entries extracting all or most entries in the vast majority of cases and successfully linking inline citations to these bibliography entries also in a large majority of cases when bibliography extraction fails it tends to fail catastrophically resulting in no or few extractions the overall readability score is provided in figure 9e a majority of papers 545 210 papers have no major problems impacting readability another 317 122 of papers have some problems impacting readability and 138 53 of papers have lots of readability problems we are encouraged that a majority of html renders have no major problems though our results necessitate further understanding of the papers with which our extraction pipeline has difficulty if papers with lots of problems can be identified a priori we can prevent surfacing these low quality parses to improving the accessibility of scientific documents fig 9 evaluation results for various document components corresponding numbers are provided in table 13 in appendix b the user we perform some preliminary experiments to identify paper features that are more correlated with readability problems though no features stood out as being predictive we present those results in appendix c in figure 10 we show the breakdown of overall readability by field of study plotting the proportion of papers per field that are classified as having no major problems some problems and lots of problems impacting readability many fields have similar distributions compared to the overall evaluation set however we note that some fields such as art business economics and environmental science to some degree have significantly lower quality extraction results we posit that this may be due to biases in our pdf extraction pipeline some of the machine learning modules we use are primarily trained on paper data from the biomedical and computer science domains where large scale labeled wang ll and cachola i et al fig 10 overall readability results as proportion of total split by field of study sorted by the percentage of papers with no major problems the number of documents analyzed in each field is given ranging from n7 history to n39 physics the fields of study with the worst parse quality economics environmental science business art and political science tend to be closer to the humanities and may be due to the underrepresentation of papers from these fields in the data used to train the pdf parsers we use in our extraction pipeline corresponding numbers are provided in table 14 in appendix b pdf extraction datasets can be found humanitiesadjacent fields like art and business have very different publication norms and the different layouts and content of papers and documents in these fields may provide additional challenges to our system resulting in lower quality extraction and rendering user study we conduct an exploratory user study to better understand the needs of blv scientists when reading papers and to assess whether our prototype supports these needs the study consists of a preliminary questionnaire and semistructured video interview interviews are conducted remotely on zoom22 all recruitment materials questionnaires and the interview plan are reviewed and approved by the internal review board at anonymized we recruit and interview 22 httpszoomus improving the accessibility of scientific documents six users with a pilot involving two users and a main study involving four users modifications to the prototype between pilots and the main study can be found in section 4 we report results from all six participants in any analysis that does not involve the prototype and for analysis that directly involves the prototype we denote all cases where prototype modifications between the pilot and main study may impact our results the inclusion criteria for participants are  the participant is over 18 years of age  the participant identifies as blind or low vision  the participant reads scientific papers regularly more than 5 per year  the participant must have used a screen reader to read a paper in the last year and  the participant must complete the preinterview questionnaire participants were recruited through mailing lists wordofmouth and snowball sampling prior to each interview the participant was asked to provide several keywords corresponding to their subject areas of interest and between 35 papers where they experienced difficulty reading the pdf among the 35 papers we selected one paper to use for the study based on the availability of an html render and maximizing the features that would be seen during the user study eg given a choice between a paper with figures and a paper without figures but where both otherwise demonstrate the same paper components we would select the paper with figures each study session was 75 minutes consisting of three phases phase i capturing challenges with current work flow the primary research questions we investigate in this phase are  what methods andor tools do blv researchers use to assist in reading the literature  what main accessibility challenges do blv researchers face  how do blv researchers cope with these challenges we first asked the participant to describe their current workflow and the challenges they face when reading papers clarifying how the user copes with challenges when their workflow does not adequately address the problem we then asked the participant to demonstrate how they currently read a paper by opening a paper pdf and walking us through the usage of their tools pdf viewer screen reader magnifier speechtotext etc participants kept their computer audio on so we could hear the output of their reader tools the participant was asked to think aloud and describe their actions when reading the paper we asked the participant to demonstrate any reading challenges they described in their preinterview questionnaire at the end of this phase we asked the participant to assess how easy or difficult it was to read the paper with their current reading pipeline phase ii interaction with prototype the primary research questions we investigate in this phase are  what features of the html render resonated positively with the participant  what problems can be identified in the html render the goal of this phase was to understand how helpful or not helpful the html render is to the participant the participant was asked to interact with an html render of the same paper they read in phase i in the scia11y prototype we first provided an introduction to the prototype then allowed the participant to proceed uninterrupted for several minutes interacting with the render the participant was asked to think aloud during their interactions towards the end of this phase we prompted the participant to interact with any features in wang ll and cachola i et al the html render they may have skipped over at the end of this phase we asked the participant to assess how easy or difficult it was to read the paper with the html render phase iii qa and discussion the primary objectives of this phase are to answer the questions  how likely is the participant to use the html render in the future  how can the html render be improved to best meet the participants needs moving forward the participant was given further opportunities to ask questions or discuss the prototype the participant was asked to describe their perceived pros and cons of the prototype and to provide suggestions of missing features ordered by priority we asked the participant whether they would use this prototype if it were available and if not what features would need to be implemented to change that decision the interviews were conducted by one author with two other authors observing and participating during phase iii all interviews were recorded for followup analysis and participants were compensated with a 150 usd gift card for their time the questions used to guide the semistructured interview are provided in appendix d3 we follow a grounded theory approach to identify themes and concepts from the participant interviews we first perform open coding to identify relevant concepts then axial coding to group these concepts under broad themes these themes are 1 the technologies employed by users 2 challenges in their current reading pipeline and 3 mitigation or coping strategies and in relation to the scia11y prototype 4 positive features 5 negative features or issues with the prototype and 6 suggestions for improvement interviews are selectively coded a second time to identify all concepts falling under each theme we also employ the same method to code issues raised by participants in the preinterview questionnaire themes and concepts are arrived upon by two authors following detailed reading of the interviews in several cases we further define attributes associated with some concepts such as defining whether the technologies used were in relation to opening pdfs screen reading or other tasks or whether the challenges identified affect the whole document navigation text or a particular inpaper element these delineations are described further in their respective results sections study participants participants are graduate students phd students and faculty members from predominantly englishspeaking countries whose primary research areas are in computer science though also spanning neuroscience and mathematics we interviewed two participants during the pilot phase and four participants during the main phase of our study we report findings from all six participants for all themes captured in phase i of the study since only minor changes were made to the prototype between the pilot and main study we report findings from all participants for phase ii and iii as well making note of features that changed following the pilots three of six participants study humancomputer interaction and accessibility which may be due in part to our sampling methodology but may also reflect the relevance of accessibility research to blv researchers other study participants conduct research in the areas of machine learning neuroscience software engineering and blockchain all but one participant reported having more than one year of experience using screen readers the tools employed by participants are summarized in table 6 along with the version of the scia11y prototype with which they interacted improving the accessibility of scientific documents study prototype version current

users use voiceover on macos two users use braille display in conjunction with their screen reader one participant p2 is low vision and uses a combination of texttospeech and a magnifying glass to perform sighted navigation p2s primary reading interaction involves selecting blocks of text in the pdf and using texttospeech adobe acrobat reader is the most common software for opening pdfs though several participants use preview in macos with one participant p4 explicitly stating a preference for preview over acrobat one participant uses a proprietary tool called inftyreader which converts pdfs into ascii text and math formulas into mathml which is accessible challenges of current pdf reading pipeline table 7 lists the challenges recognized by all participants in their current pdf reading pipeline some of these challenges affect the entire document eg when a document lacks heading markup it affects the ability to navigate the whole document others pertain to specific elements in pdfs like inaccessible math formulas or lack of figure alttext all six users discussed the inaccessibility of math formulas unfortunately document elements like math figures tables and algorithm blocks are used to convey a significant amount of the information content of a paper and the inability to access their content can produce negative impacts on the readers ability to understand the paper coping mechanisms the coping mechanisms employed by blv researchers to read inaccessible pdfs are wideranging often involving trying tools outside of their primary workflow soliciting help from others or in the worst case giving up and moving on we describe these in table 8 several users reported trying certain tools like alternate pdf readers browsers or optical character recognition ocr even though the tools usually do not result in a significant improvement over their standard pipeline when asked why several participants reported feeling hopeful that a tool might work p1 or hoping to get lucky p3 several of these coping mechanisms involved other people for example three participants reported needing to ask sighted colleagues or family members to copy text or to explain select paper content especially figures and equations asking for pdf remediation was also a possibility for several participants in this process workers at the researchers host institution convert a pdf into an accessible format manually correcting equation representation and writing descriptions for figures the output of the remediation process is seen as ideal p4 but the process takes significant wang ll and cachola i et al issue description affects raised by user scanned pdfs cannot be read without remediation document p3 p4 p5 no headingssubheadings for navigation figures are not annotated as

element element element element element element element p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p1 p2 p3 p5 p6 p1 p3 p5 p6 p1 p5 p4 p5 p2 p4 table 7 challenges to pdf reading identified by participants during interviews only identified as an issue during preinterview questionnaire time several weeks for any pdf and may not fit into a researchers schedule and timeline additionally this process may only be available to researchers affiliated with a significantly large and resourced institution and as p6 discusses may no longer be a viable option for those who work outside of academia in some cases blv researchers may also message authors directly to gain access to the source documents p3 and p4 both latex source and word documents are more accessible than pdfs and access to these source documents can greatly improve the ability to read these papers perhaps most disheartening is how often blv researchers may simply give up in the face of an inaccessible paper p1 says that by the time he has spent several hours making a paper readable he may have already lost interest and motivation to read it when asked how often papers are abandoned p3 responds 6070 of the time though p4 does not discuss abandonment directly p4 shares the following relevant sentiment reading papers is the hardest part of research for a blv researcher and if papers were more accessible there would be more blind researchers response to html render all user interviews were analyzed to extract positive and negative responses to various features or flaws of the prototype we summarize these features and flaws in table 9 among the participants favorite features are links between inline citations and references all 6 participants section headings for navigation 5 participants the table of contents 4 participants and figures tagged as figures with associated figure captions 3 participants regarding links between inline citations and references several participants were especially supportive of the return links that allow the reader to return back to their reading context after following a citation link p3 said that the links acted as external memory allowing blv users to essentially glance at the bibliography and back like a sighted user might similar sentiments were shared by p5 and p6 although p5 also proposed the possibility of preserving improving the accessibility of scientific documents coping mechanism raised by user what users said give up abandon the paper p1 p3 p5 p3 when asked how often they abandon papers answers 6070 of the time p5 sometimes the only option is to sit down and start crying jokingly though the sentiment is true try other conversion tools p1 p3 p6 download latex source or word document if available p3 p4 p6 ask sighted colleagues or family members to read p3 p5 p6 ask for remediation convert to braille p4 p5 p6 p4 10 day turnaround is on the quick side which is not good enough for research p5 process takes a long time around 12 weeks try other pdf readers or browsers p1 p6 p1 may try microsoft edge browser even though it usually does not help but he feels hopeful message authors to get source document p3 p4 p4 sometimes the author manuscript is accessible but the cameraready version is not fault of the conferences and publishers not the authors table 8 coping mechanisms discussed by users for dealing with challenging papers the context even further by providing bibliography information inline rather than navigating back and forth between the main text and references section among the negative features observed by participants most have to do with imperfect extraction for example incorrectly extracted headings 3 participants missed headings 2 participants and various extraction issues with code blocks tables equations and more many of these issues are known and quantified in section 5 of these issues problems with heading extraction were most notable likely because the heading structure is the first element of the document with which the participants interact and it provides a mental model of the overall document structure mistakes in heading extraction are obvious and erode trust in our overall system as p5 says its really important that i trust it and errors of this nature both false positive and false negative extractions can reduce trust similarly though we describe in our introductory material that our system currently does not extract equations p6 points out that it is unclear whether the system extracts equations because occasionally math can be found in the body text this type of conflict between what is described and what is seen can also reduce trust however one may be able to build trust even in the face of extraction errors by indicating to the user when content is not extracted as p4 says regarding the placeholders for not extracted items at least i know there was an equation here difficulty scale the responses of the users to the difficulty of their current pipeline versus the html render are shown in table 10 we ask the following question on a scale of 1 to 5 how easy or difficult was it to read this paper with the html render and why answers 1 very easy 2 easy 3 neutral 4 difficult 5 very difficult all participants in the main study reported that the html render is easier for reading than their current pipeline reductions in difficulty rating ranged from 05 to 30 most of our participants rated their current pipeline as difficult 4 participants or neutral 1 participant with one participant who is low vision p2 reporting that their current pipeline is easy during our pilot sessions users reported that the html render was difficult to use for the main study users reported the html render as neutral or easy to use wang ll and cachola i et al feature raised by user what users said bidirectional links between inline citations and references p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 headings for easy navigation p1 p2 p3 p4 p6 p3 very few research teams actually get this and get this right so well done crucial piece of the puzzle p4 headings are the best thing ever makes it very clear what section you are in table of contents figures are tagged as figures and captions are associated can use browser and os features like findcopypaste simple typography for reading can interact with headings wordbyword or letterbyletter not extracted items are noted as missing p2 p3 p5 p6 p4 p5 p6 p1 p4 positive p4 at least i know there was an equation here negative some headings extracted incorrectly some headings missed in extraction p1 p3 p5 p3 p5 code block not extracted tables are extracted as figures equations not extracted p2 p4 p2 p6 p4 p6 figures placed away from text no alttext extracted urls missing from bibliography entries some information not surfaced keywords footnotes some headersfootersfootnotes mixed in text headings are not hierarchical p5 its really important that i trust it there should be no false negatives p6 not sure if this system extracts equations because sometimes there is some math in the body text table 9 positive and negative features identified in the prototype the feature was implemented or the issue addressed in v02 following p1 pilot the issue was addressed in v03 following p2 pilot p2 is the only participant to report the html render as being more difficult to use than their current pipeline we note that p2 is sighted and did not engage with most of the navigation features we designed and implemented for screen readerbased navigation because p2 primarily interacted with papers through sighted navigation text highlighting and texttospeech they were able to interact with section headers figures tables and equations in the original pdf using the magnifier tool and found any missing content in the html render to be significantly detrimental to their reading experience the overall median difference in difficulty scores between the pdf and html render is modest at 075 this modest change may be due to the conflation of interface design and system errors when asking participants to rate the difficulty of use in general all users responded very positively to the interface design especially around the navigational features we introduce issues were raised around extraction accuracy and the propagation of these errors to the interface we may be able to offset some of the latter issues by detecting and removing papers that suffer from more extraction errors though we leave this to future work future usage at the end of each session we ask users whether they would be likely to use the prototype in the future if it were made publicly available on a range of papers we ask specifically on a scale of 1 to 5 how likely are you to use the html render if it is available to you in the future answers 1 very unlikely 2 unlikely 3 neutral 4 likely 5 very likely if the answer is unlikely or neutral we ask what changes would need to be made to the tool such that they would use it all users reported that they would use the prototype in the future five users responded 5 that they would be very likely to use it one user p5 responded 3 to the prototype as it currently is and 5 if some of the issues for heading extraction were addressed p1 who participated in an early pilot with fewer implemented features said that this would improving the accessibility of scientific documents study current pipeline html render difference would use in future pilot pilot yes yes main main main main yes yes yes yes table 10 participant ratings on the difficulty scale 1 very easy 2 easy 3 neutral 4 difficult 5 very difficult and whether they would use the tool in the future all participants reported a change from more difficult to more easy when moving from their current pipeline to the html render except p2 who uses sighted navigation the median reduction in difficulty score for all participants is 075 all participants reported that they would be very likely to use the system in the future were it to be available p5s response is contingent on improvements in section heading extraction become a tool in the toolbox but he would not be able to rely solely on it due to incomplete extractions p5 expressed a similar sentiment that in its current state he may try the prototype system when his current workflow fails but if issues around heading extraction were addressed he would be very likely to use it p3 replies when asked how the system might be integrated into their workflow i think it would become the workflow p4 says for unaccessible pdfs this is lifechanging design recommendations we distill our learnings into a set of five design recommendations for blv userfriendly paper reading systems figure 11 summarizes the following recommendations 1 document structure should match the mental model of the user structure is necessary for providing an overview of a document and is essential to navigation headings in a paper should be tagged as such and the hierarchy of the headings should match the mental model of the user ie top level headings should be tagged h1 or h2 and lower level headings h3 through h6 accordingly reading order should be specified as to not interject nonbody text objects into the body text eg headers footers and footnotes often disrupt the main flow of text because they visually break paragraphs similarly a user expects a natural flow to a paper beginning with the title authors abstract introduction etc and ending with conclusions and references papers with various elements interspersed are disruptive of this mental model and can interfere with the readers understanding of the document 2 objects in the paper should be tagged appropriately selfexplanatory headings should be tagged as headings figures as figures tables as tables lists as lists and so on appropriate tagging allows a user to take advantage of the screen readers capabilities for navigating to specific types of objects eg most screen readers have shortcuts for navigating headings and to figures or lists proper tagging emulates a sighted users ability to detect visually distinct objects such as headings figures and tables when objects are not appropriately tagged a screen reader user must scroll through the whole document each time to identify the desired sections 3 the system should act as external memory for the user visual layout can act as a source of external memory for sighted users who can quickly derive reading context and object types from visual cues for blv users strategies for emulating such external memory can be beneficial for example bidirectional navigation wang ll and cachola i et al fig 11 design recommendations for screen reader friendly paper reading systems a system should aim to provide the document structure in a way that matches the mental model of the user and to tag all elements appropriately these aspects are achievable through proper tagging of a paper including in pdf format additionally a system should aim to act as external memory for the user minimizing the amount of cognitive load needed to return to their reading context to improve trust a system should indicate when there is known missing data in the extraction or a possibility of missing or incorrect data finally a system should reduce verbosity ensuring that as few keystrokes as possible are necessary for the user to perform their desired task for all indocument links are a type of glancing feature with this feature a user no longer needs to commit text to memory in order to rediscover their previous reading context after navigating away p3 in particular emphasizes that these features are a crucial piece of the puzzle other memory features like bookmarking or notetaking may also be helpful for returning the user to their reading context 4 indicate known missing data and potential errors to facilitate trust in the system the system should indicate the presence of missing and erroneous data to users some degree of fault tolerance is permitted as long as the overall benefit to the user is greater however as these systems rely on statistical methods extraction quality is rarely perfect most users indicate a preference for knowing when the system fails rather than dealing with the uncertainty of figuring out whether the issue is with the underlying paper or with the extraction and reading interface 5 reduce verbosity any minimization of unnecessary text and spaces between links can simplify navigation for blv users though these extra commas and spaces may seem innocuous for sighted users they require extra keystrokes for screen readers reduction of unnecessary verbosity around links and introduced features can save time for screen reader users improving the accessibility of scientific documents the overarching themes of these recommendations are to reduce user cognitive load and improve trust in the system regarding cognitive load interruptions to reading flow for blv users are especially disruptive since there are no visual markers to help identify reading context paper reading systems for blv users should therefore attempt to mitigate cognitive load caused by loss of context by allowing users to quickly navigate back to their reading context when following any links and by avoiding any disruption of reading flow regarding this latter point properly labeled reading order headings for navigation and appropriately tagged objects all contribute to mitigating disruptions further it is also important to remove interjections from headers footers footnotes figure and table captions and other text all of which interrupt the natural flow of reading regarding user trust in the system this should a priority of any system builder because pdf extraction and document rendering are imperfect processes some degree of error is expected though all participants in our user study expressed that some degree of error is tolerable one can mitigate the conversion of errors to distrust by clearly indicating known errors and missing content in the system for example in some cases our system is unable to extract a figure caption if the caption for figure 3 is not extracted rather than skipping from figure 2 to figure 4 and causing confusion for the reader it is better to indicate that figure 3 is missing in the extraction a system that responds quickly to user requests is obviously more desirable however several participants indicated that some wait time is acceptable especially if a longer wait time corresponds to a higher quality reading experience though we report this finding we ask readers to take it with a grain of salt this point may not hold for all or even a majority of users since several users also remark on the pdf remediation process which usually takes 12 weeks as being too long to adequately support their research workflow though we derive these design recommendations in the scope of paper reading they are generalizable to other classes of documents in fact several of these design principles echo available guidelines for humanai interaction 2 especially in indicating the capabilities and limitations of the system recommendation 4 a number of our recommendations are simply good practice such as exposing the structure of a document and tagging document objects appropriately and are covered by current guidelines for creating accessible documents other recommendations focus on emulating the types of advantages that sighted users derive from layout and visual information but to implement them in such a way that blv users can benefit eg using the system as a source of external memory discussion in this work we present the results of several studies that aim to characterize the current state of accessibility for academic paper pdfs to learn the challenges faced by blv researchers when reading papers and to demonstrate how our scia11y system that renders pdfs into accessible html can be used to mitigate many of these challenges based on our analysis the current state of paper accessibility is grim with an average of 24 of papers across all fields of study satisfying our five assessed accessibility criteria though there is some improvement seen over time we are not optimistic that these improvements are due to authors prioritizing accessibility when writing papers since the presence of figure alttext the only of the five criteria that requires author intervention remains low rather the commitment to accessibility made by certain typesetting software providers such as microsoft word may be responsible for a portion of these improvements given the strong correlation between pdf creation software and accessibility compliance we encourage conferences publishers and authors to consider the tools they are using to generate pdfs and to integrate accessibility requirements during the publication process given the scope and magnitude of the problem and how pdf is still the dominant file type used for distributing scientific papers there are clear needs for immediate technological solutions we propose the scia11y system which wang ll and cachola i et al integrates several text and vision machine learning models to extract the content from paper pdfs and render this content as html the system adds tags and infers reading order thereby improving the navigational capabilities of blv users of course no extractive pipeline is perfect and we quantify and qualify extraction quality through an evaluation study and user study our intrinsic evaluation of extraction quality indicates that most extractions have no major problems affecting readability 862 have no or only some problems the most common extraction problems are incorrectly extracted or missed section headings as well as headers footers and footnotes being improperly mixed into the body text which can interrupt reading flow participants in our user study responded positively to scia11y preferring its navigational features and tagging to working with pdfs though the various types of extraction mistakes made by our system are noted by participants most participants reported an improvement from their current reading pipeline and all participants expressed an interest in using the system in the future we present the challenges coping mechanisms and positive and negative features identified by participants we also summarize the collective themes into a set of five design recommendations for other researchers and practitioners looking to design and build systems for accessible reading the recommendations include 1 matching the document structure to the mental model of the user 2 tagging all objects within the document appropriately 3 acting as external memory for the user 4 indicating known missing data or extraction errors and 5 reducing verbosity the first two of these recommendations are related to proper and correct representation of the document structure and inpaper objects both are necessary components of an accessible document the third recommendation is to provide additional navigation features that are otherwise encoded in the visual layout of the document and inaccessible to blv users the fourth recommendation is related to error tolerance and user trust for any machine learningbased document parsing system errors are inevitable managing user expectations for these systems is crucial this recommendation echoes previously published guidelines for humanai interaction which suggest communicating to the user the capabilities and limitations of the ai system 2 setting expectations correctly and referring the user back to the original source document when the extractive procedure fails can help mitigate inappropriate reliance on the system the final recommendation aims to reduce verbosity and the number of keystrokes needed for performing any task which can speed up the use of such a system we hope these design recommendations will facilitate further conversations around the needs of blv users and that they may result in systems that ease the reading burden for these users as one participant puts it reading papers is the hardest part of research for researchers who are blind or low vision and if papers were more accessible there would be more blind researchers it is a duty of the entire community to facilitate this and to design prototype and build systems to support the needs of the blv research community limitations future work this work focuses on rendering pdf papers in html to improve document navigation and provide a more intuitive reading order there are many other aspects of accessibility with which we do not contend such as providing figure alttext accessible math or tagging tables future work involves investigating various ways to improve or provide these features automatically or by harnessing the power of the community to provide some of these features for papers as they are requested for example we may integrate elementspecific reading features for mathematical equations 4 17 26 45 or graphs and charts 1214 or create a crowdsourcing pipeline to solicit alttext annotations for figures that lack descriptions pdf parsing remains an open research problem with many challenges our reliance on these technologies necessarily introduce error into our pipeline and system we attempt to describe and quantify these errors in appendix c but improving the accessibility of scientific documents found no strong correlation between any particular type of error and the overall quality assessment unfortunately this means that there is no obvious mitigation strategy for identifying lowquality extractions before they are shown to users further work remains to automatically or semiautomatically identify lowquality parses prior to surfacing them for example we could investigate other paper features as predictors of parse quality with more labeled data we could also train a neural classifier to identify lowquality parses in this work we focus on processing pdfs and making them accessible some papers are available in xml html or other structured markup languages and latex or word document source can be found for others our system could take advantage of these alternatives to pdfs when they are publicly available for example by rendering the semantic content of the paper as extracted from these other document representations as in arxiv vanity23 for arxiv latex source or pubmed centrals pubreader24 which renders jats xml though s2orc 24 contains latex parses derived from arxiv for over 1 million papers further study is necessary to determine whether these parses are suitable for html rendering in our system though we conduct a user study to better understand the challenges of blv users and their responses to our prototype the number of participants involved is small consequently we focus on identifying qualitative learnings from these user studies these learning when combined with our evaluation and analysis of the current state of scholarly pdf accessibility provide a more complete portrait of the challenges and issues blv scholars face when reading papers to more fully assess the benefits and flaws of our system a broader user study and testing period is needed we hope to achieve this in future work lastly pdfs have been repeatedly called out as being inaccessible not only for screen readers but broadly for reading especially on mobile and other devices with small screen sizes 34 dissociating publishing from pdfs continues to be a good goal for the future in recent years alternative publication formats have risen in popularity such as elifes dual publication in pdf and html25 the interactive html papers at distillpub26 or the acm digital librarys very own dual publication pdf and html process27 which is now available for many of the acms computing conferences and journals we have no doubt that viable alternatives to pdf have and will arise and encourage the community to explore these options when making publication decisions conclusion based on our findings most academic papers are inaccessible and significant challenges remain for blv researchers when interacting with and reading these papers though some improvements in accessibility have been seen over time these changes may not be reflective of author actions directly in the meantime we offer a potential solution for the millions of pdfs that have already been published and which still remain the dominant form of distribution for academic papers we introduce the scia11y system for rendering pdfs as accessible html documents the system extracts the content of pdfs tagging headings and objects and inferring reading order which results in a more navigable and accessible document though the extraction pipeline is imperfect and can result in errors our evaluation suggests that for the majority of papers the resulting html render has no major problems that impact readability we confirm these findings in our user study where all users responded positively to the prototype system claiming that they would be likely or very likely to use the system were it to be available in the future participants described the system as likely to 23 httpwwwarxivvanitycom 24 httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcaboutpubreader 25 httpsreviewerelifesciencesorgauthorguidepost 26 httpsdistillpub 27 httpswwwacmorgpublicationsauthorssubmissions wang ll and cachola i et al become the workflow or lifechanging indicating both a strong favorable response and particular need for these types of solutions we do not claim that scia11y solves all or even close to all accessibility problems for blv researchers but it is a step in the right direction scia11y is a technological solution that can mitigate many of the challenges experienced by blv researchers at this moment though a longer term solution would surely require more dialogue between all stakeholders and a potential revolution in the way in which scholars publish and distribute their research findings we encourage researchers to prioritize and address these challenges with whatever tools they have in their toolbox right now we especially encourage others to take into account our findings on the needs and challenges of blv researchers when designing and engineering new systems and tools for reading the scholarly literature

of scientific documents evaluation forms this section contains forms and documents used to evaluate the quality of html renders produced by our system evaluation instructions instructions for annotators are reproduced verbatim below goal identify and quantify the prevalence of different parse issues in s2orc parses to assess their suitability for accessibility purposes this will help us decide whether s2orc parses can help meet screen reacher accessibility needs number of papers 500 papers sampled across different domains of science you will be presented with a spreadsheet of scientific papers each with a pair of links one link goes to a pdf of the paper one link goes to an html representation of the same article for each pair of links we would like to know how faithfully the html representation captures the information on the pdf instructions 1 open the two links side by side 2 if the two links do not seem to correspond to the same paper stop make a note in the spreadsheet and skip 3 if the pdf shows a paper that is not suitable stop make a note in the spreadsheet and skip nonsuitable may include  it is not a scientific paper  it is spam or a fake paper  it is slides a poster or other such nonpaper document  it is just an abstract  it is a series of articles eg conference proceedings journal issue etc  it is a book  it is supplementary material note some supplementary material is solely made up of figure or images  something else that makes you pause if youre not sure skip it 4 copy the paper identifier corresponding to this paper into the first question on this form please make sure the identifier matches the paper you are evaluating 5 answer each of the questions in this form as best as you can treating the pdf as gold there is no need to review every word or line of text we are just trying to get an overall assessment of parse quality for any question that asks for a number enter 0 if there are no obvious problems with those extractions 6 submit the form and mark the row in the spreadsheet as complete note display equations those that are in their own paragraph are currently not preserved in s2orc so we ask the annotator to ignore issues around missing display equations inline equations those that are inline within a paragraph are converted to token streams which may not be faithful to the original pdf eg fractions may not be preserved the annotator can provide a description of issues around equation parsing when there is a notable issue wang ll and cachola i et al evaluation questions questions asked in the evaluation form are reproduced in table 11 quality rubric the quality rubric for the final question in the evaluation form is given in table 12 this rating attempts to capture the overall readability and usability of the html render three authors discussed and converged upon this rubric following initial pilot annotations evaluation results raw counts for each type of error detected during the evaluation of html renders are provided in table 13 the overall quality score split by field of study is shown in table 14 association between paper features and overall readability to investigate the possibility of identifying paper extractions with major problems we fit a logistic regression classifier using element specific evaluation results as input features and whether or not a paper has major problems as the target class for classification element specific questions are converted into 43 binary input variables for example the title element is mapped to three binary variables whether the title is extracted correctly titleyes extracted partially titlepartially or extracted incorrectly titleno we collapse the targets into two binary classes 1 if the paper has major problems and 0 if it has no major problems or some problems the classifier is trained using 5fold cross validation with balanced class weights and achieves a mean accuracy of 069 and area under the roc of 065 this performance is not particularly notable or good the labeled training sample is small and due to the complexity of what makes a document problematic to read we did not expect there to be a clear way to predict extractions with major problems based on a small number of elementlevel features something we aim to explore more in the future is whether the raw tokens on the pdf or publisher metadata can be leveraged to better predict when our extractive parse has failed the top 10 predictive features and their logistic regression weights are abstract extracted incorrectly 042 one table extraction error 018 no table caption errors 015 one figure extraction error 015 one figure caption extraction error 015 bibliography extraction is very bad 013 more than one figure extraction error 013 authors extracted incorrectly 012 more than one table extraction error 011 authors extracted correctly 009 improving the accessibility of scientific documents the most predictive feature is when abstracts are extracted incorrectly given the prevalence of abstracts in various literature databases abstract quality could be easily assessed through external verification in other words if the abstract we extract is different from the abstract found for the same paper in other databases on in the publisher metadata perhaps we can avoid surfacing this paper however the distribution of weights among various other elementlevel features suggests that this feature alone would be insufficient and that the contributions of these various features are complex denying us an easy way of identifying paper parses with major problems user study materials documents used for the user study are provided in this appendix recruitment email the following email was sent and forwarded to several mailing lists to recruit participants the anoncorpus research team at the anonymized is conducting an experiment to evaluate the screen reader accessibility of scientific papers we are looking for participants who are age 18 or older who identify as blind or low vision and who have experience using screen readers to interact with scientific papers if you are interested in participating please complete the following form to determine eligibility link participation in this study is entirely voluntary if you do decide to participate your individual data will be kept strictly confidential and will be stored without personal identifiers the study involves an informational interview to better understand screen reader needs around scientific papers each participant will also be asked to interact with papers on a web interface developed by the team the study will take approximately 75 minutes and participants will receive a 150 amazon gift card for their time location online zoom please contact the authors if you have any questions or concerns about this study thank you in advance for your time please help us spread the word by forwarding as appropriate preinterview questionnaire prior to each user study interview the participant was asked to complete the following form share 3 to 5 scientific papers that are difficult to read due to accessibility issues thank you for volunteering to take part in this study please take a few minutes to supply us with some subject keywords you are interested in and a list of 3 to 5 scientific papers you have found difficult to read due to accessibility issues this would help us better plan the study based on your experience 1 your name first name last initial wang ll and cachola i et al 2 please give a few examples of subject keywords you care about for example computing hardware analog computer etc 3 share one paper you have had difficulty reading due to accessibility issues by answering the following questions  paper title link for example what every researcher should know about searching clarified concepts search advice and an agenda to improve finding in academia httpspubmedncbinlmnihgov33031639  on a scale of 1 to 5 how easy or difficult was it for you to read this paper 1 very easy 5 very difficult  briefly describe why you chose the rating 47 repeat 3 interview questions the following discussion guide is used to provide structure for user interviews phase i warmup  can you tell us a little bit about yourself background what kind of research do you do  tell us about how you normally read papers what is your workflow like what tools do you use  do you usually read pdfs directly or do you read papers in other ways  if you need to read a paper and it is not accessible what do you do now  how long does the process take  how often is it successful  can you give a few examples of the main challenges you face when reading papers for example are there certain features or attributes of papers that make them particularly difficult to read  in your opinion are there any resources that provide papers that are easier to read by screen readers for example any journals conferences or search engines  overall how do you feel about your current experience of reading papers phase i current workflow  based on the list of papers you provided walk us through how you would read the paper abc use the screen reader of your choice and any additional tools or extensions that are part of your usual process  instructions please share your whole screen think aloud and walk me through your thinking process  what kind of information were you looking for and how did you explore the page to find the information  on a scale of 1 to 5 how easy or difficult was it to read this paper with the tools and why 1 very easy 5 very difficult  if you could change anything how could this best meet your needs phase ii  we are currently working on an experimental prototype to make papers more easily read by screen readers please take a minute to read the about page first link improving the accessibility of scientific documents  based on the list of papers you provided walk us through how you would read the paper abc using this html render you can also use the screen reader of your choice and any additional tools or extensions that are part of your usual process  instructions  we are working with prototypes so not everything works  please think aloud and walk me through your thinking process  feel free to provide as many feedback as you can good or bad  please take a few more minutes to explore the other parts of this prototype eg references  on a scale of 1 to 5 how easy or difficult was it to read this paper with the tools and why 1 very easy 5 very difficult phase iii  on a scale of 1 to 5 how likely are you to use the html render if it is available to you in the future 1 very unlikely 5 very likely  which features do you consider to be most helpful  is there anything it would need to have or change to convince you to use it  how do you envision yourself using this tool how might it fit into your workflow for example would it be an additional extension that is part of your usual process  if you could search for papers and view them in this format what do you think  if you could upload any pdf and create an html page like this what do you think would that be helpful for you or something you might use why or why not  are you aware of any other tools that display papers in any way besides pdf  do you have any additional feedback about the html render or anything else that you would like to share  thank you wang ll and

bibliography extractions no need to list exhaustively are inline citations linked to bibliography entries please answer this questions considering only the bibliography entries that were extracted options all linked majority linked half linked most unlinked none linked no bibliography comment optional note anything interesting about the inline citation linking no need to list exhaustively text are there any other problems with the html parse that are not covered by one of the above questions please describe optional choice please rate the overall full text quality in the html render options no major problems some problems lots of problems see rubric in section a3 table 11 evaluation questions optional questions are in italics improving the accessibility of scientific documents rating criteria no major problems that impact readability  no errors or relatively few errors  no missing paragraphs but a few insertions into paragraphs or incorrect headers okay  any errors impact only a couple of paragraphs  few missing paragraphs 1 per 5 pages or several figuretable insertions into paragraphs or incorrect headers  errors can impact multiple paragraphs some problems that impact
