arxiv210500022v1 mathco 30 apr 2021 constructing certain families of 3polytopal graphs riccardo w maffucci abstract let n 3 and rn be a 3polytopal graph such that for every 3 i n rn has at least one vertex of degree i we find the minimal vertex count for rn we then describe an algorithm to construct the graphs rn a dual statement may be formulated for faces of 3polytopes the ideas behind the algorithm generalise readily to solve related problems moreover given a 3polytope tl comprising a vertex of degree i for all 3 i l l fixed we define an algorithm to output for n l a 3polytope tn comprising a vertex of degree i for all 3 i n and such that the initial tl is a subgraph of tn the vertex count of tn is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it matches the aforementioned minimal vertex count up to order of magnitude as n gets large in fact we only lose a small quantity on the coefficient of the second highest term and this quantity may be taken as small as we please with the tradeoff of first constructing an accordingly large auxiliary graph keywords algorithm planar graph degree sequence valency 3polytope polyhedron msc2010 05c85 52b05 52b10 05c07 05c10 05c75 introduction the question graphs that are planar and 3connected have the nice property of being 1skeletons of 3polytopes as proven by rademachersteinitz see eg 11 theorem 116 we call these graphs 3polytopal graphs or 3polytopes or polyhedra interchangeably these special planar graphs are uniquely embeddable in a sphere as observed by whitney see eg 11 theorem 115 their regions are also called faces and are delimited by cycles polygons 6 proposition 426 epfl ma sb batiment 8 lausanne switzerland riccardomaffucciepflch our starting point is the following question let n 3 and g0 be a 3polytopal graph such that for every 3 i n g0 has at least one igonal face what is the minimal number of faces for g0 in what follows we will work on the dual problem indeed it is wellknown that 3polytopes have a unique dual graph that is also 3polytopal see eg 11 chapter 11 definition 1 a 3polytope has the property pn if it has at least one vertex of degree i for each 3 i n and moreover it has minimal order number of vertices among 3polytopes satisfying this condition the notation h g indicates that h is a subgraph of g our first result is the following theorem 2 let n 3 and g be a 3polytopal graph with at least one vertex of degree i for every 3 i n then the minimal number pn of vertices of g is n 11n 62 pn n 14 for n 13 we have the values in table 1 3 n 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 10 11 14 16 19 23 table 1 values of pn for n 13 moreover starting from n 14 and rn satisfying pn and the relations rn2 rn rn4 for every n 16 algorithm 8 constructs a 3polytope n 0 mod 4 n 1 mod 4 n 2 mod 4 n 3 mod 4 n 16 graphs satisfying pn for 3 n 15 are depicted in figures 8 9 1 and 10 theorem 2 will be proven in sections 2 3 and 4 passing to the duals we can answer the original question theorem 2 if n 3 and g0 is a 3polytopal graph with at least one igonal face for every 3 i n then the minimal number pn of faces for g0 is given by 11 and table 1 a related problem in our next result given a 3polytope h containing vertices of valencies 3 4 l l 5 and an integer n l we aim to construct a 3polytope g containing a copy of h as subgraph and comprising vertices of degrees 3 4 n we start with the following definition definition 3 let n 5 be odd we say that a 3polytope satisfies property qn if there is at least one vertex of degree 3 and moreover the polytope contains among its faces the triangles fnj vnj1 vnj2 vnj3 1 j n 32 where degvnj1 1 j n 32 degvnj2 1 j n 32 4 5 n 14 and vnj3 6 vni1 vni2 j i note that qn together with minimality wrt order is stronger than property pn of definition 1 theorem 4 let l 5 be odd and tl be a 3polytope satisfying ql fix an integer m 14 m 2 mod 4 and let n l mk where k is a nonnegative integer then there exists a sequence of 3polytopes tn nlmk k1 where each tn satisfies qn such that along the sequence for all 0 one has n2 11n v tn as n moreover for all k 1 it holds that tlmk1 tlmk for chosen tl and n 1 algorithm 13 constructs tlmk for 1 k n theorem 4 will be proven in section 6 remark 5 the order 15 of the sequence of polyhedra in theorem 4 is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the leading term is n2 4 as in 11 the coefficient of the linear term is only slightly larger than the 11n4 of 11 this difference can be taken as small as we please if m is chosen to be large with the tradeoff of first constructing an accordingly large auxiliary graph sm3 as detailed in sections 5 and 6 remark 6 in definition 3 we could have supposed instead n even then accordingly one would have taken j n 22 in 13 and the set 3 4 n on the rhs of 14 this would have produced similar setup and ideas related literature notation and plan of the paper related literature necessary conditions for the degree sequence of a planar graph were given in 3 5 on the other hand eberhard 7 proved that any degree sequence where q 3p 6 p q being vertex and edge counts respectively may be made planar by inserting a sufficiently large number of 6s there have been numerous generalisations and extensions since see eg 1 2 9 10 13 14 in 12 the authors determine the sequences for regular planar graphs this was extended in 15 to sequences with highest and lowest valencies differing by one or two notation all graphs that appear contain no loops and multiple edges the vertex and edge sets of a graph g are denoted by v g and eg respectively the order and size of g are the numbers v g and eg the degree or valency degg v of a vertex v counts the number of vertices adjacent to v in g we use the shorthand degv when g is clear the degree sequence of g is the set of all vertex valencies we write g  h when g h are isomorphic graphs and h g when h is isomorphic to a subgraph of g a graph of order k 1 or more is said to be kconnected if removing any set of k 1 or fewer vertices produces a connected graph regions of a 2connected planar graph are cycles of length i igons 6 proposition 426 for these graphs the terms region and face are interchangeable the igonal faces will be denoted by their sets of i vertices if a b c is a triangle we call splitting the operation of adding a vertex d and edges da db dc plan of the paper theorem 2 is proven in sections 2 lower bound 11 3 cases n 13 and 4 algorithm 8 for n 14 section 5 is about an application of a similar flavour that we can tackle via a minor modification of algorithm 8 the theory of section 5 will also be useful in section 6 to prove theorem 4 appendix a presents another way to think about algorithm 8 appendix b contains figures of graphs mentioned in sections 3 and 4 acknowledgements the author was supported by swiss national science foundation project 200021184927 the lower bound in this section we prove 11 lemma 7 let n 3 and gn be a 3polytopal graph with at least one vertex of degree i for every 3 i n then its order is at least n 5n 30 pn moreover as soon as n 8 we also have n 11n 62 pn proof let p pn q qn denote order and size of gn and dj degvj on one hand via the handshaking lemma 2q jn1 dj n 2n 3 nn 1  3 3p n 2  3p where we used 3connectivity on the other hand by planarity q 3p6 so that altogether n2 5n 30 hence 21 by 3 5 for any 3 k p 43 it holds that di 2p 6k 16 to optimise this lower bound for p the left hand side should contain as many numbers exceeding 5 as possible we thus wish to take k n 5 and we may do this as long as 3 n 5 p 43 ie n 8 and p 3n 19 by 21 these conditions certainly hold for all n 8 in this case equation 23 with k n 5 reads nn 1  15 2p 6n 5 16 and rearranging this inequality we obtain 22 proof of theorem 2 for n 13 the polyhedra up to 8 faces were tabulated in 4 and 8 for 4 n 1 8 we are looking for polyhedra with at least one igonal face for each 3 i n we consult 8 table i searching where the faces column has the maximal n 2 nonzero entries it is straightforward to find the ten relevant cases numbered 1 2 3 4 5 13 14 15 46 and 47 in 8 passing to the dual graphs we obtain the ten 3polytopes sketched in figure 8 in particular for 3 n 7 we have pn n 1 cf table 1 next we wish to find examples of polyhedra satisfying pn for 8 n 13 we observe that each graph in figure 8 save for the tetrahedron and square pyramid may be obtained from a previous one via a splitting operation our strategy is then to apply repeated splitting on the faces of r71 from figure 8 to obtain a new graph rn for 8 n 13 the aim is to obtain a subset of vertices of valencies 4 5 n in the effort to minimise the resulting graphs order we split triangles of r71 containing the maximal possible number of vertices of degree 4 or more ideally all three of them we thereby construct the graphs of figure 9 their orders match the largest of the lower bounds 21 and 22 proven in section 2 we thus complete table 1 in the next section we will combine the above with other ideas to write algorithm 8 proving the cases n 14 of theorem 2 proof of theorem 2 for n 14 setup let r14 be the graph sketched in figure 1 it is straightforward to check that r14 is a figure 1 the 3polytope r14 satisfying p14 polyhedron and that the respective valencies of vj 1 j 11 are 7 9 11 13 14 12 10 8 6 4 5 the order of this graph is 26 matching the lower bound 22 in the case n 14 and there are vertices of degree 3 as well theorem 2 is hence proven in this case in the following we recursively construct the rn n 16 of theorem 2 as for r15 figure 10 we obtain it from r14 via one edge deletion and again applying the ideas of section 3 we need a preliminary definition the operation of hsplitting a triangle about a vertex for some h 1 see figure 2 to hsplit a b c about c we begin by splitting it introducing a new vertex c1 then we split a b c1 inserting c2 and so on until we have added the vertex ch for instance referring to figure 8 given the tetrahedron s3 1splitting any face yields s42 while 2splitting any face produces s52 figure 2 notation for hsplitting a triangle a b c about the vertex c the case n 2 mod 4 we now describe the algorithm producing the rn of theorem 2 starting from the case n 2 mod 4 the remaining cases are covered in section 43 algorithm 8 part i input an integer n 16 output a set of graphs rn 16 n n where each rn has property pn description for all k 1 we define the graph pck kth piece of figure 3 the halflines and numbers in bold represent hsplitting for instance face ak bk ek is split h 4k times about the vertex ek letting pc0 r14 we label u0 v0 w0 its vertices of degrees 10 8 6 respectively v7 v8 v9 is figure 1 the vertex of degree 3 adjacent to these three will be denoted by x0 note that also in each pck k 1 there are vertices uk vk wk of degrees 10 8 6 and xk of degree 3 adjacent to them we define n144 rn r14 n 14 n 2 pck mod 4 identifying in each union operation the vertices uk1 vk1 wk1 xk1 with ak bk ck dk respectively figure 3 the graph pck dashed lines are not edges of pck halflines and numbers in bold represent hsplitting proof of theorem 2 for n 14 n 2 mod 4 we claim that rn 41 has order 11 and satisfies property pn we argue by induction the base case n 14 has already been checked the union 41 is still a 3polytope by construction by the inductive hypothesis the graph n184 pck rn4 r14 satisfies pn4 and has order pn 4 n2 19n 132 turning to rn rn4 pcn144 we record that for pck rn k 1 the vertices ak bk ck dk have respective valencies degrn ak 10 1 4k 1 2 4k 14 degrn bk 8 1 4k 3 4k 12 degrn ck 6 1 4k 1 2 5 4k 11 degrn dk 3 1 1 4k 1 7 4k 13 in particular degrn an144 n degrn bn144 n 2 degrn cn144 n 3 degrn dn144 n 1 the degree of the remaining vertices of rn4 has not changed in the union moreover degrn un144 10 degrn vn144 8 and degrn wn144 6 as for order pcn144 introduces 12 new vertices plus those given by the hsplittings namely 4n 144 2 4n 144 1 2n 27 it follows that n2 11n 62 therefore rn does indeed have property pn moreover it is clear from the construction that rn4 rn v rn pn 4 12 2n 27 the cases n 1 0 3 mod 4 algorithm 8 part ii continuing algorithm 8 for n 16 n 1 resp 0 mod 4 we start by constructing rn3 resp rn2 as above we then define rn rn3 end1n resp rn rn2 end0n with end1n resp end0n given by figure 4a resp 4b for n 1 in the union rn rn3 end1n vertices un174 vn174 wn174 xn174 are identified with a b c d respectively for n 0 in the union rn rn2 end0n vertices un164 vn164 wn164 xn164 are identified with b c d respectively finally if n 3 mod 4 we take rn rn2 end0n rn5 end1n2 end0n identifying d v w x of end1n2 with b c d of end0n respectively proof of theorem 2 for n 16 n 1 0 3 mod 4 if n 1 in rn one has dega n degb n 1 and degc n 2 the remaining valencies 4 of rn3 do not change in the union rn moreover degd 10 degv 8 and degw 6 lastly by theorem 2 in the already proven case n 2 v rn pn 3 9 n 112 n 132 n 152 n2 11n 62 as required similarly if n 0 in rn it holds that deg n degb n 1 degc 10  8 and degw 6 further degd n 11n 62 v rn pn 2 8 n 14 a the graph end1n b the graph end0n figure 4 the graphs end1n and end0n halflines and numbers in bold represent hsplitting if n 3 in rn we have dega n 2 degb n 3 degc n 4 deg n  8 and degw 6 via the already proved case degb n 1 degc 10 degd n 1 n 11n 62 v rn pn 2 8 n 14 the relations 12 are clear by construction this concludes the proof of theorem 2 remark 9 the time to implement algorithm 8 is quadratic in n and this is optimal in the sense that the order of rn is itself quadratic 11 moreover constructing rn takes no more time than obtaining all of r14 r18 rn n mod 42 rn cf 12 another application the ideas of the preceding sections have solved the problem of finding for all n a graph satisfying pn of definition 1 the following lemma constitutes an application of the same ideas and it illustrates how a minor modification of algorithm 8 allows to answer similar questions moreover the result of the lemma will be needed in section 6 lemma 10 let n 17 n 1 mod 4 and h be an order p polyhedral graph with at least one vertex of degree i 3 i n and at least three vertices of degree n 1 then its minimal order is n2 7n 34 proof let us show the lower bound first similarly to lemma 7 we begin by imposing 6p 12 n 3n 1 n 2n 1 n2 n 10 dj  3p leading to n2 n 14 thereby for n 17 we certainly have 3 n 4 p 43 applying 23 with k n 4 yields the inequality n 3n 1 n 2n 1  21 2p 6n 4 16 and rearranging this inequality and imposing n 1 mod 4 we obtain 51 as a lower bound to show the upper bound we will actually construct a graph sn satisfying the assumptions of the present lemma of order 51 we set sn rn end0n n 17 n 1 mod 4 where rn was constructed in algorithm 8 and end0n is depicted in figure 5 figure 5 the graph end0n dashed lines are not edges of end0n since n 1 mod 4 sn rn3 end1n end0n while performing the union we identify vertices d v w x of end1n figure 4a with a0 b0 c0 d0 of end0n in this order then sn is clearly still a polyhedron further degsn a0 10 2 n 13 n 1 degsn b0 8 4 n 13 n 1 degsn c0 6 4 10 degsn d0 3 5 8 and degsn w0 6 since rn has the property pn then sn has vertices of each degree i 3 i n the union with end0n has inserted two more vertices of valency n 1 lastly v sn v rn 6 n 13 n2 7n 34 n2 11n 62 4n 28 the proof of lemma 10 is complete remark 11 we record the following property of the graph sn it plainly has degree 3 vertices and contains among its faces the triangles fnj vnj1 vnj2 vnj3 1 j n 12 where degvn11 degvn12 n 1 degvnj1 2 j n 12 degvnj2 2 j n 12 4 5 n and vnj3 6 vni1 vni2 j i this property stronger than qn of definition 3 shall be denoted by rn indeed for sn rn is easily observed by construction for instance we may take the pairs 7 4 13 12 9 5 14 11 4k 14 4k 12 4k 11 4k 13 for 1 k n 174 n n 1 n 2 10 n 1 n 1 8 6 where the notation a b means that if u v denote two vertices of one of the triangles fnj then degu a and degv b proof of theorem 4 premise we first introduce the main ideas of the proof via the following lemma lemma 12 let tl be as in theorem 4 then we may construct a sequence of 3polytopes tn nl2k k1 where tlmk1 tlmk for k 1 and each tn satisfies qn moreover along the sequence for all 0 one has  1 n v tn as n here we prove the first statement relegating the proof of the second one 61 to section 63 the base case is just the assumption of the lemma we take the inductive hypothesis that tl2k1 verifies property ql2k1 of definition 3 suppose that at step k 1 k n we were to perform 2splitting on each triangle fl2k1j 1 j l 2k 1 32 13 about vertex vl2k1j3 that would raise by 2 the degrees of a set of vertices of valencies 4 5 l 2k 1 however in the resulting graph we would not be guaranteed vertices of degrees 4 and 5 therefore the 2splitting is taken only for 2 j l 2k 1 32 ie all these faces save fl2k11 we replace fl2k11 with the graph s of figure 6 identifying vl2k111 vl2k112 vl2k113 with a b c respectively figure 6 the graph s in this way the valencies of vl2k111 and vl2k112 increase by 2 and they belong to the new triangle fl2kl2k32 a b g two vertices of valencies 4 and 5 are introduced namely d e moreover these two belong to a triangle fl2k1 d e f we also set fl2kj vl2k1j1 vl2k1j2 vl2k1j3 2 j l 2k 32 1 where vl2k1j3 is the second of the two vertices introduced in the 2splitting of fl2k1j we have thus constructed tl2k satisfying ql2k as claimed in section 63 it will be shown that the above produces a sequence of graphs tn verifying 61 our goal is to optimise this method to asymptotically improve this upper bound on v tn the algorithm in section 61 we have used the polyhedron s as it has the 2 triangles a b g and d e f with vertices of appropriate valencies degd 5 and dege dega degb 4 a refinement of this idea is then to pick m even and use in place of s a polyhedron containing m 22 triangles where two vertices from each form a set of vertices of degrees m 3 m 2 m 2 m 2 m 1 m m 1 5 4 we have seen in remark 11 that for m 14 sm3 has the desired property rm3 algorithm 13 input a 3polytopal graph tl satisfying ql an integer m 14 m 2 mod 4 and a positive integer n output a set of graphs tn tlmk 1 k n each satisfying property qn and tlmk1 tlmk these are the first n entries of a sequence verifying 15 description starting from tl we perform steps 1 k n as follows the graph tlmk1 verifies qlmk1 ie it has l mk 1 32 triangular faces flmk1j vlmk1j1 vlmk1j2 vlmk1j3 1 j l mk 1 32 where degvlmk1j1 1 j l mk 1 32  degvlmk1j2 1 j l mk 1 32 4 5 l mk 1 at step k we msplit the flmk1j about vlmk1j3 for j 2 l mk 1 32 next we replace the remaining triangle flmk11 with a copy of sm3 from lemma 10 identifying vlmk111 and vlmk112 with two adjacent vertices of degree m 2 in sm3 this is well defined since m 3 17 m 3 1 mod 4 and sm3 has property rm3 remark 11 in this way we have increased by m the degrees of a set of vertices of valencies 4 5 l mk 1 and we have introduced m new vertices of degrees 4 5 m 3 applying lemma 10 moreover these new vertices together with vlmk111 and vlmk112 belong pairwise to m 22 triangles by the construction of sm3 remark 11 we have thus obtained tlmk satisfying qlmk relation 16 follows by construction concluding the proofs of theorem 4 and lemma 12 it remains to show 15 in algorithm 13 starting with v tl vertices at step k 1 we have inserted m of them for each of l 3 mk 12 1 msplittings plus v sm3 3 for the operation on flmk11 ie replacing this triangle with a copy of sm3 therefore nlm v tn v tl l 5 mk 1  v sm3 3 nlm m2 x ml 5 n l  v tl k 1  v sm3 3 4v sm3 m2 10m 12  n where as n we have bounded the constant terms via n for all 0 substituting the value 51 we have as n 11m 10 v tn as required the proof of theorem 4 is complete note that m was chosen so that m 3 17 and m 3 1 mod 4 hold in order to minimise the quantity 4v sm3 m2 10m 12 lemma 10 so that ultimately the coefficient of n in 15 is as small as this method allows in lemma 12 we had fixed instead m 2 and used the graph s figure 6 in place of sm3 since v s 7 we get 61 this concludes the proof of lemma 12 future directions the ideas behind algorithms 8 and 13 are readily generalisable to tackle problems of a similar flavour as shown for instance in section 5 the constructions or a slight modification thereof allow to minimise the total number of vertices of a graph where certain valencies have been fixed another way to present algorithm 8 the following construction of rn may be more intuitive than algorithm 8 albeit less apt for implementation we begin by fixing n 9 and defining a polyhedron an of order n 5 as follows given an initial triangle v1 v2 v3 we add in order v4 v5 vn5 together with edges vi vi1 vi vi2 vi vi3 i 4 5 n 5 splitting operations the resulting an for n 14 21 are illustrated in figure 7 a a14 b a21 figure 7 illustration of the construction an we note that a9  r3 a10  r42 a11  r52 and a12  r63 from figure 8 for all n 11 the degree sequence of these graphs is 3 4 5 6n11 5 4 3 where the superscript is a shorthand indicating quantities of repeated numbers eg 6n11 means n 11 vertices of degree 6 assuming n 14 we pass from an to another polyhedron bn in the following way firstly we apply the splitting operation to every face of an this has the effect of doubling all previous vertex degrees and introducing 2n 5 4 new ones an is a triangulation  it is maximal planar so that the sequence is now 6 8 10 12n11 10 8 6 32n14 secondly we split either of the two faces containing v1 v4 this yields in particular a vertex of degree 4 to obtain one of degree 5 we split the two faces that are adjacent to one another and that contain v2 v5 and v3 v5 respectively for instance in figure 1 inserting v24 raises the valency of v10 to 4 and inserting v25 v26 raises the valency of v11 to 5 the constructed polyhedron shall we denoted by bn its order is v bn n 5 2n 5 4 3 3n 16 7 9 11 13 14 12 12n14 10 8 6 5 4 32n13 and its sequence in a2 we have purposefully isolated a subset of vertices of degree 12 v 0 v 0 bn v bn with cardinality n 14 keeping the remaining one aside we have b14  r14 figure 1 for n 16 our strategy is outlined as follows the vertices in an have been designated to eventually correspond to ones of degree 6 or higher in rn following the ideas of section 3 bn has been constructed by splitting faces of an that contain three of these vertices of high degree next starting from bn we split faces containing two of them we take four vertices from v 0 of a3 via nine repeated splitting operations we aim to raise their degrees to 15 16 17 18 similarly the next four shall become of degrees 19 20 21 22 and so forth 4k 11 4k 12 4k 13 4k 14 this procedure ends when there remain either 2 3 0 or 5 vertices in v 0 depending on whether n 0 1 2 or 3 mod 4 for n 2 the algorithm stops here in the other cases n 0 1 3 we look to apply further triangle splittings to obtain vertices of degrees n 1 n n 2 n 1 n or n 4 n 3 n 2 n 1 n respectively the details have already been presented in section 4 illustrations for small cases of theorem 2 here we
