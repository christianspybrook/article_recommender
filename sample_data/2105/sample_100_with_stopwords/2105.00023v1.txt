canada a1c 5s7 may 4 2021 per bap abstract a finitedimensional quantum system is coupled to a bath of oscillators in thermal equilibrium at temperature t 0 we show that for fixed small values of the coupling constant the true reduced dynamics of the system is approximated by the completely positive trace preserving markovian semigroup generated by the davieslindblad generator the difference between the true and the markovian dynamics is o14 for all times meaning that the solution of the gorinikossakowskisudarshanlindblad master equation is approximating the true dynamics to accuracy o14 for all times our method is based on a recently obtained expansion of the full systembath propagator it applies to reservoirs with correlation functions decaying in time as 1t4 or faster introduction consider an nlevel system with hilbert space cn coupled to a reservoir of oscillators in equilibrium at temperature t 0 the hamiltonian is given by h hs hr g g where hs is an n n hermitian matrix with possibly degenerate eigenvalues ej and eigenvectors j hs ej j ihj and hr is the environment or reservoir hamiltonian k ak ak hr describing modes of a collection of harmonic oscillators labelled by k with frequencies are k 0 put 1 the creation and annihilation operators ak ak satisfy the canonical commutation relations ak al kl kronecker symbol the interaction term contains a coupling constant r an interaction operator g hermitian n n matrix and it is linear in the field operator 1 x g gk ak hc 2 k where hc denotes the hermitian conjugate the collection of the numbers gk c constitutes the form factor g the size of gk determines how strongly the oscillator k is coupled to the system this model is ubiquitous for n 2 it is called the spinboson model in the limit of continuous modes thermodynamic limit infinite volume limit the values of frequencies k becomes a continuum as do the values of the parameter k for definiteness we consider a reservoir modeling a scalar quantized field in three dimensions this corresponds to momenta k r3 and k gk ak and ak become functions k gk a k ak with ak a l k l dirac distribution in the continuous mode limit the reservoir hamiltonian 13 and field operator 14 are ka kakd3 k hr r3 z gka k hc d3 k g 2 r3 the hilbert space on which the operators 15 act is the customary bosonic fock space over the single particle wave function space l2 r3 d3 k momentum representation f n0 l2sym r3n d3n k where the subscript sym refers to symmetric functions bosons and the summand with n 0 is interpreted to be c in this paper we understand that the continuous mode limit is performed to begin with that is we consider the hamiltonian 11 with hs given in 12 and hr g given in 15 the hilbert space of pure states of the coupled system is h cn f with f given by 16 we consider an initially disentangled systemservoir state of the form sr0 s r where s is an arbitrary system n n density matrix and r is the equilibrium state of the reservoir at temperature t 1 0 since the hamiltonian hr has continuous spectrum the operator ehr is not trace class and so we cannot define the reservoir gibbs density matrix directly by constraining the reservoir particles to move in a finite volume r3 in typically a box in direct position space the momenta of particles are quantized and discrete and one can define the usual equilibrium gibbs density matrix r ehr for hr given in 13 and frequencies determined by in the limit of contiunous modes the density matrix ehr is ill defined however the twopoint function tr ehr a f ag r a f ag tr ehr has a well defined limit explicitly given by r a f ag hg e  1 f i kf k 3 d k ek 1 for any f g l2 r3 d3 k the associated state is quasifree or gaussian meaning that averages of general field observables p which are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators and limits thereof are found using wicks theorem 6 this state is the infinite volume or continuous mode limit of the reservoir in thermal equilibrium and it is the initial state for the reservoir see 18 the state r is a linear functional on the observable algebra p of polynomials in creation and annihilation operators or the weyl algebra and it can also be represented by a density matrix r having actually rank one albeit in a hilbert space different from f this is called a purification and we explain it in section 21 below the reduced system density matrix s t is then defined by the relation trcn s ta s r eith a 1lr eith 110 valid for all system observables a bcn operators on cn on the right side of 110 we use the convenient notation s r a b trcn s ar b which extends by linearity to all nonproduct systemreservoir observables the mapping s 7 s t is linear and defines the socalled dynamical map vt s 7 vt s s t 111 vt maps the initial system state to the state at time t evolved according to the interacting dynamics a central question in the theory of open quantum systems is when one can approximate vt by a completely positive trace preserving cptp semigroup etl a classical result is that this can be done under some conditions 10 11 32 show that 2 k lim sup kvt etls 0 02 ta for any a 0 112 here ls ihs is the free system dynamics and k describes the influence of the bath to second order in perturbation consisting of a hamiltonian as well as a dissipative term see also 1 7 33 often the superoperator k is called the davies generator and ls 2 k is the generator of a cptp semigroup 8 14 27 the davies generator can be calculated by perturbation theory and corresponds to the socalled level shift operator see section 23 and also the appendix of 27 as follows from 112 it can also be constructed from the relation lim v 2 e ls e k  0 113 in differential form the approximate markovian dynamics defined as 2 k m t etls m 0 114 takes the form of the ubiquitous markovian master equation m t lm t l ls 2 k 115 an inconvenience of 112 is that the accuracy of the markovian approximation is only guaranteed for times that are not too large satisfying 2 t a this holds for arbitrary fixed a but the deviation of the true dynamics vt from its markovian approximation etls k cannot be bounded uniformly in a in other words the speed of the convergence to zero as 0 in 112 depends on a said differently 112 shows that the markovian approximation is guaranteed to hold for t only if at the same time one takes 0 with a bounded value for 2 t for this reason 112 is sometimes called the weakcoupling or van hove limit recently in 21 27 the result 112 was improved to 2 k sup vt etls  c2 116 provided 0 for some 0 as 116 shows the markovian approximation is now guaranteed to be accurate to o2 uniformly in time t 0 for fixed the proof of 116 is given using the socalled dynamical resonance theory in 21 27 an analyticity condition on the form factor gk see 11 is imposed which implies that the symmetrized reservoir correlation function c t re c t where c t r geithr geithr 117 118 is the correlation function decays exponentially quickly in time for large times it is well known that decay of reservoir correlations is necessary for a markovian description of the system dynamics to be accurate but demanding exponential decay is not necessary the reason for the analyticity condition and hence the assumption of exponential decay of correlations made in 21 27 is that the analysis is based on socalled spectral deformation methods pioneered in 4 18 in this setting however a technically more demanding approach based on mourre theory was introduced in the current context in 25 15 and further developed in 19 20 it can be viewed as an infinitesimal version of the deformation method and only requires the existence of a few derivatives up to order four for us here rather than analyticity of the form factor gk consequently the mourre theory approach allows us to deal with polynomially decaying reservoir correlation functions in the present work the decay has to be at least as quick as c t t4 t 119 as we explain below after 34 the main achievement of the present work is a proof of the accuracy of the markovian approximation uniformly in time assuming the abovementioned weak regularity condition our main result is theorem 11 which gives 116 but alas with an inferior error estmate of o14 prior to the current work mourre theory was not used to show the validity of the markovian approximation in 19 it was used to show that the spinboson model has the property of return to equilibrium even in the strong coupling regime in which one is forced to use mourre theory as the analytic deformation cannot be applied in 20 that approach was further developed to examine the reduced dynamics of the spinboson model large coupling giving an expansion of the spin dynamics into the sum of a main term plus a remainder the remainder was shown to decay to zero as t but not to be small in nor was it shown that the main term is a cptp dynamics in 28 an expansion of the systemreservoir dynamics was derived with an explicitly identified main term in terms of resonance data and a remainder which is small in for all times t 0 our current work uses the results of 28 to prove the validity of the markovian approximation deriving a markovian effective evolution equation for open systems is an important task for theoretical and practical reasons 1 7 22 33 the literature on the topic is huge and growing and it encompasses research in mathematics physics chemistry quantum information and biology 2 5 8 9 16 23 24 30 31 34 35 main result our main result is theorem 11 below we first present the assumptions assumptions 1 smoothness of the form factor gk l2 r3 d3 k we assume gk for some values 1 kpq p 21 12 23 or p 2 and q 2 120 121 and where hk is a function four times differentiable with respect to k for k 0 such that h and its derivatives are bounded on 0 and limk0 k hk 6 0 j 0 4 2 effective coupling a fermi golden rule condition we assume that min hm gn i g em en d 0 1mnn em 6en 122 where the minimum is over all distinct eigenvalue pairs of hs see 12 b simplicity of resonance energies we assume that the socalled level shift operators e e e0 em en m n 1 n have simple eigenvalues the e are explicit matrices describing the second order 2 corrections to the energy differences e e0 given in section 33 remarks i another way of expressing assumption 1 is that that g should be four times differentiable in the radial variable k and that it should have the infrared and ultraviolet behaviours gk kp for k 0 and gk kq or k respectively with p and q satisfying 121 ii assumptions 1 together with 2a guarantee that the coupled systemreservoir complex has a unique stationary state the coupled equilibrium state for small nonzero see 25 and also section 33 assumption 2b is a simplification that can be quite easily removed by a slightly more cumbersome analysis we do not present it here iii sometimes the reservoir spectral density is introduced as g 2d  0 j 2 123 the bound 122 is equivalent to jem en 6 0 and hm gn i 6 0 for all em 6 en the spectral density is related to the fourier transform of the nonr itu symmetrized correlation function 118 b c u r e c tdt by c u 1 eu see eg the appendix of 27 the main result of this paper is u r 124 theorem 11 markovian approximation uniform in time there is a constant c0 0 such that if 0 c0 then 2 k kvt etls k c14 125 for another constant c here ls ihs and k is the davies generator the norm in 125 is that of superoperators ie operators acting on density matrices in particular we have kvt s etl s k1 c14 trace norm with c independent of s 1 the next result gives an estimate of c0 in terms of the temperature for low temperatures proposition 12 consider temperatures t 1 in the range 0 t t0 for a fixed t0 then the constant c0 in theorem 11 satisfies  min 1 a 2 g 32 43 126 c0 c0 t max 1 1 where c0 is a constant depending only on t0 but independent of t and independent of the parameters a g the latter five quantities naturally emerging from the perturbation theory some of which depend on t they are given in 348352 and they explicitly calculable in concrete models see proposition 13 below the bound 126 is not optimal finding the smallest possible c0 for which our method still works is an arduous task which we do not take on at this stage the spinboson model as an explicit illustration we consider the twodimensional system with hamiltonian hs and interaction operator g written in an orthonormal basis 1 i 2 i to be given by  1 0 g11 g12 hs 127 g12 g22 2 0 1 here 0 is the bohr energy of the system and g g is a hermitian matrix we introduce the superoperator k acting on 2 2 density matrices as k 12 b c 0 g11 g22 p1 p2 p2 p1 c g12 2 11 p2 21 p1 21 p1 b c g12 2 22 p1 12 p2 12 p2 ihls 128 with hls c u 1 x gkl pv pk  kl12 r ek el u since we are in finite dimensions all norms are actually equivalent 129 in 128 129 we use the notation pj j ihj ij hi j i for j 1 2 e1 2 e2 e1 and b c is given in 124 we understand b c 0 as the limit lim0 b which is nonzero only for p 12 cf 121 the superoperators ihls and ls ihs commute set l ls 2 k 130 it is readily verified that if g12 6 0 and b c 6 0 ie if 122 holds then the only density matrix satisfying l 0 is the gibbs equilibrium ehs tr ehs 131 and that limt etl s for any initial state by integrating dtd l one easily finds explicitly etl 11 e 1 t 0 11 1 e 1 t s 11 132 etl 12 eit x2 e 2 t 0 12 133 with 1 g12 2 j coth 2  21 b c 0 g11 g22 c u  g22 g11 pv cothu2  g12 pv ju 2 1 134 135 136 the constants 2 1 and 2 2 are the thermalization and decoherence rates respectively proposition 13 there is a constant c0 0 such that if 0 c0 then 125 holds for ls ihs and k given in 128 moreover if 0 t t0 for a fixed t0 and if p 12 see 121 then c0 c0 t 763 137 for a c0 depending only on t0 and our estimates are not uniform in the temperature t as t 0 one might attempt to optimize the bound t 763 given in proposition 13 but we are not dealing with this here proof of theorem 11 the dynamics of an open quantum systems is usually presented in form of the evolution t 7 t of the density matrix the link to our result corollary 22 of 28 is obtained by passing to a purification of the system that is representing the density matrix t by a vector in a new hilbert space after all a density matrix is an operator which is an element or vector of the space of all linear operators we present the purification in section 21 and in section 22 we explain how the dynamics is expressed in the new hilbert space we show in section 23 how the setup is that of 28 and we how we can borrow the result of corollary 22 there to prove theorem 11 here purification of the initial state we now describe the purification of the systemreservoir complex take p any system density matrix s acting on hs and write it in its diagonal form s j pj j ihj then associate to s the vector s j pj j cj cn cn here c is the antilinear operator taking complex conjugates of the components of a vector in cn in the energy basis j 12 the choice of this basis is a convention the map c is introduced so that s 7 s is linear also define the linear map s representation taking matrices on cn to matrices on cn cn determined by a 7 s a a 1ls it is then immediately verified that trcn s a hs s as ihs hs cn cn relation 23 is the purification of the state s it is also called the gelfandnaimarksegal gns representation as an example the equilibrium gibbs state is represented 1 hs s zs 7 s zs eej 2 j j where zs trcn ehs j1 e is the partition function the purification of the reservoir equilibrium state is known as the arakiwoods representation of the canonical commtation relations 3 29 the starting point is the reservoir equilibrium state r ehr for hr given in 13 in the contiuous mode limit ehr is not trace class since hr has continuous spectrum so the density matrix ehr is ill defined rather the state is defined to be the continuous thermodynamic limit of a sequence of discrete modes equilibrium states the limiting state is described by the normalized linear functional determined by the twopoint function 19 the state is quasifree or gaussian meaning that averages of general field observables p polynomials of creation and annihilation operators and limits thereof are found using wicks theorem let p be a field observable similarly to 23 we have a representation which we verify to be correct in 213 below r p hr pr ihr where hr l2sym r s 2 n du dn is the symmetric fock space over the oneparticle space l2 r s 2 du d l2 r s 2 here d is the uniform measure over the unit sphere s 2 r3 the vector r is the vacuum vector of the fock space hr ie r 1 0 0 when written according to the sum decomposition 26 as in any fock space we have creation and annihilation operators which we denote by a f a f where f l2 r s 2 is a singleparticle function over which the fock space hr is built the canonical commutation relations a f a g hf gil2rs 2 are satisfied the field operators acting on hr are defined  f a f a f as in any fock space the annihilators map the vacuum vector to zero a f r 0 for all f the representation map maps operators on f 16 to operators on hr is linear and satsifies a a its action on field operators g 12 a g ag where g l2 r3 d3k is a oneparticle state associated to the fock space 16 then determines uniquely2 we have  g g  l2 r3 d3 k l2 r s 2 du d 210 where takes a function gk k r3 into a function gu u r s 2 defined by gu 211  g u 1 e on the right side of 211 g is represented in spherical coordinates u k 0 s 2 for instance a radially symmetric form factor gk kek k r3 is given in for instance as a g 1 g  iig we have a g 1 g  i ig spherical coordinates by gu u eu u 0 independent of note hat the map  is not linear but only real linear as on the second line in 211 the complex conjugate  appears the linearity of and 29 imply that a g 12 g i ig see also footnote 2 using 211 then gives 12  a f a 1 e 1 e 212 where u 1 if u 0 and u 0 for u 0 and u 1 u to verify that 25 is correct with our definitions 26 29 and 211 we calculate for f g l2 r3 d3 k 12 hr a f agr ihr hr a u f u u 1 eu r i 1

214 where s is an arbitrary density matrix acting on cn and r is the reservoir equilibrium state defined by 19 in the hilbert space h hs hr 215 where hs and hr are given in 23 and 26 respectively the state 214 is represented by the normalized vector 0 s r h 216 here s hs is the purification of s moreover  s 217 see 21 and 29 maps observables o acting on cn f before purification to operators on h after purification and we have s r o h0 o0 ih 218 liouville operator the next task is to find out how the dynamics generated by the hamiltonian h 11 acting on cn is represented in the hilbert space h the answer is that  eith oeith eitl oeitl 219 for a selfadjoint operator l l0 i 220 acting on h called the liouville operator it is the generator of dynamics in the purification hilbert space akin to the hamiltonian h without purification given h the operator l satisfying 219 is not unique this is a general fact explained by the tomitatakesaki theory of von neumann algebras 6 which tells that the image of the map does not constitute all operators on h but only half of them in the following sense there is an antiunitary map j on h called the modular conjugation having the following property given any a in the image of ie a a for some operator a on cn f the operator jaj commutes with all operators in the image of 3 we say that jaj is in the commutant of the algebra of observables now suppose a specific operator l satisfies 219 then take any x in the commutant and set k l x this is again an operator on h and it also satisfies4 eith oeith eitk oeitk the nonuniqueness of the liouville operator can be used to ones advantage by choosing a suitable operator x using the perturbation theory of equilibrium kms states 13 6 it is known that the interacting systemreservoir complex has a unique equilibrium state represented by a normalized vector sr h this vector has an explicit taylor expansion in at  0 and sr s r o 221 where s is given in 24 in other words sr0 s r is the noninteracting equilibrium state we then use the above freedom choice of x to impose the condition l sr 0 222 the resulting liouville operator has the form 18 4 13 27 l l0 i 223 l0 ls lr ls hs 1ls 1ls hs lr du 224 225 226 where more precisely if we denote by m the weak closure of the image of and by m its commutant then jmj m this can be checked for instance by using the katotrotter formula 36 note however that l is not in general an operator in the image of so x does not commute with l the system part ls acts on cn cn and lr is the second quantization of multiplication by the radial variable u r acting on the fock space hr in particular eitlr a f eitlr a eitu f bogoliubov transformation the interaction operator i in 223 is given by i  g g j g g j compare with 11 where j is the modular conjugation the explicit form of j is well known see eg 121 of 19 one then gets the expression 19 27 i g 1ls g 1ls cgc eu2 g 227 resonance expansion and proof of theorem 11 let o be a systemreservoir observable according to 216 218 and 219 its average at time t in the state s r is given by s r o hs r eitl oeitl s r i 228 given any vector s cn cn there exists a unique operator b on cn such that s 1ls bs cn cn 229 where s is the purification vector 24 representing the system gibbs equilibrium state the operator b can be found explicitly and easily as follows see also 27 since the 1 hs density matrix s zs is invertible we can write see also the beginning of section 21 s s s s j pj j ihj 1 s j pj j ihs 1 s j the latter sum has the representation j pj j cs s j 1ls cs s cs in the purification

range we thus obtain from 228231 s r o hs r b eitl oeitl s r i 232 next using the normalization 222 the bound 230 and the expansion 221 yields s r o hs r b eitl os r i r1 233 r1 ckok 234 where is a constant independent of t s and o we also used keitl k 1 and kok kok note that in 233 we cannot commute b back to the right as it will not commute with eitl o because that operator is not in the range of any longer after cancelling the factor eitl consider now an observable o a 1lf on the system alone a an n n matrix then the main term on the right side of 233 is of the form as indicated in

311 proof of theorem 31 the proof follows the strategy of 20 19 however in those papers the interaction operator i is proportional to a weyl operator which is in particular a bounded operator and not the field operator we have here it is thus necessary to give a proof in the present case introduce the regularized liouville operator l for 0 by l l0 in i 320 where x means the restricted operator pr xpr ranpr and where  is ds fbseis ie a diu 321 i 2 r here fbs 212 r eisx f xdx is the fourier transform of the function f which we choose to be a schwartz function satisfying f k 0 1 for k 0 1 this implies isk fbsds 1 k 0 1 322 2 r in what follows we use the notation proposition 33 suppose 8 rz l z1 sfbsdskgk kug k 323 2 then the following holds 1 we have 2 n iml 2n in particular z with imz 2 is in the resolvent set of l and krz k 2 imz1 2 we have kn 12 rz k h rz i12 and kn 12 rz k 2 kn 12 k as well as kn 12 rz n 12 k rz the same bounds hold for rz replaced by 3 for z with imz 0 the range of rz belongs to the domain of n and of l0 an moreover rz leaves the domain of invariant furthermore rz converges to l z1 in the strong sense on ranpr as 0 proof of proposition 33 the arguments are similar to lemma 43 of 19 the difference being that there the interaction operator is a weyl operator as opposed to the field operator we have here once statement 1 is proven the other statements follow from it as in 19 we then only show statement 1 here to do so write  is i n 12 ds n 12 324 1l iml n im fbsn 12 eis ie  is i  is ds we get the estimate by writing eis ie s eis ie  is i n 12 k skn 12 i  n 12 k 4skgk kug kl2 325 n 12 eis ie combining 324 and 325 we get the bounds on iml the bound on the resolvent follows easily this completes the proof of proposition 33 proposition 34 suppose that for some l 0 we have kuk g k for k 1 l 1 1 set i d  i then kn 12 ik cl l where 4kgk cl kul1 g k l 2 2 we have 326 1 s sl fbs ds 2 2 4c1 kn 12 1 2 12 k rz k e c1 cl1 proof of proposition 34 1 we

the part coming from the sum r 0 l  4kgk k l2g k the in 330 integrates to zero due to 322 next kn 12 adl2 estimate 326 follows 2 following the proof of lemma 45 in 19 and keeping track of the constants one derives h rz i 4e82c1 kn 12 1 2 12 k2 the exponential comes from a gronwall type estimate combining this with proposition 33 2 the bound 328 follows this completes the proof of proposition 34 proof of theorem 31 we show the bounds 37 38 for the regularized resolvent rz since the upper bounds are independent of since rz is bounded uniformly in  for z c fixed and since rz rz strongly as 0 proposition 33 3 the result follows we write simply r l z1 here let k 0 be an integer we have zk r krk1 and denoting 331 see also proposition 34 point 1 we get h rk1 i ha rk1i hr k1 ai h rk1 i 332 all operators are on the range of pr and we write simply x for x for operators x cf after 320 the derivation satisfies the leibniz rule and we have r rir because l0 in 0 we get r rr rj irkj2 333 we first use krk 2 and 328 to estimate ha rk1i kak krk1k cec1 k12 kk1 kk1 334 the same bound holds for hr k ai next using 326 328 krk 2 and kn 12 rk 2 proposition 33 2 h r ir kj2 kn 12 rj1 kkr kkn

337 h rk1i c 1 c1ec1 ec1 1 k12 kk1kk1 now we use 337 to get ha rk1i c 1 c1 ec1 ec1 1 k12 kk2kk1 and similarly for the second term on the right side of 332 which then amounts to use now l 2 in 335 h rk1i c 1 ec1 c1 c2 ec1 1 k12 kk2 kk2 338 upon integration 338 yields the bound h rk1i c 1 ec1 c1 c2 ec1 1 k32 kk2kk2 339 which is 337 with the power of increased by one and the norm of the vectors and the prefactor changed we now iterate this procedure k times to obtain 37 r rir we investigate now we show 38 since d h riri ha riri hrir ai h riri 340 using 328 ha riri kn 12 r ak kn 12 ik krk ckg

343 the last term on the right side of 342 has the same upper bound next h riri kn 12 r k kn 12 ik krk ce2c1 cl l1 kk1 kk1 taking l 2 in 343 and l 1 in 344 and using this in 342 yields h riri ce2c1 c1

kec1 kk2 kk2 since  rir this shows 38 the proof of theorem 31 is complete proof of proposition 12 by the expression a b we mean that a constb where the constant is independent of the parameters g a and of the inverse temperature according to the proof of theorem11 238 we need that 0 0 where 0 is given by see 28 equation 214 min 1 a 2 kipr k g 32 347 max 1 1 1 1 1 the various parameters are given

that c1 1 3 it follows from 315 that 1 2 9 consider low temperatures t 1 1 then 1 9 and so max 1 1 1 1 1 18 max 1 1 354 also one easily sees that lim kipr k is a fixed nonzero value and thus min 1 a 2 g 32 min 1 a 2 kipr k g 32 for small temperatures combining 354 and 355 gives the bound 2 32 min  0 t 18 for t 1 small max 1 1 then 0 355 356 is satisfied provided 126 holds this completes the proof of proposition level shift operators and fermi golden rule condition a5 it is shown in 25 that if 122 is satisfied then l has a simple eigenvalue at zero for small 6 0 it then follows that l does not have any other eigenvalues except for that single one at the origin 17 6 this argument holds even if the spectrum of hs is degenerate denoting as in 28 the number of eigenvalues of l for 6 0 by me we see that condition 122 implies that m0 1 and me 0 for all e 6 0 in particular the only invariant state for 6 0 is the coupled equilibrium state more precisely as shown in 25 condition 122 implies that the spectrum of the level shift operators e for e 6 0 lies in the open upper complex plane c z imz 0 and that 0 has a simple eigenvalue at the origin eigenvector s see 24 and all other eigenvalues of 0 are in c therefore e has exactly me real eigenvalues as required in condition a5 of that paper this characterization of the spectrum of the e is usually called the fremi golden rule condition the assumption a5 in 28 contains another part namely that the eigenvalues of e are simple we have e pe ipe l0 e i0 1 ipe 357 with i given in 227 and where pe pse pr where pr is given in 31 and pse is the eigenprojection of ls associated to the eigenvalue e as i contains two terms 357 is the sum of four terms 358 pe g 1ls gl0 e i0 g 1ls gpe pe g 1ls gl0 e i0 1 1ls cgc eu2 gpe pe 1ls cgc eu2 gl0 e i0 1 g 1ls gpe pe 1ls cgc eu2 gl0 e i0 1 1ls cgc eu2 gpe the partial trace over the reservoir part is calculated using the formula pr f l0 e i0 1 gpr 21 pr a f l0 e i0 1 a gpr  2 pr f u gu ls e u i0 1 dud

cases where g g are given explicitly see eg section 331 note that if e is a simple eigenvalue of ls then pse has rank one and so e has automatically simple spectrum note also that e 0 is always a degenerate eigenvalue of ls 331 spinboson model proof of proposition 13 consider hs and g to be given as in 127 the energies of hs are e1 2 e2 2 and so the eigenvalues of ls are e 0 with multiplicities m m 1 and m0 2 the gap of ls is thus g 361 set ij i j c2 c2 we have p 21 ih21 p0 11 ih11 22 ih22 p 12 ih12 362 using 360 we find h i  g12 coth2 g 2 gu 2  g11 g22 2 r u dud 1 eu rs 2 dud u2 gu cothu2 pv  2 g12 rs 2 2 gu dud 1 eu rs 2 363 where r u is the dirac distribution acting on functions of the variable u r and pv denotes the principal value those distributions arise due to the identity u u0 i0 1 ir u u0 pv u u0 u0 r 364 the level shift operator is obtained from the expression on the right side of 363 by replacing p by p and changing the sign of the two real terms in see also theorem 11 of 26 it is automatic that 0 i0 for a selfadjoint 0 again by theorem 11 of 26 and an explicit calculation using 360 gives 365 0 i0 1 e2 2 z 2 e 0 g12 g 2 d 366 1 e s 2 note that the vector e2 1t is in the kernel of 0 the nonzero eigenvalue of 0 is thus its trace 2ig12 2 j coth2 expressed in terms of the spectral density 123 we thus obtain the following eigenvalues of the level shift operators 367  2ig12 2 j coth2 368  ig12 2 j coth2 ig11 g22 2 1 e 0 u2 gu cothu2 pv  21 g12 2 dud rs 2 2 gu g11 eu2 g22 2 pv dud 1 e rs 2 369 370 371 let us now estimate the parameters a 348351 in the remainder of this section we write a b to mean that a constb for a constant independent of a and independent of the inverse temperature we start with an estimate for a the nonzero imaginary of  parts of the eigenvalues and 0 are g12 j coth2g11 g22 1e 0 and 2g12 j coth2 respectively we have j 22p for 0 where p is the infrared parameter see  c for p 12 we 121 thus 1e  0 0 for p 12 and 1e 0 thus get for g12 6 0 and j 6 0 1a1 for t 1 1 372 now we estimate maxes ae maxa0 a 349 from the above analysis of a we know how to estimate a0 as well as the imaginary part of a they are 1 consider the the integral involving the principal value of u 1 the part of the integral coming from the domain u 2 is bounded 1 for 1 on the part where the distribution becomes singular u 2 we estimate the integral as follows we write it as 2 pv ju cothu2  2 coth2 pv cothu2 coth2 373 in the second integral on the right side of 373 the principal value distribution has become simply the function u 1 we use the mean value theorem cothu2 coth2 2 e  e2 2 374 for some between u and clearly 2 32 and so since 1 we have e2 e e2 e2 2 we conclude that 373 next we analyze the last integral in 369 to alleviate the analysis we shall assume that p 12 then the pv u1 is simply the function u1 and it follows readily that the integral has the upper bound 1 1 1 we conclude that for t 1 1 375 next we estimate the gap between the eigenvalues of the level shift operators 350 only 0 has to be taken into account since are onedimensional we have 1 a0 1 for t 1 1 376 finally we have see 351  1 377 since the eigenprojections of all the level shift operators are orthogonal in the case at hand we are now able to simplify the condition 126 using 372 376 and 377 we get recall that we do not estimate uniformly in g 1 min 1 a 2 378 next using 375 376 and 377 we get max 1 1 379 min 1 a 2 g 32 max 1 1 380  t 763 381 we combine 378 and 379 to obtain we conclude that 126 holds provided t 1 and this shows the bounds of proposition 12 it remains to calculate the davies generator k 128 its expression is given in the appendix of 27 this completes the proof of proposition 12 acknowledgements the author was
