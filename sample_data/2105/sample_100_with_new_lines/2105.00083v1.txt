abstract
we present a characterization of a small 9liter and mobile 01 6 lidoped pulseshapesensitive plastic scintillator antineutrino
detector called sandd segmented antineutrino directional detector constructed for the purpose of nearfield reactor monitoring with sensitivity to antineutrino direction sandd comprises three different types of module a detailed monte carlo
simulation code was developed to match and validate the performance of each of the three modules the combined model was then
used to produce a prediction of the performance of the entire detector analysis cuts were established to isolate antineutrino inverse
beta decay events while rejecting large fraction of backgrounds the neutron and positron detection efficiencies are estimated to be
348 and 802 respectively while the coincidence detection efficiency is estimated to be 717 resulting in inverse beta decay
detection efficiency of 20002stat21syst the predicted directional sensitivity of sandd produces an uncertainty
of 20 in the azimuthal direction per 100 detected antineutrino events

1 introduction
nuclear power reactors are the most intense manmade
sources of antineutrinos a 1gw thermal gwt nuclear reactor emits  1020 antineutrinos per second isotropically as
the composition of the reactor core evolves due to the consumption of 235 u and the production of 239 pu the antineutrino flux
and energy spectrum both evolve downwards 1 this makes
it possible in principle to monitor the onoff status and the
fuel evolution of the core over time antineutrinos have a very
low interaction cross section which makes their detection challenging the same property allows them to pass through large
amount of material unimpeded which makes them unshieldable the detection of antineutrinos presents opportunities for
nonintrusive realtime monitoring of the operational status of
nuclear reactors for safeguards which falls within purview of
the international atomic energy agency 2 3 additionally
shortbaseline measurements of reactor antineutrinos could offer valuable insights into the nature of the neutrino 4 5 6 7
the concept of continuous nonintrusive realtime monitoring of a reactor core using antineutrinos has been demonstrated
several times the concept was first demonstrated in the 1980s
at the rovno nuclear power plant in the soviet union 8 9 it
was followed by experiments at the bugey nuclear power plant
in france using 6 liloaded liquid scintillator 10 11 and in the

antineutrinos undergo the inverse beta decay ibd reaction

producing an mevscale positron that slows down and annihilates with an electron emitting two 0511mev gamma rays
the neutron thermalizes and can be detected via capture on nuclei with high thermal neutron capture cross sections usually

while the capabilities of antineutrino detectors for nuclear
safeguards have been demonstrated practicalities associated
with deployment need to improve 2 most shortbaseline detectors have been deployed below ground to suppress fast neutrons caused by the cosmic ray muons 1 9 thick hydrogenous shielding is required around the target material to further
reduce the fast neutron flux this increases the overall size
and complexity of the detector and limits the range of possible deployment locations to solve this issue contemporary
nearfield detectors employ segmented geometry and materials
capable of pulseshape discrimination to reject fast neutron induced backgrounds and to select the delayed coincidence events

that are confined both in time 200 s and space 1 m this
approach greatly suppresses the accidental coincidence and the
muogenic backgrounds allowing for aboveground deployment
for example prospect is an aboveground segmented 4ton
lidoped pulseshapesensitive liquidscintillator detector that
has demonstrated realtime monitoring of the 85mw highflux isotope reactor hfir at a 7m standoff 14
among the aforementioned detectors sandd fig 1 is the
only detector that uses pulseshapesensitive plastic homogeneously doped with 6 li 28 01wt in contrast to neutron
capture on 155 gd 157 gd or h which produces one or more
gamma rays that deposit their energies over a larger volume
neutron capture on 6 li produces an alpha and a triton which
deposit their energies over a short range hence the use of
li combined with the fine segmentation enables additional discrimination foragainst neutron captures via rod multiplicity
improving ibd coincidence identification and further suppressing the high rate of backgrounds near the surface the fine
lateral and azimuthal segmentation of the scintillator elements
also permits good spatial resolution a requirement for directional sensitivity antineutrino direction can be statistically reconstructed from the average displacement vector defined by
the positron and neutron capture locations 29 detectors such
as goesgen 30 31 palo verde 30 32 chooz 33 double
chooz 34 35 36 and more recently prospect 37 have
theoretically and experimentally studied their directional sensitivity to antineutrino flux so far double chooz reported
the lowest angular uncertainty of 43 from 100 detected ibd
events 36
the focus of this paper is a characterization of the full 9liter
sandd fig 2 it builds on earlier work 15 which characterized a prototype of the central module with shorter pulseshapesensitive rods and no 6 li doping the aim of the previous
work was to test a data acquisition system capable of recording
key performance metrics such as pulseshapeparameter psp
energy e zposition resolution and particle id via segment
multiplicity rm  the relevant performance metrics in this
work are similar but also include psp of the neutron capture on

the full 9liter sandd described here employs the same readout for the central module and a dualend readout of scintillator
bars with 1 photomultiplier tubes pmts for the outer modules

4064 cm bar are referred to as component 1 component 2 and component 3
respectively
all of the shortbaseline detectors described above employed
organic liquid scintillators some of these liquids can be chemically toxic volatile and flammable energy depositions in the
container holding the liquid may also not contribute to light
production and detection furthermore materials compatibility
with the liquid scintillator containment can be problematic and
support and retaining structures require careful engineering
to improve the safety characteristics and ease of deployment
several efforts to develop compact aboveground solid plastic
antineutrino detectors are underway current and proposed
nearfield detectors such as sandd 15 16 panda 17

segmented and employ pulseshapesensitive solid materials

were measured and compared separately to a geant4 simulation 38 39 henceforth we refer to each of these components
as component 1 component 2 and component 3 respectively
as described in table 1
the three different components of sandd are shown in
fig 2 and parameterized in table 1 analysis cuts were established to retain the majority of ibd events while removing
a large fraction of background events as a result antineutrino
detection efficiency and uncertainty in the direction of the reactor antineutrino flux are predicted by a tuned simulation

details of the composition and the fabrication of the 6 lidoped pulseshapesesitive plastic scintillator can be found in
ref 40 multiple solid scintillator sections were prepared
over an 8 months period some sections were machined for
the 64rod inner module while the others were machined into
the outer layer bars the rods were then optically coupled
to a pair of sipm arrays sensl j60035 series 5044 mm 
5044mm 41 using bc630 silicone optical grease as shown
in fig 2a the scintillator rods were supported by an 8  8
square plastic frame that was fitted to each sipm the frames
were used to maintain the alignment of each rod with its associated sipm pixels two additional 88 square plastic frames
were placed at onethird and twothirds of the length of the rods
to prevent them from sagging and contacting each other such
that the total internal reflection within each rod can be maintained the larger bars were wrapped with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tape polytemp pn16050 and each end was
optically coupled to a 1 hamamatsu r1924a100 pmt 42
using bc630 silicone optical grease as shown in fig 2b
the light sensors sipms or pmts mounted at either end of
each plastic scintillator will be referred to as light sensors a

the sipm and pmt operating voltages were set at 28 v and

thresholds were set to ensure data rates were not too high for
the daq  corresponding to an approximate energy threshold of 02 mevee and 01 mevee for the central module and
the large cross section bars respectively waveforms 1600 ns
were sent to disk as each digitizer buffer was filled the digitized waveforms were stored in root format 43 and then
processed by a series of standard root routines in the analysis individual channel timestamps were sorted into events consisting of waveforms within a 1 s event window energy depositions were required to trigger the light sensors on both ends

to measure the apparent attenuation length of the scintillator a series of collimated 137 cs measurements were taken at
regular intervals along the length of each component in each

to determine the range of acceptable surface roughness and
intrinsic attenuation length a series of 1d scans were performed over the range of sigma alpha values each scan yielded
a 2 plot over a range of intrinsicattenuationlength each plot
was then fitted with a seconddegree parabolic function to determine the intrinsic attenuation length parameter corresponding to the 2 minimum at that surface roughness for each such
minimum the range of acceptable intrinsic attenuation length
parameters were the ones that yielded a 2 value within 68
cl of the minimum value this generated a range of acceptable 2 values within 68 cl over a range of attenuation
length and sigma alpha values the minima of all the parabolic
fits were taken as the best fit values and the uncertainty was
given by the range of acceptable values the chosen sigma alpha and intrinsic attenuation length parameters are 012002
and 726103 cm respectively table 2
the simulation framework was also tuned in terms of light
yield of the scintillator and the coupling efficiency between the
light sensor and the scintillator by comparing the measured and

types of component apparent attenuation lengths of 182 cm
282 cm and 312 cm were measured for component 1 component 2 and component 3 respectively
in the geant4 simulation there are two parameters influence
the apparent attenuation length intrinsic attenuation length of
the plastic and the surface roughness of the plastic a simulation was performed to investigate the relative importance of
these two characteristics the surface roughness parameter was
modeled with the sigma alpha parameter in geant4 44 in the
large cross section bar simulations components 2 and 3 scintillator bars were wrapped with the teflon tape the unified
model was used with the teflon reflection type set to lambertian
distribution and scintillator reflection type set to specular lobe
distribution the sigma alpha parameter describes the degree
of non specular reflection at surface in terms of a gaussian distribution with a width of sigma alpha radians the simulation
placed a small air gap between the scintillator and the teflon
tape the refractive index of the scintillator was assumed to be
similar to polystyrene 16 in the range of 480680 nm the
shapes of the absorption and the emission spectra of the plastic
were taken from measurements 40
the comparisons to simulation in fig 3 were obtained by
simulating 477 kev electrons at the same positions as the data
with a 05cm position spread note that the energy corresponding to the compton continuum maximum of 662kev
137
cs gamma rays is 477 kev 45 the energy depositions produce optical photons that are propagated through the scintillator
material and arrive at the light sensors sipms or pmts the
hamamatsu pmt quantum efficiency 42 and the sensl sipm
photon detection efficiency 41 were then folded into the detector responses the charge responses from the simulation and
experiment were normalized to minimize the sum of the squares
of the differences between them as shown in fig 3
to determine the best combination of surface roughness and
intrinsic attenuation length independent 2 ndf maps were obtained for light sensors a and b and for different components small differences in bestfit surface roughness and intrinsic attenuation length were then resolved using the fisher
where e a is the charge collected at light sensor a e b is the
charge collected at the opposite light sensor b and e is proportional to the energy deposited in the target volume equation4 assumes that light transport within each rod or bar behaves exponentially figure 6 shows the measured backgroundsubtracted energy responses to a collimated 137 cs source the
energy resolution values of approximately 22 16 and 18
were observed at the compton continuum maximum of 662kev gamma rays for component 1 component 2 and component 3 respectively the measured energy responses were
then compared to the simulated ones within 0410 mevee
energy range to obtain 2 maps as shown in fig 5 a similar
optimization was performed to tune the scintillator light yield
and scintillatorlight sensor coupling efficiencies the two parameters are fully correlated and hence a strong correlation as
shown in the band of good fits extending from top left to down
right can be observed fig 5 since we cannot estimate the
two parameters independently we report the combined value
of both parameters as shown in table 2 an example comparison between the measured and simulated energy responses for
one of the best fits is shown in fig 6 the discrepancy below
04 mevee may be due to the lowenergy scattered gammaray
interactions in the target volume that are not captured by the
simulation for example the 662kev gamma rays may scatter
off the detectors surrounding materials and deposit their energy
in the target volume

we also tuned the birks parameter for the plastic scintillator in the simulation over a range of possible birks parameters
by comparing the measured response to 252 cf neutron captures
with the simulated response as shown in fig 10 in doing so
sigma alpha intrinsic attenuation length parameter coupling efficiency and light yield were fixed to values shown in table 2
the aforementioned method to determine the optimal simulation parameters and their associated uncertainties yielded the
accepted ranges of the birks constant as shown in table 2

in this section the selection of positron and neutron capture
candidates and the rejection of common backgrounds in the full
sandd consisting of a full assembly of components 1 2 and 3
fig 1 is discussed neutron capture and positron candidates
were selected by establishing cuts on the energy rod multiplicity and psp coincidence time window was then optimized to
select positronneutron pairs and to estimate the antineutrino
detection efficiency lastly directional capability of sandd is
discussed
in the simulation sandd was surrounded by a 15cmthick
polyethylene layer around the sides of the scintillator not the
top and bottom where the light sensors are mounted to reflect
neutrons back into the sensitive detector volume and increase
the neutron capture efficiency the polyethylene thickness was
constrained by the size of the dark box available the neutrons
and positrons that result from ibd interactions were independently simulated in sandd 1mev electrons were simulated
uniformly in the scintillator segments to convert the photon hits
into mevee a 02mevee trigger threshold was assumed

of the charge ratio was found to follow an s curve over the
length of each segment especially if the attenuation length was
small with respect to the length of the segment for apparent
attenuation lengths comparable to the length of the scintillator a linear profile was found to be an adequate approximation
the linear fit was used to obtain an estimate of the position of
each event along the segment and to convert the rab and sigma
of rab distribution of a collimated gammaray source into the
zposition residual and its associated uncertainty we did not
observe significant variation in the sigma of rab distribution of

the neutron capture efficiency in sandd was found to be
454 with 872 of the neutrons were captured by 6 li and
128 of the neutrons were capture by hydrogen the remaining neutrons either exited sandd 519 or were captured
by hydrogen in the polyethylene layer 27 the average neutron capture time was 372 s and the average distance travelled
by neutron was 7 cm the thickness of the polyethylene layer
largely affects the capture efficiency of the neutrons for example the neutron capture efficiency in sandd increases to

as 038071 mev 037061 mev and 035061 mev for
components 1 2 and 3 respectively these energy cuts correspond to a simulated 957 detection efficiency
neutron capture candidates were further required to have a
rod multiplicity equals to one neutron captures on 6 li produce alpha and triton particles with a total kinetic energy of
478 mev these particles have a short range and hence their
energy depositions are mostly contained within the same rod or
bar 15 among the neutron captures that pass the twosigma
energy cut 999 have rod multiplicity equal to one fig 14
for neutron capture candidates psp was also used to differentiate between different particles the psp cut to identify
neutron capture candidates was defined to reject background
gamma rays at the 99 level in the twosigma energy range
the experimental detection efficiency due to the psp cut was
determined from the 252 cf data as shown in fig 12 the resulting measured neutron capture efficiencies were 736 947
927 for components 1 2 and 3 respectively component
1 loses more lights due to the high aspect ratio disturbing its
psp performance in fig 12a the psp cut is not shown for the
average central module response since a different psp cut was
applied for every rod multiplying the volumeweighted detection efficiency due to the psp cut with the detection efficiencies
due to the energy cut and the rodmultiplicity cut the overall
ibdneutron detection efficiency was estimated to be 348
42 positron detection efficiency
positron candidates were required to deposit a minimum of
1 mevee and a maximum of 7 mevee summed over all the rods
and bars of sandd the minimum energy requirement was
chosen due to the poor pulseshape discrimination performance
below 1 mevee fig 8 an upper energy cut of 7 mevee was
chosen to exclude the cosmic muon background based on the
simulated energy response to ibd positrons the 17 mevee
energy requirement yielded a detection efficiency of 836
the psp requirement for positron candidates was established
using a 252 cf neutron source and setting the probability of
falsely identifying a fast neutron recoil as a positron at 1 as
shown in fig 13 the corresponding positron efficiencies due
to the psp cuts were 785 982 and 970 in the energy
range 1 mevee7 mevee for components 1 2 and 3 respectively multiplying the volumeweighted detection efficiency
due to the psp cut with the detection efficiencies due to the energy cut the ibd positron detection efficiency was estimated to
be 802

45 directionality
the determination of antineutrino direction via the ibd interaction in hydrogenous media requires a probabilistic approach
the positron carries most of the energy of the ibd interaction
while the neutron carries most of the momentum the ibd
positron promptly annihilates and hence its interaction position can be used as an estimate for the ibd interaction point
the neutron undergoes a random walk before it is captured
hence on an eventbyevent basis the neutron capture location
can vary considerably and many ibd events are required to reconstruct the direction on average a vector drawn from the
positron to the neutron capture position will point away from
the antineutrino source
in the simulation the direction of the antineutrino flux was
set to the sandd local positive x direction see fig 1 the
aforementioned analysis cuts were applied and the relative
positron and the thermalneutron capture positions were estimated the xy positions were estimated from the scintillator segment with the largest energy deposition the z position
was reconstructed based on the charge difference collected at
both light sensors the xyzprojections of the distribution of
the positronneutron vectors are shown in fig 16 projections
along the x y and z axes reveal an approximately gaussian
distribution of displacements with widths 41 mm 44 mm and
65 mm respectively and average displacements of 116 mm
009 mm and 008 mm the arrangement of the outermost
layer bars of sandd is asymmetric resulting in the observed
difference between the x and y distribution widths
figure 15 q analysis was applied to the measured background data and the
simulated timetocapture to obtain the best temporal cut used to isolate promptdelayed coincident events the average ibd neutron capture time was investigated via simulation and found to be 372 s the optimum coincidence time
cut was found to be 44 s
tral module where the aforementioned psp cuts energy cuts
and rodmultiplicity cuts were applied to the background data
to estimate the time distribution between a positronlike event
followed by a capturelike event as shown in fig 15 the optimum temporal cut is found to be 44 s resulting in the simulated delayed coincidence detection efficiency of 717
44 antineutrino detection efficiency
the antineutrino detection efficiency was calculated by multiplying the estimated neutron capture detection efficiency the
positron detection efficiency and the time coincidence efficiency table 3 the associated systematic uncertainties are
summarized in table 4 to estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the variation in the simulation parameters ibd simulations were repeated with the parameter uncertainties listed in
table 2 for each case we performed a simulation of 1mev
electrons uniformly distributed in the scintilator volume to convert the photon hits into mevee the aforementioned analysis

ibd events in comparison with the double chooz experiment 43 for 100 detected ibd events
to understand how the detector design affects the angular
uncertainty we performed simple geant4 simulations neglecting the detector response simulated detectors were a 2d array of 6 lidoped plastic segments with varying segment crosssections and distances between segments the simulated ibd
neutrons were emitted with positive x direction and uniformly
distributed in the detector volume perfect position reconstruction where neutron production and capture positions are precisely known was assumed this means the reconstructed xy
position uncertainties correspond only to the crosssection of
the segments note that in this simulation the detector geometry and the random walk of neutrons are the only factors
affecting the directional performance figure 18a shows perfectly reconstructed angular uncertainties for 100 ibd neutron
capture events with varying segment crosssection and constant
distance between segments at 06 mm figure 18b shows the
response with varying distance between segments and constant
segment crosssection at 1 an increase in the distance between the segments results in a larger reconstructed angular uncertainty however when the distance between the segments
approaches the crosssection of the segments this effect becomes less significant a decrease in the crosssection of the
segments results in a smaller reconstructed angular uncertainty
however such improvement is less significant when the segment crosssection is less than the average 2d neutron capture
distance 72 cm average capture distance in 3d space corre
the reconstructed azimuthal angle was close to zero since the
direction of antineutrinos was set to the local positive x the associated uncertainty  was calculated based on the average
neutron displacement l and position resolution p we calculated the average displacement as the root sum squared of the
means of the xyprojections yielding a value of 116 mm we
calculated the position resolution as the average of the standard
deviations of the xyprojections yielding a value of 42 mm
the 1sigma uncertainty for 100 detected ibd event was estimated as

one could obtain similar results by repeating the calculation
using the sum of 100 vectors figure 17 shows the xyzprojections of the sum of 100 vectors the estimated average displacement and the position resolution were 1154 mm
and 423 mm yielding azimuthal angle and 1sigma uncertainty
of 04 and 20  respectively sandd is therefore predicted
to have a better directional resolution 20 for 100 detected

cosmic neutrons are expected to be the most dominant background aboveground 37 they could create an ibdlike signal
from a proton recoil followed by neutron capture the satoniita cosmic neutron spectrum 47 was used to sample the energy of cosmic neutrons we used a cos3  48 angular distribution with respect to the positive y axis to sample the direction
of the cosmic neutrons since sandd will be deployed with its
xz plane parallel to the ground in the simulation the sandd
was surrounded on all sides with a 30 cmthick polyethylene
fast neutron shield the inner 1 consisted of borated polyethylene to capture the incoming neutrons once thermalized the
estimated cosmic neutroninduced background detection rate
was 29day suggesting that sb  1 may be achievable if
sandd were to be deployed at a hypothetical 85 mwth reactor 7 m from the core predicted signal rate is 26day for
such an sb level the estimated azimuthal angle and the associated 1sigma uncertainty for 100 detected ibd events are
31 and 31  respectively this suggests that the background
must be wellcharacterized to estimate the antineutrino direction properly assuming that the background would be measurable to the same accuracy as the signal during reactoroff
periods and the polyethylene shielding could reduce the rate of
neutrons originating from the reactor to a negligible level during the reactoron periods one can estimate the antineutrino
direction by subtracting the reactoroff data from the reactoron
data note that we ignored background contribution from antineutrinos produced by the world rectors neutrons produced
by untagged muons and accidental coincidences of two uncorrelated signals in our current background rate estimation a
more detailed study is needed to estimate the sandd background level properly

5 conclusion
sandd is a directional antineutrino detector that could potentially operate aboveground the fine segmentation and the
pulseshape discrimination capability of sandd allows the
promptdelayed coincidence to be discriminated against the
cosmic background components of sandd were characterized and a detailed monte carlo simulation code was developed
and tuned to investigate the performance of sandd analysis cuts were developed to strike a balance between the antineutrino detection efficiency and the particle misclassification
probability the coincidence detection efficiency was estimated
to be 717 and the neutron and positron detection efficiencies were estimated to be 348 and 802 respectively resulting in antineutrino detection efficiency of 20 uncertainty
of 20 in the azimuthal direction was predicted for 100 detected antineutrino events for comparison double chooz
experiment observes 43 angular uncertainty for 100 detected
ibd events 36measurement of the direction of incoming antineutrinos could be useful for determining supernova direction
detecting geoneutrinos that could lead to better understanding
of the earths interior and its formation mechanism 49 improving the oscillation sensitivity for reactor antineutrino experiments and disambiguating antineutrinos emitted by multiple reactor cores in the vicinity of the detector
sponds to 58 cm capture distance when projected onto xyplane suggesting that the neutron scattering plays a dominant role in determining the width of the distributions shown in
fig 16 when we performed full simulation with the detector
response considered a detector consisting entirely of a 66 array of component 2 bars 93 l detector volume with 06 mm
air gaps between the bars is predicted to yield an angular uncertainty of 18 for 100 detected ibd events such predicted
angular uncertainty is smaller than that estimated for the current sandd design 20 for 100 detected ibd events which
employs several larger bars and air gaps between the three different components however the current sandd design 9 l
detector volume was chosen to provide an opportunity to investigate the particle id performance of component 1 while retaining a good directionality and maintaining a reasonable electronics cost for a similar detector volume the investigation of the
component 1 performance was important to study background
suppression techniques via rod multiplicity
46 background estimation
we performed a cosmic neutron simulation to estimate the
impact of background on the sandd directional performance
while sandd shows the promise for mobility and good directional and detection performance this design also has several limitations for instance sandd uses a statistical approach to reconstruct the direction of antineutrino flux which
could fail in the presence of overwhelming background an
eventbyevent directional reconstruction method using ibd
has been proposed by safdi and suerfu 50 where the detector volume is segmented into alternating target and capture
layers with the former made sufficiently thin for neutrons to escape 50 rearrangement of sandd components could potentially allow for such technique to be used another limitation
is our planned active volume 9 liters that may not allow for
measurement beyond reactor onoff detection to monitor the
core inventory of a 20200 mwth plutonium production reactor a tonscale detector is required 51 52 to obtain reasonable
statistics in the measured antineutrino spectrum to increase
sandd active volume while maintaining a reasonable cost of
light sensors cross section of sandd plastic can potentially
be made as large as the 2d average distance travelled by the
ibd neutrons 58 cm further study is needed to understand
the tradeoff between the antineutrino detection rate and the directional performance
future works include study of the cosmic background and
the feasibility study of sandd aboveground deployment detector performance using different detector material such as
wavelengthshifting plastic wrapped in 6 liloaded zns scintillator may be studied the use of fasttiming daq to improve
the zposition resolution and particle identification may be explored as well
