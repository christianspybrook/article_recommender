astronomical transients events realtime detection data reduction time
in the last years the need for automated realtime detection and classification of astronomical
transients began to be more impelling better technologies involve a higher number of detected
candidates and an automated classification will allow dealing with this amount of data every night
the desired stateoftheart in detection and classification will be presented in its key features and
different practical approaches will be introduced as well several ongoing and future surveys will
be presented showing the current situation of timedomain astronomy and eventually compared
with the desired stateoftheart the final purpose of this paper is to highlight the general
technology readiness level with respect to the level yet to be achieved
domain astronomy
1 introduction
1609 the astronomers were finally able to better
the modern study of astronomical transient events
approach these events
started within the 800 although such kind of
improvements in optics and the space age led to an
phenomena was already known especially in the
extraordinary increase in the number of detections per
form of supernovae among the most famous events
night up to hundreds of transients in the current
in this sense are sn1572 observed by tycho brahe in
period and thanks to the constantly improving
the cassiopeia constellation and sn1604 the last
technology the number of transients detected per
known supernova exploded inside the milky way
night is estimated to rise to millions 1
and studied by johannes kepler in 1604 with the
astronomical transient events are one of the most
birth of the telescope owed to galileo galilei in

frbs appear to be point sourcelike and are
as introduced before an automated realtime
characterized by a wide range of radio frequencies
approach in detecting and classifying transients is
usually around 1400 mhz though some were
highly desirable given the rate at which the
detected at frequencies in the range of 400800 mhz
detections per night are raising
la revue gestion et organisation 00 2014 000000
a fully automated realtime classification of those
the most representative of this topic since the authors
events is desirable for two reasons first the need of
repeatedly insist on it
collecting and processing a huge amount of data
second the need to discerning what events deserve a
realtime since transients are usually characterized
proper followup for further characterization respect
by a very short duration a human manual
the ones that do not
interevent might not be fast enough to ensure proper
a second point derives from the fact that all transients
changing their magnitude might represent a wide
class of phenomena the reason why it is important to
automatically decide what events are worthy of
further investigation which implies time and costs
allocation another important problem is represented
by the typology of the data sometimes heterogeneous
and incomplete and usually evolving in time 26
classification and prioritization as well as the
activation of a proper followup for an event initially
unknown of which we also do not know the duration
until it runs out realtime action is of course an
ideal concept but the practical target is to close the
distance between real and ideal case as much as
possible until we reach a state of the art in which the
system is capable of reacting in a matter of fractions
of seconds
most of the characterizing information is derived
from archival resources and contextualization of other
reliability the more a system is a complex the
features of the candidate transient such as its location
higher is the probability of errors and malfunctions
in the host galaxy in this case becomes vital that the
mostly determined by the failure of its weakest
automated pipeline can discern between noise and
element such eventuality must be mitigated at
artifacts and real events so as not to miss any
maximum to develop a system with a low failure rate
important candidate such pipeline must have a low
rate of false alarm and high completeness also taking
robustness transients belong to a world of the
advantage of archives with data from previous
unknown inputs might be very different from
known events 27
expected ones and the system must be able to cope
with situations that deviate even much from
31 data reduction pipeline key features
accounted ones
an ideal system should be able to respect severe
low rate of false positives incoming data are
requirements listed hereafter and based on 26
known to be sparse and heterogeneous yet
automation the system must be able to process
gigabytes of data every night and yet allow minimal
human intervention the concept of automated
classification and decisionmaking is probably one of
detections are bound to be contaminated by artifacts
andor already known sources the system must apply
the first filter to discard unwanted inputs and reduce
false positives as much as possible
la revue gestion et organisation 00 2014 000000
learning a system able to act in realtime should be
along with archival and contextual information one
also able to constantly improve its performance by
above all the spatial location of a given event as
learning over time this goal can be achieved by
mentioned before these two inputs are directed to an
creating a proper archive with data from past surveys
intermediary event portfolio which modifies time by
and other ongoing projects
time all the data regarding a particular class of
followup after the event is detected little of it is
probably known except basic information such as the
light curve in this phase providing that the event is
considered interesting enough the followup is
supposed to take over and the system would trigger it
in full autonomy the followup photometric
spectroscopic multiwavelength is intended to enrich
what is known of the source and by observing key
transients after this first step is the event
classification engine which compares the fresh data
with inputs from a library that gives back a set of
probabilities that a given feature manifests provided
that the event belongs to a given class of transients
the final result obtained from the classification
engine is a set of evolving probabilities of the
candidate transient belonging to various classes the
treated data are now ready to be fed in the followup

regression 23 used for an automatic classification
algorithm is a valuable tool to gain useful
information from the lc of the candidate in
particular data of interest to be derived are galactic
latitude the color of the object in the ri band
proximity to other objects and so on
another possibility is presented as an lcbased
approach mahabal and colleagues propose to collect
lcs for several objects belonging to a known class
and building a probability density function pdf to
represent its probabilistic structure this way not only
to better understand the purpose of classifiers
mahabal et al propose a supernova event as an
example an exploding star can undergo this process
only once in its life and a transient candidate with a
light curve showing a previous activity before the
main event could indeed not be a supernova
different bits of information called into question
different classifiers and even more than one classifier
is liable to be used in the same filtering step 24 the
possibility of combining more than one classifier at
the same time is presented as a nontrivial possibility
however still under development

become more insistent as new surveys will come
however it is highlighted that the data streams from
crts were on the other hand actively used as a test
to experiment with new solutions toward an
automated data reduction pipeline
describing the data reduction more deeply can be
firstly outlined the use of the sextractor photometry
software by the catalina sky survey telescopes
css in arizona 32 33 transients are identified
by comparing the fresh images with source catalogs
in order to exclude artifacts and thus false positives
the objects taken from the catalogs are coadded
images resulting from the median combination of not
less than 20 other images
another way the crts adopts to find transients is the
launched in april 2018 atop of a falcon 9 tess is
a space telescope devised to reveal the presence of
exoplanets by the transit method according to 34
its primary duty is to explore a sky area 400 times
greater than keplers monitoring about 200000
main sequence dwarf stars waiting to detect drops in
luminosity
tess will observe the southern and northern
hemispheres 1 year each dividing each of them into
13 sectors partially overlapped to ensure the presence
of constantly monitored regions at the ecliptic poles
continuous viewing zone or cvz
these 26 sectors will allow tess to keep an eye on
about 90 of the sky with a temporal cadence of 2

special targets are observed the scheduler returns to

the scheduler works together with the survey system
a strength of the project consists in taking advantage
to give a new target each time there is the necessity of
of prolonged periods of dark during which it is

predominant not to mention that the whole
photometry would also be interesting to be carried out
processing may take minutes as well as hours near
in both surveys providing that the flux measured by
realtime processing is supposed to take not more
one is obtained thanks to the aperture of a source
than a fistful of minutes on the other hand the open

data philosophy allows several teams to work in
another strength of this proposal lies in the euclid
parallel at the same time and guarantee an efficient
wide survey which can be carried out only with a
transient detection over a potentially short period in
single visit at the time for transient detection this is
this sense is clear how automation is given a lower
not the best approach and yet transients remain
priority
objects of interest for euclid but euclid could
provide additional data to the lsst survey such as
spectroscopic redshifts by nisp for a fraction of iatype sne detected by lsst itself this would be for
example a way to improve the elimination of
systematic biases when using photometric redshifts
alone
19 discussion
after presenting the desired state of the art and some
of the most active and famous surveys we finally
arrive at the necessity of comparing those two
realities before starting the comparison the authors
of this paper want to highlight that in many cases all
the information necessary to expose a given survey
was available only thanks to those who are actively
involved in the surveys themselves for this reason
transiting exoplanet survey satellite tess brings
keplers performance to a new level and
introduces a new dimension of automation in
exoplanets survey being able to orchestrate a
complex data pipeline this is of course made
possible by a strong union between inflight and onground operations
antarctic survey telescopes this is a particularly
noteworthy survey in which the necessity for
automation in an isolated infrequently crowded
facility led to an interesting product prolonged
periods of dark are exploited at best with a fully
automatic telescope and related pipeline from the
survey
scheduling
the
final
product
unfortunately no data were found about the response
time in case of a sudden fast event
the typical spirit of an article review will manifest in
lsst the lsst is the spearhead of its kind its level
this section
1 data products are generated within 60 seconds from
for the sake of readability and order the comparison
the event itself and in this case alerts are included as
will be carried out by survey
well the automatic operations carried out by the data
catalina realtime sky survey the effort in this
pipeline are associated with a further level of analysis
survey is largely based on previous ones see
that can be carried out by human teams to further
palomarquest and the human component is still
filtering or reconsidering the created data products

also yearly data releases will allow recovering
automatically detected candidates and confirmed
missed events even though no alarm is triggered due
candidates which highlights the limits of this survey
to for example faint events this thick net of data
zwicky transient facility the presence of the
processing represents a promising tool for future
robotic observing software allows long surveys
surveys for which the lsst will be a precursor
fully conducted in automatic no human intervention
panstarrs this survey is characterized by a
highly automatic data pipeline strongly orientated to
public
diffusion
the
data
product
data
reprocessing already seen in the lsst is also
important for ensuring not to miss any transient
candidate not promptly recognised at the right time it
is needed except for monitoring and parameters
modification its autonomy in terms of storage is also
praiseworthy and allows the facility to function in
isolation for up to 2 weeks its nearrealtime
response capability is to be considered one of the
highest levels in the currently ongoing surveys
is however clear that the panstarrs still relies on
sardinia radio telescope the existence of different
a high presence of manwork but it is also clear that
pipelines optimized for specific observations is
is capable of keeping up with other similar surveys
indeed intriguing also the versatility of the
with a response time below the minute the pan
telescope allows it to operate in several fields but
starrs is thus a near realtime facility with a
unfortunately little material was found about any
right but a millisecondsresponse is still far from the
connection with the scientific community
current level
agile a strength of agile that stands out is the
spitzer space telescope along with the more
response of 2 minutes for grb alerts the scientific
famous hubble space telescope the compton
community will benefit from an important service
gammaray and chandra spitzer is one of the four
being able to promptly steer ongoing surveys on the
nasas great observatories an important problem
gamma source in a very reduced time also the
comes to attention the high rate of falsepositive and
capability of conducting x and gammaray surveys
the necessity of multiple detections of the same object
at the same time is not a common feature and it
which of course affects the realtime response
represents an important tool to make exciting science
capability of the observatory it also requires a
manual visual check of the images to rule out false
positives so that the pipeline still needs a human
step to complete its data processing and production
within one day from public data release human
teams are indeed vital to rule out false candidates
leading to an almost 1100 proportion between
rotse as well as the antarctic survey telescopes
rotse combines a fully automatic response to
sudden events with fast data processing which
happens in a matter of minutes the inheritance from
rotsei helped to create a good example of fastresponse transient detection and classification survey

james webb space telescope as hubbles
its potential coupling with the lsst seems also to be
successor james webb will be almost fully dedicated
the perfect receipt for a prolific science program
to the scientific community several teams will be
able to benefit from its great capabilities and a large
20 conclusions
number of papers and contributions in general is
bound to see the light from the early years the study
in this paper a review mapping of the stateoftheart
of rocky exoplanet atmospheres will probably be one
of timedomain astronomy surveys both on the
of the most important contributions of the telescope
ground and in orbit is proposed astronomical
it would have been interesting to characterize the
transient events were introduced listing some of the
expected response time of the telescope in case of fast
most representative and wellknown types based on
transient but no information was found about this
the literature available it was also showed what are
point
the desirable features of the ideal realtime detection
and classification system and those that could be the
very large array despite its longevity the vla is
most indicated approaches to the problem
still able to deliver valuable science to the
in the second instance several surveys were
community in particular the realfast pipeline would
presented to outline the respective data reduction
allow fast response and a fast datasharing with the
pipelines in their main features
community as well as other younger surveys
finally a comparison between the presented surveys
wfirst and euclid those two telescopes have
yet to demonstrate their capabilities on a mission and
to little was found about their data processing
and the expected level for the state of the art was
made to show the gap if any between the current
level and the desirable one it is eventually clear that
the human component is still dominant in the majority
wfirst showed a preliminary high accuracy in
of the pipelines since no system cannot be separated
creating final data products and this will probably
from proper monitoring on the other hand several
ensure a low rate of falsepositive without any further
promising surveys such as the lsst and the zwicky
human intervention
transient
euclid on the other hand shows an interesting
concerning the previous generation of and it is
concept in which characterized by parallel functions
reasonable to expect even more automated systems
working at the same time on different features of the
for the times to come another challenge will be
acquired raw data this will probably ensure fast
closing the distance between the current nearreal
processing and data production for the scientific
time capability and realtime capability milliseconds
