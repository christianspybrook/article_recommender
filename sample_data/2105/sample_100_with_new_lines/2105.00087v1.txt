1 introduction
the guojacquet trace formula 15 is a promising tool to generalise waldspurgers result 32 on the
relation between toric periods and central values of automorphic lfunctions for gl2 to higher ranks
it is inspired by jacquets new proof 19 of waldspurgers theorem although such a formula has not
been established in full generality its simple form was used by feigonmartinwhitehouse 14 to obtain
some evidence for the conjecture of guojacquet for applications one needs to compare geometric sides
of guojacquet trace formulae for different symmetric pairs some local results on the comparison of
relative orbital integrals include guos fundamental lemma 15 and zhangs smooth transfer 37
in order to study the guojacquet trace formula and its comparison one may begin with an infinitesimal variant that is to say we replace a symmetric space by its tangent space called an infinitesimal
symmetric space such a variant should share some similarities with the geometric side of guojacquet
trace formula it is simpler than the original formula because spectral objects are replaced by the
fourier transform of geometric objects cf 33 and 8 moreover by the method of descent dating
back to harishchandras works the comparison at the infinitesimal level should imply the comparison
of geometric sides of original formulae see 37 on the transfer of orbital integrals
an infinitesimal variant of guojacquet trace formulae has been established in 25 and 26 via an
analogue of arthurs truncation process in 2 see also 8 for its lie algebra variant we actually consider
more general cases suggested by 36 and 28 most namely regular semisimple terms appearing in
these formulae can be written as explicit weighted orbital integrals on infinitesimal symmetric spaces
over a number field see 25 theorem 92 and 26 theorem 92 they are noninvariant analogues of
ordinary orbital integrals which can be compared locally thanks to 15 and 37 and should be the next
date may 4 2021
objects to be compared as the first evidence the weighted fundamental lemma has been proved in 26
theorem 109 thanks to labesses work 23 on the base change for gln 
the same philosophy of waldspurgers work 34 on the endoscopic transfer has been followed by
zhang 37 to prove the transfer of local orbital integrals on infinitesimal symmetric spaces of guojacquet a simple form of the local trace formula 37 lemma 65 howes finiteness for orbital integrals
29 theorem 61 and representability of the fourier transform of orbital integrals 37 theorem 61
apart from a simple form of the global trace formula 37 theorem 84 and p 1875 and the fundamental
lemma 37 lemma 518 at the infinitesimal level have been used in zhangs proof it is expected that
such a strategy should be extended to the weighted context in fact some successful attempts have
been made by chaudouard in 9 and 10 on the stable base change we would like to follow these
ideas in the comparison of local weighted orbital integrals on infinitesimal symmetric spaces of guojacquet however further study in noninvariant local harmonic analysis on infinitesimal symmetric
spaces is needed to achieve our goal this paper aims to prepare some essential ingredients such as a
noninvariant local trace formula howes finiteness for weighted orbital integrals representability of the
fourier transform of weighted orbital integrals and an invariant local trace formula our methods are
mainly inspired by the works of waldspurgers 33 and arthurs 5
let ef be a quadratic field extension of nonarchimedean local fields of characteristic zero denote
by d a central division algebra over f and by glnd the reductive group over f whose f points are
gln d we study two generalised cases of guojacquet trace formulae the first case is g h
where g  gl2nd and h  glnd  glnd denotes its diagonal subgroup by diagonal embedding
denote by s the tangent space of the symmetric space gh at the neutral element on which h acts by
conjugation the second case is g  h   where g is the group of invertible elements in a central simple
algebra g over f containing e and h  is the centraliser of e  in g  denote by s the corresponding
infinitesimal symmetric space notice that g h and g  h   are the same symmetric pair after a base
change to an algebraic closure of f containing e in the rest of the introduction and this paper we shall
focus on results in the first case and provide complete proofs the second case is similar in statements
and proofs so we shall only state main results point out additional ingredients and sketch necessary
steps for later use
before explaining the main results of this paper we introduce some necessary notations let  be the
quadratic character of f  n e  attached to ef  where n is the norm map e   f   for x  gf 
we denote by nrdx its reduced norm let cc sf  be the space of locally constant compactly
supported complexvalued functions on sf  denote by srs  s the zariski open subset consisting of
regular semisimple elements see section 31 let m0 be the group of diagonal elements in g which
is a common minimal
levi
 subgroup of g and h a levi subgroup of g containing m0 is said to be
0 1n
stable if  
 m  denote by l g m0  the set of stable levi subgroups of g suppose
1n 0
that m  l g m0  write m  liem  and mh  m  h let am be the maximal f split torus in
the centre of m  denote by f g m  the set of parabolic subgroups of g containing m  this paper is
organised in the following way
in section 2 we fix some notations of local harmonic analysis and recall some facts of arthurs g m families most of which can be found in 33 iii in particular for m  l g m0  and q  f g m 
we define the local weight function vm
on gf  of main interest by 261
in section 3 we prepare some properties of infinitesimal symmetric spaces some of them are stated
for a general symmetric pair and most of them are relative avatars of classical works of harishchandra
17 preliminaries on symmetric pairs can be found in 29 and 1
in section 4 we define local weighted orbital integrals for the action of hf  on sf  and study their
properties let m  l g m0  and q  f g m  for all f  cc sf  and x  m  srs f  we
define
f adx1 xnrdxvm
xdx
 x f   ds xf
hx f hf 
where ds xf is the weyl discriminant factor see 311 and hx denotes the centraliser of x in
h the distributions jm
 x  on sf  are local analogues of the global weighted orbital integrals
obtained in 25 theorem 92
in section 5 we establish the noninvariant local trace formula for f  cc sf  we define its
fourier transform f by 321 for m  l g m0  let tell m  s be a set of representatives for
mh f conjugacy classes of m elliptic cartan subspaces in ms see section 32 for f f   cc sf 
we define
j g  f f   
ml g m0 
w0mn w0gln 1 1dimam ag 
ctell ms
w mh  c1
csrs f 
 x f f  dx
where w0mn  w0gln and w mh  c are certain weyl groups see section 32 and jm
 x f f   is
defined by 511
theorem 11 see theorems 53 and 512 for all f f   cc sf  we have the equality
j g  f f   j g  f f  
this formula results from the plancherel formula and an analogue of arthurs truncation process in
5 we cannot deduce it via the exponential map as in 33 v for lack of a local trace formula for
symmetric spaces one needs to return to the proof of 5 instead
in section 6 we show howes finiteness for weighted orbital integrals on sf  for r  sf  an open
compact subgroup denote by cc sf r the subspace of cc sf  consisting of the functions invariant
by translation of r
proposition 12 see corollaries 66 and 69 let r be an open compact subgroup of sf  m 
l g m0  and   m  srs f  suppose that there exists a compact subset 0  m  sf  such
that   admh f 0  then there exists a finite subset xi  i  i   and a finite subset
fi  i  i  cc sf r such that for all x   and all f  cc sf r we have the equality
 x f  
 xi  f jm
 x fi 
the proof originates from howes seminal work 18 which is extended to weighted orbital integrals
on lie algebras by waldspurger we modify the argument in 33 iv to make it apply to our case
in section 7 we show that the fourier transform of weighted orbital integrals on sf  is represented
by locally integrable functions on sf 
proposition 13 see propositions 72 and 710 let m  l g m0  and x  m  srs f  then
there exists a locally constant function m
 x  on srs f  such that for all f  cc sf  we have
f y m
 x y ds y f dy
 x f 
sf 
its proof is similar to that in 33 v and makes use of the noninvariant trace formula and howes
finiteness for weighted orbital integrals
 x 
in section 8 we modify weighted orbital integrals to obtain nrdinvariant distributions im
on sf  by 811 and 817 where m  l
m0  and x  m  srs f  the method is close to
arthurs standard one but it is simpler here since there is no spectral object involved which is also a
feature of 33 by the above proposition and the construction via induction there also exists a locally
constant function g
m  x  on srs f  such that for all f  cc sf  we have
f y g
 x f 
m  x y d y f
sf 
in section 9 we establish the invariant local trace formula for f f   cc sf  we define
gln 1

csrs f 
 x fig
 x f  dx
theorem 14 see theorems 91 and 94 for all f f   cc sf  we have the equality
i g  f f    i g  f   f 
this formula is deduced from the noninvariant local trace formula we mainly consult 33 vii for
the proof
in section 10 we prove a vanishing property at infinity of the function g
m   y  on m  srs f 
where m  l g m0  m 6 g and y  srs f  denote by vf  the valuation on f 
proposition 15 see propositions 101 and 104 let m  l g m0  m 6 g let x  m  srs f 
and y  srs f  then there exists n  n such that if   f  satisfies vf   n  we have
m  x y   0
it is an analogue of 9 proposition 22 and serves as a complement of the limit formula for the function
 y  on srs f  in 37 proposition 71 where y  srs f  in a subsequent paper we shall prove
some relations between the functions g
m and their analogues for the case of g  h  which are related to
the comparison of guojacquet trace formulae at the infinitesimal level the above vanishing property
will be used to construct some nice test functions whose fourier transforms have vanishing nontrivial
weighted orbital integrals
in the end we remark that although we concentrate on the case of guojacquet here many results
in this paper might be extended to other symmetric pairs which can be seen from their proofs

2 notation and preliminaries
21 fields let f be a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero denote by   f resp vf 
the normalised absolute value resp the valuation on f and by of the ring of integers of f  fix a
uniformiser  of of  let q be the cardinality of the residue field of of 
22 groups and the map hp  let g be a connected reductive group defined over f  all algebraic
groups and algebraic varieties in this article are assumed to be defined over f until further notice fix
a levi subgroup m0 of a minimal parabolic subgroup of g
denote by ag the maximal f split torus in the centre of g define
ag  homz xgf  r
where xgf is the group of f rational characters of g define the homomorphism hg  gf   ag
hhg x i  logxf 
for all x  gf  and   xgf  set agf  hg gf  which is a lattice in ag 
fix a maximal compact subgroup k  kg of gf  which is admissible relative to m0 in the sense
of 3 p 9 in other words k is the stabiliser in gf  of a special point in the apartment associated
to am0 of the bruhattits building of g for a central division algebra d over f  we denote by glnd
the reductive group over f whose f points are gln d in this paper when g  resef glnd with
d being a central division algebra over a finite extension e of f  we choose m0  resef gmd n to
be the subgroup of diagonal elements in g and k  gln od  with od being the ring of integers of
d see 35 p 191 for example set w0g  normgf  m0 m0 f  to be the weyl group of g m0 
where normgf  m0  denotes the normaliser of m0 in gf  it is known that any element in w0g admits
a representative in k
by a levi subgroup of g we mean a group m containing m0 which is the levi component of some
parabolic subgroup of g for such a group m  set km  m f   k then the triplet m km  m0 
satisfies the same hypotheses as g k m0  denote by f g m  p g m  and l g m  the set of
parabolic subgroups of g containing m  parabolic subgroups of g with levi factor m and levi subgroups
of g containing m respectively
for p  f g m0  let mp be the levi component containing m0 and np the unipotent radical denote
ap  amp and ap  amp whose dual rlinear space is denoted by ap  define a map hp  gf   amp
hp mnk  hmp m
for all m  mp f  n  np f  and k  k let p  p g mp  be the parabolic subgroup opposite to p 
for p  q a pair of parabolic subgroups in f g m0  the restriction xmq f  xmp f induces
a pair of dual maps ap  aq and aq  ap  let aq
p be the kernel of the former map ap  aq  set p
to be the set of simple roots for the action of ap on p  mq  denote by q
p  the set of coroots as
in 6 p 26 then p  is a basis of the rlinear space ap 
23 heights we fix a height function k  k  gf   r as in 5 4 it satisfies the following properties
1 kxk  1 x  gf 
2 kxyk  kxkkyk x y  gf 
3 there exist constants c  0 and n  n such that kx1 k  ckxkn  x  gf 
if p  f g m0  for any x  gf  we can choose mp x  mp f  np x  np f  and kp x  k
such that x  mp xnp xkp x then
4 there exist constants c  0 and n  n such that kmp xk  knp xk  ckxkn  x  gf 
we also fix a euclidean norm still denoted by k  k on the rlinear space am0 which is invariant
under the action of w0g on am0  then
5 there exist c1  c2  0 such that
c1 1  log kyk  1  khm0 yk  c2 1  log kyk y  m0 f 
in addition we require that k  k is a norm on gf  in the sense of 22 182 this is possible for
example for g  gln  by writing g g 1   gij  hij 1ijn  one may define kgk  supgij f  hij f 
for g  gf  since gij  hij 1ijn is a set of generators for the ring of regular functions of g viewed
as an affine variety over f  this defines a norm in the sense of 22 182 on gln f  for general g
one can choose an closed embedding g  gln over f and define the norm on gf  by the pullback
of the norm on gln f  by 22 proposition 1812 this defines a norm in the sense of 22 182 on
gf 
24 functions and distributions let g  lieg more generally we shall use a minuscule fraktur
letter to denote the lie algebra of its corresponding algebraic group denote by ad the adjoint action
of g on itself or g the adjoint action of g on itself is denoted by ad
for a locally compact and totally disconnected topological space x eg gf  or gf  denote
by cc x the space of locally constant compactly supported complexvalued functions on x for
f  cc x denote by suppf  its support denote by cc x the space of distributions on x ie the
linear dual of cc x
suppose that there is a left action of gf  on such an x then gf  acts on cc x or more
generally the space of complex functions on x from the left by
g  f x  f g 1  x g  gf  f  cc x x  x
moreover gf  acts on cc x from the left by
g  df   dg 1  f  g  gf  d  cc x  f  cc x
let   gf   c be a locally constant character we say a function f  cc x resp a distribution
d  cc x  is invariant if g  f  gf resp g  d  gd for all g  gf  for trivial  we simply
say that such a function resp distribution is invariant
25 haar measures fix the haar measure on k such that volk  1 following 33 i4 for all
p  f g m0  we fix a haar measure on np f  such that
exp2p hp ndn  1
np f 
where p is the half of the sum of roots with multiplicity associated to the parabolic subgroup p
opposite to p  from 5 p 12 for all m  l g m0  there are compatible haar measures on gf  and
m f  such that for all p  p g m  and f  cc gf  we have
f mnkdkdndm
f xdx 
gf 
mf np f k
we shall fix such measures
for a f split torus t  we choose the haar measure on t f  such that the maximal compact subgroup
of t f  is of volume 1 for a general torus t  we choose the haar measure on t such that the induced
measure on t f at f  satisfies volt f at f   1
notice that if m0 is a torus we have associated to it two measures however it will be clear which
one should be used according to the context
fix open neighbourhoods vg of 0 in gf  and vg of 1 in gf  such that the exponential map
exp  vg  vg induces a homeomorphism between them choose the unique haar measure on gf 
such that exp preserves the measures similarly we obtain haar measures on f points of lie algebras
of algebraic subgroups of g
from the fixed euclidean norm k  k on am0  we deduce measures on am0 and its subspaces
26 g m families following 3 p 15 we define

where zq
p  denotes the lattice in ap generated by p  
suppose that m  l g m0  and that q  f g m  let cp p p g m be a g m family in the
sense of 3 p 36 by 3 lemma 62 we can define
cp pq 1

we sometimes write cm  cg

an important example is following according to 3 p 4041 for x  gf 
vp  x  ehp x    iam  p  p g m 
is a g m family denoted by vp xp p g m  then we obtain a function

for a smooth function cp  on iap  we can associate to it a smooth function cp  on iap as in
3 63 in 6 denote by cp the value of cp  at   0 let cp p p g m and dp p p g m be
two g m families we define their product cdp p p g m in the obvious way and have the following

3 symmetric pairs
31 general cases following 1 definition 711 by a symmetric pair we mean a triple g h 
where h  g are a pair of reductive groups and  is an involution on g such that h is the subgroup of
fixed points of 
suppose that g h  is a symmetric pair let g  lieg and h  lieh write d for the
differential of  then
h  x  g  dx  x
define
s  x  g  xx  1
on which g acts by
x  s  xsx1  x  g s  s
we have a symmetrization map gh  s defined by x 7 xx1 which identifies the symmetric space
gh with the gorbit of the neutral element on s the induced action of h on s is the conjugation by
h let s be the tangent space at the neutral element of s then
s  x  g  dx  x
on which h acts by restriction of the adjoint action notice that
g  h  s
for x  s denote by hx resp gx  hx  sx  the centraliser of x in h resp g h s
we say an element x  s is semisimple if the orbit adhx is zariski closed in s by 29 fact a p
108109 x  sf  is semisimple if and only if adhf x is closed in sf  in the analytic topology
we say an element x  s is regular if hx has minimal dimension it is known that x  s is regular
if and only if gx or sx  has minimal dimension cf 21 proposition 7 denote by srs the subset
of s consisting of regular semisimple elements in s for x  s consider the characteristic polynomial
det  adxg  denote by ds x be the coefficient of the least power of  appearing nontrivially in
this polynomial then ds x is an hinvariant polynomial on s from 29 end of p 107 we know
that x  s is regular semisimple if and only if ds x 6 0 thus srs is a principal zariski open subset
of s
by a cartan subspace of s we mean a maximal abelian subspace for the lie bracket c  s defined
over f  consisting of semisimple elements for such c let creg  c  srs  by 24 theorem 51 and
corollary of theorem 52 if c  s is a cartan subspace then the centraliser of c in s is c itself by 24
corollary 2 of theorem 32 if x  srs f  then sx is a cartan subspace of s hence if x  creg f 
with c  s being a cartan subspace then sx  c because of the maximality by 24 corollary 2 of
theorem 41 all cartan subspaces of s are of the form sx where x  srs f  by 31 p 323 all cartan
subspaces of s are conjugate by h over an algebraic closure of f  in particular all cartan subspaces of
s have the same dimension
for a cartan subspace c  s denote by tc the centraliser of c in h and set tc  lietc  it is known
that if x  creg f  with c  s being a cartan subspace then hx  tc see 29 p 112 note that tc
is not necessarily a torus in general though it is always a torus in cases of main interest in this paper
thanks to corollary 3113
for x  sf  we define the weyl discriminant factor
ds xf  ds xf 
from the above discussion we see that if x  cf  with c  s being a cartan subspace then
ds xf   detadxhtc sc f 
311
for a cartan subspace c  s set w h c  normhf  ctc f  to be its weyl group where
normhf  c denotes the normaliser of c in hf  fix a set t s of representatives for hf conjugacy
classes of cartan subspaces in s which is a finite set by 29 p 105 then we have the weyl integration
formula see 29 p 106

for all f  cc sf  recall that the adjoint action induces a local isomorphism   tc f hf  
creg f   srs f  of f analytic manifolds whose image is open in srs f  here we should use compatible
haar measures on sf  and creg f  ie we require that  should preserve the measures for particular
cases to be considered we shall fix haar measures on sf  in the following sections notice that we shall
not use the haar measure on creg f  obtained via the exponential map
the lemma below makes the definition of fourier transform on sf  possible
lemma 31 let g h  be a symmetric pair then there exists a ginvariant invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form h i on g in particular g  h  s is an orthogonal direct sum with
respect to h i and the restriction of h i to h or s is nondegenerate
proof this is 1 lemma 719
the following lemma is a special case of 38 lemma 310 which is an analogue of harishchandras
compactness lemma 17 lemma 25
lemma 32 let s be a compact subset of sf  suppose that c is a cartan subspace of s let c be a
compact subset of creg f  then
x  tc f hf   adx1 c   s 6 
is relatively compact in tc f hf 
proof choose an arbitrary x  c  we have hx  tc  let nadhxx
be the normal space see 1
notation 233 to adhx in s at the point x by 1 proposition 721 since x  s is semisimple
one has nadhxx
 sx as hx spaces note that since x  creg  creg  sx is an tale luna slice at
x in the sense of 1 theorem a23 thus we can apply 38 lemma 310
denote by f sh the f algebra of hinvariant polynomial functions on s for c  s a cartan subspace
denote by f cw hc the f algebra of w h cinvariant polynomial functions on c an analogue of
chevalley restriction theorem holds for symmetric spaces
lemma 33 1 let c be a cartan subspace of s the restriction
f sh  f cw hc
is an isomorphism
2 the f algebra f sh has a finite system of algebraically independent homogeneous generators
proof see 30 theorem 7 and corollary of theorem 8 and 29 proposition 23
the next lemma is an analogue of 17 lemma 28
lemma 34 let   sf  be a compact subset let c be a cartan subspace of s then cf  
cladhf  is relatively compact in cf  where cl denotes the closure of a subset in sf 
proof this is 37 lemma 612 whose proof relying on lemma 33 applies to an arbitrary symmetric
pair
the following lemma is an analogue of 33 lemme iii4
lemma 35 let   sf  be a compact subset let c be a cartan subspace of s and tc the centraliser of
c in h then there exists c  0 such that for all x  hf  and x  creg f  satisfying adx1 x  
we have
inf log k xk  c sup1  log ds xf 
 tc f 
proof let k  ktc h be any norm on tc hf  in the sense of 22 182 applying the argument of
22 lemma 203 to the finite morphism
  tc h  creg  srs
of affine algebraic varieties defined by x x  adx1 x we show the inequality
log kxktc h  c sup1  log ds xf 
by 22 proposition 183 the quotient h  tc h has the norm descent property in the sense of 22
186 that is to say the restriction of k  ktc h to tc f hf  is equivalent to the abstract norm
inf  tc f  k  k on tc f hf 
the lemma below is an analogue of 17 lemma 44
lemma 36 there exists   0 such that the function ds x
f is locally integrable on cf  for any
cartan subspace c of s
proof see 38 lemma 43
corollary 37 for any r  0 the function sup1  log ds xf r is locally integrable on cf  for
any cartan subspace c of s
proof we have the elementary fact cf the proof of 22 corollary 202 for   0 and r  0 there
exists c  0 such that
sup1 log yr  cy   1 y  0
then it suffices to apply lemma 36
we say an element x  sf  is nilpotent if 0  cladhf x where cl denotes the closure of a
subset in sf  from 1 lemmas 2312 and 738 we know that x  sf  is nilpotent if and only if it
is a nilpotent element in g denote by n s the set of nilpotent elements in sf  which is a cone the
following lemma is an analogue of jacobsonmorozov theorem
lemma 38 let g h  be a symmetric pair and x  n s  then there exists a group homomorphism

the next lemma is an analogue of harishchandras submersion principle 17 theorem 11
lemma 39 let i  srs f   c be a function the following conditions are equivalent
1 i is locally constant invariant by the adjoint action of hf  and of support included in adhf 
with   srs f  a compact subset
2 there exists f  cc srs f  such that
x  srs f  ix  ix f 
proof for c  t s apply the argument of 11 lemme 61 to the morphism

32 the case of g h let d be a central division algebra over f  let g be the associative algebra
of 2n  2n matrices with entries in d denote by g  g  gl2nd the group of invertible
 elements
in g equipped with the lie bracket g is identified with the lie algebra of g let  
denote by h the subgroup of fixed points of the involution ad on g then h  glnd  glnd is
diagonally embedded into g define
s  x  g  xadx  1
and its tangent space at the neutral element

then we have

let m0 be the group of diagonal elements in g which is a common minimal levi subgroup of g and h
for a linear subspace v  g we write v  v  g
note that the f rank of g is 2n denote gn  g hn  h and sn  s recall the following

proposition 310 the results below hold for f being any field of characteristic zero
1 an element x of sf  is semisimple if and only if it is hf conjugate to an element of the form
0 0 1m 0
 0 0 0 0

with a  glm d being semisimple in the usual sense more precisely the set of hf conjugacy
classes of semisimple elements of sf  is bijective to the set of pairs m a where 0  m  n is an
integer and a is a semisimple conjugacy class in glm d moreover xa is regular semisimple if
and only if m  n and a is regular semisimple in gln d in the usual sense
2 let x  xa  sf  be semisimple then the descendant hx  sx  as a representation is
isomorphic to
glmd a  glmd a   hnm  snm 
where glmd a resp glmd a  denotes the centraliser of a in glmd resp glmd 
proof this is stated in 36 proposition 52 for a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero but
its proof included in 20 propositions 21 and 22 is valid for any field of characteristic zero
corollary 311 we have
1 srs  s 
2 for x  srs  hx is a torus of dimension 21 dim g
3 for c  s a cartan subspace tc is a torus of dimension
dim g
proof 1 and 2 are clear from proposition 310 applied to an algebraic closure of f  3 results from 2
since for c  s a cartan subspace tc  hx for any x  creg 6 
lemma 312 let p be a parabolic subgroup of g then p  h is a parabolic subgroup of h if and only
if   p  moreover if  belongs to a levi factor m of p  then m  h is a levi factor of p  h
proof one may consider all the groups over an algebraic closure of f  we first suppose that p  h is
a parabolic subgroup of h then   centh  p  h where centh denotes the centre of h this
establishes one direction
we now suppose that   p  denote by n the unipotent radical of p and let m be a levi factor of p 
by the argument in the last paragraph of the proof of 25 lemma 44 we show that  is n conjugate to
an element in m with the help of 2 lemma 21 actually we need its variant over a local field for the
characteristic function of a singleton here whose proof is similar then replacing m by its n conjugate
if necessary we may assume that   m 
let g  glv  for a vector space v  1ir vi  suppose that
and that
p  g  g  gv1    vi   v1    vi  1  i  r
m  g  g  gvi   vi  1  i  r
since   m  we have vi   vi for all 1  i  r let vi resp vi  be the 1resp 1eigenspace of
vi under the action of  for 2  1 we have vi  vi vi  let v   1ir vi and v   1ir vi 
then
h  g  g  gv    v   gv    v  
hence
p  h  g  g  gv1    vi   v1    vi  gv1    vi   v1    vi  1  i  r
it means exactly that p  h is a parabolic subgroup of h and proves the other direction morover
m  h  g  g  gvi   vi  gvi   vi  1  i  r
that is to say m  h is a levi factor of p  h

 for p  f g m0  we say that p is stable if   p  denote by f g m0 
set  
1n 0
the subset of stable parabolic subgroups in f g m0  for m  l g m0  we say that m is stable
if   m  notice that m is stable if and only if m  mp for some p  f g m0  denote by
l g m0  the subset of stable levi subgroups in l g m0  let an be the group of diagonal matrices
in gln  which is a minimal levi subgroup of gln  for mn  l gln an  denote by mnd the reductive
group over f whose f points are mn d and let mnd  liemnd  in particular the notion and
mnd mnd
makes sense there is a bijection mn 7 m 
between l gln an  and l g m0  cf
mnd mnd
25 proposition 52 we shall always use the notation mn to denote the preimage of m under this
bijection notice that if m  l g m0  and q  f g m  then q  f g m0 
suppose that m  l g m0  if x  m  s then am  hx  we say an element x  m  srs f  is
m elliptic if am is the maximal f split torus in hx which is a torus by corollary 3112 denote by
m  srs f ell the set of m elliptic elements in m  srs f  write mh  m  h for x  m  srs f 
let xmh be the mh f conjugacy class of x denote by ell m  srs f  the set of mh f conjugacy
classes in m  srs f ell  if c  m  s is a cartan subspace then am  tc  we say a cartan subspace
c  m  s is m elliptic if am is the maximal f split torus in tc which is a torus by corollary 3113
since mh  m  s appears as the product of some copies of the form h s in lower dimensions cf 25
51 we define w mh  c and t m  s as in section 31 in our notation we write m  srs for the
zariski open subset of m  s consisting of regular semisimple elements with respect to the mh action
by proposition 310 and its product form we see that m  srs  m  srs  since a cartan subspace
is generally the same as the centraliser of a regular semisimple element we also deduce that a cartan
subspace of m  s is nothing but a cartan subspace of s contained in m  s denote by tell m  s the
subset of representatives that are m elliptic cartan subspaces in t m  s
lemma 313 let m  l g m0  and xmh  ell m  srs f

where w0gln resp w0mn  denotes the weyl group of gln  an  resp mn  an 
proof 1 let x  hf  be such that adxx  x   then adxhx   hx   since x  msrs f ell
and x   m  srs f ell  we have adxam   am  and thus adxm   m   as x  hf  we
is a maximal f split torus so there exists
have adxmh   mh
 we see that adxam0   mh
m  mh f  such that adm xam0   am0  that is to say w  m x  normhf  am0  
normhf  m0  where normhf  am0  denotes the normaliser of am0 in hf  now adxam   am 
in 25 91
implies that adw am   am   because m m   l g m

ff that any
 wn  w0 nd  hence
isomorphism am  am  induced by w0h can be given by
 wn  w0 nd such that w1 w  centw0h am   w0mh  where
there exists w 
centw0h am  denotes the centraliser of am in w0h  we can check that such a w satisfies the condition
in the lemma
glnd
acts transitively on this set let

 wn  w0
be such that
adwm  adwxadwmh   m xmh 
then w  mh f  thus the condition on w is equivalent to

where w0 nd denotes the weyl group of mnd  and  we see that the cardinality of the set in the

proof from 25 beginning of 92 any hf conjugacy class in srs f  is the image of a class xmh 
ell m  srs f  for some m  l g m0  by lemma 313 the weyl integration formula 312 can
be written as the above equality cf 5 p 1617 and 33 3 in i3
for pn  l gln an  denote by pnd the algebraic group over f whose f points are pn d and let

cf 25 proposition 52 we shall always use the notation pn to denote the preimage of p under this
bijection following 37 p 1846 we shallfix the haar measures

the haar measures on mpnd f  and npnd f  in section 25 we shall choose the same haar measure
for any of the four copies in mp f  or np f  under these identifications in particular we obtain the
haar measures on mp  sf  and np  sf

fix a continuous and nontrivial unitary character   f  c  let h i be the nondegenerate
symmetric bilinear form on gf  defined by

where c sf  is the unique constant such that fx  f x for all f  cc sf  and all x  sf 
for any m  l g m0  the restriction of h i on m  s is nondegenerate then we can define similarly
the normalised fourier transform of f  cc m  sf 
suppose that p  f g m0  let  be the quadratic character of f  attached to a quadratic
extension ef  denote by nrd the reduced norm on gf  for f  cc sf  we define a function

fp z

for all z  mp  sf  we show that fp  fp   so we shall denote it by fp without confusion in
fact the integral on np  sf  and the fourier transform commute by our choices of haar measures
see 33 i7 the commutativity of the integral on kh and the fourier transform results from the
hf invariance of h i
the following result is an analogue of 17 theorem 13
proposition 316 let f  cc sf  then

since t s is a finite set and the orbital integral is constant on any hf orbit we obtain a uniform

proof it is the same as the proof of corollary 37
33 the case of g  h   let e be a quadratic extension of f  let g be a central simple algebra over
f with a fixed embedding of f algebras e  g  let h  centg e be the centraliser of e in g  by
the double centraliser theorem see 27 theorem 31 in chapter iv for example we know that h is a

the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of proposition 323 we shall follow the main steps
in 37 63 which is similar to the proof of 17 theorem 13 and only point out some additional
ingredients let n be the f rank of g  denote gn  g  hn  h  and sn  s  recall that the f rank
of hn is n in case i resp n2 in case ii we shall use induction on n for n  1 in case i resp

the following description of semisimple elements and descendants see 1 definition 722 is a
generalisation of 16 lemma 21 see also 37 proposition 47

is an integer in case i resp an even number in case ii and b is a semisimple hm
f conjugacy
class in sm f  moreover y b is regular semisimple if and only if m  n and b is regular semi
simple in s f

isomorphic to
hmb
 smb   hnm
 snm 
where hmb
resp smb  denotes the centraliser of b in hm
resp sm 
proof 1 by the base change to an algebraic closure of f containing e we see from 20 proposition 21
that an element y  s f  which is h  f conjugate to y b in the proposition is semisimple now we
suppose
y  s f  is semisimple since y 2  h f  up to h  f  conjugation
 that 
 wemay suppose
 that

we deduce that y 
for some b  sm f  such that ab  ba and some c  snm f  as

y2 
 we have b  sm f  because y is semisimple it is shown in 20 p 71 that y and y 2
0 0
have the same rank over an algebraic closure of f containing e then c  0 we can also see from 20
proposition 21 that b is semisimple with respect to the hm
action after the base change we have
established the first statement
for the second statement it suffices to notice that two such elements y b1  with b1  sm1 f  and
y b2  with b2  sm2 f  in the proposition are h f conjugate if and only if m1  m2 denoted by
m and b1 and b2 are hm

the third statement follows from the base change or 2

lemma 328 we have n s  0  sbdd 
proof we may apply the argument of 37 lemma 616 thanks to lemma 327 we only sketch some
steps for convenience and omit the details in fact we use induction on r  which is also dim hx0 by 37
lemma 32 and dim s  dim h  12 dim g cf 37 lemma 43 for x0  n s  0 suppose that for
all x0  n s  0 satisfying hx   r  we have x0  sbdd  we need to show that x0  sbdd  denote
by nqs the union of all h  f orbits in n s of dimension  q then x0  n 1s dim g r  n 1s dim g r 1

f  n e  attached to it where n is the norm map e   f   for x  hf  which is viewed as
an element in gf  we denote by nrdx its reduced norm suppose that m  l g m0  and that
q  f g m  for all f  cc sf  and x  m  srs f  we define the weighted orbital integral

recall that this definition depends implicitly on the choice of a maximal compact subgroup of gf 
x is leftinvariant by m f  and we have hx  mh for
which has been fixed in section 22 since vm
x  m  srs  we see that vm x is leftinvariant by hx f  this integral is absolutely convergent since
the orbit adhf x is closed in sf  which ensures that the integrand is a compactly supported
and locally constant function on the homogeneous space
notice that for x  mh f  we have jm

convenient to introduce a transfer factor as in 37 definition 57 for x 
 srs f  define

412
x  nrda
where nrda denotes the reduced norm of a  gln d then we have adx1 x  nrdxx
and thus the function jm
  f  is constant on admh f x
though we mainly consider m  l g m0  it is unharmful to extend our definition by 411 to all
levi subgroups of the form m  adwl where l  l g m0  and w  w0h 
one may also extend in the obvious way the definition 411 of weighted orbital integrals to the
symmetric pair l lh  ad where l  l g m0  since it appears as the product of some copies of
the form g h ad in lower dimensions

proof 1 this is obvious from the definition
2 let y  m  srs f  then c  sy  m  s is a cartan subspace and y  creg f  since
admh f creg f  is an open subset of m  srs f  see 29 p 105 in order to prove the first
statement it suffices to find a neighbourhood u of y in creg f  on which the function jm
  f 
is constant we shall follow the proof of 22 theorem 1711 consider the function  on creg f  
tc f hf  defined by x x  f adx1 x then  is locally constant but usually not
compactly supported however now choosing a compact neighbourhood c of y in creg f  we see from
harishchandras compactness lemma for symmetric spaces lemma 32 applied to s  suppf  that
the restriction of  to c  tc f hf  is compactly supported by 22 lemma 21 there exists an
open neighbourhood u of y in c such that x x  y x for all x  u and x  tc f hf  it
follows that the function jm
  f  is constant on u 
the second statement is a corollary of lemma 34

from the leftinvariance of vm
x by mh f  the effect of adk comes from the rightinvariance of
vm x by kh  one should keep in mind the effect of nrdx in every step

since vm

this expression is absolutely convergent by proposition 5105 and corollary 37 one may extend in

61 in the context of groups in the sense of 30 p 467
the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of proposition 61 we shall follow the main steps in
33 iv26 since the function jm

x  m  srs f  and t m  s is a finite set by lemma 34 we may and shall suppose that  is
relatively compact in m  sf  the proposition will be proved by induction on the dimension of g
recall that we have chosen the standard maximal compact subgroup k  gl2n od  of gf  
gl2n d let k  gof   gl2n od  which is an of lattice in gf   gl2n d and is stable under
the adjoint action of k since h  l g m0  we have set kh  k  hf   gln od   gln od 
let hof   k  hf  and sof   k  sf  then we see that k  hof   sof  and that
sof  is stable under the adjoint action of kh  for all p  f g m0  we fix ap  ap f  such that

recall that we denote by n s the set of nilpotent elements in sf  and fix a uniformiser  of of  let

we define the parabolic subgroup p x of g as in 33 iv3 more concretely set

and

then let

611
note that p x is independent of the choice of  by 7 proposition 571 since a commutes with  one
has   p x  by lemma 312 p x h is a parabolic subgroup of h then there exists an element x  kh
such that p   adxp x   f g m0  we shall fix such an x let ax  adx1 ap    hf  note
that ax depends on the choice of x but this is unimportant it is proved in 33 3 in iv3 that
adax x  k
but adax x  sf  thus we have
adax x  sof

lemma 63 there exists an integer h  n such that for all y  h sof  all integers l  h and all
z  adax 1 l sof  there exists   kh with nrd  1 such that
adx  y  z  x  y  l sof 
proof it is analogous to the proof of 33 lemme iv3 the point is that we require   hf  and
nrd  1 here

since a commutes with  one has gi  gi  h  gi  s
it is proved in 33 4 in iv3 that
adax 1 k  k  adax 1 k  nx 
by the intersection of sf  with both sides in the last expression we have
613
adax 1 sof   sof   adax 1 sof   nx 
it is shown in 33 2 in iv3 and the proof of 33 lemme iv3 that there exists c  n such that

fix such an integer c  there exists c  n such that adax 1 c k  k fix such an integer c 
let h  n be such that h  maxc  c  c  c  let y l and z be as in the statement thanks to
613 we can write z  z1  z2  where z1  l sof  and z2  adax 1 l sof   nx  because
of 614 we can choose z   lc hof  such that z2  adxz   since z   c hof  from the
hypothesis l  h  c  c  we can define   expz  then we have   kh and nrd  1 it is
shown in the proof of 33 lemme iv3 that  verifies
adx  y  z  x  y  l k
but both of adx  y  z and x  y belong to sf  hence we deduce that
adx  y  z  x  y  l sof

denote by n g the set of nilpotent elements in gf  let pgf  resp psf  be the projective space
associated to gf  resp sf  and   gf   0  pgf  the natural projection since n g  0
is compact and n s  0 is a closed subset of n g  0 we know that n s  0 is compact one
also sees that

we can and shall choose a finite set n0  n s  k  k such that

is an open neighbourhood of n s  0  psf 
lemma 64 there exists an integer c  n such that for all d  m
c and all f  cc sf 
satisfying df  6 0 we have
f  x  h sof  6 
suppf   c sof

proof recall that  is assumed to be relatively compact in m  sf  fix an open compact neighbourhood   of  in sf  fix p0  p h m0  and set
p0  a  am0 f   af  1   p0 
similarly for all b  p g m0  set
b  a  am0 f   af  1   b 
we see from the argument of 25 lemma 411 that
p0 
bp g m0 p0 b
by the cartan decomposition there exists a compact subset   hf  such that hf   kh a
p0 
fix such a  then
hf

fix c  n such that ad    sof  since ada
b sof   sof   nb  sf  and
nb  sf   n s  we obtain
adhf     c sof   n s 
choose an integer c such that
c  c  sup hx

let d and f be as in the statement it is evident that
suppf   adhf    6 
suppose that x1  c sof  x2  n s satisfy x1  x2  suppf  if x2  c sof  we are done
if not let x  n0 be such that x2   x  h sof  then there exists   f  such that
x2  x  h sof  since x2 
 c sof  we have vf   c and thus vf   hx  c 
therefore x1  h sof  and then x1  x2  x  h sof   f  x  h sof  this is
exactly what we want to prove
we shall fix an integer c verifying the condition in lemma 64 we shall also fix another integer h
such that
h  sup hx 
615
xn0
denote
c  f  cc sf h sof   suppf   c sof 
which is a clinear space of finite dimension for all l  l g m  l 6 g let rl  h l  sof 
lemma 65 let z  zx x  c suppose that
1 ils
rl  m z  0 for all l  l m  l 6 g
2 m

then ish sof    m
z  0
proof write d  m
z it suffices to prove by induction on the integer e  c the assertion
ae  for all f  cc sf h sof  with suppf   e sof  we have df   0
if e  c this is true by the hypothesis 2 fix an e  c and suppose that ae1 is true for any
open compact subset s  gf  denote by 1s its characteristic function it suffices to prove that for all
y  e sof   e1 sof  we have d1y h sof    0
suppose that y  e sof   e1 sof  the hypothesis e  c implies c sof   e1 sof 
and thus y 
 c sof  suppose on the contary that d1y h sof   6 0 by lemma 64 there exists
x  n0 and   f  such that y  h sof   x  h sof  6  fix such x and  since
vf y   e and vf x  0 we have vf   e as h  hx  hx  e see 615 we obtain
h sof   h sof  and then y  x h sof  let y   h sof  such that y  x y  
let z  adax 1 h sof  since h  e  hx  we can apply lemma 63 to x y   1 z and
l  h  e then there exists   kh with nrd  1 such that
adx  y   1 z  x  y   he sof 
from vf   e we deduce that
adx  y    z  x  y    h sof 
since   kh  this is equivalent to
ady  z  y  h sof 
ady  z  h sof   y  h sof 
ad1y zh sof    1y h sof  
by proposition 413 we obtain
d1y zh sof    nrdd1y h sof  
because nrd  1 we have
d1y zh sof    d1y h sof  
now by the sum over z  adax 1 h sof   h sof  h sof  a finite set we get
616
d1y h sof    k   sof 1 d1y h k 
where
617
k   adax 1 sof   sof 
by proposition 416 we have the equality
d adax 1y h k   nrdax 1y h k  nrdax 
qf g mq6g
m q z 1y h k qax 1 
from 413 it is clear that 1y h k qax 1 is invariant by translation of rmq  by the hypothesis
1 we have m q z 1y h k qax 1  0 for all q  f g m  q 6 g so
618
nrdax d1y h k   d adax 1y h k  
we see easily that
adax 1y h k   1s 
where
s  adax y   h adax k  
619
recall y  x  y   above as x  n0  by 612 we have adax x  sof  since
y  h sof  by the hypothesis 3 on hx  we have adax y    sof  for vf   e we
obtain
adax y   e1 sof 
6110
we see from 617 that
adax k    sof   adax sof 
by 615 and the hypothesis 3 on hx  we have h adax sof   h adax sof   sof 
then by 615 and the hypothesis 2 on hx  we have
6111
h adax k    h sof   h adax sof   h sof   sof   sof 
from 619 6110 and 6111 we see that
supp1s   e1 sof 
since sof   adax k   we know that 1s is invariant by translation of h sof  using the induction
hypothesis ae1  we have
d1s   0
thanks to 616 and 618 we obtain
d1y h sof    0
this proves ae and thus the lemma
proof of proposition 61 we use induction on the dimension of g suppose that for all l  l g m  l 6
g and all open compact subgroups rl of l  sf  the image of the linear map
ils
rl  m  c  cc l  sf rl 
is of finite dimension this is actually a product form of the proposition in lower dimensions now we
would like to prove the proposition the argument below is also valid for the case g  m 
enlarge h in 615 if necessary such that r  h sof  we shall prove that the image of ish sof   
is of finite dimension admit this for the moment since isr  factorises by ish sof    the image of
i r  m
is also of finite dimension then we finish the proof
let k1 be the kernel of the linear map
ils
cc l  sf rl 
rl  m  c 
ll g ml6g
ll g ml6g
whose image is of finite dimension by our induction hypothesis applied to rl  rl for all l 
l g m  l 6 g hence to prove that ish sof    m
c is of finite dimension it suffices to prove
that ish sof   m
k1  is of finite dimension
consider the composition of the linear maps
d1  ish sof   m
and
 k1  cc sf h sof 
res  cc sf h sof   c  
the latter map is the natural restriction lemma 65 says that
which is denoted by k2  then
kerres  d1   kerd1 
d1 k1   k1 k2  res  d1 k1   c  
since c is of finite dimension we see that d1 k1  is of finite dimension
corollary 66 let r be an open compact subgroup of sf  m  l g m0  and   m  srs f 
suppose that there exists a compact subset 0  m  sf  such that   admh f 0  then there
exists a finite subset xi  i  i   and a finite subset fi  i  i  cc sf r such that for all
x   and all f  cc sf r we have the equality
 x f  
 xi  f jm
 x fi 
proof by proposition 61 there exists a finite subset xi  i  i   such that isr   m
xi   i  i
is a basis of ir  m c by linear algebra there exists a finite subset fi  i  i  cc sf r
such that isr   m
xi fj   ij  i j  i where ij denotes the kronecker delta function choose such
xi  i  i and fi  i  i
then for all x   there exists i  i  i such that
 x

 xi    cc sf r 
hence for all i  i

we have finished the proof

the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of proposition 67 it is similar to the proof of proposition 61 and we only point out some additional argument recall that we have chosen the standard maximal compact subgroup kh   gln od  of h  f   gln d  in case i resp kh   gl n2 odf e  of
h  f   gl n2 d f e in case ii since ad d   d in case i resp ad d f e  d f e
in case ii we deduce that ad od   od in case i resp ad odf e   odf e in case
ii thus ad kh    kh   let h of   gln od  in case i resp h of   gl n2 odf e  in
case ii let s of   h of    h of  be an of lattice in s f  see section 33 for the choice of
  let k   h of   s of  whose decomposition is stable under the adjoint action of kh  because
ad kh    kh   for all p   f h m0  we fix ap   ap  f  such that ap  f  1   h
starting from x  n s  s of   s of  we obtain a group homomorphism   sl

by the jacobsonmorozov theorem for symmetric spaces lemma 38 denote a

since a commutes with  by lemma 319 p x  h  is a parabolic subgroup of h   which contains the
centraliser centh  a  of a in h  as a levi factor we want to show that there exists x  kh  such
that adxp x  h    f h m0  and that adxp x   f g me0 
lemma 68 for y  n s  there exists x  h  f  such that adxy  is in the jordan normal form
ie diagonal block matrices with entries in d  in case i resp d f e in case ii whose blocks
are of the form
proof it can be proved in the same way as 16 lemmas 22 and 23 by linear algebra over a division
ring
thanks to lemma 68 we can construct explicitly the above morphism  see 13 p 184 if x
is in the jordan normal form by loc cit we may choose a  al f  for some l  l h m0  such
that centh  a   l and that centg a   le  for a general x as above by lemma 68 there exists
y  h  f  such that adya   al f  for some l  l h m0  satisfying centh  adya   l
and centg adya   le  let x  kh  be such that x1 y  p x  h  f  then adxp x  h   
adyp x  h   contains l as a levi factor and adxp x   adyp x  contains le as a levi factor
furthermore since adxp x   h   adxp x  h   we see that adxp x  h   and adxp x 
f between f h  m   and f g m  
are associated under the bijection p  7 p

fix x  kh  as above and denote p   adxp x  h    f h m0  then p

proof of proposition 67 we may apply the argument of proposition 61 with obvious modifications
especially one needs to use proposition 44 and 621 to show an analogue of lemma 65 for the case of

rather than the consequence of some steps in the proof of 33 lemme iv3 since our definition of k  is
different from g of   gln od  however there is no essential difficulty with our preparation above

notice that the notion e s can be defined for any symmetric pair and that the definition d s can at
least be extended to the symmetric pair m mh  ad where m  l g m0  since it appears as the
product of some copies of the form g h ad in lower dimensions
if d  d s is nrdinvariant with respect to the adjoint action of hf  then so is ed  e s and by

the sum in 714 is actually over the finite set w h cy where y  hf  is any element such that

additionally one may check that e  e s from the hypotheses on e0  let d  d s be the distribution

d f   d0 f 
for all f  cc sf  that is to say d0  d  d s 
note that in the argument above we have used the convergence of an analogue of 715 with e0 and
f replaced by their absolute values it also results in the absolute convergence of 713
corollary 75 parabolic induction let m  l g m0  p  p g m  and d  d ms  then the
distribution on sf  defined by f  cc sf  f 7 dfp  belongs to d s  where fp is defined by 322
proof applying the weyl integration formula 312 to dfp  we see that it suffices to fix a cartan
subspace c  m  s and prove that the distribution on sf  defined by

define a function e1  hf   creg f   c by
717
e1 x x  nrdx
ed admp xk1 xnrdmp xkdk
mh f k
for all x  hf  and all x  creg f  where mp x  mh f  is any element such that mp x1 x 
nph f kh  since kh is a special subgroup of hf  such mp x is welldefined modulo mh f   k
hence the integral 717 is independent of the choice of mp x the function e1 is left tc f invariant
on the first variable so it induces a function still denoted by e1   tc f hf   creg f   c
we shall check that e1 verifies the hypotheses of lemma 74 firstly e1 is locally constant because
ed is locally constant and e1 is right kh invariant on the first variable secondly suppose that r is
an open compact subset of sf  we fix an open compact subset rm  m  sf  such that if x 
msf  u  np sf  k  kh satisfy adkx u   r then x  rm  this is possible for it suffices
to let rm contain the projection of adkh r to m  sf  replacing rm with admh f   krm 
if necessary we may additionally assume that
718
admh f   krm   rm 
since ed  e ms  there exist constants c  0 and n  n such that
ed x  c sup1  log dms xf n
for all x  rm  m  srs f  one sees from 311 that for all x  m  srs f 
ds xf dms x1
f   detadxgm f 
hence ds xf dms x1
f is bounded for x  rm  m  srs f  recall that m  srs  m  srs see
section 32 and that ds xf 6 0 for x  srs f  see section 31 we deduce that there exists c  0
such that
719
ed x  c sup1  log ds xf n
for all x  rm  srs f  now suppose that x  tc f hf  and x  creg f  satisfy adx1 x  r
write x  mnk with m  mh f  n  nph f  and k  kh  then
adx1 x  adk 1 adm1 x  u 
where u  adn1 m1 x  adm1 x  np  sf  thus adm1 x  rm by our assumption
on rm  thanks to 718 and 719 we obtain
e1 x x  c sup1  log ds xf n 
to sum up e1 verifies the hypotheses of lemma 74
applying lemma 74 to c and e1  we know that the distribution d1 on sf  defined by
f adx1 xe1 x xdxdx
ds xf
f  cc sf  d1 f  
tc f hf 
creg f 
belongs to d s  note that e1 mnk x  nrdke1 m x for m  mh f  n  nph f  k  kh  by
the same argument as the proof of proposition 414 one shows that

note that for k  mh f   k we have adk 1 fp  nrdkfp  by the change of variables mk 7 m
one can eliminate the integral over mh f   k and see that d1 is the same as 716
let m  l g m0  and d  d ms  suppose that d is nrdinvariant with respect to the adjoint
action of mh f  following 33 v9 we define a distribution indgw

corollary 76 let m  l g m0  and d  d ms  suppose that d is nrdinvariant with respect
to the adjoint action of mh f  then the integral 7110 is absolutely convergent moreover the
distribution indgw

remark 77 this corollary is unnecessary for the proof of proposition 72 but useful in section 81
proof of corollary 76 it suffices to fix a cartan subspace c  m  s and prove the same assertion for
the distribution on sf  defined by

define a function e2  tc f hf   creg f   c by

for all x  tc f hf  and all x  creg f  it is locally constant note that ed adm1 x 
nrdmed x for x  mh f  and x  m  srs f  by our assumption on d thus we may use the
same argument as in the proof of corollary 75 to show the inequality
ed x  ed adm1 x  c sup1  log ds xf n 
x in sum e2 verifies the hypotheses of lemma
thanks to lemma 42 one has a similar bound for vm
applying lemma 74 to c and e2  we know that the integral
ds xf
f  cc sf  f 7
f adx1 xe2 x xdxdx
creg f 
tc f hf 
is absolutely convergent and defines a distribution in d s  this distribution is the same as 7111
remark 78 instead of the hypothesis ed  e
 an analogue of corollary 76 holds if one assumes
that d is defined via 711 by a function ed  m  srs f   c locally constant nrdinvariant
with respect to the adjoint action of mh f  and such that for any open compact subset r of m  sf 
there exist constants c  0 and n  n such that for all x  r  srs f  one has the inequality
ed x  c sup1  log ds xf n 
the proof is the same except that we need not use the boundedness of ds xf dms x1

lemma 79 let m  l g m0  and c  m  s be an m elliptic cartan subspace

proof 1 since c  m  s resp c  m  s is m elliptic resp m  elliptic we have atc  am

lemma
 wn  w0 nd acts transitively on the set of pairs in 2
see that the group w0h 
firstly let us count m  appearing in the pairs cf 22 p426 
since m  l g m0  for w  w0h  we see that w 
 normw h m  if and only if
wn  norm glnd mnd  where normw h m  resp norm glnd mnd  denotes the normaliser of
m resp mnd  in
w0h
resp
w0 nd 
glnd
hence the number of m  is
norm
glnd
mnd 1 
secondly for such an m  fixed we count c such that m   c  belongs to the set of pairs in 2 cf 22
lemma 71
for x  hf  we claim that adxc   m  s if and only if x  normhf  m   which denotes the
normaliser of m  in hf  on the one hand suppose that adxc   m  s then am   centh m 
s  adxtc  where centh m  s denotes the centraliser of m  s in h since adxam   
adxatc  is the maximal f split torus in adxtc  we have am   adxam   by comparison
of dimensions we deduce that adxam    am   so x  normhf  m   on the other hand suppose
that x  normhf  m   since x  hf  we have adxm  s  m  s but c  m  s so we
obtain adxc   m  s in sum we have proved our claim
from this claim the number of c is
f normhf  m  normhf  c 
since mh
f  is a normal subgroup of normhf  m   we know that the number of the double cosets is
equal to
f normhf  c normhf  c   mh
f 1
normhf  m  mh
normhf  m  mh
f normhf  c normmh f  c 1 
for x  normhf  m   we have adxam    am   because m   l g m0  there exists w  w0h
f  where centhf  am   denotes the centraliser of am  in
such that w1 x  centhf  am    mh
hf  since x  normhf  m  we have w  normw h m   that is to say
normhf  m   normw h m  mh
therefore
normhf  m  mh

and mnd are w0
since m  and m are w0h conjugate mnd

mnd 1
mnd w0
we also have
normhf  c normmh f  c  normhf  c tc f normmh f  c tc f 1
w h c w mh
 c 1 
since m   c  and m c are w0h conjugate we obtain
normhf  c normmh f  c   w h cw mh  c1 
to sum up the number of c is
norm
glnd
mnd 1
mnd w0
w mh  cw h c1 
finally combining the numbers of m  and c  we obtain the number of pairs m   c  in 2
proof of proposition 72 first of all suppose that x  m  srs f ell  then c  sx  m  s is
an m elliptic cartan subspace and x  creg f  fix an open compact subgroup r  sf  and set
r  y  sf   z  r hy zi  1 which is also an open compact subgroup of sf  for all
l  l g m  fix an open compact subgroup rl  lsf  such that if q  p g l and if f  cc sf 
in the same way
satisfies suppf   r then suppfq
  rl  where fq
is defined by 322 define rl
as r 
there exists a neighbourhood  of x in creg f  such that for all l  l g m  and all f  cc l 
sf rl
 the function jm
  f  is constant on  in fact for l and f fixed this results from proposition 412 actually its product form is needed it suffices to apply howes finiteness the product form
of corollary 66 to each symmetric pair l lh  ad and an arbitrary compact neighbourhood of x
in creg f  and then take the intersection of a finite number of neighbourhoods involved
we shall fix a  satisfying the above condition and such that if two elements of  are hf conjugate
or equivalently w h cconjugate then they are the same the latter condition is achievable since
the w h cconjugates of an element in creg f  form a finite subset which is discrete consider the
local isomorphism   tc f hf   creg f   srs f  of f analytic manifolds induced by the adjoint
action its restriction to tc f hf    is injective choose a neighbourhood  of 1 in tc f hf 
such that nrd  1 the set   is a neighbourhood of x in sf  fix a function f   cc sf 
such that suppf      f   0 and f  x 6 0
let f  cc sf  with suppf   r we shall calculate j g  f f   which is defined by 512
consider m   l g m0  and c  tell m  s if c and c are not hf conjugate by our choice
of f   the function jm
   f  f  vanishes on creg f  now suppose that c and c are hf conjugate
let x  hf  be such that adxc  c  by lemma 791 there exist elements m  mh
f  and
w  normhf  m0  such that x  m w by proposition 514 for x  creg f  we have
x   f f

from our choices of haar measures we obtain

creg f 
 y f f  dy
by lemma 792 the number of pairs m   c  with c being hf conjugate to c is
w0gln w0mn 1 w mh  cw h c1 
we deduce that
j  f f    1dimam ag  w h c1
creg f 
 y f f  dy
it follows from our 
choice of f  that the support of the restriction to creg f  of the function jm
  f f  
is contained in

ww hc

where 1adw denotes the characteristic function of adw by the change of variables y 7
adwy  which does not modify the haar measure we have

 y f f  1adw y dy 
creg f 
since w  w h c we have shown above that

which is independent of w therefore

let y   applying the splitting formula for jm

for all q  f g m  since suppfq

 in particular fq

where mq2  m  by proposition 414 we have

hence

if adx1 y   suppf      since the restriction of  to hy f hf    is injective we
have x   and then nrdx  1 since f   0 and f  x 6 0 we deduce our claim now because of

by induction on the dimension of g and parabolic induction corollary 75 one can suppose that
for all l1  l g m  l1 6 g the distribution on sf  defined by f  cc sf  f 7 jm

belongs to d s  this is actually a product form of the induction hypothesis in lower dimensions
we claim that the distribution on sf  defined by f  cc sf  f 7 j g  f f   belongs to d s
cf 33 3 in v10 in fact thanks to the noninvariant trace formula theorem 53 one can replace
j g  f f   with j g  f f  by its definition 512 it suffices to fix m   l g m0  c  tell m  s
and prove that the distribution on sf  defined by

it is locally constant by the product form of proposition 412 using lemma 42 to dominate vm1 x
and corollary 43 to dominate jm2  y f q2  we check that e3 verifies the hypotheses of lemma 74
which implies our claim
 x  conincides with some element in d s for all

let x  tc f hf  such that adxy   cf  as y  l  srs f ell and c  tell l1  s from
the proof of lemma 3131 there exist elements l1  l1  hf  and w  normhf  m0  such that

m  x y  is locally constant on m  srs f   srs f

for all x  rm  srs 
proof let rm  m  sf  and r  sf  be two open compact subgroups set r  y  sf   z 
r hy zi  1 which is an open compact subgroup of sf  notice that if f  cc sf  satisfies
suppf   r then f  cc sf r  applying howes finiteness corollary 66 to r and rm  srs  we
know that there exists a finite subset xi  i  i  rm srs and a finite subset fi  i  i  cc sf r 
such that for all x  rm  srs and all f  cc sf  with suppf   r we have

we deduce that

for all x  rm  srs and y  r  srs 
1 the local constancy of x y  7 m
 x y  on m  srs f   srs f  results from 816 propog
sition 412 and m  xi    e for i  i for l  l g m0  we deduce from lemma 82 the local
constancy of x y  7 g
m  x y  on m  srs f   l  srs f ell  let x y   m  srs f   srs f 
choose l  l g m0  and y   l  srs f ell such that y  is hf conjugate to y  fix a neighbourhood v1  v2 of x y   in m  srs f   l  srs f ell such that x y  7 y g
m  x y  is constant
on v1  v2  thanks to the nrdinvariance of g
m  x  with respect to the adjoint action of hf 
proposition 81 we know that x y  7 y g
m  x y  is constant on v1  adhf v2  which is
a neighbourhood of x y  in m  srs f   srs f  since  is locally constant on srs f  we show
that x y  7 g
m  x y  is constant on a neighbourhood of x y  in m  srs f   srs f 
2 the effect of ady comes from propostion 81 then when considering the effects of adw
and adx up to hf conjugation we may and shall suppose that y  l  srs f ell for some l 
l g m0  that is to say it suffices to prove the equality
adwm  adwxx y   nrdwxm  x y 
for all x y   m  srs f   l  srs f ell  by lemma 82 we may replace g
adwm and m by
adwm
and m
respectively in the equality to be proved now the equality results from proposition
413

dimgrankg2

where dimg and rankg denote the dimension and rank over an algebraic closure of f  of g respectively

therefore we deduce the equality

for all   f  and all x y   m  srs f   srs f  we obtain a similar equality for g

to lemma 82 and the nrdinvariance of g

proposition 81

 x y  on rm  srs   r  srs  results from 816 corollary
43 together with proposition 414 and m
 xi    e s for i  i for l  l g m0  we deduce
from lemma 82 a similar bound of x y  7 g
m  x y  on rm  srs   r  l  srs f ell  let
x y   rm  srs   r  srs  thanks to the nrdinvariance of g
m  x  with respect to the
adjoint action of hf  proposition 81 if we replace y by adyy  where y  hf  the two sides
in the inequality to be proved remain unchanged since any cartan subspace in s is hf conjugate
to an element in tell l  s for some l  l g m0  with the help of lemma 34 it suffices to fix
l  l g m0  c  tell l  s and rc  cf  a compact subset prove a similar bound for x y  
rm  srs   rc  creg  and then obtain a uniform bound for x y   rm  srs   r  srs  by the
finiteness of tell l  s but this is what we have established
5 it is a consequence of 4 applied to r  suppf  and corollary 318
for m  l g m0  and x  m  srs f  we define a distribution im
 x  on sf  by
 x f  im
 x f 
817
for all f  cc sf 
remark 84 for m  g it is evident that ig
 x f   jg
 x f  for all x  srs f  and f 
cc sf 
one may easily extend the definitions 811 and 817 to the symmetric pair l lh  ad where
l  l g m0  since it appears as the product of some copies of the form g h ad in lower
dimensions
lemma 85 let m  l g m0  and x  m  srs f  the distribution im
 x  on sf  is
independent of the choice of the hf invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form h i on sf 
or the continuous nontrivial unitary character  of f 
proof suppose that h i is another bilinear form and that  is another character denote by f 7 f  the
associated fourier transform and by i m
 x  resp j m
 x  the associated analogue of im
 x 
resp jm  x  for f  cc sf  define f  cc sf  by f y   f y  for all y  sf 
since f   f  f for all f  c  sf  it suffices to prove the equality

for all f  cc sf  one may check that  is an hf equivariant linear automorphism of sf  thanks
to hf invariance of two bilinear forms one also deduces that

from the symmetry of two bilinear forms now for all f  cc sf  and all y  sf  we have

for all y  srs f  but we have the equality

since both sides equal jm
 x f  which is defined by 411 the same computation as above
shows that the equality 818 is true when one replaces g
m and m with jm and m respectively recall
that  is hf equivariant so hy  h 1 y  for y  srs f  as a consequence for l  l g m0 
y  l  srs f ell if and only if  1 y   l  srs f ell  one may conclude by lemma 82 together with
the nrdinvariance of g

f  srs f  we shall define a distribution

proof it is almost the same as the proof of lemma 83 except that one needs to use howes finiteness
corollary 69 proposition 86 and lemma 87 we also need proposition 442 for 1 proposition

proof we may apply the argument of lemma 85 thanks to proposition 86 and lemma 87

proposition 316 and corollary 37
theorem 91 invariant trace formula for all f f   cc sf  we have the equality
i g  f f    i g  f   f 
the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of theorem 91 we shall follow the main steps in 33
vii23 the theorem will be proved by induction on the dimension of g
let f  cc srs f  and m  l g m0  by proposition 412 and 3 the function jm
  f  
m  srs f   c is locally constant and invariant by the adjoint action of mh f  where  is defined
by 412 moreover the support of its restriction to cf  for any c  t m  s is included in the
compact subset creg f   adhf suppf  then jm
  f  defines a locally constant function
on m  srs f  see section 32 for the notation via the extension by zero on the complement from
harishchandras submersion principle lemma 39 there exists f   cc m  srs f  such that
xjm  x f   d

for all x  m  srs f  let f  f

 x f   x  m  srs f 
we have shown that for f  cc srs f  and m  l g m0  there exists a function f   cc m 
srs f  such that 912 holds we shall fix such an f  and denote it by g
m f 
as before one may extend in the obvious way the definition 911 and the notation g
m f  to the
symmetric pair m mh  ad where m  l g m0  since it appears as the product of some copies
of the form g h ad in lower dimensions
lemma 92 let m  l g m0  x  msrs f ell and f f   cc srs f  then we have the equality

where

it suffices to fix y  hf  and prove that 1 y  2 y

by a product form of proposition 81 the distribution d  im

proof of theorem 91 we use induction on the dimension of g suppose that the equality is true for
l  l g m0  l 6 g which is actually a product form in lower dimensions now we would like to
prove the equality for g the argument below is also valid for the case l g m0   g ie n  1
first of all suppose that f f   cc srs f  applying lemma 92 to the definition 512 of

here we have used the absolute convergence of the expressions above to exchange the order of sums and
i l  l
l fq1  l f q2  is defined by a product form of 911
by the noninvariant trace formula theorem 53 and remark 52 we have the equality j g  f f   
j g  f  f  therefore
916
w0ln w0gln 1 1dimal ag  bl  f f    bl  f   f   0
ll g m0 
let l  l g m0  l 6 g applying the induction hypothesis we have
bl  f f

l1 l2 l g l
by exchanging l1 and l2 and by using 2 and 5 in section 27 we obtain bl  f f    bl  f   f 
we deduce from 916 that bg  f f    bg  f   f  but
bg  f f    i g  f f  
which implies i g  f f    i g  f   f 
now consider f f   cc sf  in general let i i1 be a sequence of increasing open compact
i  srs f  such a consequence exists for example one may take
subsets of srs f  such that
i  x  srs f   kxk  i for all i  1 where k  k denotes the abstract norm on srs f  defined by
22 1821 in 182 from 22 proposition 1813 since k  k is continuous we deduce that i is
i  srs f  for all i  1
compact for all i  1 it is obvious that i is open for all i  1 and that
denote by 1i the characteristic function of i  let fi  f 1i and fi  f  1i 
let m  l g m0  and c  lellm  s for all x  creg f  by lebesgues dorminated convergence
theorem we have lim ig
 x fi   ig
 x f   for x  m  srs f  because im
 x   d s
see proposition 81 again by lebesgues dorminated convergence theorem we have lim im
 x fi  
 x f  because of lemma 34 applied to suppf   there exists a compact subset r  cf  such
that for all x  creg f   r ig
 x fi   0 for all i  1 by lemma 834 applied to r and suppf  
there exist constants c  0 and n  n such that
im  x fi  
fi y g
m  x y d y f
sf 
 c sup1  log ds xf n
f y  sup1  log ds y f n ds y f dy
sf 
for all i  1 and x  r  creg  for all x  srs f  we also have ig
 x fi   ix f   where
ix is defined by 313 combining corollary 318 corollary 37 and proposition 316 we deduce
that im
 x fi ig
 x fi i1 is bounded by an integrable function on creg f  using lebesgues
dorminated convergence theorem once again we obtain
im  x f ig  x f dx  lim
 x fi ig
 x fi dx
creg f 
creg f 
therefore
i g  f f    lim i g  fi  fi 
by exchanging f and f  and using the regular semisimple support case that we have proved we draw
the conclusion
corollary 93 let m l  l g m0  x  m  srs f ell and y  l  srs f ell  then we have the
equality
dimal ag  g

l  y x

proof by lemma 832 up to mh f conjugation on x and lh f conjugation on y  we may and
shall suppose that there exist cartan subspaces c1  tell ms and c2  tell ls such that x  c1reg f 
and y  c2reg f  as in the proof of proposition 72 we can choose an open compact neighbourhood v1
of x in c1reg resp v2 of y in c2reg  such that if two elements in v1 resp v2  are hf conjugate then
they are the same let f f   cc sf  with suppf   adhf v2  and suppf    adhf v1 
by an analogous calculation to that of j g  f f   in the proof of proposition 72 with the help of
lemma 832 and proposition 413 we show the equalities
dimam ag 
i  f f   1
 x1  f ig
 x1  f  dx1
and
 x1  f  
for all x1  v1 by 712 then
dimam ag

similarly we have

m  x1  y2 ig  y2  f ig  x1  f dy2 dx1 
l  y2  x1 ig  x1  f ig  y2  f dx1 dy2 
by harishchandras submersion principle lemma 39 when f  varies the function x1 7 ix1 f   
x1 ig
 x1  f   on v1 runs over all cc v1  so the function ig
  f   on v1 also runs over all
cc v1  similarly when f varies the function ig   f  on v2 runs over all cc v2  then from the
invariant trace formula theorem 91 we deduce that
dimal ag  g
1dimam ag  g
l  y2  x1 
m  x1  y2   1
for all x1  y2   v1  v2  we conclude by x y   v1  v2

so one may apply lemma 885 to show that this expression is absolutely convergent with the help of
proposition 323 and corollary 37 one may extend in the obious way the definition 921 to the
f  m   ad where m   l h  m  
symmetric pair m
theorem 94 invariant trace formula for all f f   cc s f  we have the equality

and consulting the proof of proposition 710
10 a vanishing property at infinity
101 the case of g h the following proposition is an analogue of 9 proposition 22
proposition 101 let m  l g m0  m 6 g let x  m  srs f  and y  srs f  then there
exists n  n such that if   f  satisfies vf   n  we have
m  x y   0
remark 102 a limit formula at infinity for g
g  x y  in the spirit of laplace transform is given in
37 proposition 71 see also 36 proposition 64 which is an analogue of 33 proposition viii1
proof of proposition 101 we shall imitate the proof of 9 proposition 22
by lemma 832 up to hf conjugation on y  we may and shall suppose that there exists l 
l g m0  and an lelliptic cartan subspace c  l  s such that y  creg f  by lemma 82 we have
the equality
m  x y   m  x y 
thus it suffices to prove that there exists n  n such that if   f  satisfies vf   n  we have
 x y   0
fix an of lattice kh resp ks  of hf  resp sf  denote by kes the dual of lattice of ks in sf

which is a finite perhaps empty set for   f   choose h  n such that both of the functions
 x  and ds f are constant on y  h ks 
let f resp f    cc sf  be the characteristic function of y  h ks resp h kes  then for

fix an open neighbourhood vh of 0 in hf  which is invariant by the adjoint action of hf  such that
a homeomorphic exponential map is defined on vh  choose a  n verifying the following conditions
1 a kh  vh 
2 ka  expa kh  is a subgroup of kh 
3 nrdka   1
4 the adjoint action of ka stabilises ks and thus kes 
fix a set  of representatives in hf  of double cosets hx f hf ka  we may and shall suppose
that if x   and y  hx f xka verify ady 1 x  cf  then adx1 x  cf 
the integral in 1012 can be decomposed as
hady 1 x y if  ady 1 xnrdyvm
ydy
hx f hx f xka
by the conditions 2 3 and 4 on a respectively the factors vm
  and f  can be extracted from
the integral by comparing 1011 and 1012 since h i is invariant by the adjoint action of ka  we
obtain
1013

for x   consider the map ka  f defined by
y  ka  y 7 hadx1 x adyy i
1014
its differential at the point y0  ka is the map hf   f defined by
z  hf  z 7 hadx1 x ady0 z y i
1015
since h i is invariant by the adjoint action of gf  we see that
hadx1 x ady0 z y i  hy adxy0 1 x zi
because the restriction of h i to hf  is nondegenerate the map 1015 is not surjective if and only if
y adxy0 1 x  0
since y  creg f  this condition is equivalent to
adxy0 1 x  cf 
from our choice of  as y0  ka  it implies that
let
adx1 x  cf 
  x    adx1 x  cf 
which is a finite perhaps empty subset of  then for x      the map 1014 is a submersion
define
hx f xka 
which is an open and closed subset of hf  fix a basis of the f linear space sf  for z  sf  define
its norm kzk  r0 as the maximum of normalised absolute values of coefficients of z with respect to
the fixed basis for z  sf   0 define z  z by kzk  z f  let sx be the closure of
 ady
ady 1 x  y  
in the unit sphere ss  z  sf   kzk  1 then sx is compact recall that we denote by n s the
set of nilpotent elements in sf 
lemma 103 we have
sx  sx
 n s  0
 sx  let z  sx  there exists a sequence
proof of lemma 103 since sx  ss  it is obvious that 0 
yi  in  such that when i  
adyi
adyi1 x  z
we distinguish two cases
i suppose that the sequence kadyi1 xk remains bounded by harishchandras compactness
lemma for symmetric spaces lemma 32 the projection of the sequence yi  to hx f hf  is contained in a compact subset by taking a subsequence since the projection of  to hx f hf  is
closed we may assume that when i   adyi1 x  ady 1 x with y   thus z  sx
in this
case
ii suppose that the sequence kadyi1 xk is unbounded by taking a subsequence we may
assume that when i   kadyi1 xk   the eigenvalues of adadyi1 x are the same as
those of adx here adadyi1 x and adx are viewed as linear endomorphisms of g thus the
eigenvalues of adadyi x adyi1 x tend to zero when i   hence adz is nilpotent we
shall prove that z  n s in this case
since g is reductive one has g  z  gder  where z denotes the centre of g and gder denotes the derived
algebra of g and gder is semisimple let z  z1  z2 with z1  zf  and z2  gder f  since adz is
nilpotent as a linear endomorphism of g we deduce that adz2  is nilpotent as a linear endomorphism
of gder  as gder is semisimple we obtain that z2 is a nilpotent element in g let x  x1  x2
with x1  zf  and x2  gder f  the projection of adyi x adyi1 x to zf  is equal to
adyi x x1  which tends to zero when i   thus z1  0 and z  z2 is a nilpotent element
in g hence z  n s 
for u  n s  0 consider the map ka  f defined by
y  ka  y 7 hu adyy i
1016
its differential at the point y0  ka is the map hf   f defined by
z  hf  z 7 hu ady0 z y i  hy ady01 u  zi
by the gf invariance of h i since y  creg f  and ady01 u   n s  0 we have
y ady01 u  6 0
then the map 1016 is a submersion by the nondegeneration of h i on hf 
using lemma 103 and combining our discussion on the maps 1014 and 1016 we deduce that
there exists an open compact neighbourhood sf
x of sx in ss such that the map   ka  sx  f  sx
defined by
y z  ka  sf
x  y z 7 hz adyy i z
is a submersion since any submersion is open the image of  denoted by im is an open compact
subset of f  sf
x  then the map  induces a surjective submersion   ka  sx  im applying
harishchandras submersion principle 17 theorem 11 to   there exists a function   cc im
such that for all   cc im
t z t zdzdt
 hz adyy i zdzdy 
ka sf
fix such a  denote by c f  sf
x  the space of locally constant complexedvalued functions on
f  sx  for   c f  sx  the restriction of  to im belongs to cc im so we obtain
t zt zdzdt
hz adyy i zdzdy 
f sf
ka sf
by taking t z  tz with   f and   cc sf
x  we deduce that for all z  sx 
t ztdt
hz adyy idy 
since im is an open compact subset of f  sf
x  we see that   cc im  cc f  sx  
cj  j  j with cj  c j  cc f  and j  cc sx  then
cc f   cc sx  suppose that  
1jm
t ztdt 
cj j j z
1jm
where j 
is the fourier transform of j  we see that there exists n0  n such that for all
  f  satisfying vf   n0 and all z  sx  we have
hz adyy idy  0
cc f 
fix such an n0 
recall that for x  
ix 
hz adyy idy
where   adx
ix  0 if
and z  adx
set
adx1 x for x      we have z  sx  so
vf   adx1 x  n0 
0  sup adx1 x
which is finite thanks to harishchandras compactness lemma for symmetric spaces lemma 32 now
let
n  n0  0 
 x y   0 it suffices to prove vm
x  0 for
suppose that vf   n  from 1013 to show m
all x   
for x    we have adx1 x  creg f  then adx1 hx   tc  since x  m  srs f 
we see that adx1 am  is an f split torus in tc  as c  l  s is lelliptic al is the maximal
f split torus in tc  thus adx1 am   al  then am  adxal   adxam0  we deduce
that adxam0  is a maximal f split torus in mh  so it is mh f conjugate to am0  therefore
x  mh f normhf  m0   mh f kh  consequently we have vm
x  0 and conclude
102 the case of g  h  
f  srs f  and x  srs f  then there
proposition 104 let m   l h m0  m  6 h   let y  m
exists n  n such that if   f satisfies vf   n  we have
m  y x  0
proof it is almost the same as the proof of proposition 101 except that one needs to use lemma 882
and lemma 87
