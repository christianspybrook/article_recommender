1 introduction
historically power grids have grown from simple localized grids to large physically widespread grids often spanning multiple nations or even whole continents 1 despite its
importance to modern society the energy sector has adapted
slower than other industries to digital technology due to its size
and need for high system availability because of the need
for more efficiency digital technology gets more widespread
and new technologies in the power grid heavily rely on highfrequency monitoring cycles and adaptation to bottlenecks in
the grid 2 this trend is boosted with the rise of renewable
energy ranging from large offshore wind farms matching the
power generation of traditional power plants to a single household feeding solar energy into the grid 3 4 which leads to
power generation becoming more distributed and thus less reliable resulting in difficult to organize transmission and distribution of energy 5 6
this results in a less controllable situation than in the past
when only a small number of bulk power production plants
were required while increasing power demands can be satisfied with more traditional or renewable power plants the grid
itself needs to support the transportation of the generated power
however extending the grid by adding new lines is prohibitively
expensive and often slowed down eg by regulations or resistance of residents fortunately digital technology can aid in
better utilizing the existing grid leading to an increased deployment of digital technology to control monitor and maintain transmission and distribution of power 7
this increasing use of digital technology requires more and
more networking capabilities and connects previously isolated
components with larger communication networks 810 re
sulting in a large variety of new dataflows 11 the resulting
increasing interconnection of power grids raises severe security concerns 12 protocols and systems originally developed
for power grids were not designed with security in mind yet
these systems are still used alongside modern technology and
increasingly exposed to outside networks such as the internet
likewise the increasing use of digital and decentralized technology provides a larger attack surface 1315 indeed different cyber attacks have successfully targeted essential parts of
the power grid 16 17 resulting disruptions and widescale
outages of electrical power have extensive social and economic
consequences 18
contributions this paper specifically targets the security challenges originating from the increasing interconnection of power
grids especially at the transmission and distribution level to
this end we motivate the need for cybersecurity when operating power grids and outline promising approaches that improve
security at different levels of abstraction more specifically our
contributions in this paper are
1 we provide a highlevel overview over the communication infrastructure of power grids and derive resulting
fundamental challenges wrt cybersecurity risks section 2
2 as a foundation to secure power grids we identify a comprehensive set of attack vectors and scenarios based on
these security challenges section 3
3 we distill and discuss promising approaches that provide
security for interconnected power grids to protect against
serious attack vectors and scenarios section 4
figure 1 a simplified view of a tsodso network separated into office network connected to the internet typical data processing tasks and process control
network scada traffic connecting the control room with substations and field devices while data should only be exchanged through a dedicated data exchange
server in reality these networks are often interconnected eg with vpns
as such our contributions are relevant for both cybersecurity researchers who are usually not familiar with the processes
and terminology of electrical engineering as well as electrical
engineers and power grid operators who have a decent understanding of power grids but are often unaware of the extent and
specifics of cybersecurity challenges
2 communication infrastructure of power grids and resulting cybersecurity challenges
with the increasing digitalization of power grids operators
are confronted with rapid changes regarding the amount of necessary communication and the means through which this communication is conducted as a result more and more communication is introduced to power grids in the following we first
describe the communication infrastructure of power grids before focusing on the fundamental security challenges resulting
from an increasing interconnection of power grids
we use the term grid exclusively to refer to the power grid
and the term network for digital communication networks furthermore the information contained in this paper mainly focuses on european power grids however many of the proposed changes to cybersecurity also apply to other regions in
this context we refer to transmission of power as the transportation of energy over long distances eg between distant cities
not within a city and distribution of power as the transportation on a local scale such as a single city or small region the
transmission of power is overseen by transmission system operators tso while the distribution of power is carried out by
distribution system operators dso
21 communication infrastructure of power grids
to illustrate the typical communication infrastructure found
in power grids we provide a simplified view of the network of
a grid operator ie a tso or dso in figure 1 typical to
such a network is the separation between office network and
process control network pcn the office network is similar to
any usual corporate network with eg email traffic or data processing contrary the pcn connects the control room of grid
operation companies with their substations and field devices
typically using dnp3 19 north america and parts of asia
or iec 608705104 20 rest of the world as protocol resulting control messages are usually interpreted by a programmable
logic controller plc and then passed to the process layer
the control room typically contains a humanmachine interface hmi a database db server managing grid information
and a simulation server for precomputing the effects of grid
changes furthermore the control room is connected to multiple substations each containing at least a gateway an hmi
and multiple plcs and can be coupled with other tsodso
scada systems for mutual control
data exchange between office network and pcn should only
be handled through a dedicated data exchange server where every file is checked for malware before being passed through
sometimes though as seen in the ukraine attacks 16 there
are other communication channels such as vpns which allow
direct communication between the office network and the pcn
or remote maintenance lines for vendors or contractors
22 fundamental cybersecurity challenges
while the increasing digitalization of power grids is necessary to deal with changing power demands and generation
it raises fundamental security challenges in the following we
introduce and highlight the most important challenges or mechanisms in electrical power grids impacting cybersecurity
221 cia triad availability is key
the triad of confidentiality integrity and availability cia
21 as the fundamental concept of information security has to
be interpreted slightly differently in the energy sector in traditional cybersecurity it is generally preferable to ensure confidentiality and integrity and sacrifice some availability in
power grids however availability is by far the most important
measure of the triad as the consequences of downtimes can be
severe 18 the longer a blackout lasts and the more of the
grid is affected the harder it is to rebuild the grid 22 to illustrate the race for availability the german power grid had an
endconsumer availability of 999995 in 2017 23 compared
to the allegedly highly available google services with 99978
no scheduled downtime 24 when measured in time the
power grid has a more than 45fold higher availability as
availability is the most important measure in power grids any
measures ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of systems
should never interfere with the availability of power delivery
222 balancing generation and consumption
electrical power grids rely on a stable grid frequency of either 50 hz or 60 hz due to the use of alternating current the
frequency is only stable if power generation and consumption
are at an equilibrium if more power is generated than consumed the frequency rises and vice versa
the operation reserve ensures the equilibrium between production and consumption at any given time in europe the operation reserve is separated in three different stages primary
operation reserve secondaryreserve and minute reserve the
primary control is a continuous frequency load control where
the controller is implemented as a droop control distributed to
different power plants thereby the amount of primary operation reserve is 3 gw which is the power rating of two mayor
generation units eg nuclear power plants the secondaryreserve and minutereserve will be activated if the frequency
derivation holds on more specifically the secondary reserve
has to be activated after 5 minutes of frequency derivation and
will be replaced by the minute reserve after 15 minutes these
are both activated centrally by the grid operator in whose grid
area the power deviation occurred however at deviations of
1 hz either some consumers possibly multiple cities have to
be disconnected from the grid in case of decreased grid frequency or power plants have to be downregulated to save the
generators from damage 25 26
the sensitive equilibrium between generation and consumption can be exploited by attackers as they only need to control
a comparably small amount of consumption or generation to
use cascading effects within the grid to create a systemwide
blackout 27 28 as power generation and consumption in the
operating reserve have time delays
223 decentralization of power generation
the rise of renewable energy has empowered many individuals and companies to enter the energy sector 29 for example individual households can now feed their excess solar energy into the grid naturally the security of their systems is not
as tightly controlled as those of traditional energy companies
as a result the hardware and software use by individuals to operate power generation are often not as secure as it should be
or misconfigured 30 potentially impacting transmission and
distribution in the grid
assuming a vulnerability in a large number of eg solar
installations is found attackers may control the power fed into
the grid consequently an attacker can do considerable damage even when controlling only a comparably small section
of the grid by exploiting cascading effects see above 29
by controlling the feeding of power into the grid an attacker
could exploit these cascading effects with the goal to cause
a systemwide blackout impacting distribution and transmission 27 28
224 no security in process control networks
most devices used in power grids such as protection devices or plcs are designed for multipledecade use often
they are neither patched nor replaced the most widespread
protocols are dnp3 19 mostly used in north america and
parts of asia and iec 608705104 20 predominantly used
by the rest of the world these protocols have been developed
more than 20 years ago with no security concerns in mind 31
despite their widespread use by dsos and tsos neither protocol supports basic security mechanisms such as authentication or integrity protection which have been taken for granted
for years in other commercial sectors for example iec 608705104 20 as used by dsos and tsos is susceptible to maninthemiddle denialofservice replay and spoofing attacks 32
34 similar observations have been made for the dnp3 19
protocol 3537 while the standard iec 62351 provides additional cybersecurity concepts 38 it is not yet supported by
many devices and networks such that its deployment is rather
slow or even nonexistent
as grid operators often use their own separated networks
over dedicated physical cables they could neglect further security mechanisms in the past leading to networks which do
not necessarily use cryptography authentication or integrity
checks past attacks have shown that office networks connected to the internet are often not sufficiently separated from
the pcn allowing attackers lateral movement between the two
networks 16 once an attacker gains access to an unsecured
pcn simple tools enabling communication in the specific protocol may be used to control devices crucial for grid operation
225 difficulties of physical network changes
field devices in power grids have planned lifetimes which
are measured not in years but decades 39 information technology has much faster development cycles allowing the development of attacks for devices which may have to be in use for
many more years it is very unlikely that all energy companies
will be able to always follow current security bestpractices by
simply exchanging devices for newer models which eg support more modern protocols such as iec 61850 40
if possible at all modern security mechanisms have to be
implemented in software only and run on the available hardware or be able to interface directly with the specialized devices
used by grid operation companies without affecting the availability of electricity supply however many devices in use may
not have the computational power to support additional security functionality 4145 even if certain devices are eventually exchanged or upgraded with new software they are often
required to support legacy protocols to be able to communicate with older devices still relying on these protocols consequently distribution and transmission system operators suffer
from the wellknown problem of insecurity by inheritance 46

table 1 classification of attack vectors specific to the energy sector and power grids
226 weakest link problem
for attacks to have devastating consequences an attacker
does not have to target the largest grid operator as long as the
victim of an attack has control over enough power to affect the
grid frequency the attacker can leverage cascading effects to affect the whole power grid as smaller operators often lack the
means to harden their devices and networks as much as larger
operators such targets may be more attractive to attackers furthermore attacks do not have to be limited to grid operators
an attacker controlling a larger number of consumer electronics eg solar power cells might still be able to influence the
frequency within the grid 28
as a result there is a need to develop solutions which can
be used by all relevant actors in interconnected power grids and
are not only deployable by larger grid operators
3 attack vectors and scenarios
practical cybersecurity in interconnected power grids is impacted by a diverse set of fundamental security challenges cf
section 22 as a foundation to overcome these challenges and
thus provide security for distribution and transmission grids we
now identify attack vectors and attack scenarios that result from
the fundamental security challenges in the following we first
discuss the most important attack vectors before we present the
attack scenarios enabled by these vectors
31 attack vectors in distribution and transmission grids
attackers can leverage different attack vectors to compromise the network of a transmission or distribution system operator with the goal of causing a blackout or at least considerable disturbance in the power grid to achieve this goal an
attacker will likely aim to compromise the pcn of the target
system from there the attacker can compromise substations
or field devices thus gaining control over parts of the grid in
the following we discuss the most important attack vectors an
attacker can exploit to access a pcn we provide a summary of
our classification of attack vectors in table 1
311 lateral movement from the office network
in the attacks on ukrainian grid operators in 2015 16
attackers gained access to the pcn through lateral movement
from the office network cf figure 1 allowing communications between pcnconnected devices and the office network
might be necessary eg to transfer certain information such as
environment data between office network and control room an
attacker can comprise an office network eg by sending spearphishing emails to certain employees or by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications such as web browsers or office suites 47
once access to a machine in the office network has been gained
the attacker can passively listen for user credentials and search
for eg a vpn tunnel to the pcn lateral movement from the
office network is one of the most dangerous attack vectors for
power system operators an attack would however be limited
to a single network
312 physical access
energy providers often use their own dedicated cable networks for pcn communications cf section 224 while this
certainly provides an extra level of security it does not offer
any protection once an attacker has gained physical access to
one device in the network for example substations are usually connected to the pcn and are controlled remotely without
personnel being present therefore an attacker can gain physical access to the network by breaking into a substation and
then manually use available systems or connect its own device
to the pcn 48 breakins in substations already happen today 49 50 although mostly with the intention to steal and
then sell copper cables 48 51 hence such a theft could be
used as camouflage by cyber attackers to deter grid operators
from even looking for traces of a cyber attack such an attack could have a large influence on grid operations but does
not scale well as it necessitates physical presence at possibly
multiple substations
313 remote maintenance access
manufacturers of control room software and hardware usually have a maintenance contract with the grid operators using
their systems to be able to debug these systems remotely or to
deploy software updates these systems are typically equipped
with some form of remote maintenance access 52 depending on the technology used and security measures in place attackers may try to exploit this maintenance access to gain access to the pcn such maintenance access is typically hardened
against cyber attacks however if a vulnerability is found an
attack could have a considerable impact at multiple operators
and wideranging control over the pcn is likely as an example in 2014 icscert reported on a security breach at a public
utility where the attacker used standard brute forcing techniques
to gain access to a passwordprotected remote access 53 the
risk of this attack vector is further illustrated by an incident
from 2013 in which attackers compromised a vendor of a large
power producer in the us and canada to exfiltrate passwords
potentially used for remote maintenance access 54
314 thirdparty exploit
attack vectors are not limited to the premises of grid operators in fact exploiting thirdparties such as suppliers or
subcontractors is one of the most dangerous and hard to control attack vectors for example the actors behind the dragonfly malware which specifically targets energy systems compromised three different manufacturers of ics equipment and
inserted their malware into software available on the manufacturers websites 55 likewise for the attack on the ukrainian
power grid in 2016 17 attackers compromised manufacturers of field devices and manipulated firmware update installers
on the publicly available websites of the manufacturers employees at the affected dso then downloaded and deployed
these updates consequently unknowingly installing the attackers malware which allowed the attackers to gain access to pcnconnected devices
moreover in case the manufacturer of the control room
software is compromised attackers may have direct access to
the remote maintenance access of multiple grid operators this
becomes especially relevant when relying on cloud resources
39 56 57 in a different case the turbine control system of
a power company in the united state was unintentionally infected with a virus through an infected usb drive plugged in
by a thirdparty technician during maintenance 58 a special
case of a thirdparty exploit would be a compromise of the supply chain during the manufacturing of field devices if attackers
are able to tamper with devices before they are installed at the
grid operator they might eg install a covert channel for remote access the impact of such an attack would be high and
could result in extensive access to the pcn a single exploit
could be used to gain control over multiple grid operators
315 overcoming air gap
even if pcns are airgapped ie physically isolated from
other networks such as the office network to prevent lateral
movement attackers can still try to attack a pcn by strategically placing usb drives containing malware around a facility
they are targeting consequently curious or helpful employees may unknowingly compromise airgapped systems by connecting such drives to devices in company networks such an
attack would likely be local in scope with a medium impact
as attackers could only execute previously determined attacks
because of the air gap there will be no immediate feedback on
the attacks success to an adversary indeed malwareinfected
usb drives are one suspected attack vector of stuxnet 59 60
notably airgapped systems in areas with even stronger security requirements such as military bases 61 or the international
space station 62 have shown to be susceptible to such attacks
especially using usb drives
316 insider attack
if an attacker already works within the energy sector or
compromises an employee of a grid operator the attacker might
have direct access to the control room or field devices and could
therefore directly control devices or introduce malware even to
airgapped systems insider attacks are hard to predict and protect against in the case of an insider no further compromise of
systems may be necessary as the attacker has legitimate access
to the pcn different examples of disgruntled employees misusing their authority have been reported by brdiczka 63 for
example a disgruntled employee caused a power outage during
the 2002 winter olympics by knocking out a substation in salt
lake city 48 an insider attack can have a high impact on the
grid especially since insiders typically have decent knowledge
of the inner workings of grids and potential security measures
in place thus being able to carefully pick their target
317 cascading effects
instead of having to compromise the network of one or more
grid operators an attacker may leverage cascading effects in
the power grid to cause a power outage cf section 2 for
example by remotely gaining control over a large number of
consumer electronics such as solar power cells 64 an attacker
can take advantage of the mechanics of the operating reserve
to influence the frequency within the grid 28 there are also
companies that centrally manage many distributed solar or wind
plants eg within the scope of a virtual power plant 65 a
compromise at one of these service providers may allow attackers to leverage similar effects an attack exploiting cascading
effects could be global in scale with a medium to high impact
depending on the amount of power under the attackers control but has a high technical difficulty as a comparably large
number of devices has to be exploited and controlled simultaneously however already today larger botnets eg conficker
hajime or wannacry control hundreds of thousands to millions of devices 6669 making such attacks less unlikely than
it appears the problem might further exaggerate with the rise
of electric mobility as electric cars as well as their charging infrastructure 70 will be networked facing their own cybersecurity risks combined with a high amount of energy consumption
under their control
32 attack scenarios
different vectors can be used to attack distribution and transmission systems to disrupt vital control systems we assume an
attacker accessing a pcn to aim at disrupting the power grid
and do not specifically consider pure passive attacks such as industrial espionage in the following we briefly discuss the three
most important methods an attacker with access to the pcn can
employ
321 disconnecting resources
if an attacker has gained full access to the pcn we can
assume that the attacker is able to send arbitrary control commands to connected control systems since commonly used communication protocols lack even basic authentication or authorization features thus an attacker can eg control switches in
substations which disconnect entire power lines or power plants
from the grid possibly leading to an immediate loss of the
power supply to consumers in the attack on ukraine in 2015
225 000 consumers were disconnected from the grid as attackers were able to control switches in multiple substations 16
policies procedures  awareness
physical security
network security
device  application security
322 injecting false information
if an attacker can only gain control over a small subset of
field devices he can still indirectly influence the power grid
eg by sending forged or manipulated sensor readings to the
control room 71 72 the operators in the control room may
act on the wrong data and take steps to correct a nonexistent
problem 73 74 which may lead to disruption in the power
grid eg unintentionally overloading a power line because sensor readings show a normal load depending on the sophistication of the attack scada software may be able to identify a
problem through bad data detection algorithms however these
have been shown to not always be effective 75
323 denial of service
even if attackers neither have full access to the pcn nor can
inject false information they may still be able to manipulate
certain devices and effectively render them nonfunctional resulting in a denial of service attack against parts of the power
grid 71 for example in the attacks on the ukraine power grid
in 2016 17 the crashoverride malware used by the attackers was able to disable siemens siprotec devices manipulate the firmware of serialtoethernet devices and hence
disrupt crucial substation functions such as protection automation or measurement in future attacks similar methods could
eg allow attackers to overload power lines even if these are
secured by protection devices potentially leading to physical
damage
4 providing cybersecurity for interconnected power grids
given the tremendous threats resulting from the diverse set
of attack vectors and scenarios providing security for power
transmission and distribution within the grid is a paramount
objective we claim that future improvements in the security
of power grids will have to be a combination of technical approaches awareness measures and closer collaboration between
the electrical engineering community and cybersecurity experts
to provide a way forward for security in interconnected power
grids we thus identify a set of diverse security solutions and
approaches including both security software as well as organizational measures such as security training which complement
each other nicely more specifically we draw from the principle
of defenseindepth 7678 as illustrated in figure 2 to provide a comprehensive set of security measures at different layers these measures encompass approaches for i device and
application security ii network security iii physical security as well as iv policies procedures and awareness while
discussing all four aspects in more detail in the following we
specifically focus on approaches to provide network security
since the need to protect communication becomes especially
important with an increasing interconnection of power grids
figure 2 following the principle of defenseindepth providing security for
interconnected power grids needs to encompass a comprehensive set of measures for i device and application security ii network security iii physical
security as well as iv policies procedures and awareness
41 device  application security
as a foundation to provide defenseindepth all devices and
applications deployed in power grids have to be secured this
becomes especially important considering an increasing interconnection in power grids thus exposing potentially vulnerable
devices and applications to larger attack surfaces especially in
the context of interconnected power grids one promising approach consists of device and application diversity ie using
a wide range of different hardware and software to thwart a
worstcase scenario where malware pervasively compromises
all equipment 79 before integrating new devices into the network or deploying updates to devices static firmware analysis 80 can be used to detect susceptibility to vulnerabilities as
well as malware and default credentials contained in a firmware
image following a different direction security assessments allow to additionally detect insecure configurations and test for
vulnerabilities at runtime 8183 such approaches also show
promising benefits for device and application security in power
grids 84 85
once firmware has been analyzed assessed for security
and subsequently deployed on devices controlling the power
grid such as plcs operators have to ensure that the applications running on these devices do not get compromised to this
end different approaches for hardwarebased 86 or softwarebased 87 remote code attestation allow to verify the integrity
of code its execution and updates within the context of interconnected power grids remote attestation can eg be used
to detect compromised devices based on changes in their physical memory 79 88 likewise hardware performance counters
can be utilized to detect modifications in firmware of critical infrastructure components 89 from a different angle and complementing approaches to provide network security deploying
security agents to individual components such as plcs aids in
applying security patches maintaining endtoendsecurity as
well as managing alarms 9092
42 network security
the increasing use of digital technology in power grids demands for more and more networking capabilities resulting
in the connection of previously isolated components to larger
communication networks 8 10 to address resulting security
concerns we require methods to proactively prevent security
incidents most prominently using network separation and to
detect security incidents that successfully bypassed preventive
measures using intrusion detection systems
421 network separation
traditional network separation through demilitarized zones
dmz and virtual networks is a standard tool for securing networks these techniques make it harder for attackers to get
a comprehensive view of the network through simple reconnaissance methods and restrict lateral movement within the network dmz and virtual networks are already used today by grid
operators 84 and their deployment is often enforced through
laws 93 more recently softwaredefined networking sdn
provides a more flexible alternative to dmz and virtual networks which are usually configured once at the creation of a
network and cannot easily be changed during operation with
sdn changes to network separation can be configured quickly
eg to counter cyber attacks likewise sdn can be used to
enforce network compliant behavior eg specified using communication rules by the operator of the communication network 94 95 dong et al 96 and white et al 97 provide
more information on the opportunities and challenges of using
sdn for smart grid resilience the main challenges of sdn approaches for securing power grids result from availability concerns of grid operators
422 intrusion detection systems
intrusion detection systems ids are used in most company networks to detect attackers through suspicious network
activities 98 99 while not all companies in the energy sector
are using ids to secure their pcns today often citing availability concerns we assess that ids are especially wellsuited to
provide security in interconnected power grids in contrast to
office networks of large companies traffic in pcns is well defined as only certain protocols are used and in most cases any
piece of software or hardware communicating over the network
is known in advance 100 an ids in a pcn can therefore be
much more restrictive without affecting operations than in an
office network where a large number of protocols and devices
might communicate with each other and unknown internet endpoints still an attacker doing active reconnaissance eg a
port scan could even easily be detected by a simple traditional
ids which is not specialized on industrial control systems
existing ids deployments can be classified into networkbased and hostbased approaches 77 we assess that combining both approaches to secure pcns offers significantly more
value than relying on a single approach only furthermore distributed and processaware ids allow to further strengthen security in interconnected power grids in the following we discuss the different approaches for ids and their application to
the energy sector
most of the communication in a pcn in the energy sector
is conducted between the control room and substations or field
devices consequently a networkbased ids nids should be
deployed at nodes in the network such as switches to be able to
monitor any traffic within the pcn especially those sent from
the control room or towards it such an ids can then easily
detect reconnaissance measures eg port scans moreover as
traffic in pcns is well defined a networkbased ids can detect
further suspicious network activity eg an increase in the number of packets sent from a network node or communication between network nodes that have not communicated beforehand
an emerging challenge in nids within a pcn is the question
of how to cope with the ever changing and dynamic smart grid
environment 72 98
a hostbased ids hids runs on a single host in a networked environment and is therefore only able to monitor the
incoming and outgoing traffic on this device but in contrast
to nids hids also monitor log files system policies and
other relevant data concerning the host they are installed on
these systems should be used wherever possible to supplement
networkbased ids in the pcn not all switches in a network
may offer a monitoring port or there might be other restrictions
why networkbased systems cannot be used for parts of the network in such cases hids can be used to still monitor most
parts of the traffic hids can eg detect and block a denialofservice attack targeting a device within the pcn however
within a pcn a challenge for hids are the specialized hardware used it will only be possible to install hostbased ids on
a certain subset of systems for highly atrisk hardware eg
some plcs a hostbased ids could be implemented by using
a gateway between the network and the plc to monitor any
incoming and outgoing traffic 101
a distributed ids for the power grid combines networkbased and hostbased ids and centrally aggregates and correlates data provided by the systems distributed within the pcn
102 such a distributed ids allows a more complete view on
the traffic within the pcn compared to many individual systems attacks from multiple points within the network can be
correlated and dealt with more specifically moreover compromised devices may be more easily identified the collected data
can be processed at a central location and could be used to help
the operators in the control room to make wellfounded decisions a major challenge for distributed ids within a pcn is
the placement of the nodes as this influences the quality of the
aggregated data
a processaware ids employs context information about
the environment in which it is placed chromik et al 103 recently developed such a system for local substation networks
in their approach which employs the eventbased network security monitor bro now zeek 104 they check incoming control commands for consistency with safety requirements and
physical constraints their approach maintains a model of the
local system which is updated through sensor readings and
commands sent through the iec 608705104 protocol at the
current stage inconsistent commands yield an alert message
which has to be acted on manually such systems could eg
be extended to block commands if their execution would lead to
an inconsistent state especially when adapted to more modern
grid communication protocols
the concept of processaware ids is especially interesting
in a scada and industrial control systems ics environment
where valid traffic is welldefined and commands lead to physical changes in the controlled system 105 in combination with
distributed ids such approaches can lead to substantially more
secure grids while introducing a minimum of extra hardware
into the pcn however the main challenge for deploying such
a system lies in the considerable knowledge which is required
about the individual environment future work is necessary to
automatically adapt to differences between grid operators eg
wrt used hardware software protocols and topologies
43 physical security
as grid operators often use their own physical networks for
communication physical security is directly related to cybersecurity for example a motivated attacker could break into
a substation and infect local devices with malware or tamper
with the available access to the pcn in another way physical
security for substations differs widely between grid operators
but might be as low as a wire fence paired with no means of
surveillance or access control 49 recommended measures to
ensure physical security for substations include the protection
of information on substations such as engineering drawings and
power flow models surveillance and monitoring measures such
as video cameras and motion detectors as well as the restriction
of physical access 50
more sophisticated physical security may not only deter attackers but also act as a part of a general ids for example if
a physical security violation is detected at a substation 106
subsequent malicious activities in the pcn could be correlated
with this violation helping in attack response a major challenge will be integrating automatically detected physical security violations 106 into an overall security solution involving intrusion detection on the network side with an increasing integration of novel easilyaccessible assets such as smart
meters 107 and charging infrastructure for electronic vehicles 70 108 into the communication infrastructure of smart
grids the challenge of physical security further exaggerates
44 policies procedures  awareness
to date the most devastating cyber attacks on power grids
all specifically exploited human behavior either through spearphishing most prominently using emails or manipulated downloads 16 17 these problems cannot solely be solved by using
more sophisticated security technology consequently employees need to be trained to increase awareness towards securityrelated behavior 109
especially workers who have direct access to vital equipment need to be aware of social engineering techniques and
empowered to detect simple attacks such as spearphishing for
example phishing experiments are valuable to raise employees
awareness for spearphishing at companies in the energy sector 110 however as long as office networks and operational
networks are not completely separated which might be difficult
to achieve a general increase in security awareness is necessary to increase overall security a challenge of securityrelated
awareness training is its adaptation to the constantly changing
cyber attack landscape
additionally even with the best security measures and awareness trainings in place eventually a potential security incident
will occur 111 as such corresponding incident response
plans and guidelines need to be created maintained and trained
however most existing guidelines for responding to security
incidents are mainly concerned with information chains and organizational processes 112 113 and not with actually remedying security incidents
consequently grid operators need to develop and maintain
actionable incident response plans and guidelines supporting
their employees with precise instructions also at the technical
level on how to react to security incidents to further decrease
incident response times it is recommended to keep the number
of involved parties small eg by operating own networks and
thus reduce the need for synchronization and communication
during incident response 111 notably proper preparation
for cybersecurity incidents also requires to regularly train the
response to cybersecurity incidents eg using a corresponding training simulator 114 115 to be valuable for training
employees of grid operators such training environments need
to closely model typical process control network as found in
power grids 12 116
5 conclusion
with increasing digitalization and decentralization grid operators are faced with rapid changes in the amount of necessary
communication and how this communication is conducted as
a result more networking is introduced creating a wider attack
space for attackers in this paper we highlighted resulting fundamental security problems and attack vectors which still have
to be addressed in the coming years in order to maintain a high
level of security and availability of power grids as a critical infrastructure
to provide security in interconnected power grids we discussed a set of diverse security solutions and approaches depending on the country and the specific grid operation company
current security measures range from nonexistent to stateoftheart however even if attackers are only able to control a
small fraction of the power generation or consumption they can
still leverage mechanisms inherent to todays large power grids
to cause considerable damage thus only an overall increase in
the security of a countrys power grid provides an effective defense against sophisticated attacks consequently we identified
a combination of software and organizational approaches including intrusion detection systems softwaredefined networking and awareness training as promising candidates for achieving this goal
the cyber landscape within power grids is drastically changing to continually provide ubiquitous power new cybersecurity threats have to be taken into consideration and protected
against achieving these goals requires tight collaboration between cybersecurity experts and grid operators to develop and
implement cybersecurity solutions that are tailored to the unique
requirements of power grids to this end our theoretical contributions consolidated in this survey paper provide the foundation for deeper practical research and experimental studies to
pave the way forward to provide a high level of cybersecurity
for interconnected power grids
