introduction
exotic mesons containing four quarks of different flavors are interesting members in the family of xy z
mesons analyses of such structures were triggered by
information of the d0 collaboration about evidence for
the state x5568 composed presumably of four different
quarks 1 later other collaborations could not confirm
existence of this state 2 3 but knowledge gained due
to theoretical studies of x5568 methods and schemes
elaborated during this process played an important role
in our understanding of exotic mesons
new stage in this field began recently by discovery of the lhcb collaboration which reported about
new resonancelike structures x01 2900 in the process b   d d k  4 5 they were seen in the
mass distribution of mesons d k   and may be considered as first strong evidence for exotic mesons composed
of four quarks of different flavors indeed from decay
modes of these states it is clear that they contain valence quarks udcs which makes them objects of intensive
studies but one should bear in mind that x01 2900
may have alternative origin and appear due to rescat0
tering diagrams c1 d k  and dsj d1 k 0 in the decay
b   d d k  6
masses and spinparities of these structures were determined by lhcb and used in various models to explain internal organizations of x01 2900 as usual they were
interpreted as hadronic molecules diquarkantidiquark
states and rescattering effects see refs 7 8 and references therein in our articles 7 8 we treated x0 2900
and x1 2900 as a scalar hadronic molecule d k 0 and
diquarkantidiquark vector states udcs respectively
predictions for their masses and widths extracted from
sum rule analyses seem confirm assumptions made on
their structures
it is clear that resonances x01 2900 are neutral
states and emerge in intermediate phase of the decay
chain b   d x  d d k   in accordance with
ref 9 these processes occur due to colorfavored and
colorsuppressed transformations but weak decays of
b  meson with the same topologies may trigger also processes b   d z   d d k   in this chain an
intermediate particle z  is an exotic meson with quark
content ucsd carrying two units of electric charge in
our view b meson weak decays which are already under detailed analysis and collected experimental data
may be used to uncover doubly charged tetraquarks
z   ucsd with different spinparities these new
scalar and vector particles may appear as resonances in
the d k  mass distribution this fact is a main motivation for present studies
doubly charged diquarkantidiquarks already attracted interests of researches and some of these states
was studied in a rather detailed form thus spectroscopic parameters and strong decays of pseudoscalar
tetraquarks ccss and ccds were calculated in ref 10
doubly charged scalar pseudoscalar and axialvector
states zcs  sduc were considered in our article 11
results obtained for their masses and widths read
mzs  2628166
153 mev zs  6689  1511 mev
mzps  2719144
156 mev zps  381  71 mev
mzav  2826134
157 mev zav  473  111 mev
where subscripts zs  zps and zav refer to the scalar
pseudoscalar and axialvector tetraquarks zcs  respectively
the positively charged counterparts of zcs are
tetraquarks z  with the same characteristics and spinparities therefore one can safely use parameters of particles zcs to study exotic mesons z   it is not difficult
to see that scalar and vector states zs and zv
decay
to ordinary mesons ds  and d k  for zs these
modes are swave decays whereas for zv
they are p wave processes in the present work we are going to find
parameters of the vector tetraquark zv
 the mass of
zv should be around or larger than mzav  therefore
even without detailed analysis one sees that decays to final mesons ds   and d k  are among kinematically
allowed modes of zv
 in other words the states zs
and zv may be seen in d k  mass distribution in the
decay b   d d k  
we compute spectroscopic parameters and full width
of the vector tetraquark zv
using various versions of
the qcd sum rule method thus the mass and current
coupling of zv
are found by employing the qcd twopoint sum rule approach 12 13 in our analysis we
take into account contributions of various vacuum condensates up to dimension 10 prediction for the mass
of zv
 as well as its quantum numbers j p  1 permit us to classify kinematically allowed decay modes of
this tetraquark the mass and coupling of zv
are also
input parameters necessary to calculate partial widths
2317 
of the decays zv
 ds1 2460    ds0
d k  and ds   to this end we explore vertices of
with ordinary mesons for example zv
d k 
and find corresponding strong couplings relevant investigations are carried out using the qcd lightcone sum
rule lcsr method which is one of effective nonperturbative tools to study conventional hadrons 14 in the
case of tetraquarkordinary meson vertices the standard
methods of lcsr have to be applied in conjunction with
a softmeson approximation 15 16 for analysis of the
exotic mesons the lightcone sum rule method and soft
approximation was suggested in ref 17 and used to
investigate decays of various tetraquarks 18
this paper is structured in the following manner section ii is devoted to calculations of the mass and cou
pling of the vector tetraquark zv
 ucsd in section
iii we compute strong couplings in relevant tetraquark
meson vertices and evaluate partial widths of zv
cays the full width of zv is found in this section as
well section iv is reserved for our conclusions and final
notes
the spectroscopic parameters of
the mass m and current coupling f are important pa
rameters of the vector tetraquark zv
 ucsd in
what follows we omit superscripts denoting charges of
the tetraquark and various mesons we use the qcd
twopoint sum rule method to evaluate values of these
parameters
we begin calculations from analysis of the twopoint
correlation function
 p  i d4 xeipx h0t j xj 00i
where j x is the interpolating current for zv  and
t denotes the timeordered product of two currents
the vector tetraquark zv can be modeled using a scalar
diquark uc5 c and vector antidiquark s 5 cd it is
known that colorantitriplet diquarks and colortriplet
antidiquarks are most stable twoquark structures 19
therefore we chose as building blokes of zv struct
tures abc ub c5 cc and amn sm  5 cdn  which belongs
to 3c  and 3c  representations of the color group suc 3
respectively then the colorless interpolating current
j x takes the form
j x  e
utb xc5 cc xsm x 5 cdn x
where e
  abc amn  and a b c m and n denote quark
colors in eq 3 ux cx sx and dx are the quark
fields and c stands for the chargeconjugation operator
the sum rules for m and f can be derived by calculating  p in terms of the physical parameters of zv 
as well as in the operator product expansion ope with
certain accuracy having equated these two expressions
applied the borel transformation to suppress contributions of higher resonances and continuum states and
subtracted these contributions using the quarkhadron
duality assumption 12 13 it is possible to get required
sum rules for the mass and coupling of the tetraquark
zv 
expression of  p in terms of parameters of zv is
obtained by saturating the correlation function  p
with a complete set of j p  1 states and performing in
eq 2 integration over x
phys
 p 
h0j zv ihzv j 0i
m2  p 2
where the dots stand for contributions of higher resonances and continuum states
to proceed it is convenient to introduce the matrix
element
h0j zv i  f m 
where  is the polarization vector of the tetraquark zv 
then phys
 p can be rewritten in the following form
phys

the twocomponent lorentz structure in the parentheses
in eq 6 corresponds to a vector particle the first component of this structure is proportional to g and does
not contain effects of scalar particles it is formed due
to only vector states therefore in our studies we utilize
the structure  g  and label corresponding invariant
amplitude by phys p2 
expression in eq 4 is obtained in the zerowidth
singlepole approximation in general the correlation
function  p receives contributions also from twomeson reducible terms because the current j couples
not only to fourquark structures but also to two mesons
with relevant quantum numbers twomeson effects generate a finite width of the tetraquark zv  and modify the
quark propagator in eq 4 it was demonstrated that
these effects do not change prediction for the mass of zv 
they rescale only the current coupling f  which is small
and can be neglected 10 20 21
the qcd side of the sum rules ope
 p is found by
inserting the interpolating current j x into eq 2 and
contracting relevant quark fields

were estimated from analysis of numerous hadronic processes 12 13 22 23 and are known and universal parameters higher dimensional condensates are factorized and expressed in terms of basic ones we assume
that factorization does not lead to large uncertainties
the masses of s and c quarks are also among input
parameters for which we use ms  9311
5 mev and
mc  127  02 gev respectively
the borel and continuum threshold parameters m 2
and s0 are auxiliary parameters of computations and
their choice should meet usual requirements imposed on
m 2  s0  by the pole contribution pc and convergence
of the operator product expansion technical side of such
analysis was explained numerously in the literature see
for instance refs 8 17 for this reason we skip here
further details computations of m 2  s0  demonstrate
that working regions for the parameters m 2 and s0

and

the sum rules depend on vacuum condensates up to
dimension 10 the basic condensates
which are sum rules for m and f  respectively here
m 2  s0  is the borel transformed and subtracted amplitude ope p2  which depends on the borel m 2
and continuum threshold s0 parameters in eq 9
 m 2  s0  is the derivative of the amplitude over
dd1m 2 
it is clear that the amplitude m 2  s0  is a key ingredient of the obtained sum rules calculations of this
function give the following result
z s0
dsope sesm  m 2  11
m  s0  
where m  mc  ms  computations are carried out by
taking into account vacuum condensates up to dimension
10 the amplitude m 2  s0  has two components first
of them is expressed using the spectral density ope s
which is computed as an imaginary part of ope
 p the
borel transformation of another terms are found directly
from ope
 p and included into m  the first component in eq 11 contains a main part of the amplitude
whereas m 2  is formed from higher dimensional terms
analytical expressions of ope s and m 2  are rather
lengthy therefore we do not write down them here
satisfy these constraints in fact in these regions pc
changes within limits

at the minimum m 2  4 gev2  a contribution to
m 2  s0  arising from a sum of last three terms in ope
does not exceed 1 of the full result which proves convergence of the sum rules central values of the mass
m and coupling f are evaluated at the middle point of
regions 13 ie at m 2  5 gev2 and s0  135 gev2 
at this point the pole contribution is pc  053 which
ensures the groundstate nature of zv 
results for m and f read

the mass and coupling of the tetraquark zv are depicted
in figs 1 and 2 as functions of m 2 and s0  because m 2 is
the auxiliary parameter prediction for m and f should
be stable under its variations but in a real situation
there is residual dependence of m and f on the borel
parameter in our case we observe a mild variation of
the tetraquarks mass on m 2  whereas the coupling f is
almost stable in the explored range of the borel parameter

fig 1 dependence of the zv tetraquarks mass m on the borel parameter m 2 left panel and on the continuum threshold
parameter s0 right panel
fig 2 the same as in fig 1 but for the coupling f of the tetraquark zv 
the second source of theoretical errors is connected
with a choice of the continuum threshold parameter s0 
despite m 2  it bears physical information about first excitation of the tetraquark zv  the selfconsistent anal
ysis implies that s0 has to be smaller than mass of
such state there are only a few samples when two observed resonances were assumed to be ground and radially excited states of the same tetraquark the resonances zc 3900 and zc 4430 may form one of such
pairs 24 the difference between masses of zc 3900
and zc 4430 is equal to  530 mev therefore a mass
gap s0  m  400  600 mev can be considered
as a reasonable estimate for tetraquarks here we get
s0  m  400 mev which is in accord with this general
analysis
effects connected with a choice of parameters m 2 and
s0 are two main sources of theoretical uncertainties in
sum rule computations in the case of the mass m these
ambiguities equal to 36 whereas for the coupling f
they are 14 of the full result theoretical uncertainties for f are larger than for the mass nevertheless they
do not overshoot accepted limits
it is interesting to analyze a gap between masses of
axialvector and vector tetraquarks with the same content our present calculations demonstrate that for
tetraquarks ucsd the difference between masses of
the axialvector and vector particles zav and zv is
m  mzav  500 mev this result can be compared
with similar prediction for other tetraquarks thus resonances y 4660 and x4140 with quantum numbers
j pc  1 and 1  quark content cscs and color
structure 3c   3c  were investigated in refs 25 26
respectively an estimate for my  mx1 extracted from
these studies is approximately equal to 500 mev as well
in other words radially excited axialvector and groundstate vector tetraquarks in this special case are very
close in mass this fact maybe useful to explain numerous charged and neutral resonances from xy z family in
the mass range of 4  5 gev
another issue to be addressed here is a mass gap
between vector tetraquarks zv and x1 2900 which
amounts to  450 mev and is quite large it has been
noted in section i that x1 can be modeled as a vector
tetraquark udcs and hence both zv and x1 are composed of same quarks but there are two reasons which
may lead to aforementioned mass effect first of them is
internal organizations of these states the tetraquark zv
is composed of a heavy diquark uc and relatively heavy
antidiquark sd whereas x1 is strongly heavylight compound the latter is more tightly connected structure
and should be lighter than zv  besides diquarks in zv
have fractional positive electric charges which generate
repulsive forces between them in the case of x1  between
ud and cs exists attractive electromagnetic interaction
whether these features of zv and x1 are enough to explain a mass gap between them or there are other sources
of this effect requires additional studies
iii
strong decays of the tetraquark
the sum of partial widths of zv tetraquarks different
decay channels constitutes its full width the result for
m obtained in the previous section is necessary to fix
kinematically allowed strong decay modes of zv  decays
to final states ds1 2460 and ds0
2317 below simply
ds1  and ds0  are among allowed swave process for
the tetraquark zv  the p wave processes which will be
explored are decays zv  dk and zv  ds 
processes zv  ds1  and zv 
ds0
here we study the decays zv  ds1  and zv 
ds0
 and compute their partial widths we provide
details of calculations for the first process and write
down only essential formulas and final results for the
second decay it should be noted that the mass m 
3340  120 mev makes possible swave decays of zv
to final states dk1 1270 ds b1 1235 and ds a1 1260
as well but widths of these processes as it will be explained below are suppressed relative to aforementioned
two decays due to kinematical factors therefore we restrict ourselves by investigation of two dominant swave
decays
the width of the process zv  ds1  can be found
using the coupling g1 that describes strong interactions
of particles zv  ds1  and  at the vertex zv ds1  in
order to evaluate g1  we use the qcd lightcone sum rule
method 14 and a softmeson approximation 15 16
starting point in lcsr method is the correlation function
 p q  i d4 xeipx hqt jd1 xj 00i 16
where by d1 in the current jd1 we denote the meson ds1 
the current j 0 in the correlation function  p q is
introduced in eq 3 as interpolating current jd1 x
for the axialvector meson ds1  we use the expression
jd1 x  sl xi5  cl x
with l being the color index
the function  p q has to be rewritten in terms
of the physical parameters of the initial and final particles involved into the decay by taking into account the
ground states in the ds1 and zv channels we get
phys
 p q 
h0jd1 ds1 pi
hds1 p qzv p i
p2  m21
hzv p j 0i
p2  m2
where p q and p  p  q are the momenta of ds1   
and zv  respectively in eq 18 m1 is the mass of the
meson ds1  and the ellipses stand for contributions of
higher resonances and continuum states in the ds1 and
zv channels
to get more detailed expression for phys
 p q we utilize the matrix elements
h0jd1 ds1 i  f1 m1   hzv p j 0i  f m
and model the vertex hds1 p kqzv p i in the following form
hds1 p qzv p i  g1 p  p     
 p    p    
in eqs 19 and 20 f1 and  are the decay constant
and polarization vector of the meson ds1  respectively
polarization vector of the tetraquark zv in this section is
denoted by   using these matrix elements in eq 18
it is not difficult to find

the function phys
 p q contains two structures proportional to g and p p  respectively these structures
and relevant invariant amplitudes can be employed to extract the sum rule for the strong coupling g1  we choose
to work with the term  g and corresponding invariant
amplitude
the qcd side of the sum rule can be obtained using
explicit expressions of the correlation function  p q
and interpolating currents having contracted quark and
antiquark fields in the correlation function we get

where  and  are the spinor indexes
the function ope p q contains local matrix elements of the quark operator ud sandwiched between the
vacuum and pion simple transformations allow one
to express hqub 0dn 00i in terms of the pions
known local matrix elements to this end we expand
u0d0 by employing 
full set of dirac matrices j 
1 5    i5     2 and project obtained operators onto the colorsinglet states these manipulations
lead to replacement

1 bn j 
  u0j d0 
which should be fulfilled in ope
 p q the operators
u0j d0 placed between the vacuum and pion are matrix elements of the  meson
the qcd expression of the correlation function 22
contains hardscattering and soft parts the hardscattering part of ope
 p q is expressed in terms of
quark propagators whereas matrix elements of the pion
form its soft component for vertices built of conventional mesons correlation functions depend on nonlocal
matrix elements of a final meson which are expressible
in terms of its distribution amplitudes das in the
case under analysis due to fourquark nature of zv 
ope
 p q contains only local matrix elements of the
pion as a result integrals over das which are typical
for lcsr method reduce to overall normalization factors in this case the correlation function has to be found
by means of the softmeson approximation which implies
computation of the hardscattering part of ope
 p q in
the limit q  0 17 it is worth to emphasize that softmeson approximation is necessary to analyze tetraquarkmesonmeson vertices strong couplings at vertices composed of two tetraquarks and a meson can be calculated
by employing full version of the lcsr method 27
it is evident that soft approximation should by applied
also to the phenomenological side of the sum rule in the
limit q  0 for the amplitude phys p2  we get

where m
e 2  m2  m21 2 the function phys p2  depends on one variable p2  p2 and has the double pole
at p2  m
e 2  the borel transformation of phys p2  is
given by the formula
e m
e m
phys m 2   g1 f1 m1 f mm
besides groundstate contribution the amplitude
phys m 2  in the soft limit contains unsuppressed terms
which survive even after borel transformation these
contaminations should be removed from phys m 2  by
applying the operator 15 16

after this operation remaining undesired terms in
phys m 2  can be subtracted by usual manner in the
context of quarkhadron duality assumption it is clear
that we have to apply the operator pm 2  m
e 2  to qcd
side of the sum rule as well then the sum rule for the

ref 17 and in many other publications for this reason

the strong coupling and partial width of the second

the last equality in eq 31 is the relation between the

returning to other swave decays listed above
we assume that couplings corresponding to vertices
zv dk1 1270 etc are the same order of g1 and g2  then
widths of these decays
 are suppressed because the factor m2  3  22 m2 m is a mass of a final meson is
smaller for two finalstate mesons of approximately equal
mass than in the case of light and heavy mesons we
also take into account that the full width full of the
tetraquark zv is formed mainly due to p wave processes
zv  dk and zv  ds  and for this reason consider
only two dominant swave decays
decays zv  dk and zv  ds 
in this subsection we consider the p wave decays
zv  dk and zv  ds  of the tetraquark zv 
treatments of these processes do not differ from analysis carried out above differences being mainly in mesontetraquark vertices and matrix elements of finalstate
mesons employed in calculations
let us concentrate on the decay zv  dk the correlation function to find a sum rule for the strong coupling
g1 of vertex zv dk is given by the formula
 p q  i d4 xeipx hkqt j d xj 00i 44
where j d x is the interpolating current
in expressions above md and fd are the mass and decay
constant of the d meson respectively
in terms of quark propagators the same correlation

operations necessary to derive the sum rule for the coupling g1 have just been explained above that is why we

it is clear that zv can be classified as an exotic meson of wide width its main decay modes are processes zv  ds  and zv  dk with branching ratios
brzv  ds   054 and brzv  dk  022
respectively contribution of the decay zv  ds1  is
also considerable with estimate brzv  ds   018
conclusions and final notes
in this article we have studied the doubly charged vec
tor tetraquark zv
 ucsd and calculated its mass
m and width full  the parameters of zv
have been
evaluated using the qcd twopoint and lightcone sum
rules it is worth noting that doubly charged tetraquarks
zcs  sduc with quantum numbers j p  0  0 and
1 were investigated in our paper 11
interest to these yet hypothetical particles is twofold
they are built of four quarks of different flavors and
moreover bear two units of electric charge recently
the lhcb collaboration observed structures x01 2900
which may be interpreted as exotic mesons containing
four different quarks 4 5 the structures x01 were
seen as resonancelike peaks in the mass distribution of
d k  mesons the master process to discover x01
was the weak decay of the b meson b   d d k  
it is remarkable that the process b   d d k 
and data collected during its exploration can be employed to observe another tetraquarks namely states
with quark content ucsd in fact analysis of the invariant mass distribution of mesons d k  may lead
to information about doubly charged scalar and vector
tetraquarks ucsd decays to final mesons d k  are
among favored channels of the scalar zs and vector
particles relevant branching ratios are equal to
brzs  dk  086 and brzv  dk  022 re

spectively the decay of the b meson b   d ds  
is also useful to see states zs and zv
 because processes zs  ds  and zv  ds  have considerable
branching ratios brzs  ds   012 and brzv 
ds   054 results obtained for spectroscopic param
eters and decay channels of zv
 as well as information
on the tetraquarks zcs may be useful for such experimental investigations existence of tetraquarks with content
udcd may be confirmed in decay b   d ds   as
well these neutral states may be fixed in the invariant
mass distribution of d   mesons
it is evident that threemeson weak decays of b meson are sources of valuable information on fourquark exotic states data collected by various collaborations in
running experiments may be utilized for these purposes
new decays of b meson can open wide prospects to study
numerous fourquark states indeed finalstate mesons
in such processes can be combined to form different pairs
and their invariant mass distributions can be explored
to find resonancetype enhancements in any case additional experimental and theoretical studies are necessary
to take advantage of the emerging opportunities
