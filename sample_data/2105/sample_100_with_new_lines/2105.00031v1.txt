abstract
normality is the most often mathematical supposition used in data modeling
nonetheless even based on the law of large numbers lln normality is a strong
presumption given that the presence of asymmetry and multimodality in realworld
problems is expected thus a flexible modification in the normal distribution proposed by elalolivero 12 adds a skewness parameter called alphaskew normal
asn distribution enabling bimodality and fattail if needed although sometimes
not trivial to estimate this third parameter regardless of the location and scale
this work analyzed seven different statistical inferential methods towards the asn
distribution on synthetic data and historical data of water flux from 21 rivers channels in the atacama region moreover the contribution of this paper is related to
the probability estimation surrounding the rivers flux level in copiap city neighborhood the most important economic city of the third chilean region and known
to be located in one of the driest areas on earth besides the north and the south
pole

introduction
we live in the big data era in which a high volume and variety of data characterization are often noticeable in a data lake nonetheless despite its amount of observation
symmetry and smoothtail are not always observed these characteristics are natural
since we all live in a complex world with nonlinear relations and outliers describing
extreme values more recurrent than easy statistical tools take into account this new
age requires flexible models and different reasoning based on data information
an often question crossing some traditional departments worldwide are statistics
methods getting old fashion sir david cox 6 explains that the focus is on the
data relevance and quality based on its coverage and representativeness which gives
confidence for the results despite the amount of information large volume in the set
which may hold some potentially biased estimates with measurement errors efron
 hastie 11 discuss the relation across computerrelated and statistical inference
as a mathematical logic system for guidance and correction complemented by the
largescale prediction algorithms suitable for this new century
therefore complexity is intrinsic to massive data where highdimension is often presented and dynamic 18 30 nonetheless all the information contained in the acquired
data can be extracted through an estimation method ie in maximum likelihood estimation mle and in a parametric version it will be supported by a supposed
distribution parametric approaches are easy to interpret patterns through parameters and enable association across variables present a low computational cost and be
easier to implement in decisionmaking systems
in many cases the standard mle may not return desirable results other estimation
methods that return accurate estimates have been considered such as estimators based
on the least square function 32 the product of spacing 4 28 or goodnessoffit
statistics 21 there is no unique method that performs better for all models and it may
depend on the selected parametric form 20 27 thus using an efficient estimation
method jointly with a flexible parametric model that covers many data patterns is
demanded which sometimes accommodates asymmetry and multimodality that may
be contained in the data that is considered
this is the case of meteorological data which shows significant changes as well as
a complex dynamic 2 9 these field demands an extra attention on datadriven
models thus needed to incorporate spatialtime dependence 19 structural change
23 extreme value 10 but moreover in the parametric world a model supported by a
probabilistic model which deals with asymmetry and multimodality 25 29 thus
this paper was motivated by the study case of the water flux of 21 rivers channels
from the surroundings of copiap city placed in the atacama desert as one of the
planets driest areas moreover we are persuaded to exemplify evidence towards the
probability density associated with these events empirical distribution through seven
different statistical inference approaches
this paper is divided into four parts section 2 presents the motivation and details
regarding the analyzed data section 3 provides a background about the adopted
methodology towards statistical inference elements then sections 4 and 5 show the
results related to the implemented methodology on synthetic data and the realworld
data analysis finally section 6 discusses the conclusions based on the obtained results
the data
the adopted data set is related to fluviometric records average monthly flows from
the atacama desert region third region of chile in the copiap city neighborhood
the historical period of these data are from the past ten years from jan 2011 to
dec 2020 associated with 21 rivers or stream channel obtained from the chilean
government website called direccion general de aguas informacin oficial hidrometeorolgica y de calidad de aguas en lnea
historical events reveal the high periodicity of the low water flux of the region
however cyclical events were also noticeable such as two showers of rain defrost of
glacierssnow in summer amongst others creating an expected multimodality and
large leptokurtosis
within the process information a decision support system dss sifts through and
analyzes massive amounts of data compiling comprehensive information that can be
used to solve problems and in decisionmaking figure 1 summarizing chart flow of the
knowledge discovery in databases kdd from the information retrieval ir decision
figure 1 visual summary of the probabilistic role in the knowledge discovery in databases as a cornerstone
for quantification of uncertainty statistical inference procedures enable us to draw conclusions based on a

support system dss to monitoring  forecasting
thus the atacama desert watershed problem is one of a multidimensional study
related to the circular economy to be analyzed it is essential to mention that uncertainty is always presented globally as a measurement error sample bias amongst
others nonetheless probabilistic reasoning allows one to generalize results through
statistical inference procedures

given its flexibility the asn distribution has been used in data modeling and
adopted in different fields such as astronomy 34 modeling wind speed 39 and
benchmark data 1 figure 2 presents different forms of the pdf of the asn distribution for instance assuming   0 location   1 scale and different values for

note that while carl friedrich gauss introduced the lsq in 1822 and it is one
of the oldest estimation procedures we have included the paper of swain et al 32
the authors used such an approach for a class of nonnormal models and became a
standard reference when applied in different probability distributions the additional
details related to the estimation of the asn distribution parameters are presented in
the following subsections
321
maximum likelihood estimation
the maximum likelihood estimation mle is widely used in data analysis where
fishers derivation of the information inequality is seen at first for the analysis of variance and later for estimate functions derived from eulers relation for homogeneous
functions despite the fact that historical records of this technique have been widely
exposed and defended by ronald a fisher maybe gained visibility because of the
epic fights with egon s pearson its rationality dates back to the mid1700s 31
let t1  t2      tn be the sample of the random sample of size n from f t  
the maximum likelihood estimator m le  m le and m le can be obtained by maximizing lets consider zi  ti 
l

numerical methods such as newtonrapshon are required to find the solution of the
nonlinear system under mild conditions the mles are asymptotically normally distributed with a joint multivariate normal distribution given by
m le  m le  m le   n3    i 1    as n  
where i   is the fisher information matrix given in elalolivero 12
this methodology is often adopted given the mle sufficiency combined with consistency which leads to the statistical efficiency and asymptotic normality is guaranteed often cases mle are adopted under regularity conditions and assumptions
like score functions linearly approximation nonetheless some more constraints on the
class of estimates whenever the increase of parameters numbers unbounded likelihood functions and the possibility of local improvement should be verified and needed
to be contours of the likelihood
next we will present a series of minimum distance estimations easily applied
to estimate consistently unknown parameters and designed to reflect the proposed
model reproducing the probabilistic structure of the realworld phenomenon under
study 38 minimum distance estimations provide consistent parameter estimates
and competitive especially when other methods did not succeed
322
ordinary and weighted leastsquare estimate
let random sample of size n present a sequence t1  t2      tn then been a series
of order statistics in which f t   is a monotonic function the least square
lsq estimators lse  lse and lse for the asn distribution can be obtained by
minimizing the parameters   and  as
v    
f ti     
thus the lsq equations can be obtained through solving the nonlinear equations
f ti     
j ti      0
j  1 2 3

alternative solutions are obtained through numerical approximation with high precision for these j for j  1 2 3 partial derivatives
alternatively the weighted leastsquares wlq estimates are proposed whenever
efficient method is required under sets of small data w lse  w lse and w lse  can
be obtained by minimized adopting the following equation
n  12 n  2
w    
f ti

the solutions are deviated from the nonlinear equations

i n  i  1
j  1 2 3
where 1      2      and 3      are given in 8 the wlq
estimation technique is particularly useful whenever one aims to weigh the observations proportional to the equivalence of the error variance for that observation then
overcoming the issue of nonconstant variance
323
method of maximum product of spacings
the maximum product of spacings mps method is a powerful alternative to mle for
estimating unknown parameters of continuous univariate distributions which aims to
maximize the geometric mean of spacings in the data differences between the values
of the cumulative distribution function at neighborhood data points cheng  amin
proposed this method 4 5 and also obtained independently by ranneby 28 as a
kullbackleibler information approximation measurement some desirable properties
of the mps methods such as asymptotic efficiency invariance and more importantly
consistency are held broadly under general conditions than for mles 5
lets represented the differences between the values of the cumulative distribution function
data points by the function di    
 on their neighborhood
f ti     f ti1      for i  1 2     n1    as an uniform spacings
of a random sample from the asn distribution defining by f t0      0 and
f tn1      1 the constraint of the n1
i1 di     1 is held thus the
mps estimates m p s  m p s and m p s can be obtained by maximizing the geometric
mean of the spacings
gasn    
 n1
di   
considering the maximization of this gasn  function by adopting its logarithm as
1 x
hasn    
log di   
the estimates of the unknown parameters m p s  m p s and m p s are obtained by
solving the nonlinear equations
1 x
j ti     j ti1     0
di   
j  1 2 3
where 1      2      and 3      are given respectively in 8
it is important to mention that if tik  tik1      ti then dik    
dik1         di     0 therefore the mps estimators are sensitive
to closely spaced observations especially ties when the ties are due to multiple observations di    should be replaced by the corresponding likelihood f ti    
since ti  ti1 
under mild conditions for the asn distribution the mps estimators are asymptotically normally distributed with a joint trivariate normal distribution given by
m p s  m p s  m p s   n3    i 1    as n  
324
the cramervon mises minimum distance estimators
alternatively an estimator that requires no assumption about the distributions parametric form the cramervon mises estimator cme is based on the difference between the estimate of the cumulative distribution function and the empirical distribution function 7 37 these estimators operate based on the minimum distance across
the true distribution observed and the modeled distribution adjusted through
the maximum goodnessoffit
macdonald 22 showed that the bias of the estimator from the cme presents
smaller distances alternatively to other minimum distance estimators the cramervon mises estimates cm e  cm e and cm e of the parameters   and  are obtained
by minimizing through
 2i  1 2
c   
f ti     
12n
thus these estimates are also obtained by solving the nonlinear equations
f ti
2i  1
    
j ti      0
j  1 2 3
where 1      2      and 3      are given respectively in 8
325
the andersondarling and righttail andersondarling estimators
another type of minimum distance estimator is based on andersondarling statistics often called andersondarling estimator ade this estimator is based on the
minimum distance estimator obtained from sampling a sort data in ascending order
of observed set y then x  sorty and also combined with the permutation of
1 2     n which makes the x series sorted thus this process is associated with the
cumulative distribution function f and the survival function s  1  f  for any
pdf in contrast samples are drawn from a uniform distribution only if y and x
are samples from the pdf distribution
the andersondarling estimates 
bade  
bade and 
bade of the parameters   and
 are obtained by minimizing with respect to   and  the function
2i  1 log f ti      log s tn1i     
these estimates can also be obtained by solving the nonlinear equations
a    n 
j ti    
j tn1i    
  0 j  1 2 3
2i  1
n1i
alternatively one can improve the ade performance by taking into account the
information held on the nonsymmetrical differences between theoretical cdf and
empirical cdf 40 thus the righttail andersondarling estimates rade is an
alternative though 
brade  
brade and 
brade of the parameters   and  are obtained by minimizing the function
r

where 1      2      and 3      are given respectively in 8
numerical analysis
in this section we investigated the behavior of the asn distribution based on artificial synthetic data and its parameters modification conditioning on the estimation
methodology thus a monte carlo simulation was carried out seven frequentist estimation methods were considered for the parameters and comparing their efficiency
the following approach was adopted the procedure is
1 generate n samples of size n given a set of parameters from the asn  
distribution
2 for each generated set based on the estimation methods mles lsqs wlqs
mpss cmes ades and rtades estimates of the parameters   and 
were calculated
3 then considering      and      it was computed the
bias and mean squared error mse of  which are given respectively by
1 pn
1 pn
and
 for j  1 2 3 each paramj
eter whereas j
k  1 2     n 
denotes the estimate of j obtained from sample k for
this simulated studys results shall return the most expected efficient estimation method conditioning on their estimations both bias and mse closer to zero
for this simulation study we adopted the r software r core team 2014 and
for the maximization method used package maxlik and stats4 henningsen and
toomet 2011 the chosen values of the simulation parameters were n  10 000
and n  40 60 80     300 due to lack of space we will present the results only
for   05   05   3 and   0   1   5 nonetheless the following
results are generalized by other choices of the vector of parameters  the estimation
methods are considered under the same conditions in terms of samples limit iterations numbers and initial values here we considered the true values as initial values
however we provide a simple approach discussed in the next section to deal with real
cases where good initial values are not available

ades and rtades with n  10000 simulated samples and different values of n it
can be observed that the mles do not return adequate estimates for some parameter
values and only converges for large samples of size these results show a drawback
in the current approach used to obtain the parameter estimates of asn distribution
although there is no uniform method that returns better estimates for all parameters
and different parameter values we observed that the ades obtained the best results
in terms of minimum bias and mse additionally obtaining an estimate for  is quite
challenging to estimate given the influence from the parameter of location and scale 
and  in this approach we faced fewer computational issues to obtain such estimates
and therefore we recommend using the ades to achieve the estimates for all practical
purposes

results
as we presented in section 2 the motivation of this paper is driven by the atacama
desert water flux more precisely in the copiap neighborhood figure 5 shows the
empirical density of this phenomenon whereas a high concentration of lowvalues is
presented near to zero although important events also captured in this 10year time
window such as a big rain retrieving a large leptokurtosis
table 2 presents the statistical summaries minimum 1st quartile median mean
3rd quartile maximum of the water flux per month since the weather is very constant
in the region the seasonality across years is to be ignored since low flux is common
close values through the minimum of the months nonetheless the cycle per month
is essential given events like defrost at the end of springbeginning of summer higher
values in the 3rd quartile in nov and dec it is expected to receive more water in
the system
the use of the logarithm transformation has been used for a long time 13 though
often obtained a normal distribution some other situations not the case for instance
the dynamic of the water flux through the observed period in figure 7 showing the
presence of bimodality in this data transformation and its monthly representation by

figure 6 it is essential to mention that the maximum historical values were in may
and jun of 2017 related to the heavy rains that occurred in the region also notable
in the previous table 2

conclusion
uncertainty reveals a wide variety of processes and experiences which may follow
different rules although different attributions of uncertainty such as external disposition versus internal ignorance are assessed by statistical inference given philosophical interpretations of probability 17 the utilities of each possible outcome lead to
choosing rational actions regardless of the observed results uncertainty
the example brought by this paper is the water flux modeling related to an essential
element stressed by the significant population growth and the increase in the demand
figure 7 the empirical distribution of the log of the water flux and its frequency represented by gray blocks
the black dashed line represents the adjusted asn distribution based on the mle   1949   085  
414707 and the red dotdashed line based on the ade   1879   105   836
for water supply for agriculture industrial process mineral extraction human consumption 33 therefore planning the logistic of these excessive water decisions upon
the probabilistic distribution helps in unraveling this complex task 16 36 initiated
by the analysis of the water flux especially when environmental factors present limit
sources towards the water level
thus this work proposed the investigation towards comparing different inference
methods towards the asn probabilistic distribution which shows a promising and flexible distribution bimodality was noticeable and skewed information observed in the
historical series nevertheless accommodated by the adopted probabilistic approach
bigdata solution may now be implemented using realtime analysis once the processs probabilistic function was estimated and evidence towards the goodoffitness
was shown monitoring charts and other statistical process control spc tools can also
explore since parametric distribution is often adopted and here shown elements onto
the asn distribution future works should expand into the reasoning towards quantile estimations associated with this problem with explainable features in a regression
structure and forecasting may also be a further research motivation later
