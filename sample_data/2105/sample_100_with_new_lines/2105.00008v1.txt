introduction and summary
a recent advance in the understanding of black holes are the computations 1 2 of the time evolution of the entanglement entropy between a holographic black hole system and an external bath
uhlemannumichedu
to which the black hole is coupled a crucial ingredient in these computations are entanglement
islands  contributions to the entanglement entropy ee from regions that are disconnected and
can be far away from the bath 37 these contributions become dominant at late times and lead
to a page curve for the time evolution of the entropy in line with expectations based on unitarity
the discussions so far are largely based on bottomup models and on lowdimensional theories
where the features of gravity are qualitatively different the special case of a karchrandall model
with a tensionless endoftheworld brane discussed in 8 can be embedded into type iib as an
orbifold of ads5  s 5  but that case is somewhat peculiar in that the 4d graviton has a mass that
can not be separated from the uv cutoff in the 4d gravitational description
the aim of the present work is to demonstrate in a uvcomplete string theory setting the
emergence of entanglement islands and page curves for black holes in fourdimensional theories of
gravity in which the graviton mass can be controlled including theories with massless gravitons
starting point are the discussions of islands and page curves in general 5d karchrandall models
812 which can be used to model gravitating systems coupled to nongravitating and gravitating
baths these models have the appealing feature that the quantum extremal surfaces 13 14
exhibiting island contributions are entirely geometrized due to the doublyholographic nature of
these models 15 16 this allows for the identification of entanglement islands through classical
ryutakayanagi surfaces 17 we will uplift the discussions in these bottomup models to type
iib string theory to provide uv completions and concrete holographically dual qfts
the string theory constructions are based on holographic duals for 4d boundary cfts and for
3d scfts engineered by configurations of d3 d5 and ns5 branes 1820 holographic duals for
large classes of such theories were constructed in 2124 and they provide natural string theory
realizations of the karchrandall models with nongravitating and gravitating baths we will
study quantum extremalminimal surfaces in these solutions and identify quantities that exhibit
page curve behavior the key findings of 8 11 such as the existence of critical brane angles
separating different phases of minimal surfaces will find string theory realizations we will also
identify 10d versions of the leftright ee that was found to exhibit page curve behavior in the
5d models with gravitating bath where the usual notion of geometric ee becomes subtle
in the following we will first review relevant aspects of the discussion in the karchrandall
models to set the stage and then summarize the main results of this paper
islands and page curves in karchrandall models the karchrandall models for 4d
gravity coupled to a nongravitating bath are based on a part of ads5 cut off by an endoftheworld
etw brane extending along an ads4 slice fig 1a the conformal boundary is cut off at the
point where it is intersected by the etw brane so that these models are holographically dual to
boundary conformal field theories bcfts the advantage of these setups from the entanglement
islands perspective is that they have 3 holographically related descriptions
a einstein gravity on asymptotically ads5  etw brane
b a 4d cft with uv cutoff  gravity on asymptotically ads4  coupled via transparent
boundary conditions at the boundary of ads4 to a 4d cft on half of r13
c a nongravitational 4d cft on half of r13 coupled to 3d boundary degrees of freedom
these descriptions can be understood to arise from applying adscft twice description b is
obtained by converting the 3d boundary degrees of freedom in c to a gravitational theory on
ads4  and description a geometrizes the entire bcft
description b is the one of interest for the black hole information paradox to pose the
paradox the ads4 slices are replaced by ads4 black holes this realizes a black hole on the etw
brane and on the remaining half of the conformal boundary of ads5  which serves as bath it can be
fig 1 left karchrandall model for nongravitating bath the figure shows part of ads5 with the etw
brane cutting off the shaded region the dashed curve is the black hole horizon and r is the radiation region
blue the green curve ending on the horizon represents the hm surface the green curve extending from
the boundary of r to the etw brane is the island surface i is the island red right for a gravitating
bath a second etw brane is introduced leaving only a 3dimensional part of the conformal boundary
interpreted as coupling the gravity system on the etw brane to a bath at the same temperature
as the black hole to quantify the entropy of the radiation one picks a region far in the bath
system and computes its ee one type of surface relevant for computing the ee holographically
are hartmanmaldacena hm surfaces 25 which connect the boundary of the radiation region to
the corresponding point in the thermofield double due to the stretching of the space behind the
horizon the area of these surfaces grows in time suggesting an unbounded growth of the entropy
which is a version of the information paradox 4 the paradox is resolved by the existence of island
minimal surfaces that stretch from the bath into the gravity system fig 1a the part of the
etw brane near the black hole that is captured by the surface constitutes the island contribution
its computation is entirely geometrized through the existence of the 5d bulk the area of the island
surfaces is constant in time which limits the growth of the entropy and leads to page curves as
emphasized in 8 the graviton is generically massive in models with a nongravitating bath
a gravitating bath can be realized by introducing a second etw brane as bath fig 1b
11 this modifies description b to now comprise two cfts coupled to gravity on distinct ads4
spaces and coupled to each other at the conformal boundaries description c is reduced to a 3d
cft since both etw branes have dynamical gravity a conventional geometric ee can not be
defined on the second etw brane if one allows the end points of minimal surfaces on both etw
branes to be chosen dynamically the surfaces can settle on the horizon and lead to a flat entropy
curve in line with the general arguments of 26 the quantity that was found to exhibit page
curve behavior in 11 instead corresponds to minimal surfaces anchored at the remaining point of
the conformal boundary of ads5  and was interpreted as ee between defect degrees of freedom
represented by the left and right etw branes the form of the entropy curve was found to have
interesting dependence on the etw brane angles as will be discussed in more detail below
islands and page curves in type iib in this work we will study 10d string theory versions
of the karchrandall models and show that the qualitative features captured by the bottomup
models are realized in a uvcomplete theory of quantum gravity we will discuss black holes
coupled to nongravitating and to gravitating baths realized through 10d black hole solutions
based on the ads4  s 2  s 2   solutions of type iib constructed in 2124
we start the discussion with nongravitating baths the solutions constructed in 2123 can
be used to describe semiinfinite d3branes terminating on a system of d5 and ns5 branes with
additional d3branes suspended between the 5branes the brane configurations engineer n  4
sym on a half space corresponding to the semiinfinite d3branes coupled to a 3d scft on
the boundary corresponding to the d3branes suspended between the d5 and ns5 branes the
structure of the supergravity solutions and brane setups is illustrated in fig 2 at each point of 
there is an ads4 and two 2spheres with independently varying radii the region x   where

baths on each boundary component an s 2 collapses so the 10d geometry is closed d5ns5 brane sources
are located on the y  0y  2 boundaries the limit x   is a regular point of the internal space
for x   the solutions approach locally ads5  s 5  this region corresponds to the conformal boundary in
fig 1a the etw brane in fig 1a can be seen as effective description for the remaining 10d geometry
right associated configuration of d5 ns5 and d3 branes with d3branes suspended between 5branes and
semiinfinite d3branes emerging in one direction the distribution of 5brane sources in the supergravity
solution encodes how many d5ns5 branes there are and how the d3branes end on them
the geometry becomes ads5  s 5 is modeled in the karchrandall models in fig 1a by the
ads5 region far away from the etw brane the etw brane itself can be understood as effective
description for the remaining part of the 10d solution ie the region around the 5brane sources
in fig 2 we will modify these solutions by introducing black holes on the ads4 spaces which
leads to nonsupersymmetric solutions of type iib that are asymptotic to the supersymmetric seed
solutions and describe the dual qfts at finite temperature
the radiation region r will be defined in the asymptotic ads5  s 5 region at x   in fig 2
while the physical black hole corresponds to the region around the 5brane sources the surfaces
computing the entanglement entropy of the radiation region wrap both s 2 s and are anchored in
the ads5  s 5 region at a fixed value of the ads4 radial coordinate for the nongravitating baths
we construct the hm surfaces explicitly at the time t  0 when their area is smallest the minimal
surfaces can be described by specifying the ads4 radial coordinate r as function of the coordinates
on the riemann surface x and y the surfaces extend along the riemann surface  and either drop
into the horizon in ads4 along a curve xh y hm surfaces or extend all the way to x  
where they can close off smoothly before reaching the horizon in ads4 island surfaces
the extremality condition is a nonlinear pde on  the boundary conditions will be derived
from regularity of the induced metric on the minimal surface which will give a string theory
justification for the use of neumann boundary conditions at the etw brane in the karchrandall
models other boundary conditions in 5d were discussed in 27 solutions to the pde are obtained
numerically the class of ads4 s 2 s 2  solutions is very broad reflecting the breadth of brane
configurations that can be realized with d3 d5 and ns5 branes we will choose representative
solutions with n5 d5branes at x y  0 0 n5 ns5branes at x y  0 2  and 2n5 k semiinfinite d3branes studying more general solutions will be left for the future
the 8d minimal surfaces can be visualized as 2d surfaces in the 3d space spanned by  and
the ads4 radial direction r with the horizon at some finite rh  the conformal boundary of ads4
at r   corresponds to the defect in fig 1a a sample of island and hm surfaces is shown in
figs 5 6 the island surfaces show distinct behavior near the 5brane sources which is discussed
in sec iii c the area differences between island surfaces and hm surfaces at t  0 are shown in
fig 7 the results show that for radiation regions starting far in the bath small r the hm surface
dominates at t  0 the area of the hm surface grows in time and sets the initial growth of the
entropy but the entropy growth is bounded by the constant area of the island surface this evades
an information paradox and shows that the entropy follows a page curve

fig 3 left ads4  s 2  s 2   solutions for gravitating baths the ads5  s 5 region is closed off the
limits x   both lead to regular points in the internal space this leaves the 3d conformal boundary of
ads4  corresponding to the remaining point of the conformal boundary in fig 1b right the associated
brane configurations have no semiinfinite d3branes only d3branes suspended between 5branes
critical angle the analysis of 11 found a critical value for the tensionangle of the etw
brane  in fig 1 where the behavior of the island surfaces changes qualitatively the critical
angle c can be defined as follows at zero temperature for an island surface anchored at a fixed
point in the bath system one can ask for the end point on the etw brane as function of  for
  c this is a finite point as c is approached the end point on the etw brane diverges towards
the poincar horizon and below c there are no more island minimal surfaces
remarkably a similar phenomenon can be identified in 10d the angle  in 5d is set by the
tension of the etw brane which can be understood as a measure for the number of degrees of
freedom represented by the etw brane the relevant parameters in the 10d solutions considered
here are the radius of the asymptotic ads5  s 5 region which is set by the number of semiinfinite
d3branes and the number of d5 and ns5 branes on which the d3branes terminate the latter
determines the 3d scft that n  4 sym is coupled to at the boundary of the half space one
may expect that the brane angle in 5d captures the ratio of the number of d3branes suspended
between 5branes and the number of semiinfinite d3branes this is indeed the case for island
surfaces at zero temperature with fixed anchor point in the ads5  s 5 region the end point at
x   is shown as function of n5 k which controls the ratio of suspended and semiinfinite
d3branes in fig 8 the results indicate that there is a critical ratio at which the end point at
x   runs off towards the poincar horizon for black hole solutions with finite temperature
this behavior is regulated fig 9 and island surfaces can be found beyond the critical ratio
gravitating baths for the description of a gravitating bath the asymptotic ads5  s 5 region
in fig 2 is closed off this corresponds to removing the semiinfinite d3branes from the brane
setup leaving only d3branes suspended between d5 and ns5 branes fig 3 this is captured
in the 5d karchrandall models by the introduction of a second etw brane the 10d solutions
are holographic duals for 3d t su n  scfts 24 and have massless 4d gravitons closing off
the ads5  s 5 region removes the part in which the radiation region was defined and a minimal
surface stretching from x   to x   now has to satisfy neumann boundary conditions
on both ends this allows it to settle onto the black hole horizon and leads to a constant entropy
identical to the thermal entropy of the bath in line with the general arguments of 26 28
one can instead consider minimal surfaces splitting the internal space which are expected to
compute nongeometric entanglement entropies whose holographic interpretation was initiated in
29 30 in the karchrandall models a leftright ee represented by surfaces ending on the
point where the two etw branes meet in fig 1b was found to exhibit page curve behavior
and was interpreted as an internal entanglement entropy in 11 the type iib solutions realize
the dual of the defect as full 10d geometry making them an ideal setting for studies of minimal
surfaces separating degrees of freedom according to their representation in the internal space
we consider surfaces wrapping the spatial part of ads4  both s 2 s and a curve in  which
depends on the ads4 radial coordinate the surfaces are anchored at the conformal boundary of
ads4 along a curve xy in  which separates the 5brane sources and defines a split into black hole
system and bath such surfaces may be expected to compute ees associated with decompositions
of the quiver diagram in the uv description of the dual 3d scft one again has to consider hm
surfaces extending through the horizon in ads4 into the thermofield double and island surfaces
which close off in one of the x   regions before reaching the horizon in ads4  these are
10d versions of the surfaces in fig 1b the class of ads4  s 2  s 2   solutions that could be
considered is again broad and we focus on simple representatives we include two groups of d5branes and two groups of ns5 branes placed symmetrically at x   on the boundary components
of  the separation of the 5brane sources determines how the d3branes in the associated brane
configuration are suspended between the 5branes comparing to the karchrandall models in
fig 1b these particular 10d solutions correspond to two equal etw brane angles
some 10d island surfaces are shown in fig 10 the corresponding hm surface is described by
x  0 and a timedependent embedding in the ads4 part of the geometry the difference in areas
between island and hm surfaces at t  0 is shown in fig 11b we find that for  above a page
value p the hm surface initially dominates at t  0 the entropy growth indicated by the hm
surfaces is bounded by the constant area of the island surfaces leading again to page curves shown
in fig 12b a second distinguished value for  can be seen in fig 11a at a critical value c
the capoff point of the island surface at x   diverges towards the conformal boundary of
ads4  and no island minimal surfaces are found for   c  the numerical results suggest that c
is slightly smaller than p  though we leave the possibility that the difference could be a numerical
artifact in the small and possibly empty range c    p the island surfaces are found to
dominate already at t  0 leading to a flat entropy curve these results bear striking resemblance
with critical and page angles found in the karchrandall models in 11 suggesting that the etw
brane angles capture aspects of how the 5brane sources are distributed on  in 10d
in the regime where no island minimal surfaces were found in the 5d karchrandall models in
11 tiny island limiting surfaces which degenerate to an infinitesimal segment at the defect in
fig 1b were found to dominate and limit the entropy growth indicated by the hm surface in
10d we find that similar tiny island surfaces connecting the x  0 locus to x   arise for   c 
outline the main part is organized as follows the 10d supergravity solutions are introduced
in sec ii in sec iii the ansatz for extremal surfaces is discussed along with the extremality and
boundary conditions and the behavior near the 5branes the method for constructing minimal
surfaces is summarized in sec iv island surfaces and page curves are discussed for nongravitating
baths in sec v and for gravitating baths in sec vi we close with a brief outlook in sec vii
type iib supergravity solutions
the general local form of the ads4 s 2 s 2  solutions that will be used here was constructed
in 21 22 for the study of minimal surfaces we will only need the geometry which is a warped
product of ads4 and two 2spheres s12 and s22  over a riemann surface  for the solutions of
interest here  can be taken as a strip
  z  c  0  imz  2 
on each of the boundary components of the strip one of the s 2 s closes off smoothly so that the
10d geometry has no boundary depending on the nature of the points at infinity solutions for
different types of field theories can be constructed janus solutions dual to interface cfts can be
realized if the points rez   both correspond to asymptotic ads5  s 5 regions solutions
with one asymptotic region closed off were constructed in 23 and are dual to bcfts duals for
3d scfts were constructed in 24 by closing both asymptotic ads5  s 5 regions
the solutions are generally parametrized by two harmonic functions h1  h2 on  the einsteinframe metric takes the form
ds2  f42 ds24  f12 ds2s 2  f22 ds2s 2  42 dz2 
where ds24 and ds2s 2 are line elements of unitradius ads4 and s 2  respectively the coefficient

the expressions for the fluxes and dilaton will not be needed here they can be found in 2124
based on this local form broad classes of supergravity solutions can be constructed which
describe d3branes intersecting ending on or suspended between d5 and ns5 branes for the
realization of karchrandall models with gravitating and nongravitating baths we will employ
representative solutions dual to bcfts and 3d scfts noting that more general solutions could

the solutions describe semiinfinite d3branes ending on d5branes and ns5branes which have
additional d3branes suspended between them the number of semiinfinite d3branes is controlled
by k for k  0 the solutions describe d3branes suspended between d5 and ns5 branes groups
of d5ns5 branes are represented by the poles of h1 h2 on the boundary of  the specific
brane configuration can be characterized in terms of linking numbers which are encoded in the
distribution of the 5brane sources on  23 24 for k 6 0 an ads5  s 5 region emerges at
rez   with rez becoming the radial coordinate of ads5 in ads4 slicing and imz
becoming an angular coordinate on s 5  for k  0 the limit rez   leads to a regular point
in the internal space the limit rez   leads to a regular point in both cases
we discuss the concrete solutions that will be used below first and briefly comment on the more
general picture and dual field theories afterwards the solutions we will study for nongravitating
baths are dual to n  4 sym on a half space coupled to 3d t su n  theories on the boundary

these solutions describe n52 2 d3branes suspended between two groups of d5branes and two
groups of ns5branes with n5 2 5branes in each group there are no semiinfinite d3branes
and the asymptotic ads5  s 5 region at rez   is closed off the limits rez   both
correspond to regular points in the internal space the 5brane groups are represented in the
supergravity solutions by sources with n5 2 d5 and n5 2 ns5branes respectively at z   and
z    i2 the parameter  determines how the d3branes terminate on the d5 and ns5
branes fig 4b for   0 the numbers of d3branes terminating on each group of 5branes are
equal comparing to the 5d karchrandall models the closing off of the asymptotic ads5  s 5
region corresponds to the introduction of the second etw brane in fig 1b the entire 10d
solution corresponds to the remaining wedge of ads5 in fig 1b

fig 4a up to hananywitten transitions this will be useful below from now on we set 0  1
solutions with more general arrangements of 5brane sources poles in h12  and no asymptotic
ads5  s 5 region describe configurations of d3branes suspended between d5 and ns5 branes that
can be characterized by two young tableaux  and  which determine how precisely the d3branes
terminate on the 5branes the general relation between the distribution of the 5brane sources on
the boundary of  and the young tableaux  and  can be found in 24 the brane configurations
engineer 3d n  4 quiver gauge theories and the supergravity solutions are dual to their ir fixed
points for solutions with ads5  s 5 region and semiinfinite d3branes the dual field theory is
n  4 sym on a half space coupled to a 3d t su n  scft on the boundary 23 the free
energies obtained holographically were matched to field theory computations using supersymmetric
localization for the former in 31 32 and for the latter in 33
finite temperature
for each ads4  s 2  s 2   solution one may replace ads4 by a finite temperature black hole
and still obtain a solution to the type iib supergravity field equations to verify the field equations
one only needs that the 4d space is einstein with negative curvature this is true for the ads4
black hole metrics we will use so that replacing ads4 by a black hole yields nonsupersymmetric
solutions which asymptotically approach the supersymmetric seed solution from a more general
perspective the ads4  s 2  s 2   solutions are in the class for which 34 conjecture that a
consistent truncation exists having a consistent truncation to 4d gauged supergravity would allow
to uplift more general 4d solutions to 10d but this is not needed for our purposes here
to introduce finite temperature we replace the ads4 metric in 2 by the ads4 black hole
metric

br  1  e3rh r 
the horizon is at r  rh  the conformal boundary at r   it will be convenient to also introduce
the tortoise coordinate u by
u  cosh1 e 2 rrh

the range u  r corresponds to the exterior region covered by the original coordinate r with
the horizon at u  0 the metric becomes

from the cft perspective replacing ads4 by a planar black hole corresponds to adding a finite
temperature for n  4 sym on ads4 for solutions with an ads5  s 5 region the black hole
solutions without ads5  s 5 region are dual to 3d t su n  scfts at finite temperature
iii
extremal surfaces
in this section we discuss the embedding ansatz for the surfaces that will be used for the
entanglement entropy computations the extremality and boundary conditions and the behavior
near the 5brane sources
island surfaces
the surfaces of interest are 8d minimal surfaces in the 10d geometry 2 that wrap both s 2 s
part of the riemann surface  and a part of the ads4 black hole geometry for the ads4 black
hole we choose coordinates 8 such that the 10d metric is given by 2 with
ds24 
dr2
 e2r brdt2  ds2r2 
the surfaces can be described by specifying the ads4 radial coordinate r for any given point of 
on  we introduce real coordinates
z  x  iy 
with x  r and 0  y  2  the embeddings are thus described by a single embedding function
r  rx y 
the induced metric on the surface reads
ds2  e2r f42 ds2r2  f12 ds2s 2  f22 ds2s 2  42 dx2  dy 2  
f42
dx x r  dyy r2 
the area of a general surface of this form is given by a  vr2 vs12 s22 s  with
s  4
dxdy e2r f42 f12 f22 2
f42
x r2  y r2  
4br2
the combinations of metric functions appearing in this expression are given by
h1 h2
f42
f42 f12 f22 2  8 h1 h2 w  
with these expressions the area simplifies to
s  32
dxdy e2r h1 h2 w 
h1 h2
r2 
2br w
since 4w  h1 h2  the area depends on h1 and h2 only through the combination h1 h2 
the extremality condition resulting from variation of s with s  l  can be written as
1  gr2 
2  gr  gr   ln
1  gr2
brf 2
where  is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric on  and
f  h1 h2 w  
h1 h2
2br w
the dependence on r itself drops out for zero temperature ie when br  1 if rx y is a
solution to the extremality condition at zero temperature then so is rx y  c with a constant c
with different asymptotic values at x   this reflects the defect conformal symmetry
boundary conditions
we now discuss the boundary conditions for surfaces extending along  starting with the two
boundary components of the strip at y  0 and y  2  near y  0 the sphere s12  collapses with
f12  4y 2 2 so that the background has no conical singularity in the space parametrized by y and
s12  the induced metric 14 near y  0 consequently takes the form
ds2  e2r f42 ds2r2  f22 ds2s 2  42 dx2  dy 2  y 2 ds2s 2  4 dx x r  dyy r2 
the contribution proportional to y r2 dy 2 threatens to introduce a conical singularity in the
y s12  part of the induced metric on the surface a smooth metric is obtained with the neumann
boundary condition y ry0  0 the reasoning for the second boundary component where s22
collapses is analogous we conclude
y rx y
y rx y
y 2

the nature of the limit x   is different for the solutions in 6 for a nongravitating bath
where an ads5  s 5 region emerges in this limit compared to the solution 7 for a gravitating
bath for the latter the limits x   both lead to regular boundary points and the boundary

of y as a result one can find extremal surfaces with no dependence on y which is an angular

condition with r0 y  rr  in summary

nearpole behavior
at zero temperature the minimal surfaces will show distinct behavior near the 5brane sources
and cap off there1 in this section we will discuss this behavior analytically using the form of
the supergravity solutions near the 5brane sources at finite temperature the behavior near the
5brane sources will be regulated by the horizon
this differs from the behavior of the spherical entangling surface centered on the defect studied in 33 which has
a simple universal embedding which is insensitive to the 5brane sources
to discuss the behavior near a pole at z  z0 it is convenient to introduce coordinates centered
on the pole z  z0  rei for z0 on the real line and z  z0  rei for imz0   2 the
combinations that appear in the area functional 17 behave at zero temperature as follows
f  h1 h2 w   f0 sin2  ln r 
1 h1 h2
 r2 ln r 
2 w
where f0 is a constant which depends on the solution under consideration the value of f0 will not
be relevant since the extremality condition 18 is invariant under constant rescalings of f 
to discuss the nearpole behavior it is convenient to drop the overall factor in the extremality
condition 18 and use the condition in the form
1  gr2
0  2   gr  gr   ln
the two nontrivial terms on the right hand side are generically of the same order noting that
 ln    o1r a scaling analysis suggests to take r  o1r ln r and make an ansatz
rr   r0 ln ln r 
r1 
ln r
where the ellipsis denotes regular and subleading terms the leading nontrivial order in the
extremality condition 28 then is its finite part the nearpole solution without divergences in 
is given by r0  1 and r1 constant in summary the behavior of the embedding near a 5brane
source at z  z0 is given by
rz z   ln ln z  z0      
since limzz0 rz z   the minimal surface drops into the poincar horizon at the source
at the point z0 the background geometry is singular as appropriate for a solution near a 5brane
source and we do not impose additional regularity conditions for the minimal surface
hm surfaces
we will focus on the nongravitating bath solutions 6 for the discussion of hm surfaces those
for the gravitating bath solutions will be discussed in sec vi we use the tortoise coordinate u
defined in 9 and parametrize the embedding at t  0 in terms of xu y instead of rx y the
minimal surfaces range in u from the value enforced by the dirichlet boundary condition 26
through the horizon into the thermofield double we focus on surfaces anchored at the same point
rr in the thermofield double which are symmetric with respect to reflection across u  0 at t  0
so we can restrict to u  0 to find the embeddings from that perspective the hm surfaces end
on the horizon at u  0 along a curve xh y which is determined by the extremality condition
the induced metric with the tortoise coordinate u and the parametrization xu y becomes

on the other end the surface should intersect the horizon and end from the onesided perspective
at u  0 the symmetry under reflection across u  0 leads to the neumann condition
u xu yu0  0 
this condition also ensures that boundary terms in the variation of the area at u  0 vanish
solving for minimal surfaces
to summarize the extremality conditions are nonlinear secondorder pdes on the strip  
x  iyx  r 0  y  2  with neumann boundary conditions at y  0 and y  2  the domain
and boundary conditions in the x direction depend on the background solution and type of surface
under consideration the solutions are expected to be smooth except for the locations on the two
boundary components at y  0 2  where the d5ns5 sources are in 6 and 7
to solve these pdes numerically we start with a trial surface satisfying the boundary conditions
and let it dynamically settle on a minimal area configuration to this end an auxiliary external
time parameter  is introduced and the embedding say for island surfaces is described by a
 dependent function rx y   the  evolution for rx y   is chosen as
 rx y    l1
rx y  
where l is the volume element of the surface in 17 this exerts a force on the embedding in the
direction in which the area decreases the right hand side is given by 18 with rx y replaced
by rx y  
to numerically implement the relaxation the embedding function rx y   is discretized in x
and y and eq 36 is replaced by a set of odes for the values of r at the lattice points rij  
we use x  tanhx to obtain a finite domain and a rectangular lattice with equidistant points
the derivatives are discretized using secondorder finite differences and the boundary conditions are
implemented such that they are compatible with the secondorder accuracy of the finite differences2
the resulting set of odes is integrated numerically using mathematica
asymptotically the evolution of the rij   is expected to settle on an equilibrium configuration
  which is a discretized solution to the extremality condition for the minimal surface letting
rij
the evolution 36 run for a large time max fl 1 will yield an approximation to this equilibrium
configuration the quality of the final configuration rij max  can be assessed from the residuals
rij  l1
rx y  
 max
for neumann boundary conditions the lattice is extended by one row beyond the actual domain the neumann
boundary conditions in the y direction 21 apply for regular points of  not at the locations of the 5brane
sources this has to be taken into account in the discretization
fig 5 island surfaces from top left to bottom right anchored at rr  5 3 21 1 the horizon is at
rh  0 and n5 k  2 the ads5  s 5 region emerges at tanh x  1 the 5brane sources are at tanh x  0
and tanh x  1 is a regular point in the internal space for smaller rr smaller radiation region the
surfaces stay closer to the horizon near the 5brane sources the surfaces reach to the horizon for all rr 
we typically use a lattice with o100 nodes in the x and y directions though coarser lattices
already capture the qualitative form of the surfaces well for the surfaces and data shown below
the residuals have decreased to o106  or less a limitation of this method is that it is unlikely to
capture extremal surfaces for which the area functional does not take a local minimum ie saddle
points however the interest here is primarily in actual minimal surfaces
due to the symmetry of the d5ns5 brane sources in the supergravity solutions 6 and 7
under sduality combined with z  i2z the einsteinframe metric is invariant under y  2 y
for the minimal surfaces discussed here the boundary conditions respect this symmetry so that
the surfaces themselves are symmetric the pdes thus only have to be solved on the half of the
strip  with 0  y  4  with a neumann boundary condition at y  4 to enforce the symmetry
islands with nongravitating baths
in this section we discuss minimal surfaces island contributions and the emergence of page
curves in the 10d solutions for nongravitating baths given in 6 the general structure of the
supergravity solutions is illustrated in fig 2 and we have d5 and ns5brane sources respectively
at x y  0 0 and x y  0 2 the 8d minimal surfaces can be visualized as 2d surfaces in
the 3d space spanned by the x and y coordinates parametrizing  and the ads4 radial direction
they are obtained using the relaxation method of sec iv we will start with a discussion of general
features before moving on to comparing the areas of island and hm surfaces
fig 6 hm surfaces at t  0 for rr  1 left and rr  21 right with rh  0 and n5 k  2 the plots
show the tortoise radial coordinate u in which the horizon is intersected orthogonally the further the hm
surfaces are anchored from the horizon at rh  0 the further they reach towards negative x
island vs hm surfaces
a sample of island surfaces with varying anchor points rr  limx rx y in the ads5  s 5
region for supergravity solutions 6 with temperature rh  0 and n5 k  2 is shown in fig 5
simultaneous rescalings of n5 and k lead to an overall rescaling of the metric functions in 2 so
the form of the minimal surfaces only depends on the ratio n5 k the ratio n5 k controls the
ratio of the number of d3branes suspended between the 5branes and the number of semiinfinite
d3branes for n5 k  2 these numbers are equal fig 4a for surfaces with large rr  anchored
far from the horizon the impact of the 5brane sources is clearly visible in fig 5 in line with the
behavior discussed in sec iii c the relaxation method works with the zero temperature case as
well see fig 8b as the anchor point rr is decreased moving towards the horizon the entire
surface moves towards the horizon and the nearpole behavior becomes less pronounced
for the surfaces in fig 5 a discretization with 200 100 points in tanh x y was used and
the residuals 37 at   103 are reduced to o1010  the quality of the solutions can also
be investigated using the undiscretized extremality condition 18 from a discretized solution
one can construct a twice differentiable interpolating function rx y the interpolation should
not necessarily be expected to capture the true solution accurately away from the lattice points
especially near the d5ns5 sources where the true solution is not smooth evaluating 18 on the
interpolation nevertheless only produces small errors near the poles which decrease further with
increased lattice resolution suggesting that they are benign and not systematic
examples of t  0 hm surfaces for n5 k  2 are shown in fig 6 for radiation regions that
start far in the bath system the surfaces are anchored close to the horizon at tanh x  1 ie with
rr close to rh  these surfaces drop into the horizon along a curve xh y which is located well
before reaching the d5ns5 sources at x  03 upon moderately increasing rr  the surfaces reach
further towards smaller values of x the curve xh y starts to bulge out towards negative values
in the interior of  ie for y 6 0 2 while the boundary values xh 0 and xh 2 remain at
larger values and stay shy of reaching the 5brane sources at x  0 the behavior upon further
increasing rr depends on n5 k and will be discussed below
with the surfaces in hand we can compare the areas between island and t  0 hm surfaces
anchored at the same rr and discuss the time evolution of the entropy the areas have the usual
divergences associated with entanglement entropies in 4d rather than isolating the divergences
if the initial trial surface reaches beyond the 5brane sources the relaxation transitions it into the x  0 region

fig 7 area difference s  sisland  shm as function of the anchor point rr in the asymptotic ads5  s 5

radius of the ads5  s 5 region is controlled by n5 k the number of defect degrees of freedom by n52  the
colorcoded dots are from top to bottom for n5 k  12 16 20 24 with k  1
separately for island and hm surfaces we directly compute the finite area difference between
island and hm surfaces anchored at the same rr  for numerical stability it is desirable to take the
difference at the level of the integrands at least in the region of large x since the hm surface is
obtained with a different parametrization we transform the hm surface described by xhm r y to
a parametrization in terms of rhm x y by inverting xhm r y with respect to the first argument
the derivatives of rhm can be expressed in terms of xhm 
x rhm x y 
r xhm r y
rrhm xy
y rx y  
y xhm r y
r xhm r y
rrhm xy
this is used to replace the derivatives in the area functional 17 before replacing rhm x y itself
by the inverse of xhm  to avoid taking derivatives of the inverted function and improve numerical
stability the area integrands obtained this way are numerically smooth and are used to compute
the area differences with a cutoff tanh x  1   the dependence on the cutoff is very mild with
percent level variation between   102 and   103  and the latter is used for the plots
the results are shown in fig 7 they show that the island surface has larger area than the t  0
hm surface when rr is not too far from the horizon rh  this leads to page curves the radiation
region is identified far from the location where the gravity and bath systems meet r   as the
part of the ads5  s 5 region at x   with ads4 radial coordinate r  rr  with rr close to rh 
the results in fig 7 show that for these regions the area of the hm surface at t  0 is smaller than
the area of the island surface the area of the hm surface grows with time but the entropy is
bounded by the constant area of the island surface leading to a page curve
the results in fig 7 show that the area difference between the island and t  0 hm surfaces
is larger for larger n5 k one may compare this to expectations based on the karchrandall
models larger n5 k corresponds to a bcft with more 3d defect degrees of freedom relative to
4d bulk degrees of freedom which in the 5d models amounts to larger tension of the etw brane
larger tension bends the etw brane towards the conformal boundary of ads5 in fig 1 ie smaller
 a tensionless brane has   2 from this 5d perspective one would expect the island surface
to have larger area relative to the t  0 hm surface for smaller  since the etw brane is further
from the bath this is the 5d version of the area difference being larger for larger n5 k in 10d
the curves in fig 7 further show transition points rr at which the areas of the island and
hm surfaces are equal at t  0 suggesting constant entropies for rr  rr  near the end points

way to x   and ceases to settle on an equilibrium configuration the hm surface could turn
from a minimum to a saddle point which the relaxation could transition over towards the island

region around the 5brane sources and can not be parametrized globally by xu y the value of

be found explicitly with no noticeable bound on rr  the separation between rr
to grow with n5 k for radiation regions far in the bath small rr  we find page curves for
rr  rr fig 7 suggests that the island surfaces lead to constant entropies though if new types of
hm surfaces become relevant the entropy curve may remain nontrivial in either case the entropy
is bounded by the area of the island surfaces which we find explicitly for small and large rr 
critical brane setups
the ratio n5 k plays a prominent role also at zero temperature a sample of island minimal
surfaces for different values of n5 k at zero temperature is shown in fig 8b for fixed anchor
point in the asymptotic ads5  s 5 region the point where the surfaces close off at x   moves
towards the poincar horizon as n5 k is increased this is shown more quantitatively in fig 8a
which shows the difference between rr  limx rx y and rl  limx rx y as function
of n5 k for small n5 k the difference rr  rl grows linearly but for larger n5 k it starts to
grow rapidly faster than exponential the plot suggests the existence of a critical value
 40 
k crit
at which rr rl diverges for the surfaces from which the data in fig 8a is extracted the residuals
37 are reduced to at most o107  increasing n5 k beyond the critical value appears to lead
to irreducible residuals 37 which remain finite and keep driving the anchors rl and rr further
apart with increasing runtime in   rather than settling on an equilibrium configuration this is
consistent with rr  rl diverging when n5 k approaches 39 and there being no island minimal
surfaces beyond the critical value at zero temperature

fig 9 difference rr  rl between the end points at x   at finite temperature with rh  0 from
bottom to top for n5 k  225 275 325 375 425 the solid black line shows rl  0
these results line up well with the observations in the karchrandall models as noted before
the angle  of the etw brane in 5d is expected to be an effective description for the number of
defect degrees of freedom relative to the number of 4d degrees of freedom which in this particular
example of a 10d solution is determined by the ratio n5 k the discussion in 11 found that as
the angle is decreased the point where the island minimal surface with fixed anchor on the bath
brane hits the etw brane moves towards the infrared and diverges towards the poincar horizon
at a critical angle this is consistent with the behavior of the 10d solutions considered here if 1
is identified with n5 k it would be interesting to investigate more general 10d solutions eg with
multiple 5brane sources in which one may expect a more complicated phase structure
at finite temperature the runaway behavior of the capoff point rl at the critical n5 k is
regulated by the black hole horizon and island surfaces can be found beyond the critical n5 k
the behavior can again be diagnosed by the difference rr  rl  at zero temperature and below the
critical n5 k this difference is finite and independent of rr  with its value growing rapidly towards
the critical n5 k at finite temperature and below the critical value of n5 k the difference rr rl
is not constant but it approaches a constant for large rr  this behavior can be seen in fig 9 as
the curves that saturate towards a constant the constant is set by the zero temperature value of
rr  rl  as n5 k approaches the critical value the point where the growth of rr  rl saturates
increases rapidly the results are consistent with rr  rl staying linear without bound for n5 k
beyond the critical value the end point rl appears stuck below a critical value similar to the
behavior found in the 5d models in 11
islands with gravitating baths
we now turn to the gravitating bath solutions 7 in which the ads5  s 5 region at x   is
reduced to a regular point of the internal space fig 3 these solutions have massless 4d gravitons
ther 4d newton constant is related to the free energy of the dual 3d scfts and proportional
to  h1 h2 w  without the ads5  s 5 region there is no natural place to geometrically define
radiation regions compatible with diffeomorphism invariance at x   or to anchor minimal
surfaces minimal surfaces stretching from x   to x   instead satisfy neumann boundary
conditions on both ends as discussed in sec iii b and are found to settle onto the horizon this
leads to a flat entropy curve in line with the arguments of 26 for gravitating baths
as suggested in 26 28 a page curve may still arise for other quantities in situations with
gravitating baths an alternative is to consider surfaces that divide the internal space which may
be expected to compute nongeometric ees though the general interpretation of such surfaces
fig 10 island surfaces in gravitating bath solutions from left to right for   05 04 03 the vertical
axis shows the tortoise ads4 radial coordinate u the surfaces are anchored at the conformal boundary of
ads4 u   on the curve xy  0 in  the plots only cover the x  0 part of  near the 5brane
sources the surface caps off close to the horizon the capoff point at x   increases as  decreases
may not be entirely understood one can view some of them in the current context as limiting cases
of surfaces computing geometric ees as suggested in 11 an earlier example where geometric
ees turn nongeometric in the ir can be found in 35 the proposal of 11 can be made precise
in 10d consider brane configurations where d3branes suspended between 5branes are kept
finite in extent to realize n  4 sym on an interval one may compute conventional geometric
ees on that interval though holographic duals for n  4 sym on an interval are not explicitly
known these geometric ees would be represented by conventional ryutakayanagi surfaces in the
putative holographic duals as ir fixed points one obtains 3d t su n  scfts with holographic
duals of the form discussed here at the ir fixed point the geometric ees on the interval become
nongeometric ees and the ryutakayanagi surfaces become minimal surfaces in the internal
space we thus expect at least certain minimal surfaces separating regions in the internal space to
compute nongeometric ees in lowerdimensional examples such ees are discussed in 36
there are numerous ways to separate regions in the internal space in the 10d type iib solutions
one may for example divide one of the s 2 s which should be related to a split of the hilbert space
based on the rsymmetry 30 the surfaces which arise from geometric ees as outlined above
are expected to split the riemann surface  instead where they can separate the 5brane sources
as shown in 37 minimal surfaces dividing the internal space end when reaching the conformal
boundary of the ads part on an extremal subsurface in the internal space boundary conditions
can be imposed to fix the subleading behavior as the conformal boundary in the ads part is
approached instead of the leading behavior eg for surfaces splitting the s 5 in ads5  s 5 the
slipping mode away from the equator in the solutions 7 there is a natural candidate extremal
surface in  due to the reflection symmetry of the solution under x  x the locus xy  0 is
extremal in  and can serve as an anchor point for 8d minimal surfaces wrapping the spatial part
of ads4  both s 2 s and a curve in  which depends on the ads4 radial coordinate u
a symmetric hm surface which is anchored at xy  0 also in the thermofield double is given
by xu y  0 this entire surface is extremal thanks to the reflection symmetry in x  x more
general surfaces may be obtained by specifying nontrivial subleading behavior in the ads4 radial
coordinate as the x  0 locus is approached4 we only impose that the surface be anchored at
xy  0 for u   and in the thermofield double and then let the relaxation method settle on a
surface this procedure selects the xu y  0 hm surface at t  0 since xy  0 is an extremal
curve in  finding the hm surfaces for t 6 0 reduces to a problem within the ads4 part of the
geometry which is identical to the discussion in appendix a of 11
for the island surfaces we impose that they are similarly anchored for u   along the xy  0
admissible choices for the falloff behavior near the boundary of ads4 can be determined by linearizing the
extremality condition around the xu y  0 surface and performing a mode expansion in the y direction

under x  x the surfaces ending at x   and x   are symmetryrelated and we only
construct the ones ending at x   explicitly
a sample of island surfaces for different values of the 5brane source locations  on  is shown
in fig 10 the plots show only half the range of x for larger  the surfaces more rapidly approach
the horizon and then stay close to it this behavior is captured more quantitatively in fig 11a

diverging towards the conformal boundary for a critical value
c  028 
in line with this interpretation the relaxation method does not settle on equilibrium minimal
surfaces below c  instead the trial surfaces keep approaching the conformal boundary of ads4 at
generic points of  while staying close to the horizon at the 5brane sources in line with behavior
derived in sec iii c this will be discussed further below
the area differences between the island and t  0 hm surfaces are computed similarly to the
nongravitating bath case to implement the subtraction at the integrand level the embedding
for the island surface uisland x y has to be inverted with respect to the first argument to match
the parametrization of the hm surface the embeddings are not invertible on the entire domain
so the subtraction is implemented at the integrand level in a patch around x  0 and at the
integral level for the remaining parts the resulting area differences are shown in fig 11b as
colored curves for different choices of cutoff on the ads4 radial coordinate the cutoff on the
radial coordinate is imposed in feffermangraham gauge eu   with  varied between 0005
and 005 the curves are indistinguishable for generic values of  they only spread in a narrow
region around c  where the island surfaces approach the conformal boundary of ads4 and residual
cutoff dependence can be seen the residual cutoff dependence is smooth and is fitted for each
 to obtain an extrapolation to zero cutoff the result is shown as dashed black curve
the area differences in fig 11 show that generically for large  the hm surface at t  0 has
smaller area than the island surface the area of the hm surface grows in time and when it equals

fig 12 left area differences s  sisland  shm normalized to the constant in 42 the plot shows the
extrapolated curve of fig 11b right page curves the solid line shows the timedependent finite part of
the area of the hm surface the corresponding constant areas of island surfaces are shown as dashed lines
from bottom to top for   029 032 04 05 06 the page time increases monotonically with 
that of the island surface the island surface becomes dominant leading to a page curve the curves
in fig 11 suggest a second distinguished value for  a page value p where s at t  0 vanishes
the value of p obtained from the numerical data
p  029 
is close to but slightly larger than the critical c in 40 since the difference between c and p is
small and the island surfaces become numerically challenging for   c  as evidenced in the spread
of the curves in fig 11 the possibility remains that the true area difference may be nonnegative
for all   c  in the possibly empty range c    p  the island surface dominates already at
t  0 and leads to a flat entropy curve regardless of the relation between c and p  for   c the
entropy growth indicated by the hm surface is limited by island surfaces whose area is constant
as noted before finding timedependent hm surfaces reduces to a problem within the ads4
part of the geometry since x  0 is an extremal curve in  up to an overall factor the area as
function of time can then be determined as in appendix a of 11 to which we refer for details
on that part of the computation the overall factor arises from the parts of the internal space
wrapped by the 8d minimal surfaces in the 10d solutions it can be determined by integrating the
area functional in 32 evaluated on the x  0 embedding over y this leads to the factor

it will be convenient to discuss the timedependent entropy curves normalized to this factor so
that the area of the hm surface is universal the area differences between island and hm surfaces
at t  0 normalized to c are shown in fig 12a as function of 1 the normalized area differences
are monotonically increasing with  the timedependent entropy curves up to factors of c and the
10d newton constant are shown in fig 12b to obtain the curves a timeindependent divergent
part has been minimally subtracted and a factor 2 has been included to account for the parts of
the surfaces in the thermofield double fig 12b shows the transition from the hm surface to the
island surfaces for various  the page time at which the transition occurs increases monotonically
with  though the t  0 area differences in fig 11b are not monotonic the page time depends
also on the growth rate of the hm surface which decreases with  the page time vanishes at p 
the 10d results are remarkably consistent with the phase structure found in 5d karchrandall
models if the inverse brane angle  in 5d is seen as effective description for the brane stack separation
 on  the analysis of 11 identified critical angles and page angles with a phase structure of
minimal surfaces that with the aforementioned identification qualitatively matches the results
found here compare eg fig 5 of 11 to fig 12a the symmetry of the 10d solutions 7 under
x  x suggests that they give rise to karchrandall models with two equal etw brane angles
the range   c  where no island minimal surfaces are found corresponds to the regime
above the critical etw brane angle in 5d the dominant contribution in 5d was identified as
tiny islands which arise as limiting surfaces that connect the defect to one of the etw branes
infinitesimally close to the conformal boundary in 10d the behavior of the island surfaces for
  c and of the trial island surfaces below c  summarized around 40 both indicate that
similar tiny island limiting surfaces arise for   c  the evolution of trial island surfaces for   c
indicates that the 10d tiny islands approach the conformal boundary of ads4 almost everywhere
on  except for narrow throats around the 5brane sources where they reach to the horizon in 5d
the tiny islands were further motivated in 11 through a deformation in which the etw branes
are separated and the tiny islands arise as limits of extremal surfaces computing geometric ees
this deformation has a clear analog in 10d as keeping some d3 branes finite in extent to describe
n  4 sym on an interval it would be interesting to study this deformation also in 10d which
would require as a first step the corresponding supergravity solutions

outlook
the results presented here demonstrate in a uvcomplete string theory setting the emergence of
entanglement islands and page curves for black holes in fourdimensional theories of gravity the
gravity theories certainly differ from the one we experience in nature but they have dynamical
gravitons with a mass that can be controlled and show versions of the information paradox whose
resolution can be analyzed via adscft using a variety of methods we close with some brief
thoughts on avenues for future exploration
the discussions were based on representative type iib supergravity solutions that realize 5d
karchrandall braneworlds with nongravitating and gravitating baths in 10d these solutions
are members of a broad class of solutions corresponding to more general configurations of d3
d5 and ns5 branes it would be interesting to study further examples the brane angles that
play a crucial role in the phenomenology of the karchrandall models were given analogs in the
representative 10d solutions where the entanglement entropies exhibit a similar phase structure
one may suspect more complicated phase structures to emerge for more general 10d solutions
it would be desirable to understand the time evolution of the entanglement entropies from the
perspective of the dual qfts the critical parameters in the supergravity solutions translate in
a precise way to brane configurations and in turn to parameters in n  4 sym on a half space
and 3d t su n  scfts this should provide a concrete starting point for investigating the
resolution of information paradoxes through entanglement islands in 4d using qft methods
a key holographic aspect appears to be a better understanding of minimal surfaces in the
internal space these are apparently quantities which exhibit page curve behavior in systems with
a gravitating bath both in the 5d karchrandall models and in the string theory versions yet the
holographic understanding of these surfaces and their associated field theory quantities leaves much
to be desired the 10d setups with the full internal space present should be a viable starting
point for more detailed investigations of page curve behavior in surfaces bisecting the internal
space the surfaces studied in sec vi are natural candidates for computing ees associated with
decompositions of the quiver diagram in the uv description of the dual 3d scfts
