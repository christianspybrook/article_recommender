abstract the reversible computation paradigm aims to provide a new foundation for general classical
digital computing that is capable of circumventing the thermodynamic limits to the energy efficiency of
the conventional nonreversible paradigm however to date the essential rationale for and analysis
of classical reversible computing rc has not yet been expressed in terms that leverage the modern
formal methods of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics neqt in this paper we begin developing an neqtbased foundation for the physics of reversible computing we use the framework of
gorinikossakowskisudarshanlindblad dynamics aka lindbladians with multiple asymptotic states
incorporating recent results from resource theory full counting statistics and stochastic thermodynamics
important conclusions include that as expected 1 landauers principle indeed sets a strict lower
bound on entropy generation in traditional nonreversible architectures for deterministic computing
machines when we account for the loss of correlations and 2 implementations of the alternative
reversible computation paradigm can potentially avoid such losses and thereby circumvent the landauer
limit potentially allowing the efficiency of future digital computing technologies to continue improving
indefinitely we also outline a research plan for identifying the fundamental minimum energy dissipation
of reversible computing machines as a function of speed

1 introduction
the concept of reversible computation or computation without information loss even
locally played a centrally important role in the historical development of the thermodynamics
of computation 16 it remains critically important today in the field of quantum computing
where it is necessary for maintaining coherence in quantum algorithms 7 however the
original motivation for reversible computation which was to circumvent the kt ln 2 landauer
limit1 on energy dissipation in classical digital computing is less often remembered today
some authors have critiqued the original arguments for landauers limit and reversible
computing as relying on equilibrium assumptions eg 8 but in fact no such assumption
beyond the existence of an external heat sink at some temperature t is required when properly
stated and interpreted landauers limit holds regardless of whether the computing system is
at or even close to equilibrium internally this statement follows directly from elementary
statistical physics and information theory 9
indeed landauers limit has also been derived directly for systems out of equilibrium
1011 this nonequilibrium limit is expressed purely in terms of the nonunitality of the
in this expression k  kb  138  1023 jk is boltzmanns constant which is the natural logarithmic unit of entropy and t is temperature

quantum channel evolving the system and heat bath in other words landauers limit has
been derived solely as a consequence of thermal operations as defined in neqt acting on
the joint quantum mechanical evolution of a system and a bath this directly reinforces the
motivation for reversible computing which is to avoid the landauer cost of ejecting correlated
information into the environment the free energy2 cost of operations that do not eject
correlated information can be made arbitrarily small a fact rigorously proven using resource
theoretic techniques in neqt 12 we discuss these connections in some detail in later
sections further the enterprise of recasting the classic understanding of the thermodynamics
of computing in more modern terms offers other benefits in particular it allows the theoretical
apparatus of the modern neqt formalism to be brought to bear on the problem of analyzing
the potential capabilities of and fundamental limits on classical reversible computational
processes
this problem is of far more than just academic interest today an increasingly serious
concern is that the conventional nonreversible paradigm for general digital computation is
approaching firm limits to its energy efficiency and cost efficiency these limits ultimately
trace back to the kt energy scale since reversible computing is broadly speaking the only
nonconventional computing paradigm that can potentially offer a sustainable path forward
capable of circumventing the efficiency limits associated with that energy scale in general digital
computing it is therefore critically important to the prospects for medium and longterm
improvement in the efficiency and economic utility of general digital computing to determine
exactly what the potentialities and limitations of reversible computational mechanisms may
be according to fundamental theory
in this paper we aim to carry out the essential groundwork for this enterprise laying
down lowlevel theoretical foundations upon which a comprehensive neqtbased treatment
of physical mechanisms for reversible computation may be based it is essential for any
such effort to identify the most appropriate definitions for key concepts and we do this
throughout taking special care with the definitions of the appropriate physical concepts
corresponding to classical digital computational states and operations on this ground we
advocate for our position that the most appropriate understanding of landauers principle is
to view it as comprising most essentially a statement about the strict entropy increase that is
required due to the loss of mutual information that necessarily occurs whenever nontrivially
deterministically computed ergo correlated bits are thermalized in isolation there are other
oftcited forms of the principle that deal only with a transfer of entropy between computational
and noncomputational forms but we instead refer to these as the fundamental theorem of the
thermodynamics of computation to avoid confusion since it has long been known that simple
transfers of entropy between different forms can occur in a thermodynamically reversible
way the inappropriate conflation of landauers principle proper as we identify it with
the fundamental theorem is what we believe has been the root cause of a great deal of
confusion in the thermodynamics of computing field as we suggest simply appropriately
distinguishing these concepts permits the straightforward resolution of many longstanding
controversies
another central aim of this work is to go beyond discussions of landauers limit to develop a firstprinciples model of classical rc operations using informationtheoretic techniques
in nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics these techniques allow us to understand the
fundamental quantum mechanical expressions of and restrictions on classical rc operations
in several ways from resource theory and fluctuation theorems 1215 these techniques provide us with a way of understanding the overall limitations of state transitions including those
the free energy referred to here is the   1 free energy in particular ie the nonequilibrium helmholtz free energy in the words of 12 directly
that work shows that the most general possible type of catalytic thermal operation and thus the most general type of transition possible in quantum
thermodynamics restores the distinguished role of the helmholtz free energy

that correspond to classical rc operations in addition to constraints the framework of gorinikossakowskisudarshanlindblad operators gksl operators also known as lindbladians
with multiple asymptotic states 1719 offer a framework by which explicit nonequilibrium
quantum thermodynamic expressions of classical rc operations can be realized as such
these techniques offer a natural language for expressing the dynamics of rc operations and
provide us with an understanding of the fundamental quantum mechanical restrictions on the
way these operations can manifest in physical systems fundamental bounds on quantities
of interest such as the dissipation of an operation as a function of its speed will necessarily
have to arise from neqt
here we provide a description of rc operations via the theory of open quantum systems
in this formulation we can examine the joint evolution of the computing system with a thermal
environment aka heat bath using the machinery of completely positive trace preserving
maps cptp maps aka quantum channels in particular we rely on the framework of
gksl operators with multiple asymptotic states 1719 to develop representations of classical
reversible information processing operations quite powerfully this framework can directly
give us bounds on dissipation quantities of interest not only for rc operations but for
quantum computation qc operations as wellsince we express rc operations in terms of
quantum channels the results we derive for rc operations can be directly extended to qc
operations in future work
the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows section 2 describes materials
and methods including outlining a broad theoretical framework in 21 relating that broad
framework to the more detailed tools and methods of neqt in 22 and reviewing a variety
of existing and proposed physical implementation technologies for reversible computing

frameworks of catalytic thermal operations and gksl dynamics 3435 sec 4 gives some
general discussion of results and outlines our research plan looking forwards and sec 5
concludes
2 materials and methods
as this article presents theoretical rather than experimental work there is no laboratory
apparatus to speak of however we provide a brief review of some of the existing and proposed
physical implementation technologies for reversible computing in 23 but first we present
the key foundational definitions of our broad theoretical picture in 21 please note that this
presentation roughly follows but expands upon that given in 920 then in 22 we tie this
broad picture to the much more detailed theoretical apparatus of neqt
21 broad theoretical foundations
in this subsection we present and review a number of important lowlevel definitions
that form the broad foundation upon which our overall approach to the physics of reversible
computing is built this includes 211 our overall picture based on a framework of open
quantum systems 212 our definition of classical digital computational states and their
physical representation which invokes what we call a protocomputational basis which may in
general be timedependent 213 our definitions for classical computational operations and
different types of operations which are expressible in terms of 214 primitive computational
state transitions and 215 the appropriate definition of what it means for a given unitary
time evolution to implement a classical computational operation

211 open quantum systems framework
in this subsection we briefly review the broad outlines of the open quantum systems
based picture that we are using in this paper further details will be developed in 22
2111 system and environment
we begin with a fairly conventional picture of a physical computer system based on an
open quantum systems perspective at the highest level we assume that the model universe
u under study can be described as a composition of two subsystems s e where s is the
physical computer system in question and e is its external environment ie the rest of u
outside of s as an example one could define the computer system s as consisting of
everything ie all quantum fields encompassed within some region of 31d spacetime
circumscribed by some closed 21dimensional bounding surface for simplicity one could
think of a spatial boundary that is unchanging in time over some interval typically our
analyses will treat the environment e as an effectively infinitely large uniform thermal
reservoir heat bath that is internally at thermal equilibrium at some effectively constant
over time temperature t the temperature may be treated as effectively constant when the
environment is large enough that its temperature is negligibly affected by heat transferred
from s3
meanwhile we will treat the computer system s as an in general nonequilibrium system
which includes its own internal supply of free energy eg this could be a battery or a fuel
reservoir this is just a simplification of the overall picture for our present purposes to avoid
the need to explicitly represent a flow of work or free energy in from a separate power supply
system ie the power supply is treated as internal to the computer however we will allow
that the system s is able to exchange thermal energy and entropy with its environment e
through all or some portion of its boundary typically the computer would be assumed
to expel waste heat to its external environment e during operation in order to maintain its
ss own internal operating temperature which will generally be nonuniform within some
reasonable bounds the mechanisms for managing the needed thermal flows are generally
assumed to be contained within s see figure 1
2112 decoherence model
a further important simplifying assumption is that we as modelers cannot effectively
track any classical or quantum correlations between the detailed states of s and e or
internal correlations between different parts of e on any practical timescales note this
is not to say that such correlations do not exist physically as they do under unitary time
evolution but rather just that they are not reflected in our state of knowledge as modelers a
typical assumption which we adopt is that it is also safe or reasonable to ignore any such
correlations that may exist4
stated slightly more formally we first assume for simplicity that the hilbert space hu
of the model universe u factorizes neatly into separate hilbert spaces for the system s and
environment e that is
hu  he  hs 
given this we can imagine that within a negligible thermalization timescale subsequent to
the emission of any small increment q of waste heat out of s the mixed state u of the
model universe would quickly degrade for all practical purposes into a correlationfree
of course this model is already somewhat of an idealization since a typical real environment would attain a nonuniform temperature profile under a
steadystate thermal flow with constant power output from s but it can nevertheless be considered an adequate model for an initial study
whether this is in fact a valid assumption is a broad question about the applicability of this opensystems perspective which we do not address in this
paper

figure 1 simplified picture of our model universe u in an open quantum systems framework power
supplies and waste heat removal mechanisms are assumed to be included within the physical computer
system s in general we may assume there is a flow of waste heat from the system out to an assumed
very large external heat bath e
product state u  e  s  where e is the maximumentropy equilibrium mixed state of
energy qe which includes the heat increment q after it has diffused into the environment
and s is a reduced density matrix for the mixed state of the computer system after one
has traced out any lingering correlations it may have had with the environment initially
upon emission of the waste heat note that in the absence of totally separable dynamics ie
bu  h
be  h
bs  a strict entropy increase is
a hamiltonian over hu given at all times by h
implied by taking the trace over e compared to the entropy of an immediatelyprior joint state
0 briefly entangling the environment with the system in the instant just after the emission of
the heat q thus simply performing this state reduction results in global entropy increases
in the model universe even when all other dynamics including the internal dynamics within
s is taken to be unitary this state reduction process models the effective decoherence of the
system s as a result of its interaction with the modeled as thermal environment e 21
a slightly more general model with weaker assumptions can be provided by stipulating
that we take the trace over e only once at the very end of an evolution of interest rather than
continuously after each incremental emission q of heat into this environment postponing
the state reduction allows for the possibility that correlationsentanglements between the
system s and environment e and within e may persist for some period of time and affect
the evolution to some extent however it is not expected that this change will make very
much difference in practice5
modeling the allowed thermal transformations of open quantum systems in detail is the
topic of the resource theory of quantum thermodynamics rtqt which we review briefly in 
as a thought experiment consider a computer system s in deep space such that any thermal photons emitted from the system into the environment
would be expected to mostly just propagate to infinity with only an astronomically tiny probability of reflecting off of interplanetary gas or dust in
such a way as to convey correlated quantum information back into the system the analysis of such cases at least would clearly be only insignificantly
affected by treating state reduction as a continuous process

221 below but first let us continue outlining our broad framework for studying the physics
of rc
212 computational states and the protocomputational basis
we now discuss how to formally model in both abstract and physical terms the digital
computational states of a computer system s
note that our emphasis in this paper is on classical not quantum reversible computation
and furthermore we wish the scope of our model to include the usual case in real engineered
digital computing systems which is that digital computational states may be encoded by
extended physical objects whose detailed microstate is in general not fully determined by the
computational state being represented as an example of this consider a logic node connected
conductor within a digital cmos circuit where typically the digital symbols 0 and 1 may
nominally be represented by node voltages within certain prespecified nonoverlapping
lowtohigh ranges v0l  v0h  and v1l  v1h  respectively
2121 designated times
given that we wish to model active computing machines in which the abstract computational state of the machine changes over the course of some time interval we can expect
to encounter the difficulty that the classical digital state of the machine which as a discrete
entity takes on values that range over some merely countable set may not be welldefined
in traditional terms at least at all moments during the physically continuous transition
from one state to the next to avoid this difficulty while maintaining simplicity in our model
we will declare for purposes of the present paper that there exists some countable set   
of time points   r labeled with integers   z which we will call the designated times at
which the classical digital computational state of the machine is welldefined
note that this model is somewhat oversimplified since a real engineered computing
system is typically not monolithic but is broken down into subsystems and it may be the case
that the larger system is globally asynchronous in the sense that some subsystems may be in the
middle of state transitions while others are in welldefined states indeed depending on the
system architecture there may be no moments at which the entire machine is simultaneously in
a nominally welldefined digital state however we will postpone elaboration upon methods
to handle this more general case to a later time as it does not affect anything essential in the
present paper6
2122 computational states correspond to sets of orthogonal microstates
regardless of what precise physical encoding of digital computational states is used
we take it as fundamental to the concept of a classical digital computational state that at
any designated time t    r there exists some set c t   ci t  of abstract entities
comprising all of the possible alternative welldefined computational states ci t of the computer
system s that the machine could occupy at the time t and further that for any given
such state c  ci t there exists some corresponding set bc  hs of mutually orthogonal
normalized basis vectors b  bc  each of which represents a pure quantum state of s that
is unambiguously interpretable as representing the state c in other words there is some
orthonormal basis b  bc for hs such that if one were to hypothetically perform a complete
however to just briefly preview one way in which a resolution of this problem can work we can augment the concept of a welldefined state of a classical
computation with that of a welldefined state transition as we do in 214 this can be meaningful even for nonreversible andor stochastic operations
then at any moment across an extended asynchronous machine we can say that each local subsystem is either in a welldefined computational state or
is partway through a welldefined state transition

projective measurement7 of the state of the entire computer system s down onto the basis
b at time t and the measured state i in that basis were found to be one of the basis states
b  bc  then the computational state is unambiguously interpreted to be c it follows from this
that any superposition of the b  bc must also be unambiguously interpreted as c since such
a superposition is not distinguishable from the members of bc  if any such superposition state
were measured in the basis b  the projected state would necessarily be contained in the set bc 
we note that when the physical state of a machine is dynamically evolving over continuous time the basis states making up the set bc could also generally be evolving for example
consider an informationbearing signal pulse propagating down a transmission line which
may be convenient to represent in terms of a basis that propagates down the line along with
the pulse when discussing such cases we can write bc t to explicitly denote the possible
timedependence of the physical basisset representation of a given computational state
however as mentioned above we will often assume for simplicity that there exists
some discrete set of designated time points   r where   z at which the computational
states are welldefined and focus our attention on those this will then allow us to characterize
nonreversible and stochastic computational evolutions in between those designated time
points in which there are merging or splitting of computational states at a more abstract level
in our model without having to specify all details of the transition process such as when
exactly the computational states split or merge and indeed physically these transitions will
in general not be sharp
however it follows from the assumption that at designated time points t    each
bc   identifies ct unambiguously that at least at these times all of the bc are mutually
orthogonal to each other and thus can be taken to be disjoint subsets of a single master
orthonormal basis bt ie c  c t  bc t  bt we call such a master basis a protocomputational basis for the system s proto because the basis states unambiguously determine
the computational state but are not in general uniquely determined by the computational
state they are lowerlevel physical entities defined prior to the computational state itself
note that any particular protocomputational basis bt at a designated time point
t    since it is defined to be a complete basis for the hilbert space hs of the physical system
comprising our computer may in general include some basis states b that do not fall into any
of the sets bc t these are microstates of the system that do not correspond to welldefined
computational states such microstates could arise in practice for any number of reasons
eg such as if the machine has not yet been initialized or it has broken down or simply
gone out of spec regardless of the cause we will group these invalid basis states together
into a special set b  b  cc bc meaning that the computational state is undefined for
convenience we can also define an extra dummy computational state c representing this
undefined condition and an augmented computational state set c   c   c  so that then
we can say that the system s always has some computational state c  c   although it may be
the undefined state c  with this change note that the set  bc  of basis sets corresponding to
all of the computational states c  c  in the augmented set now corresponds to a proper
settheoretic partition of the full protocomputational basis b  see figure 2
note that the foregoing treatment of computational states is really no different fundamentally from the case of identifying any other potentially macroscale classical discrete state
variable in other words a classical computational state in our formulation can be viewed as
simply being a discrete macrostate that we happen to consider as carrying some informational
significance within a computational system
please note that this definition of computational states does not require us to actually be able to do these complete projective measurements in practice it
is sufficient for purposes of the definition that they could be done in principle by we can imagine applying a suitable abstract operator that measures
some complete set of commuting observables of the system

here n  2 these basis sets form a partition of the complete protocomputational basis b 
2123 computational and noncomputational subsystems
as an additional but inessential assumption that will be useful in some derivations
we can suppose that the hilbert space hs of the system can be factored as a product of
subspaces corresponding to what we call computational and noncomputational subsystems c n
of the computer system s that is we write hs  hc  hn  with the idea being that the
computational states c correspond to basis vectors of hc  which are tensored with the basis
vectors of hn to obtain the protocomputational basis b for the entire system s
however this factorizability assumption is really a special case which only holds when
the basis sets bc of the whole system are identically sized more generally we can express hs
as a subspace sum
hs 
cc 
where
denotes the hilbert space of the noncomputational subsystem n when restricted
to the case that the computational state is c that is it is the subspace spanned by the basis
vectors in bc  see figure 3
2124 rapid collapse of superpositions
in the course of the real physical evolution of the system s it is of course possible in
general that quantum states could arise that are superpositions of basis states b from different
basis sets bc and exist in the system briefly yielding an indeterminate computational state
at such moments however since our primary focus in the present paper is on the analysis
of machines that are not even designed to carry out quantum computing it is reasonable to
suppose that such superposition states will spontaneously decohere on very short timescales
as they would naturally tend to do anyway in most largescale systems in other words we
expect that most of the time our computational subsystem c will be living in a decoherencefree subspace dfs such that the computational states are naturally stable as part of the
systems pointer states 21 towards which the system is continually being decohered by
its interactions with its environment in this context the environment of the computational
subsystem c can include portions of the noncomputational subsystem n of the computer
system as well as the machines external environment e

figure 3 breakdown of the computating system s into computational c and noncomputational n
subsystems the hilbert space of s can be expressed as either a product hs  hc  hn of subsystem
subspaces or more generally as a subspace sum hs  cc  hn
thus at least in the case of a logically deterministic nonstochastic computational
process starting from a welldefined initial computational state c0  we assume that each of
the systems pointer states will at any designated time  for   0 have all or nearly all of
its probability mass concentrated within a single welldefined computational state c  and
even in a stochastic computation we will obtain a classical statistical mixture of computational
states not a quantum superposition over them
the challenge in reversible computing is then to arrange for the systems already naturally stable pointer states to notwithstanding their stability still remain subject to undergoing
a physically natural if engineered dynamics in which they will evolve relatively quickly over
time translating themselves eventually onetoone into new computational states c1 
which may bear new semantic interpretations such a system could thereby carry out useful
computations at useful speeds
we will discuss computational operations and their physical correlates in more detail
in 213215 these can be very directly embedded in open quantum systems exhibiting
gksl dynamics which we discuss in detail in 35
but even just the above definitions already suffice to prove what we call the fundamental
theorem of the thermodynamics of computing this is discussed in 31
2125 timing variables
one nearly ubiquitous feature of engineered physical computing systems is the concept
of a timing variable that is some noncomputational nonequilibrium degree of freedom
that influences when transitions between computational states will occur and possibly how
long they will take as an example an ordinary synchronous digital computer normally
includes at least one clock oscillator which outputs a periodic clock waveform at a prespecified
or controllable frequency which is used to control the timing of digital operations in such a
situation we can take the phase  of the oscillator as a timing variable in adiabatic circuits
see 231 not only the frequency but also the speed quickness of digital state transitions is
controlled by the clock speed   ddt
furthermore even nonsynchronous computing systems typically still have physical
degrees of freedom that influence the timing of transitions for example in the novel barc
ballistic asynchronous rc computing paradigm being developed at sandia discussed
further in 235 below individual bits propagate ballistically as flux solitons fluxons traveling
10 of 68
along interconnect lines between devices the position x of a given fluxon of a given velocity
along the length of its interconnect can be considered a timing variable
it is important to note that while the values of timing variables are not digitally discretized they are also generally not entirely random or uncorrelated to other parts of the
machine unlike thermal state variables thus timing variables will be the one common
exception in digital computating systems to our general rule that noncomputational degrees
of freedom will be assumed to rapidly thermalize
next we define some key concepts of classical computational operations
213 computational operations
in order to discuss in detail the thermodynamic implications and limits of performing
classical digital computational operations including reversible operations we first present
some basic terminology and definitions relating to such operations in this subsection
as mentioned in general the set c   of welldefined computational states could be
different at different designated time points   but to simplify our presentation we will
temporarily focus on the case where it is unchanging ie   z  c    c
to permit treatment of stochastic randomizing computational operations we define
some related notation let p c denote the set of all normalized probability distributions
over c for simplicity to avoid having to deal with normalizability issues we can assume
that c is finite8
then a possibly stochastic computational operation o on c simply refers to some arbitrary
function o  c  p c mapping each initial state ci  c to a probability distribution over
the possible final states cf  c for a given initial computational state ci  we can write
oci   pi  p c where pi  c  0 1 denotes the resulting probability distribution over
final states we can also allow o to be a partial function eg when discussing operations that
are not defined over all states c  c which can be useful if the operation will only ever be
applied to states c  domo  c
note that it is sufficient for our present purposes to use probabilities in this definition
instead of complex amplitudes since for classical reversible computing systems we are going
to assume that the system is highly decoherent in any case any superposition over different
computational states would soon decohere to a classical statistical mixture9
2131 deterministic operations
a particular computational operation o is called fully deterministic meaning nonstochastic if and only if all of its finalstate distributions pi have zero entropy that is c  c 
h oc  0 adopting here the standard entropy functional h  if an operation is not fully
deterministic we say it is stochastic we could also have that o is deterministic over a subset
a  c of initial states whilst not being deterministic over the entire set c such an o can also
be called conditionally deterministic under the precondition that the initial state c  a
2132 reversible operations
we say that an operation o is unconditionally logically fully reversible if and only if there
is no state ck  c such that for two different i j i 6 j both pi ck   0 and pj ck   0
otherwise we say that o is logically irreversible we say that o is conditionally logically
reversible under the precondition that c  a for some a  c if and only if there is no state
indeed due to the holographic bound 22 if the minimal bounding surface of s has finite area then the hilbert space hs  and therefore also hc  must
be finitedimensional in any event
however in the future we anticipate that the present line of work may usefully be extended to explore dissipation limits for quantum computation as
well at that point it would be appropriate to replace the probability distribution pi c with a more general density operator i 
11 of 68
ck  c such that for two different i j i 6 j with ci  c j  a it is the case that pi ck   0 and
pj ck   0 in such a case we could also say that o is reversible over a
2133 timedependent case
note that it is easy to generalize the above definitions to situations in which the set c
of computational states may be different at different designated times let s    t  m be
two different designated times with s  t then we can write ost to denote a computational
operation being performed over the time interval from start time s to end time t then we
have that ost  c s  p c t and the remaining definitions for determinism reversibility
etc also change accordingly in the natural way for an operation taking place between times
s and t s  t we can define d  t  s as the delay or latency of the operation and q  d1 as
its quickness or speed
the above definitions are illustrated in figure 4 below
214 computational state transitions
we can describe the computational operations from the previous subsection as a combination of various primitive computational state transitions such as those illustrated in figure 5
below other types of transitions may be described as combinations of these for example
the lowerleft operation in figure 4 includes a transition of  c1  c2  from time s to t that
exhibits both splits and merges but as suggested by the arrows in the diagram it could be
decomposed into a sequence of a split of c2 into two unlabeled states followed by a merge
of c1 into one of those states
215 correspondence between classical operations and quantum evolution
in this subsection we give a general theoretical picture regarding how a real ergo
quantummechanical physical process may effectively implement classical computational
state transitions and computational operations such as described above
2151 unitary dynamics
as before we focus our attention on a computational process taking place between two
designated time points s   and t  1 where t  s consider now the joint hilbert
space hu of the model universe the environment together with the computer whatever is
happening physically in the universe over the time interval s t including the performance
of the computational operation will be encompassed in a theoretical perspective assuming
perfect knowledge of the universes dynamics by the overall time evolution operator which
b u
b st u that applies between those times in hu  formally if we describe
we will denote u
the initial quantum state of the model universe as a mixed state using an initial density matrix
s  then the final density matrix t is given by
b su
t  u
this overall time evolution process includes activities such as the dynamical details of the
computation process itself together with the incremental delivery of some needed free energy
from the power supply eg battery into that process and the transport of some incremental
amount of dissipated energy waste heat away from that process or more precisely the
incremental progression of a continuous flow of waste heat that is propagating away from the
computational mechanism and out towards the environment esince in general the waste
heat that resulted from prior operations will still be traveling outwards when subsequent
operations occur we call this picture the open system case

now let us restrict attention temporarily to the subspace of hu that is the hilbert space
hs of the closed spacelike hypersurface slice of spacetime volume enclosing the computer
system ignoring for the moment the flow of waste heat through the systems bounding
surface let us pretend for a moment that the dynamics within the surface itself can also be
b st s over hs  the quantum subsystem
described by a unitary timeevolution operator u
contained within the boundary we call this the closed system case
of course the closedsystem picture is a simplification since in reality no thermal
isolation is perfect and so there will also be interactions across the surface to transport
heat out however we expect that theoretical developments for the closedsystem case can
generally be preserved when reexpanding the model to include the outward thermal flow
since the net effect of that flow will just be to maintain a reasonable temperature inside the
boundary by exporting excess thermal entropy to the environment
an easy way to see that this translation from the closedsystem to the opensystem case
ought to work in general is simply to note that if the bounding surface of s is taken to be
extremely distant to begin with then there will be negligible practical difference between the
opensystem and closedsystem cases ie a real computer with an internal power supply
would operate just fine at least for a while even if enclosed in a very large but finite perfectly
thermally insulated box

figure 5 illustration of different types of computational state transitions between two designated time points s and t showing
the protocomputational basis state sets bc corresponding to computational states c all of the individual basis states b  b 
are also implicitly timedependent in general reversible computational operations include only onetoone transitions such
as a in such transitions the initial and final basis state sets may be the same size n even in a closed system irreversible
computational operations include at least some examples of manytoone transitions merges such as b in a closed system
the basis state set resulting from a merge must be at least as large as the sum of the merged sets due to unitarity stochastic
operations include onetomany transitions splits such as c each of the basis state sets resulting from a split may be smaller
than the original set even in a closed system although their aggregate size must be at least as large

thus henceforth in this subsection we will take the timeevolution u
the computer system s in the closedsystem picture while remembering that we can revert
to the opensystem view when necessary
earlier we noted that the protocomputational basis b may in general be timedependent
so that the two bases bs and bt may not correspond to exactly the same set of physical
quantum states however the effect of any change in the protocomputational basis b between
b bt  then
times s and t can also just be represented as a unitary operator which we denote u

2152 quantum statistical operating contexts
next we need to define a computational process in a statisticallycontexualized form earlier we abstractly defined computational state transitions and computational operations but
this definition said nothing whatsoever about the statistics of the initial state either computational or physical before the operation was performed we require a formalism for describing
such information in order to speak meaningfully about the informational or thermodynamic
effect of performing a computational operation within a particular statisticallydefined scenario
the following presentation generalizes the discussion of classical statistical operating
contexts that can be found in eg 9 to a quantum context
since we want to produce a quantummechanical model of classical computation including reversible computation we require a quantum statistical picture thus let us define s
to be a mixed quantum state ie a statistical mixture of pure states in some diagonal basis
that encompasses all of our uncertainty as modelers regarding what the initial quantum

figure 6 blockdiagonal density matrix for an initial quantum statistical operating context s  in this example we imagine
there are 3 computational states c1  c2  c3 and let c  c3  say with corresponding basis state sets b1  b2  b3 left at the center
we illustrate a corresponding blockdiagonal quantum statistical operating
d contexte or initial density matrix s  rows and columns
are labeled in gray with the corresponding basis vectors note that bi s b j  rij  this is an hermitian matrix so rij  r ji 
also trs   1 matrix entries left blank are 0 at right is a simplified depiction of s 
state of the physical computational system s is at time s prior to performing the desired
computational operation ost 
we further require that s must have a blockdiagonal structure in the initial protocomputational basis bs such that the blocks correspond to the partition  bc  of basis vectors
corresponding to the augmented initial computational state set c  s stated more formally
the density matrix representation of s in the bs basis must not include any nonzero offdiagonal terms between basis states b p bq  bs such that b p  bi and bq  b j where bi  b j
are the subsets of bs corresponding to two distinct computational states ci  c j  c  s ie
with i 6 j see figure 6
this blockdiagonal structure models our assumption mentioned earlier that a classical
computer is highly decoherent thus there are no quantum coherences between the blocks
corresponding to different computational states however it is permissible for coherences to
exist within blocks this is just another way of saying that the choice of protocomputational
basis vectors is completely arbitrary within the subspace corresponding to each block the
subbasis for any block can be freely rotated within its subspace and we still will have a valid
protocomputational basis for time s
2153 quantum contextualized computations
now that we have defined the quantum version of a statistical operating context we can
define what a quantumcontextualized computation means this generalizes the discussion
of statistically contextualized computations that can be found in 9
a quantumcontextualized computational process or just quantumcontextualized computation
denoted cst ost  s  refers to the act of carrying out a specified computational operation ost
from time s to t  s within the computer system s in a quantum statistical operating context
wherein the initial mixed state of s at time s is given by s  where s meets the conditions
ie blockdiagonal structure described above given the protocomputational basis bs and
computational state set c s note that bs and c s are left implicit in the cst  notation
for brevity
2154 implementation of classical computation by unitary dynamics
given the above definitions we can now formally define what it means for a systems
unitary dynamics to implement a given classical computation
15 of 68
b st s b implements the quantum
we say that the basisadjusted timeevolution operator u
contextualized computational process cs os  s  written
b st s b
cst ost  s 
if and only if the final density matrix
b st s bs u
b st s b
t  u
b st s b to s has the property that for any initial computational state
generated by applying u
ci s  c s that has nonzero probability under s  if we were to zero out all elements of s
outside of the rowscolumns corresponding to ci ss basis set bi s and renormalize and
b st s b to this restricted 0s  the resulting final mixed state 0 would imply the
then apply u
same probability distribution pi t over final computational states in c t as is specified by
applying the stochastic map ost to the initial computational state that is pi  ost ci s
one can see by inspection that this is a very straightforward and natural definition
since by assumption the initial quantum statistical operating context s has no coherences
between different initial computational states it is impossible for the transition amplitudes
from initial to final basis states to interfere with each other in ways that would disrupt the
overall probability distribution over final computational states from what one would obtain
by simply combining the results from treating the initial computational states separately10
note that the above definition doesnt by itself immediately require that the unitary evolub st s b cant introduce any immediate coherences between different computational states
tion u
ci t c j t where i 6 j but this is unproblematic since one of our background assumptions
throughout this treatment is that the system will naturally decohere very quickly to a definite
computational state so any offdiagonal matrix elements between different computational
states that may arise will naturally decay by themselves very quickly this can happen via
the usual zurek process 21 wherein the decoherent state variables entangle with nearby
noncomputational degrees of freedom which thenat least in the opensystem version
of this treatmentcarry the associated quantum information out to the external thermal
environment e once its in that environment taking the trace over the environment state
to reflect our ignorance about the environments detailed evolution then effectively erases
the entanglement between the system s and the environment and decays the coherences
between the different naturallystable pointer states of the computer in zureks terms the
natural interaction between the computer system and its environment effectively observes
the state of the system and this effective measurement of the system by the environment
collapses the system down to what is then effectively just a classical statistical mixture of the
observably distinct classical computational states
at this point having described what it means in quantum physical terms to perform
classical digital computational operations our problem in building quantum physical models
of reversible computing has now been reduced to
b st s b that meet the above
finding specific closedsystem timeevolution unitaries u
definition of the implements operator for the case of desired reversible andor
conditionally reversible operations ost in specific physical setupsand its easy to see
that theres no essential loss of generality in starting with the closedsystem case since
for large enough systems closedsystem evolution should work just fine for a while
until the system runs out of free energy or overheats
as discussed in 2152 each computational state corresponds to an orthogonal subspace indeed for classical computing each computational state must
be an orthogonal subspace to prevent quantum coherences between computational degrees of freedom in different computational states then this
statement is a direct consequence of the fact that the full space can be decomposed into the sum of projectors over all of its orthogonal subspaces
16 of 68
b st s can then be extended appropriately
showing that the closedsystem definition of u
to the opensystem case where there may be a heat flow out from the systems bounding
b st u for the
surface for consistency with the existence of a global unitary evolution u
model universe that includes the process of heat outflow to the environmentbut this
part is expected to be a relatively easy formal technicality and finally
showing that some such unitaries can indeed be implemented via realistic buildable
physical computing mechanisms of these three steps this one is expected to be the most
difficult one to accomplish in practice
however the supposition that the above physical picture of classical reversible computing can in fact be realistically implemented is supported by the illustration of a number of
existing and proposed examples of concrete physical implementation technologies which
appear to accomplish this which are briefly reviewed in 23 below
but first we now review some relevant tools and methods from neqt which can be
used to flesh out the general theoretical framework presented above in more detail
22 tools and methods from nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics
in this section we review some key theoretical tools and methods from nonequilibrium
quantum thermodynamics neqt that we believe will prove to be invaluable in the effort to
arrive at a more complete understanding of the physics of reversible computing and relate
them to the more general picture presented above in 21
221 resource theory of quantum thermodynamics
first we review several theoretical tools relating to what is known as the resource theory of
quantum thermodynamics rtqt in order to relate them to the broad framework presented
above
2211 stinespring dilation theorem and thermomajorization
we briefly summarized the overall open quantum systems perspective in 211 earlier
the rules of quantum thermodynamics let us turn the broad intuitions summarized there
into specific statements about the types of transformations allowable on the system s the
evolution of a general density matrix  is given by a completely positive tracepreserving cptp
map  7 t  also known as a quantum channel or quantum dynamical map the map t
maps the initial density matrix to a final density matrix here t represents the time interval
from the initial time t0 to the final time tf 11 
t  represents the most generic type of transformation that we can apply to  in
general the density matrices  and t  arent required to be taken over the same hilbert
space in our setup however we stipulate that the initial and final hilbert spaces are the
same namely hs  as the name cptp map suggests in order for the map  7 t  to
satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics we need t to preserve the trace of  to preserve
the positivity of  and to preserve the positivity of  even when  is part of a larger system
which t acts on as a whole furthermore we need t to be hermitian to be linear and
finite under the trace norm
the stinespring dilation theorem 23 provides a very natural representation of this channel
this theorem gives the evolution of an open quantum system s in terms of the unitary joint
evolution of the system and the environment together which together comprise the entire
most generally a t subscript for a time interval can be taken to specify an ordered pair t0  tf  of start and end times ie the notation doesnt need to
assume time translation invariance per se but in the usual case when it is present for t to specify just the time difference d  tf  t0 is sufficient
17 of 68
universe ie u  se if s starts in the state ins and e starts in the state e  the evolution
appears as
b tse ins  e u
b tse
ins 7 t ins   trf u
 trf ei h tf  t0  ins  e  ei h tf  t0  
as we noted earlier the final state may not be in the same hilbert space as the initial state ie
t may not necessarily map s to itself this is reflected in the fact that we take the final trace
over f  u where f may not necessarily be the same space as e however for our purposes
we will always have f  e
b ts0 e  ei hb tf  t0  as the global unitary evolution operator over all
in 7 we defined u
bs  h
be  h
bise is the global hamiltonian over all of se divided
of u  se here h
bs over s alone the hamiltonian h
be over e alone and the interaction
into the hamiltonian h
hamiltonian hise between s and e this representation forms the basis for both the existing
neqt results on landauers principle as well as the gksl framework for examining open
quantum systems beyond the rules of quantum mechanics the only additional assumptions
here are that s is coupled to some environment e which it jointly evolves with unitarily and
that the initial state of se can be factorized 24
in terms of the dilation theorem the set of transformations on ins allowed by thermob tse that preserves the total energy
dynamics is simply the set of unitary transformations u
over all of se these transformations are explicitly described by the resource theory of quantum thermodynamics rtqt 2526 in general quantum resource theories qrt provide
a informationtheoretic framework for describing all possible operations on a given state 
by describing the information cost of operations and states in terms of new information we
require about the system 27 in particular qrts describe the conditions on operations to
act at no additional information cost and provide the conditions on the types of states of new
systems that can be prepared at no additional information cost and appended to the overall
system these are respectively known as the free operations and free states in addition to these
the quantum resource theory provides the conditions on transformations on  known as
the state conversion conditions the nature of free operations free states and the conversion
conditions depends on the specific resource theory12
bs and the inverse environment temin rtqt we start with the system hamiltonian h
perature   1t the thermal gibbs states   e  h tr e  h are the maximumentropy
states which must necessarily be preserved by energypreserving unitary operations 28
thus these are the free states of the environment as such if we examine a system using the
dilation theorem it takes no additional information to set the initial state of the environment e
to be the thermal state e  conversely selecting any other state does involve extra information
not specified in the resource theory namely information about the distribution of states over
e setting f  e this gives us a direct expression for the free operations which are known as
the thermal operations
b tse ins  e u
b tse
ins 7 t ins   tre u
as an example the resource theory of asymmetry tells us the free operations and states of a system with an overall symmetry described by a compact lie
group g with the free operations and conversion conditions given in terms of the unitary representations of g operations that are covariant with g and
states that are invariant under g require no additional information beyond the group already specified thus these are respectively the free operations
and free states of this resource theory this example is expanded upon in 27 which also provides the illustrative example of the resource theory of
bipartite entanglement
18 of 68
the necessary conditions for these transformations
i to occur are called the thermomajorization
bs  0 ie when the final state of s has
conditions when the commutator t ins  h
a definite energy value as is the case for all of the systems we will be considering these
conditions are both necessary and sufficient13
these conditions are defined in terms of the ordering hof a statei s  which has eigenbs with s  h
bs  0 the ordering
values  pi in1 and corresponds to a hamiltonian h
p  p1      pn is defined 29 as an ordering of the pi that satisfies pi e ei  pj e ej
for all i  j where ei is the energy corresponding to pi  thus the ordering of the  pi s
is defined by decreasing values of pi e ei  from this ordering we can define the thermomajorization curve as the curve defined by the points14
 e1 
 e1
 e2 
 ei
 p1  e
 p1  p2       e
  pi
0 0 e
i 1
i 1
then finally the thermal operation ins 7 t ins  can occur if the thermomajorization
curve of t ins  is below or equal to the thermomajorization curve of ins everywhere
collectively the thermal states thermal operations and thermomajorization conditions give
us the complete set of states we can generate and transformations we can perform in quantum
thermodynamics
2212 catalytic thermal operations and correlated systems
the concept of a thermal operation can be extended to the case of a catalytic thermal
operation cto in which a component of the system is a socalled catalyst subsystem which
cycles back to the initial state this can be an appropriate model for certain types of subsystems
in a computerfor example a periodic clock signal such as a resonant clockpower oscillator
for an adiabatic circuit see 23 further every digital data signal in a typical reversible
logic technology eg 30 cycles from a standard neutral or noinformation state to an
informationbearing state and then back to neutral thus every node in a typical reversible
circuit effectively acts like a catalyst this will be discussed in more detail in 34 and 42
we now present the most general type of ctos explicitly following the presentation in
12 note that this examines a more general class of transformations than the ones traditionally
examined in the second laws of thermodynamics framework the relationship between this
presentation and the second laws is discussed in 2213 if we divide the overall system s
into the subsystems t and k the catalyst k is defined as a subsystem which is required within
the overall dynamics of the system for the state transition int 7 t int 15 if the state of
the catalyst is given as k  then the transition of the state int  k  is given 12 by
b ttke int  k  e u
b ttke
int  k  7  tk  tre u
b ttke  h
btke  0 and trke  tk  is arbitrarily close to t int  under the
here we have u
trace norm for all e  r  there are allowed transformations with
ktrke  tk   t int k1  e
bs 6 0 remains an open question 27 fortunately that is also beyond the scope of our model
the case of t ins  h
its worth noting that the ordering of the  pi s may not be unique when some of the pi e ei values are equal to each other but even in this case the
thermomajorization curve is always unique
the reasons the catalyst is required are not explored in the cto framework rather the cto framework merely assumes that a catalyst is required
19 of 68
meanwhile the catalytic condition requires trte  tk   k  this is the most general type
of cto which can be realized if and only if the final helmholtz free energy f is less than or
equal to the initial helmholtz free energy out of equilibrium the helmholtz free energy of a
b is given by
state  in a system governed by a hamiltonian h
h i
b  kt s
f   tr h
here s is the rnyi1 entropy ie the von neumann entropy of  in terms of f  the
condition we require for the cto in 10 to be realizable is16
f trke  tk   f int 
notably these ctos do not impose any additional major constraints on the shape of the
bk  0
correlations between t and k for any   r  there exists some k and  tk such that h
and the quantum mutual information i t  k between t and k is bounded by 
i t  k  s tk k trte  tk   trke  tk   
in practical terms this means that we can achieve state transitions from int to trk  tk 
by engineering the catalyst and the cptp map t to minimize the correlation i t  k this
process of correlation engineering 912 lies at the heart of reversible computing by engineering
interacting subsystems bearing computational degrees of freedom and the transformations
t applied on them we can achieve the ctos given in 10 with the net energy dissipation
given by the free energy difference in 13
2213 uncorrelated catalytic thermal operations
the expressions in 2212 may come as a surprise to those familiar with thermal operations and catalytic thermal operations conventionally ctos are defined 25 by the
transformation
b ttke int  k  e u
b ttke
 t int   k 
int  k  7 tre u
the data processing inequality dpi can give us necessary
conditions for these
ctos to be
btk  0 2531 for
realized which become necessary and sufficient when t int   k  h
any function f k of the density matrices  and  and for any cptp map t  the dpi gives
f k   f t kt 
in other words the dpi is a requirement that must be satisfied for all functions f for t to
be a valid cptp map one family of such functions are the relative rnyi entropies rre
which are defined 283233 as
sgn  tr  1
  1 0  0 1
tr 
 tr 12  12  
s k   sgn 
   1  1 
 1 
tr  ln   ln  
lim   1
in the case that f int   f trk  tk   e the condition 13 can be extended by including an uncorrelated source w of free energy in this case if w has
the states w and w with f w   f w   e then we can realize the cto int  k  w 7  tk  w when f int  k  w   f  tk  w 
here the condition 14 remains naturally if we generalize to the case where correlations between tk and w are permitted we return to the cto given
in 10
20 of 68
the   1 limit provides us with the familiar expression for the quantum relative divergence
qrd17  as such the dpi imposes the requirement that the cto 15 must satisfy
s int  k ktk   s t int   k ktk 
for all  as a necessary condition18 in the case that we have transition from the product state
int  k to the product state t int   k  these are in fact sufficient conditions beyond
being simply necessary ones 3638 thus 18 tells us the constraints we need to satisfy the
ctos 15 the s k  in turn define 28 the helmholtz free energies
f ins   kt ln z  s ins ks 
we can immediately recognize the   1 case as equivalent to the expression 12 the ctos
defined in 15 are realized when we have
f t int   f int 
for all  these conditions are known as the second laws of thermodynamics 28
2214 correlated vs uncorrelated ctos
the expressions for the rres in 2213 might initially be cause for some concern since
a cto must satisfy 20 for all alpha to be a viable transition this concern may escalate to
alarm when we consider that the rres and thus the free energies are monotone in  ie
f   f  for all    beyond the standard helmholtz free energy f1  two notable
cases are the extractable work f0 and the work of formation f  as their names imply these are
respectively the amount of work we can extract from a given state and the amount of work
it takes to form that same state since in most cases we have f0  f  it would appear that
the energy difference f  f0 is simply dissipated in the process of creating a state and then
extracting work from that state as a corollary this would imply that our only hope for a
viable reversible computing framework in this formulation is to find sets of states i  where
the equality between f i  is satisfied for all  which may be a highly restrictive condition
as discussed in 12 however the second laws of thermodynamics and these attendant
issues arise from an additional assumption about the shape of ctos specifically the ctos
15 that give rise to the second laws of thermodynamics assume that the final state of s
after the thermal operation is a product state of t and k ie that catalytic thermal operations
transform the state int  k to the state t int   k  however by definition of the catalytic
thermal operation we needed the presence of k to induce the transformation to begin
with thus the cto on int  k necessitates an increase in the qmi between t and k
specifically given by 14 indeed as proven in 12 this mutual information can be made
to be infinitesimally small but cannot be zero thus the cto in 15 in which we demand
that the final state of s be in the product state t int   k  is more precisely thought of as
performing the general cto 10 and then ejecting the qmi 14 a direct consequence of this
is that as proven in 12 in the general cto 10 where we permit correlations to develop
the   1 limit can be taken either with a monotonically increasing sequence from the   0 1 case or with a monotonically decreasing sequence from
the   1  case as with the qrds other familiar entropies are recovered as limiting cases of the rres the 0rre s0 k  ln trsupp   is given
by the   0 limit the maxrre s k  inf   r    e  is given by the    limit and the s1 k and s k cases are given by
interchanging  and  in the arguments its also worth noting that the expression for   1  in 17 is the conventional form for the rre at these
values of  this expression is called the sandwiched rre however because in general  and  do not commute with each other there are an infinite
number of ways to arrange powers of  and  that satisfy the rnyi entropy axioms 34 and retrieve the appropriate limiting cases these can all be
expressed as a single twoparameter family of entropies 35 known as the the zrres
indeed the dpi tells us that a necessary condition for the cto 15 to be valid is that f int  k ktk   f t int   k ktk  for all functions f of
int  k and tk

figure 7 breakdown of subsystems for purposes of 2221 etc a for our purposes in this section and in much of what
follows we focus our attention on a subsystem s0  m of the entire physical computer system a memory that exists for the
purpose of passively registering some computational data of interest but does not include any active mechanisms for controlling
the timing and performance of state transitions b an example of a density matrix representation of a computational state
of m in the blockdiagonal picture from fig 6 in this example the noncomputational subsystem of m is assumed to be in a
maximumentropy mixed state conditioned on the computational state being c  c2 
between the system and catalyst the   1 helmholtz free energy uniquely specifies the
condition required for the transition to take place19
consequently if we seek to develop a framework for computing which reduces energy
dissipation by avoiding the energy cost of expelling the built up qmi our computing operations must follow the cto expression given in 10 since reversible computing is precisely
this framework 10 provides an explicit expression for the shape of reversible computing
operations in terms of ctos as a tradeoff we achieve these operations via a buildup of qmi
14 which can be made arbitrarily small but cannot be precisely zero in the framework of
reversible computing this is an acceptable indeed preferred tradeoff to make20 
222 quantum mechanical models of the landauer bound
the general ctos given in 12 and discussed in 2212 further give us a conceptual
framework for understanding the nonequilibrium landauer bound 10 and the difference
between conditional and unconditional landauer state reset 40 first we briefly review
the landauer principle following the excellent presentation found in 40 before connecting
these to the nonequilibrium landauer bound and the general ctos found in their respective
former references
2221 conditional vs unconditional landauer erasure
here and in much of what follows we restrict our attention to a subsystem s0  m
of the entire computer system s that plays the role of passively registering data we can
generically call such a subsystem a memory without implying any particular architectural
structure ie it could be any informationbearing set of signals in the machine this is to
be distinguished from other components that actively manipulate the state of the machine
thus 12 verifies the conjecture first provided in 39 in the words of 39 directly the   1 helmholtz free energy is singled out as a measure of
athermality
as pointed out in 12 the more general ctos 10 arent necessarily an improved form of the ctos 15 but rather simply offer a different setup in lieu
of the unavoidable free energy differences f  f0  weve accepted the unavoidable buildup of qmi as a tradeoff for our purposes here building up
qmi and engineering the system and cto to minimize the qmi and the difference ktrk  tk   t int k is preferred but the optimal type of cto will
in general be a function of the type of process were interested in
22 of 68
and control the timing of operations which we will assume are separated into another
subsystem z which will usually be left implicit see figure 7a however note that even
m as a physical system can still be separated into computational and noncomputational
subsystems as in fig 3 and thus assuming as usual no coherences between digital states
still has states in blockdiagonal form as in fig 6 each computational state ci  c of m thus
has a unique corresponding representation im as a density matrix if we assume minimal
information about the noncomputational part of the state that is taking it to have maximum
entropy given the specifications as to what constitutes the set bi of microstates of m validly
representing the given computational state ci in a given technological scenario see fig 7b
note that the following discussion blurs the distinction between these density matrices and
the abstract states ci that they represent and calls them computational states even though
in the density matrix form they are also manifestly physical entities
now for a subsystem s0  m carrying some computational degrees of freedom the
landauer state reset process following 40 is the process by which the state s0 is set
to some standard reset state rs0  in a practical implementation of general computational
operations on the system s0 which bears computational degrees of freedom the reset state is
essential to what we consider the sensible functioning of the operations on the system the
reset state is a standard known reference state when we perform operations on the system
which correspond to operations we transform the system from rs0 in a known way such
that the operations we perform on rs0 correspond to sensible computational operations the
end result of this series of operations will be the final computational state which we then
need to reset to the standard state in order to perform a new set of operations
in general we expect the computer to have a possibly large but finite number n of total
possible computational states s0   1 that it
 can be in at any time then the reset process
were interested in is the set of the cptp maps s0 7 rs0 for all   1     n  we can
start by taking these operations to be thermal operations of the form 8

brs0 is individualized for
operators comes solely from the fact that the reset hamiltonian v
each s0  each of these operators gives us a distinct cptp map t s0  as a result the
expressions 21 and 23 correspond to conditional landauer reset ie the process of resetting
b ts0 e is
the computational state s0 to the standard state rs0 where the reset protocol u
conditioned on the specific state s0  in other words the process of conditional landauer
b ts0 e and even more specifically selecting v
brs0  for each s0
erasure involves selecting u
such that the final state fcu is the same for any initial state s0  e we choose
a central quantity of interest in the landauer reset process is the lower bound on the
amount of energy transfer aka the dissipation from the system to the environment this
can be calculated by examining the change in the environment energy  ee during the
evolution 21 in terms of this evolution the final state of the environment is given by
b ts0 e s0  e u
fce  trs0 fcu   trs0 u
ts e 
because fce is the same for all  we can directly examine the energy increase of the environment as a result of conditional landauer reset protocol applied to any of the initial
states

here the subscript c indicates that this is specifically for the conditional landauer reset
from the strong subadditivity of the von neumann entropy and from partovis inequality
 ee c has a lower bound given by 40
 ee c  kt ln 2 ss0  kt ln 2 s t s0  s s0 
here ss0 is the change in the von neumann entropy between the initial and final states
of s0  thus when the reset protocol is given as in 21 the sole contribution to the bound
on dissipation into the environment is given by the change in entropy in s0 induced by the
b ts0 e 21 notably when the initial states and final state have the
overall unitary evolution u
same von neumann entropies the expression ss0 is zero and thus the lower bound on
dissipation is zero in this case
by contrast to the conditional landauer reset we can also define
 the unconditional landauer reset protocol in which transitions from each of the states s0 to the reset state
brs0 to any of the states ins0 that
rs0 are achieved by applying a single standard potential v
as a reminder the unitary dynamics over s0 e by construction cannot increase the entropy over s0 e as a whole 2141 since we dont a priori assume
b ts0 e maps s0 e product states to s0 e product states however this can still increase the subsystem entropy of s0 
that u

the corresponding set of thermal operations in this case are given by

the set of evolutions given in 28 provide a sharp contrast with those given in 21 in
brs0 such that u
b ts0 e mapped every s0  e to the same final state fu 
21 we chose v
by contrast in 28 we have only a single unitary operator for every possible state under
b us0 e maps each s0  e to a different global final state

b us0 e is to produce a
in other words for each s0  the result of the evolution given by u
distinct final state over all of u the only constraints on the evolutions in 28 and thus on the
states  f u  beyond the laws of quantum mechanics and quantum thermodynamics is that
the final subsystem state of s0 must be the reset state we require tre  f u  rs0 for all 
because each of the final global states is different the energy increase of the environment
calculated as in 25 and 26 will be a distinct expression for each initial state however
we can collect these expressions together by examining the average energy increase of the
conditional and unconditional landauer resets over a collection of reset operations performed
over a set of individual states if the states s0 appear in our collection a fraction of p times
then the average energy increase of the environment will be given by22

we can compare these expressions to the average energy increase

of the unconditional landauer reset protocol across all of the s0 s since convex linear
combinations
 of density matrices form another density matrix we can express the weighted
sum of the s0 s as a new fiducial density matrix ins0

p s0 
we can alternately think 40 of this as a series of conditional or unconditional landauer resets respectively over a single joint system s0 e with the
population fractions representing the number of times s0 e is set to that state
25 of 68
then the average energy increase of the unconditional landauer reset protocol corresponds
40 to the average energy increase of ins0

here we recognize n 1 p log2 p   h  p   iers0 as the shannon entropy of the
distribution  p  which is equivalent to the information quantity transferred from s0 to e
as before when the initial states and final state have the same von neumann entropies the
expression ss0 is zero in this case the lower bound on the unconditional landauer reset
protocol is given entirely by the amount of correlated information transferred from s0 to e
in the last sentence it may seem like the word correlated was picked out of the aether
as presented thus far it may be unclear what correlations arise in the landauer protocol23  in
fact the correlated nature of ier plays a central role in understanding the conditional and
brs0 and
unconditional landauer bounds likewise the details of where the reset potentials v
brs0 come from will play a key role in understanding the distinction between these two we
discuss these issues in 34 as we tie in this model to the cto framework
2222 nonequilibrium landauer bound
we can understand the expressions in 2221 very straightforwardly from the neqt
point of view both from the point of view of quantum thermodynamic fluctuation relations
1011 and from the point of view of the general ctos discussed in the previous section we
start with a general cptp map given in terms of the dilation theorem 7 with f  e and a
general environment state e  ie a cptp map given by henceforth just writing s for s0 
b tse ins  e u
b tse
ins 7 t ins   tre u
if we label the eigenstates of e as ea i the eigenvalues of e as ea  and perform the partial
trace over the basis vb i of e then the expression of t ins  expands to give
b tse ins   ea ea ihea  u
b tse 1s  vb i 
t ins   1s  hvb  u
by process of elimination as of now we can guess that these correlations have something to do with the process of conditioning the potential vs0  since
thats the only thing thats different about these two protocols

the distributivity of the tensor product allows us to write this expression solely in terms of
operators on s this defines the system kraus operators usually simply the kraus operators 42

its worth noting that the kraus operators are dependent on the global operator u

outside of s neverthelessnwe have
o mab  autdhs  when considering it as an operator
also note that a given set mab of kraus operators is emphatically not unique any unitary

any given set of kraus operators satisfies the completeness relation

the kraus operators in turn give the operatorsum representation of the cptp map t ins

from the kraus operator completeness relation 38 the hlder dual of any cptp map is
always unital ie for any cptp map t  we always have t 1s   1s  the same may not
necessarily be true for t itself instead the unitality condition for t is given in terms of the
kraus operators by the condition
 mb ab mb ab  1
a b
unital channels are notable since they map the identity 1s to itself and thus the maximally
mixed state 1s tr1 to itself we have t 1s   1s only when t is unital by definition
its worth noting that even though the kraus operators themselves can be arbitrarily changed
by a unitary transform this sum is invariant under such a transform so the unitality condition
is independent of the specific basis we evaluate the kraus operators in
we can very straightforwardly understand the difference between the conditional and
unconditional landauer reset and in particular the terms in the unconditional landauer
bound 34 in terms of the kraus operators and the unitality condition in the same way
as we defined the system kraus operators we can define the environment kraus operators
b cd  autdhe  as kraus operators on e labelling the eigenstates of ins as sc i the
b cd as
eigenvalues of ins as sc  and the basis of s as wd i we can define n

as with 24 were interested in the final environment state of e which can tell us the bound
on the energy increase of e the final state of the environment as a result of the transformation

this gives the momentgenerating function of the dissipated heat given by

b cd n

then a direct consequence of jensens inequality is that the energy increase in this process is
given in terms of the kraus operators
b cd n
b  e 
h ee i  kt ln tr  n
c d
this expression immediately helps us understand the conditional landauer bound 26
and the unconditional landauer bound 34 the overall evolution 42 corresponds to a cptp
map aka quantum channel over e24  this channel may or may not be unital over e and
the degree to which this channel fails to be unital is exactly the degree to which the channel
increases the overall entropy of s and expels the information quantity iers to e the fact
that unital quantum channels map maximally mixed states to maximally mixed states is
essential the degree to which this channel fails to be unital tells us the extent to which the
channel perturbs the maximally mixed state e of the environment indeed we see that for a
perfectly unital channel the sum of the kraus operators retrives 1e  and the energy bound is
zero
the degree of unitality stands out as a key quantity of interest in examining the nonequilibrium landauer bound in a given system using the technique of full counting statistics
43 and the twotime measurement formalism 44 the expressions 4546 can be extended
11 to a oneparameter family of expressions replacing  with a more general parameter

its worth noting that although 46 is slightly unclear compared to 26 and 34 in the sense that kraus operator expression mixes both the entropy
increase contribution and the correlated information ejection contribution it serves as the most clear expression from a quantum information theory
point of view and is also the tightest bound available 10

energy dissipated into the environment given 10114345 by
h qit  ss  i s  e  se tke

we can immediately recognize this expression as simply the extension of the expressions 26
and 34 to include the possibility of initial correlations between s and e and the possibility
that the environment may not start out in the thermal state for our setup neither of these
conditions are applicable and thus the last two terms vanish
we would expect that the environment is not a special subsystem in terms of these
derivations and that an equivalent expression can be derived by considering the system from
each subsystems point of view the other serves as the ancillary system in the dilation theorem
sense indeed expanding the kraus operators in terms of sc i and wd i and rearranging terms
in the overall trace provides us with an equivalent expression to 45

b tse is an operator which
as with the kraus operators the expression tre u

depends on properties outside of s but as an operator lives in autdhs  ie it maps
density matrices in s to density matrices in s the connection between these expressions to
the conditional and unconditional landauer reset protocols is apparent but the connection
between both of these to the cto framework is slightly more subtle the connection between
all three is discussed in 34
223 gorinikossakowskisudarshanlindblad gksl dynamics
beyond providing neqt justifications for landauers principle and providing a new
explanation for the difference between the conditional and unconditional landauer recent
protocols another central aim of this work is to lay out the foundations for representing
classical rc operations explicitly in terms of open quantum systems here we discuss the
framework of gksl equations with multiple asymptotic states 1719 which we apply in 35 to
model reversible computing operations
2231 markov assumption

superoperator version of the lvn equation as

this is also known in the literature as the quantum master equation or the liouvillian as
with the unitary evolution of states the formal solution to this is given by a volterra integral
equation
t  t exp
dt0 l t0
  t 
in the specific case that l is independent of time this simplifies to t  etl t0  in general
this may not be guaranteed to converge let alone have a closedform solution 474925
nevertheless this is the formal solution to the lvn equation 51 using the dilation theorem
we expect the time evolution of s t to follow the same principle ie that we can determine
the dynamics of s t by examining the time evolution of the closed system u  se and
taking the partial trace over e thus we have the lvn equation for s t given by
ds t
bse  u
b tse s t0   e u
b tse
 tre  i hse  se t  i tre h
just to be clear about the notation in the last expression were taking the partial trace over e
bse with the state given by the unitary time evolution of s ti   e 
of the commutator of h
to find a solution to this equation for s  we would need to evaluate the volterra integral
equation 52 for the global evolution over se and then trace over e this has the exact
same problems of convergence and closed form as before since we havent changed the
problem itself instead as a first step to determining the dynamics of s  we can make the
simplifying assumption of markovian dynamics ie that over a differential time evolution
t 7 t  dt the properties of t  dt are determined entirely by the properties of t since
this assumption explicitly states that s t  dt depends only on s t we must make the
markov approximation in order to write down a differential evolution equation s thats
firstorder in time we might be concerned that this is an overly restrictive assumption for
a sensible model of reversible computing fortunately this assumption is in fact entirely in
line with some of the key assumptions we make in our generalized models of reversible
computing the relation between these assumptions and their suitability is discussed in 43
the map s t0  7 s t is a quantum channel ins 7 t ins  thus we can express t  dt in terms of the operatorsum representation 39 of the cptp map in this
representation the markov approximation appears as
s t  dt 
 nbcd dt s t nbcd dt
c d
we can retrieve a liouvilletype superoperator in the markov approximation by examining
the differential evolution of a quantum channel
dt s     dt lim dt
       dt l

by expanding the kraus operators and keeping the terms up to order odt we get the

this is of course true for the unitary evolution of states as well convergence is only guaranteed when the algebra of the argument of the integral has a

as always this simplifies to a
the expressions of l and l  defined in 56 and 58 are not unique we can have unitary transformations which redefine the jump operators or mix the jump operators and hamiltonian or
that do both while leaving the overall forms of l and l  invariant28
the gksl equation 56 also serves as the generator of the quantum dynamical semigroups
525556 starting with the dilation theorem 7 we as always select f  e as discussed
before seeking a firstorder differential equation of the form 56 automatically imposes the
markov property if we consider the set of all of the cptp maps which start at the same starting
environment state e and are evolved to various times t the markov property is equivalent to
the semigroup property t1 t2  t1  t2  thus we define the quantum dynamical semigroup
as the family t  t  0 that satisfies the markov property29

the notation bh represents the set of bounded operators on h with finite trace norm
this is unfortunate but not surprising we saw the same kind of ambiguity in the definition of the kraus operators indeed the first kind of unitary
transform is due to precisely that ambiguity from earlier
according to lindblads theorem 50 any quantum operation that satisfies the semigroup property will satisfy the gksl equation and vice versa
however note that not every cptph map satsifies
the gksl equation 5354 it just so happens that were only concerned with the ones that do
b is a continuous function of t for all tracenormbounded operators a
b  bhs  is also specified however
oftentimes the requirement that tr t  a
b  bhs  is a bounded function and that the semigroup property is specified where
because we already specified that t is a cptp map for all t that a
t  r is a continuous parameter this requirement is a direct consequence of what we already have finally we note that the notation oph is sometimes
used for bhs  eg as in 1719

semigroup we can recognize l as the generator 5657 of this semigroup as usual we can
then define etl in terms of its taylormadhava series expansion

2232 gksl dynamics with multiple asymptotic states
central quantities of interest in gksl evolution are the asymptotic states which are the
set of states that s t evolves into in the infinite time limit under the etl evolution
 ii  lim etl ins ii
here weve employed the doubleket notation that appears in the vectorization of bhs 
this is discussed in more detail in appendix b this notation will be used for the remainder of
the text
before continuing its worth noting an important subtlety in the time limit t   the
gksl equation examines the process by which a system initially in a state in ii relaxes to
one or more of the asymptotic states  ii this assumes that the relaxation occurs on a
timescale much faster than the timescale involved in the dynamics of the asymptotic states30
thus implicit in this expression is the notion that t is a parameter that only sees timescales on
the order of the relaxation timescale in other words the gksl dynamics is entirely before the
dynamics of the asymptotic states and the limit as t   is then still before the asymptotic
state dynamics for reference for later discussions we label the relaxation timescale tre and
the asymptotic dynamics timescale sas  with tre fi sas  intuitively the gksl dynamics is
interested in the limit as t  tre  but due to the parametrization of the dynamics we take the
limit as t   in order to describe the asymptotic dynamics we use a separate parameter s
we can determine the asymptotic states by examining the spectral decomposition of l 
here we follow the excellent presentation in 19 which is the thesis corresponding to the
original papers 1718 which develop this framework this is simply an abbreviated version
the reader interested in more details of the framework is highly encouraged to read these
references in general l is not necessarily hermitian if its still unitarily diagonalizable we
denote the eigenvalues by  a  the right eigenvectors by pa ii and the left eigenvectors by
hhqa   denoting d  diag a  p as the matrix formed by setting pa ii as rows and p 1
as the matrix formed by setting hhqa  as columns we have s tii in terms of the spectral
decomposition of l given by
s tii  etl ins ii  p etd p 1 ins ii
  pa ii eta hhqa ins ii   c a eta pa ii
in fact the gksl equation involves three timescales not just these two the markov assumption also involves an assumption about fluctuations between
s and e corresponding to a statement about the timescale of these fluctuations this is discussed in more detail in 43
32 of 68
here c a  hhqa ins
  ii are simply the coefficients of the hilbertschmidt inner product
hhqa ins ii  trs qa ins  since t  r the eigenvalues can only satisfy re a   0 or
re a   0 to have finite  ii the eigenstates for re a   0 are the damped or decaying
states while the eigenstates for re a   0 are the asymptotic states31
in the case that l isnt diagonalizable it still has a decomposition in jordan normal form
each jordan block has a specific eigenvalue but eigenvalues could be spread over multiple
jordan blocks if we remove the assumption of unitary diagonalizability the decomposition
given by 62 still holds for diagonal jordan blocks where  a is now specifically the eigenvalue
of pa ii since the left eigenvectors are the same as the right eigenvectors of the adjoint
operator the eigenvalue of hhqa  is just a  the overall spectral decomposition of the operators
now use the right eigenvalue specifically for nondiagonal jordan blocks the expression etl
pulls down a factor of tn n for each instance of a nonzero superdiagonal entry thus for a
given nondiagonal jordan block with right eigenvalue  a and n generalized eigenvectors if
we index the generalized eigenvectors by    n
n  we have the decomposition of e  ins ii
for that specific block given by 1719
s tii  etl ins ii 
t  
pa ii eta hhqa ins ii
c a eta t  
pa ii
a direct consequence is that the jordan normal form of the asymptotic state eigenvalue blocks
ie the eigenvalue blocks with pure imaginary eigenvalues are all diagonal since the factor
of t   would blow up otherwise
as mentioned earlier the factor of eta in the spectral decompositions 62 or 63 of pa ii
tells us that the set of pure imaginary eigenvalues correspond to the asymptotic states we
can denote these as  a  im a  the corresponding right eigenvectors form a subspace
of bhs  called the asymptotic subspace and denoted ashs  the asymptotic left and
right eigenvectors are respectively the asymptotic states and the asymptotic conserved
quantities of the gksl system were examining32 indexing these by their value of  and
their corresponding degeneracy  well denote the right and left eigenvectors as s and
respectively for clarity this means that we have l s
 i s
and l  j
i j 
under the action of etl  all initial states in ii converge to ashs  in the t   limit
naturally the gksl dynamics maps states outside of ashs the states that dont survive
in the infinite time limitto some linear combination of states in ashs  however at a finite
time t theres no requirement that if s tii  etl is in ashs  then it must stay in that
state for all future times indeed the gksl dynamics permits the time evolution of a state in
ashs  to leave that subspace altogether at some other time as long as the state returns to
ashs  at t   two examples of gksl state evolution are provided in figure 8
most examinations of gksl dynamics examine the case of a single asymptotic state given by the right eigenvector corresponding to   0 the
corresponding left eigenvector is 1 gksl systems with multiple asymptotic states form a set of measure zero 19 over the set of all possible gksl
systems however were representing an actual engineered system were not interested in the set of all possible gksl systems were interested in the
one that actually represents our system so this isnt a problem
these conserved quantities are slightly different from some of the more familiar conserved currents in classical and quantum mechanics for instance the
conserved quantity given by the hh1 eigenvector is the trace of  
33 of 68
figure 8 two examples of evolution of states under gksl dynamics to ashs  in the t   limit
here the gray blocks denote further subspaces of ashs  in2 ii starts outside of ashs  and settles
into one such subspace of ashs  as t   whereas in3 ii starts inside one subspace of ashs 
leaves it but stays within ashs  and then returns to the same subspace as as t   many further
dynamics are possible for instance a state in one of these subspaces could leave ashs  altogether
and then settle into the same or even a different subspace of ashs  as t   meanwhile a state
could start in a subspace of ashs  leave it but stay within ashs  overall and settle into a different
subspace as t   there are indeed no restrictions on where the initial state can start from as long
as its somewhere in the universe and settles to ashs  as t   as with in2 ii a state could start
outside of ashs  altogether or a state could alternately start inside ashs  but outside one of the
subspaces these subspaces are defined in the infinite time dynamics thus they only have relevance
after the gksl dynamics has finished

we can recall from the discussion at the beginning of this section that the markov dynamics
involves two timescales the relaxation timescale tre and the asymptotic timescale sas  here
b  is the hamiltonian that governs the asymptotic dynamics parametrized by the time
parameter s fl t ie s solely describes the dynamics of the system after it has already
equilibrated from this expression we can directly see that ashs   p  bhs 
the spectral properties of l play a central role in understanding the gksl dynamics
of the system in question as such the projector decomposition of these dynamics which
separates the asymptotic dynamics from the dissipative dynamics serves as an essential tool
to understand the overall structure of gksl evolution this is given by the fourcorners
decomposition  first developed in 18 as before we follow the presentation in 19 we
the last two equalities come from recognizing p  as the projector onto the peripheral spectrum of etl  the secondtolast equality expresses p  as the
cesro mean of etl  and the last equality expresses p as the dunfordtaylor integral of etl via the resolvent z  l

of the four corners projection superoperators p  p  p  p
 which act on a
66 and 67 serve as the foundation for examining the properties of gksl systems with
multiple asymptotic states as well as the geometric properties of their quantum state spaces
these in turn are fundamental for examining the properties of classical including reversible
computing operations in gksl systems however a detailed discussion of the properties of
the fourcorners decomposition is far beyond the scope of this paper the interested reader is
highly encouraged to examine 1719 for our purposes here whats relevant is that ashs 
forms an identifiable subspace which we can project onto using the four corners projection
superoperators
as an important note p does not project onto ashs  directly rather the
subspace
contains ashs  in its entirety ashs  
 the difference between these lies in the
b   ashs  describes the states that survive in the
asymptotic dynamics governed by h
infinitetime limit as given in 64 and 65 if there are no further dephasing dynamics
within  then ashs    conversely if there are then ashs    this notation also
serves as a visual indication for the framework each operator in bhs  can be subdivided
into four regions corresponding to these projections we can freely gather ashs  into the
bpba projects into the topleft corner ie pba a
bpba projects into 
topleft corner then pba a
the subspace is a full hilbert space in its own right supporting quantum mechanical
b  in the t   limit thus it supports any possible dynamics that can
evolution under h
be governed by a hamiltonian indeed this framework provides a way to describe an
open system extension of any finitedimensional system that can be governed by the laws
of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as long as the open system relaxation is governed
by markov dynamics34 thus we can directly model a system of computational states as
discussed in 2152 each computational state corresponds to a dfs within an overall hilbert
in principle infinitedimensional hilbert spaces relativistic quantum mechanical systems and quantum field theories should be describable as well
however the details of these descriptions are still in progress

space the overall hilbert space
is then the direct sum of the individual dfs spaces known
as the von neumann algebra 5862
hdfsi 
the fact that this is identical to 2 at the level of the vectorized space shows us that the von
neumann algebra is a natural framework to represent reversible computing operations this
representation is discussed in detail in 35 the embedding of a von neumann algebra within
the four corners representation of an operator evolving under gksl dynamics is given in
figure 9
figure 9 an example of the type of overall operator algebra bhs  that can support classical including
reversible computing operations note this matrix operates on the space of vectorized density matrices
here the upper left corner subspace is a von neumann algebra corresponding to the direct sum
of decoherencefree subspaces with the gray regions representing the individual decoherencefree
subspaces
a striking feature of gksl dynamics with multiple asymptotic states is that the shape
corresponds to substantially different expressions for the quantum geometric tensor
qgt over  this is a key aspect of gksl dynamics with multiple asymptotic states and
will also serve as an essential feature of understanding the properties of rc operations in
open quantum systems the dependence of the dynamics on the qgt of
is central to the
framework developed in 18 and is discussed in detail there and in 19 unsurprisingly
because the framework of classical reversible computing operations in open quantum systems
relies at its core on gksl dynamics with multiple asymptotic states the dependence of gksl
dynamics on the qgt over
is an indispensable part of classical rc operations in open
quantum systems as well the quantum geometric properties of rc operations are briefly
mentioned in 35 a more detailed analysis of these properties and conclusions regarding rc
operations are the central theme of a forthcoming work which follows up on these discussions
23 existing and proposed implementation technologies
in this section we briefly survey a number of conceptual examples of concrete physical
mechanisms of operation that may be suitable to varying degrees for performing reversible
computations the detailed performance characteristics for these example technologies eg
the exact energy dissipation per operation as a function of speed depend on a great many
design details so we will not attempt to derive those characteristics here rather this survey
is just to give the reader an idea regarding the range of physical mechanisms for reversible
computing that may be possible it is likely that many other much more efficient mechanisms
can be invented with further research
36 of 68
first here is a concise list of the technologies we will survey with abbreviations noted
some of which are coined here
reversible adiabatic cmos racmos
reversible quantum flux parametron rqfp
reversible quantumdot cellular automaton rqca
reversible nanomechanical rod logics rnrl
ballistic asynchronous reversible computing in superconductors barcs
these particular examples will be described in a bit more detail in the following subsections these are not the only physical mechanisms for reversible computing to have been
proposed but except for barcs are some of the most welldeveloped implementation
concepts so far
231 reversible adiabatic cmos
this class of implementation technologies for reversible computing refers to a logic
design discipline based on ordinary cmos complementary metaloxidesemiconductor
fieldeffect transistors 306368 to approach physical reversibility in these types of circuits
requires several conditions to be met see appendix a for some key derivations
the onoff conductance ratio ronoff  gon goff of the device channel at the specified
operating points should diverge as the technology is improved the quantity gon refers
to the typical effective peak sourcedrain conductance through the channel of a device
transistor when it is in the on state with gate voltage set accordingly eg vg  vdd 
logic high for an ntype fet meanwhile goff refers to the maximum conductance
through the device for offstate leakage current including both gate leakage and
subthreshold current when the device is nominally turned off eg vg  0  logic low
for an nfet roughly speaking 1gon ends up being proportional to the characteristic
relaxation timescale r  ron c of the circuit while 1goff ends up being proportional to
the characteristic equilibration timescale e  roff c of the circuit when its nonequilibrium
state is not being actively maintained one of the classic results of physical reversible
computing theory the roots of which can be traced back to feynmans lectures on
computation delivered in the early 80s 69 is that in general at least for any classic
adiabatic reversible computing technology the maximum energy recovery efficiency for
a reversible device is 
ultimately limited as a function of the ratio of these two timescales
eg as er  1  c  r e for e fl r  see app a that
 is the minimum fraction
of signal energy dissipated per operation cycle scales like r e  quite generally for
cmos this means that to attain high energy efficiency we want to make the leakage
conductance goff as small as possible to extend the equilibration timescale e  and doing
this well in practice requires some combination of various engineering refinements eg
higher threshold voltages thicker gate oxides lower operating temperatures higher
materials purity identifying the most economical manufacturing process to minimize
goff in practice is not a simple optimization problem by any means however there
appears to be no fundamental reason why the ratio ronoff cannot be made as large as
desired with further refinement of the technology over time thus it seems that this
class of circuits can approach ideal reversibility with continued development
since in cmos the relaxation timescale r is subject to lower bounds the transition time
ttr for the adiabatic logic transitions should also diverge for a given technology the
minimum dissipation per cycle will be found when the transition time ttr is within a
small constant factor roughly at the geometric mean m  r e between the relaxation
and equilibration timescales app a but as long as we can arrange to keep extending
37 of 68
the equilibration timescale e  the useful transition time ttr  m can continue increasing
as well
the effective quality factor qeff of any external resonant oscillatory element serving as the
clockpower supply driving the adiabatic circuit should also diverge for our purposes
qeff can be defined as the ratio between the peak electrostatic energy eload  12 cload vdd
stored transiently on the logic nodes and the energy dissipated by the resonant oscillator
per cycle qeff  eload eodiss 
in addition to the above two design rules that must always be obeyed in conditionally
reversible adiabatic cmos circuits in order for them to be able to approach physicallyreversible operation in the above limits are the following
never turn on a transistor when there is a nonzero sourcedrain voltage across it
never turn off a transistor when there is a nonzero sourcedrain current through it
if either of these rules is ever broken in the design this can lead to substantial nonadiabatic dissipation and the physical computational process as a whole no longer qualifies
as being asymptotically physically reversible this is discussed further in 306570
a brief description of the overall normal mechanism of reversible operation for these
kinds of circuits is as follows periodic voltage waveforms are supplied by a resonant oscillatory circuit that is customized to provide quasitrapezoidal wave shapes that is with roughly
flat waveform tops and bottoms the flat regions are needed in order to avoid pushing
current through devices while they are being switched on or off the provided waveforms
exist in several different mutuallyoffset phases each phase drives a corresponding section
subset of adiabatic logic circuits the choice of which circuit nodes to charge up in a given
section is determined using seriesparallel networks of devices whose gate control electrodes
are connected to the quiescent nodes controlled by a neighboring phase after the supplied
waveforms have finished causing the desired transitions between valid logic voltage levels for
a given section of the circuit now those circuit nodes can be used to control the adiabatic transitions for the neighboring sections in adjacent clock phases the correct architectural design
of these kinds of circuits can become somewhat involved but is conceptually straightforward
see 30 for an example
2311 description of racmos in terms of our general framework
in reversible adiabatic cmos technology a given timedependent computational state
c  has a very simple description in terms of physical microstates essentially in a given
computational state at a given time each circuit node exhibits a given welldefined relatively
uniform voltage level within some tolerances of course there will be local fluctuations about
that average level physical states in which voltages depart substantially over a broad region
from any of the computationallymeaningful levels can be relegated to the catchall invalid
computational state c  but during normal operation of a wellengineered circuit such states
should have an astronomically close to zero probability of arising in any case
in terms of computational operations a certain computational operation ost is carried
out each time one of the supply waveforms executes a voltagelevel transition between two
distinct valid logic levels ie from an initial level vi to a final level vf 6 vi  over the time
interval between the two time points s start time and t  s  ttr end time during this
transition the voltage levels on the set of circuit nodes that are connected to that particular
supply line themselves undergo with a slight delay and modulo voltage offsets due to leakage
and other nonidealities the same transition between voltage levels in this process some
transistors eg ones whose gates are controlled by the transitioning nodes may be turned on
or turned off causing the source and drain nodes of those transistors to become connected to
or disconnected from each other these connection and disconnection events result in the set
38 of 68
of accessible computational states changing over time since even the number of independent
connected components will be changing thus so will the number of available computational
states
in any case as long as the two rules of adiabatic design are respected throughout a given
transition the operation ost that is performed will be both conditionally logically reversible
under the condition that the rules are respected as well as asymptotically thermodynamically
reversible in the limit described above where goff  0 and ttr   while keeping ttr fi e 
thus we can allow both ronoff and ttr to continue increasing as the technology develops
and approach perfect reversibility over time given continued development of this family of
technologies
the above discussion glosses over the important issue of the effective quality factor qeff
of the driving powerclock resonator which will also limit the overall degree of reversibility
but as far as we know at present there is no reason why this quantity cannot diverge as
well with continued engineering refinements the development of highquality trapezoidal
resonators suitable for driving adiabatic circuits is in the scope of engineering rd work
being performed at sandia
232 reversible quantum flux parametron
the reversible quantum flux parametron rqfp logic family 7173 is a logically
reversible variant of the welldeveloped superconducting logic family aqfp adiabatic
quantum flux parametron which has been being developed primarily at yokohama national
university in japan rqfp and its notnecessarilyreversible generalization aqfp rely on
adiabatic transformation of the abstract potential energy surface pes that obtains within
josephsonjunctionbased superconducting circuits the independent variables for the pes
describe the current distribution in the circuit and the phase order parameter differences
across the junctions the pes is manipulated in such a way that the occupied potential energy
valley of the system is transformed adiabatically to configurations representing different
computational states
rqfp circuits are controlled by externally supplied waveforms similarly to the case
in racmos except that the supplies are providing current signals not voltage signals
since voltages except for inductive transients are normally zero in superconducting circuits
except for the fact that the state of the circuit and the driving signals at a given time is
described in terms of currents instead of voltages and that the physics of superconductivity
dominates the charge transport the representation of rqfp in terms of computational and
physical states is roughly speaking qualitatively similar to the case in racmos that is to
say the higherlevel principles of pipelined reversible logic are roughly comparable between
the two technologies
one advantage however of rqfp compared to cmos is that due to meissnereffect
trapping of flux quanta the natural equilibration timescale e is extremely large effectively
infinite in rqfp and as a result scaling to extreme ultralow levels of dissipation may
ultimately prove far easier to do in rqfp than in adiabatic cmos the primary disadvantages
of rqfp compared to cmos are its lower density and accordingly higher manufacturing
cost perdevice together with its requirement for lowtemperature operation
233 reversible quantumdot cellular automaton
the quantumdot cellular automata qca or qdca 7476 family of technologies
operate using single electrons confined to quantum dots dipole configurations of two such
electrons confined to four such dots in a square layout separated by tunnel barriers aka a
cell and linearbranching arrays of such cells interacting through dipoledipole coulombic
interactions as in racmos and rqfp externally supplied signals are used to adiabatically
39 of 68
raise and lower potential energy barriers that separate neighboring regions of the physical
state space in patterns that in the technologys reversible variant here dubbed rqca
allow the overall computational state to evolve reversiblywhich as usual means in a
conditionally logically reversible and asymptotically physically reversible way
an interesting note about qdca is that it was recently shown 77 that exponential
scaling of adiabaticity with speed as in landauzener transitions with a missed level crossing
exists in this system apparently implying that there is no fundamental lower bound on
dissipationdelay product in 78 pidaparthi and lent investigate this phenomenon in more
detail using a lindbladian analysis finding that when there is weak thermal coupling to the
environment these systems can exhibit substantially suppressed dissipation within a certain
regime of speeds this is a promising result and we expect that this type of behavior likely
generalizes to a wider variety of quantum systems
234 reversible nanomechanical rod logics
this is a concept that goes back to k eric drexlers work in the 1980s leading up to
his dissertation on molecular nanotechnology at mit 7981 the original idea was that
logical bits are encoded in the linear displacements of atomicallyprecise nanorods that move
within sleeves at the ends of nanosprings the nods are pushed back and forth by externally
supplied mechanical signals following the same kind of quasitrapezoidal waveforms weve
talked about previously to adiabatically transform them between computational states using
nanoscale bumps on the rods to sterically hinder each others motion in ways that allow them
to perform conditionally reversible boolean logic the whole scheme is closely analogous to
racmos except that it uses mechanical rather than electrical state variables
drexlers rod logic concept was updated more recently 8283 by a group led by ralph
merkle a pioneering cryptographer and early nanotechnologist the new concept eliminated
the sleeve bearings whose friction had dominated the dissipation in drexlers earlier concept
in the new scheme the only bearings are rotary bearings implemented by single carbyne bonds
whose orbitals are circularly symmetrical frictional losses in this system were assessed in
simulations 84 to be so low that individual joints operated reversibly would dissipate
70000 less than landauers kt ln 2 limit even when operating at frequencies as high as
100 mhz this example illustrates that in principle dissipationdelay products for reversible
operations can be far smaller than is the case in racmos this particular dissipationdelay value is roughly 106  improved versus projected endofroadmap cmosand at room
temperature
the main problem with the drexlermerkle family of nanomechanical rod logic concepts
for reversible computing is simply that building them would seemingly require a very general
sophisticated atomicallyprecise and fast technology for nanofabrication and assembly which
does not yet exist and may continue to not exist for some decades
235 ballistic asynchronous reversible computing in superconductors
ballistic asynchronous reversible computing barc previously called abrc 85 is
a fundamentally new physical model of reversible computing in which the computational
degrees of freedom evolve ballistically ie under their own inertia rather than being dragged
along adiabatically as a side effect of the oscillatory evolution of an external resonator this
change may provide certain advantages in terms of eg allowing us to avoid having to worry
about accidentally exciting undesired modes of the resonator and of the distribution network
for the driving signal the barc model is required to be asynchronous as a means to prevent
the nonlinear interactions between subsystems from chaotically amplifying uncertainties in
the subsystem trajectories
40 of 68
in a current project at sandia we are attempting to implement the barc model in superconducting electronic circuits 86 the computational subsystems are individual polarized
flux solitons or fluxons propagating nearballistically along long josephson junction ljj
transmission lines in our circuits fluxons are conserved and interact asynchronously with
stored flux quanta at stateful interaction sites or circuit elements transforming the local digital
state reversibly in a deterministic sort of elastic scattering interaction
barc is an extremely novel concept and has only been developed to a very preliminary
level to date so far we have a single very simple working barc circuit element ie it
simulates correctly in spice 87 a test chip for it has been fabricated and experimental tests
of it are in progress however a wider variety of useful elements leading up to a complete
logic family still need to be developed and optimized
we are also collaborating with a group at the university of maryland which has been
working on a similar ballistic approach which they call reversible fluxon logic rfl 8894
the original rfl concept envisioned synchronous ballistic logic but the maryland group is
also now also developing asynchronous elements which fall into the barcs paradigm 95
3 results
much work remains to be done in terms of fleshing out a complete physical theory
of reversible computing informed by neqt but in this section we review some important
preliminary results in this area that can be or have already been obtained
first we view it as important for resolving some of the longstanding controversies in
the thermodynamics of computation to distinguish a couple of different results that have
historically been associated with landauers principle
first is a simple result regarding the interchangeability of entropy between computational and noncomputational forms this one follows directly from the association
of computational states to sets of microstates discussed in 212 however it is such
an important result that we call it the fundamental theorem of the thermodynamics of
computation we review it in 31 below this result implies that noncomputational or
physical entropy must be increased when computational information entropy is
reduced but does not require that total entropy be increased
second is a result 32 showing that a strict entropy increase is required whenever
there is a loss of information which by itself is not surprising since entropy increase
effectively means that known information is reduced and furthermore that an example
of this necessarily occurs when one of two mutuallycorrelated subsystems is obliviously
erased meaning that in isolation its reduced subsystem entropy is ejected to its local
thermal environment without regards to its existing correlations to the extent that the
ejected information is then thermalized with its correlations to the other subsystem
being lost this then corresponds to a strict increase in total entropy this result follows
directly from unitarity information theory and the definitions in 21
we argue that it is the second result and not the first one that is most properly understood
as being landauers principle because landauers principle is most properly taken to concern
the consequences of information loss in a computersince that was the original subject of
landauers 1961 paper and at least in an ordinary deterministic computer it is normally the
case that computed bits are correlatedmeaning there is mutual information between them
since in fact one can say that it is the generation of specific desired patterns of correlation
between different subsystems that is exactly the whole point of what computation per se is all
about
in particular we show in 32 that for any deterministically computed bit or larger
computational subsystem the amount of new entropy that is generated when that bit is obliviously erased is strictly lowerbounded by the prior reduced subsystem entropy of that bit or
41 of 68
subsystem35 note that in that statement we are talking about an absolute increase in the
total entropy of the model universe including computational and noncomputational entropy
defined below and not just a transfer of entropy from computational to noncomputational
form
thus landauers principle when it is properly understood in this way really does
provide a lower bound on new entropy generation and not simply on entropy transfer as has
sometimes been claimed
in addition to the above clarification of landauers principle we also in 33 review
two fundamental theorems of reversible computing these were previously presented in 20
but we reprise them here
the fundamental theorem of traditional reversible computing whose proof is summarized
in 331 below states that the only deterministic computational operations that always
avoid ejecting computational entropy to noncomputational form and thus can avoid
landauers lower limit on entropy increase when operating in isolation on computed
bits are the unconditionally logically reversible operations traditionally studied in reversible
computing theory
the fundamental theorem of generalized reversible computing whose proof is summarized
in 332 below states that in a statistically contextualized computation it can suffice in
a properly designed mechanism to avoid entropy ejection and the resultant entropy
increase due to landauers limit if a computational operation is simply reversible on
the subset of initial states having nonzero probability in the given statistical operating
context
taking the latter observation the generalized theorem into account is essential in order
for theory to adequately encompass the state of the art of the existing best practices in
the engineering of reversible computing hardware the generalized theorem significantly
expands the class of computational mechanisms that can be seen to be capable of approaching
thermodynamic reversibility when appropriate constraints are met in particular all of the
actual implementation technologies for reversible computing described in 23 can only be
understood properly in the light of the generalized form of the theoremin other words all
of the real reversible computing technologies that have been implemented to date are only
conditionally reversible and so they rely for their ability to achieve asymptotic reversibility in
practice on the fact that their preconditions for reversibility have been met by design within
the architectures of those machines and implicitly on the generalized theorem of rc
next the framework of neqt provides us with several new perspectives from which to
understand landauers principle and to begin to characterize the properties of rc operations
in open quantum systems in 34 we relate landauers principle and the structure of
reversible computing to the ctos discussed in 2212 by examining the difference between
conditional and unconditional landauer reset using the structure of these ctos we find
a general motivation for and rationale for the structure of rc directly from rtqt quite
spectacularly we see that by treating elements of the physical computer system as the catalyst
in the cto sense we can directly represent repeated cycles of computation and landauer
reset in particular we see that using the structure of ctos outlined in 2212 we can cycle
through the operation of computational systems as long as we wish with minimal buildup of
qmi finally in 35 we begin the foundational work of representing rc operations in terms of
open quantum systems from a firstprinciples level using the properties of gksl dynamics
with multiple asymptotic states in particular we note specific properties of computational
and noncomputational operations and briefly discuss implications in terms of their quantum
geometric signatures
this argument was previously made explicit in the preprint arxiv190110327 but we reprise it here
42 of 68
let us now review these results in a bit more detail
31 the fundamental theorem of the thermodynamics of computation
first starting from the basic conception of classical digital computational states presented in 212 we can easily derive what we call the fundamental theorem of the thermodynamics of computation this theorem formalizes the relationship between socalled information
entropy that is entropy of the computational state and physical entropy
to start let  be a variable representing the complete micro physical state of the
computer system s specified by a choice of one of the protocomputational basis vectors
b  b  assume that at a given point in time  the probability mass over the different possible
physical states  is distributed according to a probability distribution p as given in the
usual way using the born rule or equivalently by the diagonal elements of the systems
instantaneous density matrix   in the b basis
we can then derive an implied probability distribution pc over the computational states
c j  c by simply summing p over the various physical states   i  b j  where b j denotes
the specific basis set bc  b corresponding to computational state c  c j 
pc j  
pi 
i  b j
it is then trivial to show that the systems total von neumannshannon entropy s where
 is a random variable ranging over values  can always be partitioned as
s     h  c   s    c 
where h c  with c a random variable ranging over values c refers to the computational
entropy or information entropy meaning the entropy of the computational state variable c
according to the abovederived probability distribution pc and meanwhile sc  refers
to the conditional entropy of the physical state variable  if the value of the computational
state variable c is given if we then define noncomputational entropy as snc  sc  then we
can just say total entropy equals computational entropy plus noncomputational entropy
note that this is true alwaysno matter how the protocomputational basis b is defined and
partitioned into basis sets corresponding to computational states see figure 10 and for
more details see ref 9
this fact together with the second law of thermodynamics ie st  0 globally
implies that one cant ever reduce computational entropy for example by merging two
computational states like in figure 5b without also increasing noncomputational entropy
by at least a corresponding amount of course this works both waysmeaning if you
increase computational entropy eg by splitting a computational state in a stochastic computational operation like in figure 5c you can thereby also reduce noncomputational entropy
accordingly this is done in practice for example in paramagnetic cooling 9698 if we think
of the relatively stable randomized magnetic domains that form during the cooling process
as constituting computational bits
a widespread perception is that the theorem corresponding to the above observations
constitutes a form of landauers principle but we argue that although it is indeed a very
important basic theorem of the thermodynamics of computation calling it landauers
principle creates confusion because it entirely misses what we argue is the central most
important point of landauers principle proper which has to do more specifically with the
loss of computed correlated information such as typically exists within a computer this
viewpoint is discussed at great length in 9 and more concisely in the following subsection
43 of 68
figure 10 fundamental theorem of the thermodynamics of computing illustrated using the picture
of fig 3 no matter how we choose the protocomputational basis b of the computing system s and
partition it into distinct computational states c  c we can always express the total physical entropy
s of the system as the sum of the information entropy h c  of the computational state state of the
computational subsystem c and the noncomputational entropy snc  of s which is equal to the
conditional entropy sc  of the physical state when the computational state is given
32 landauers principle proper
since we wish to argue that landauers principle is most centrally a theorem about the
consequences of information loss in computation specifically it behooves us to say a little bit
more about what we mean by that
a quite general picture of computation involves the concept of function evaluation eg
computing y  f  x  given x in fact historically the very first formal model of universal computation due to alonzo church defined general computations in terms of recursive function
evaluation 99 and it is of course wellknown today that arbitrarily complex computations
can be composed out of simple function evaluations eg boolean logic operations
let us then consider as an example two subsystems x y of a computational system
c that exist for purposes of holding the input value x and output value y of some function
f  to be evaluated let us assume that subsystems x and y have separable corresponding
computational state spaces c x  c y  which is to say the computational states of subsystems
x and y are independently measurable there is then a joint computational state space
c xy  c x  c y  suppose initially we have some distribution pcx  over the initial state of
x suppose then a deterministic computational oxy is performed on the joint system xy
which leaves cx unchanged but results in cy  f cx  which is to say the computational
state cy of y becomes a state representing the value y  f  x  where x is the value represented
by the state cx of x note that this operation oxy could also be reversible eg if cy contained
a known value initially eg is cleared memory
it then follows from the above setup that
first the reduced computational entropy of y written h cy  after performing oxy  is
entirely accounted for by the mutual information between y and x that is h cy  
i cx  cy  in other words y contains an exactly zero amount of independent entropy
relative to x since h cy cx   0 ie y is completely determined by x this just
follows from the fact that as is typically the case in traditional digital computation
function evaluation is a deterministic operation
44 of 68
figure 11 landauers principle as entropy increase from thermalization of mutual information red
shading denotes probability density left two perfectlycorrelated computational bitsystems x and
y their states could have been prepared by computing ys value y deterministically from x eg
using y  x middle when the variable y for the computational state of y is obliviously erased
this amounts to merging the two computational states in each column we can say that now y  0
say in each merged state note that now there briefly exists a correlation between x and the noncomputational part of the physical state right very quickly over a thermalization timescale we
lose track of the probabilities of the different physical states making up each computational state thus
losing this correlation information this is where the absolute increase of total entropy from landauers
principle necessarily occurs we cannot of course then undo this entropy increase by simply reversing
the first step unmerging the y states because the correlation information between x and y has already
been irrevocably lost by this point
second now suppose that next an irreversible computational operation oerase is performed locally on y in complete isolation from x that is without any influence from the state
of x or even any applied knowledge about the state of x beyond our prior distribution
pcx  and suppose further that the overall outputstate distribution pcy  resulting
from oerase has zero entropy this resultant distribution pcy  is found by computing
a weighted sum of oerase cy  over the set of all input computational states of y with
probability pcy   0 for this distribution to have zero entropy implies that all such
states of y map to the same value cy  c0  which is why oerase can be considered an
erasure operation
if we now simply assume that the noncomputational entropy in s will shortly be thermalized
which is to say the entropy ejected from y is not being preserved in a stable or predictable
form elsewhere in the physical state of the systemthen it follows that the correlation
previously contained in the mutual information i cx  cy  has now been lost and
therefore the total entropy of the model universe u is immediately ie after a thermalization
timescale increased by at minimum the prior value of the reduced entropy h cy  just
before the erasure an example is illustrated in figure 11
we argue that the resulting theorem constitutes what is the most appropriate statement of
landauers principle namely that to erase any deterministicallycomputed information in an
isolated computational subsystem obliviously without regards to its correlations with other
information that may exist and if this is followed by allowing the reduced subsystem entropy
that was thereby ejected to subsequently thermalize results in turning that subsystems
previous mutual information which was not independent entropy into true entropy real
new uncertainty and thereby results in a permanent increase in the total entropy of the
universe by the corresponding amount
additional details of the argument for this result can be found in the extended postprint

33 fundamental theorems of reversible computing
in this section we review what we call the fundamental theorems of reversible computing
rc 20 which show that in order for a deterministic computing system to avoid entropy
increases due to landauers principle when understood properly as in 32 above logically
reversible computational operations must be utilized the fundamental theorem of rc comes
in two versions the traditional version which shows that traditional unconditionally logically
reversible operations are required in order to avoid entropy increase from landauers principle
in all possible input circumstances and the less often recognized generalized version which
shows that a broader class of conditionally reversible operations suffice for use in systems that
are properly designed to ensure that the preconditions for reversibility of those operations are
met
331 fundamental theorem of traditional reversible computing
before we review the traditional rc theorem we first present a simple definition based
on the discussion of 3132 above which will be helpful for stating it the following is
presented in timeindependent terms but can easily be made timedependent
3311 entropyejecting operations
a computational operation o on a computational state set c is called potentially entropyejecting if and only if where exists some possible prior distribution pc   p c such
that when the operation o is applied within that context the increase snc in the noncomputational entropy required by the fundamental theorem of the thermodynamics of
computing 31 is greater than zero if an operation o is not even potentially entropyejecting we call it nonentropyejecting
note that if an operation is entropyejecting and it is performed in isolation by which
we implicitly also mean obliviously without external knowledge of the state being applied
on a subsystem that contains mutual information with other subsystems and if we assume
that any noncomputational entropy will not be preserved in a predictable form but will be
thermalized then this entropy ejection will furthermore result in a global entropy increase by a
straightforward generalization of landauers principle in its proper form stated above in 
fundamental theorem of traditional reversible computing if a deterministic
computational operation o is nonentropyejecting by the above definition then it follows
that o must be unconditionally logically reversible
the proof of this statement is trivial but can be found in arxiv180610183 the extended
postprint version of 20
note also that an immediate corollary of this theorem is that if we wish to perform
computational operations in isolation ie obliviously on subsystems that contain any mutual
information with other systems such as subsystems whose state was computed deterministically from those other systems then we can only avoid a global entropy increase from
landauers principle in the general case ie for any distribution pc  over initial computational states and when the noncomputational state doesnt preserve information in a
predictable form if those operations are unconditionally logically reversible
332 fundamental theorem of generalized reversible computing
the traditional theorem above is in essence about how we can avoid landauer losses
in the worst casethat is when we assume that we have no control over what the initial
computational state ci  c may be and thus any statistical mixture of initial states is possible
but in a real computer the initial state prior to a given computational operation may be and
46 of 68
usually is a resultant state from a previous operation thus it is frequently the case that we
can by design in a computer restrict the set of possible initial states to a proper subset a  c
of allowed states this then makes it possible to design computing mechanisms that avoid
landauer losses by transforming just the subset a of allowed states reversibly this is in fact
how typical real engineered technologies for reversible computing including those described
in 23 above worksince it turns out in general to be much easier in practice to design
mechanisms that only transform restricted subsets of computational states reversibly rather
than the full set of all potentially describable states but to show why doing this is sufficient
we need a more general version of the fundamental theorem of rc one that properly models
the case where the set of initial states is restricted
to do this we also need to extend the concept of an entropyejecting operation from 
331 as follows
3321 entropyejecting computations
for purposes of the below theorem let a statistically contextualized computation c 
co p refer to the concept of performing a computational operation o over its computational
state space c given a particular initial probability distribution p  pc  where c is a random
variable ranging over computational states c  c the quantum contextualized computation
concept of 215 is just a straightforward generalization of this concept to a quantum context
we say that a deterministic computation c is specifically entropyejecting if and only if the
increase snc in the noncomputational entropy required by the fundamental theorem of
the thermodynamics of computation ie due to a reduction in computational entropy
h c  is greater than zero if the computation c is not specifically entropyejecting we call it
nonentropyejecting
as before this then allows us to immediately state the corresponding theorem
fundamental theorem of generalized reversible computing a deterministic
computation co p is nonentropyejecting if and only if at least one of its preconditions for
reversibility is satisfied with probability 1 under the initial probability distribution p
as with the traditional theorem the proof of this is easy but may be found in arxiv180610183
like with the traditional theorem the generalized theorem has an immediate corollary
which is that if we wish to perform the computation co p in isolation obliviously on
a subsystem bearing mutual information with other systems such as a subsystem whose
computational state was deterministically computed from those outside systems then we can
only avoid a global entropy increase from landauers principle for that specific computation
assuming as usual that the noncomputational state doesnt preserve information in a
predictable form if the operation o is conditionally reversible under at least the precondition
that c  a where a   ci  c  pi  0 
the significance of the two rc theorems together is that in order to avoid the otherwisenecessary entropy increase resulting from landauers principle when performing isolated
computational operations on subsystems in the context of larger deterministic computations
one must confine oneself to the above two cases unconditionally reversible operations andor
conditionally reversible operations that have a satisfied condition for reversibility
the significance of the generalized reversible computing theorem as opposed to the
traditional one is to observe that it is a sufficient logicallevel requirement to avoid requiring
an entropy increase from landauers principle if simply those initial states having nonzero
probability in the given statistical operating context pc  are mapped onetoone onto final
states
of course in any event even when these conditions for reversibility are satisfied to avoid
entropy increase in reality also requires that the physical mechanisms implementing the given
computation must be designed to approach thermodynamic reversibility in practicebut the
47 of 68
import of the rc theorems is to say that when the conditions of either theorem are satisfied
landauers principle at least does not preclude doing this
additional discussion of these two theorems can be found in 20 with detailed proofs
available in the associated postprint arxiv180610183 we should note that although the
particular proofs of these theorems presented there did not yet explicitly utilize the quantum
generalization of the concept of a statistical operating context that we presented in 215
above all of the constructions in 215 were specifically designed to guarantee that the exact
same proofs will go through essentially unmodified in the quantum version of the theory
given our assumptions about rapid decoherence of final states thus the above theorems
remain valid within the quantum framework of the present paper
34 representations of reversible computing by catalytic thermal operations
the results above follow from a static analysis just based on the overall starting and
ending states of a given computational process however obtaining more detailed results
eg about minimum energy dissipation as a function of speed will require more detailed
attention to the dynamics of computational transitions this then requires engaging more
detailed theoretical methods such as the resourcetheoretic tools we reviewed in 221 in this
section we discuss how to think about reversible computational operations in terms of those
more detailed methods
341 reconsidering the notion of a catalyst
the nonequilibrium landauer results in 22212222 emphasize how essential it
is to have a map as close to unital as possible in order to minimize the energy cost of the
operation ie the importance of a map that minimizes the entropy difference between ins
and t ins  ideally wed like to connect these to the theory of thermal operations so that
we can begin to identify the thermal processes that are relevant for reversible computing
as discussed in 2221 the bound is zero when the landauer reset protocol applied to the
subsystem bearing computational degrees of freedom is conditioned on the state of that
subsystem and when the von neumann entropies of the subsystem state before and after reset
are equal although achieving this in practice is a nontrivial engineering challenge there is
no fundamental quantum mechnical
barrier to this constraint so we can consider this case
specifically ie that si   s  j  sr  where i and  j can be any possible computational
state
in order to select the right to we again return to the landauer reset protocols these
were described earlier as the process of resetting a state bearing some computational degrees of
information either with a conditioned or unconditioned potential without loss of generality
we can consider the system carrying these degrees of freedom as part of a larger system
then we can label the larger system s and the subsystem carrying these degrees of freedom
q as shown in figure 12 in terms of q the landauer reset protocol is the process of
transforming the state q to the reset state rq  until now weve been content to consider
the hamiltonians acting on all of the systems and subsystems as background hamiltonians
ordinarily this wouldnt pose any issues and indeed helps us keep the properties of the
system as general as possible
brq can be conditioned on q plays
however as we saw in 2221 whether or not v
a vital role in calculating the free energy bound on the reset process and in particular on
the information contribution to the bound thus by contrast to the other contributions to
bq as an ambient background potential we in fact lose a
the overall hamiltonian by having v
vital piece of context of the overall process this context is relevant when trying to identify
bq as not
the correct to we want to use to examine the process thus we need to think of v
an ambient potential that acts on q but rather a potential that acts on q from a different
48 of 68
figure 12 a the embedding of a system q carrying computational degrees of freedom inside a larger
system s which also contains a subsystem p used to induce state transformations on q b an example
of the process discussed in 2221 in terms of this embedding q is in one of the n states q  a
bq is applied to q to transform it into the reset state rq  crucially since v
bq is part of the
potential v
system it must be contained in s ie it must not be part of the environment meanwhile it also must
bq onto q to
be outside of all of q we can without loss of generality consider the subsystem that applies v
be part of or all of p c the application of this potential transforms the local state of q as q 7 rq 
assuming that the dynamics can be described by a cto of the form 10 the transformation must also
induce some state transformation 1p 7 2p  to preserve unitarity of the overall dynamics on pq
bq by p upon q also gives
the sole exception to this is the identity transformation the application of v
rise to a correleation between q and p given by the qmi 14 d the correlated states rq and 2p
correspond to a single state  pq over pq as a while with trp  pq  rq and trq  pq  2p 
subsystem p of the overall system s if we require that the local state of p ie the state of p
when we trace out every other subsystem be the same to within some value e  r under
the trace distance then we can treat p as a catalyst which is necessary to induce the local state
transformation q 7 rq  in this framework the natural to to examine this interaction is
the general cto given by 10 indeed we can recognize the ier term in the unconditional
landauer bound 34 as precisely the same as the qmi 14 built up between the transforming
subsystem and the catalyst
thus in terms of tos the correlationpreserving generalized ctos discussed in
2212 are precisely the conditioned landauer reset protocols discussed in 2221 by
contrast the requirement in 15 that the final state of the catalyst remain uncorrelated with
the final state of the transforming subsystem is identical to applying a single unconditioned
potential for the landauer reset as was the case when comparing the most general cto 10
and the more traditional cto 15 the correlated information ier  i q  p is ejected from
the overall system s  qp after the unconditional protocol alternately and equivalently
the unconditional landauer reset protocol resp the more traditional cto can be realized by
performing the conditional landauer reset protocol resp the general cto and then ejecting
the correlated information afterwards
49 of 68
thus far weve used the general cto to describe the process of a subsystem being
transformed with the help of a catalyst and to obtain the quantum thermodynamic restrictions
on this process however the word catalyst is simply a convention based on our modelling
mathematically the catalyst is simply another subsystem which within an e  r  returns
locally to the same state before and after the overall state transformation on s nothing a
priori tells us that the subsystem k in 10 must be a catalyst as far as the mathematics is
concerned this is simply a statement about a specific type of transformation on the system
s  tk where t and k are subsystems and k has the additional requirement 11 that the
state before and after the transformation is locally the same up to an infinitesimal e this offers
an interesting extension of the discussion above regarding the reset of q due to a subsystem p
what happens if we allow p to change its state before and after the transition but we require
that the subsystem q bearing computational degrees of freedom must return to the same
state a priori this seems like it would make no sense how can we meaningfully talk about
computation if the subsystem with computational degrees of freedom is left unchanged
to answer this well consider the decomposition of the transition q  p 7  qp into
two distinct noncatalytic tos over the subsystems q and p here we enforce trpe  qp  
q and ktrqe  qp   p k1  e for some infinitesimal e  r  in other words the overall
transition q  p 7  qp is an operation where now the state over q starts and ends in the
same state in this decomposition one of these transformations locally takes the state of q
away from q  and the other returns the state of q to q  overall then we consider the pair
of transformations
q  inp 7 qp 7  qp 
in addition to the properties for trpe  qp  and trqe  qp  stated above we have trpe qp  
q for some q 6 q 
the composed transition q  p 7  qp is the cto q  p 7  qp discussed above
where now it is the state q of q that starts and ends in the same state under the composition
thus the composed transition must correspond to the constraints in 2212 this has a direct
interpretation in terms of computing if we think of q as a reset state the reset state is
conventionally the state we use as our starting point to perform a computation on q which
is why its chosen as the reset state in the first place then the process 71 corresponds to
starting with the standard reset state q  using a different subsystem p to manipulate the state
of q ie perform a computation on q and then using p once more to perform a conditional
landauer reset on q to return it to the reset state remarkably since these compose to yield
an overall cto of the form 10 this process can be achieved with an infinitesimal buildup of
mutual information i q  p  1  2 for 1  2  r 
by contrast we can also consider unconditional landauer reset as a type of cto of the
form 15 in this case we can consider the transformation over qp given by
q  inp 7 qp 7 q  fp 
here q and p are uncorrelated at the end of the transformation as before we can think
of q as the reset state we can think of this pair of transformations corresponding to a
decomposition of a cto of the form 15 and simultaneously the unconditional landauer
protocol in 28 as discussed in 2212 and 2214 the fact that the final states of q and p
are uncorrelated corresponds to an intrinsic asymmetry between the work of formation f
and the extractable work f0  this loss of energy represents the energy lost as a result of the
expulsion of the qmi between q and p into the environment

342 transformations on computational states and catalytic thermal operations
for the sake of clarity we explicitly restate this way of viewing computational operations
now referencing the computational subspace c and a control subspace k combining the
framework of 2212 and the current section with the notation and viewpoint of 2221
as discussed in 2221 for a subspace c bearing computational degrees of freedom we
define the reset state rc as a standard known reference state upon which operations can be
performed these operations correspond to known computations which transform the state
of the system from the reset state to one of n known final computational states c  then in
the landauer protocol we reset the final state back to the reset state either conditioning the
reset protocol on the final state or not conditioning the reset protocol on the final state these
correspond to the conditional and unconditional landauer protocols respectively with the
lower bound on the energy cost of each given in 22212222 specifically we saw that
the conditional landauer protocol was bounded below by zero whereas the unconditional
landauer protocol was bounded below by the amount of correlated information between the
computational state and the subsystem applying the reset potential onto the computational
state
we can understand the process of repeatedly resetting the computational subspace c to
rc  evolving the state of c to a final computational state c  again resetting again evolving
to a final computational state mc which may be the same or different and continuing in
this fashion as a sequence of ctos as discussed earlier in 341 in particular since the local
state of c is constantly reset evolved and then reset and evolved again and again all under
the influence of a secondary operator k we can consider c as the catalyst subsystem in the
sense of the discussion earlier in this section a series of computational operations performed
by a subsystem k of s thats distinct from c but contained entirely within s transforms
the state of c from rc to some c  which corresponds to our computational operation k
then performs the landauer reset c 7 rc of c following either the conditional landauer
protocol 23 or the unconditional landauer protocol 27 with the corresponding energy
costs given by 26 and 34 respectively
a priori it may not be clear why we insist that k must be the same subsystem that performs the local transformation rc 7 c and the landauer reset rc 7 c  indeed these
transitions may well be performed by different machines within s however without loss of
generality we can lump the set of all machines which perform operations on c collectively
into a single subspace k and subsequently examine the set of operations that k in its entirety
performs on c in particular from the decomposition of s and e given in 211 we note that
all of these individual machines as well as their combined collection k must correspond to a
subspace of s
we can use the techniques of ctos to examine these transformations in particular using
the argument in 341 to examine the conditional landauer bound we start with c in a reset
state have k perform some operations to transform it into a final computational state and
then reset c to the reset state once again as in 341 this chain of operations permits us
to think of c as the catalyst in a cto despite c being the actual computational system of
interest then the means by which we transform from rc to c and then back to rc tells us
whether we have a cto of the form 10 or of the form 15 equivalently the means by which
this pair of transformations takes place tells us whether we have a conditional landauer reset
protocol 21 or an unconditional landauer reset protocol 28
in the case of the unconditional landauer reset protocol we have the pair of transformations rc  ink 7 ck 7 rc   f k with trk ck   c  this is of the exact same form
as the transformation 72 as such the same conclusion applies in this case this transformation corresponds to the cto described in 15 the final correlation between c and k is
ejected into the environment yielding the irreversible energy difference f  f0  conversely

figure 13 a representation of a computational operation cycle in terms of a cto with conditional
landauer reset a the computational system c starts in a standard reset state rc  an auxiliary system
k starting in the state k performs a series of operations on rc  causing ck to jointly evolve into a
state ck  with trk ck   c as one of the possible known final computational states the series of
operations that k performs on c corresponds to computation then k performs a landauer reset of c
returning it locally to the standard reset state in the case of the conditional landauer reset pictured
here the reset protocol corresponds to ck jointly evolving into the final state  ck  with trk  ck   rc 
the composition of operations rc  k 7 ck 7  ck is a composition of the form 71 and thus
corresponds to a cto of the form 10 shown as the gray arrow b locally in q the state of pq is
given by one of the n final computational states q   1  ie we have trp pq  q  c locally
in q the state of  pq is once again given by the reset state rq  ie we have trp  pq  rq 
in the case of the conditional landauer reset protocol we have the pair of transformations
rc  ink 7 ck 7  ck with trk ck   c and trk  ck   rc  here we permit
the qmi 14 between c and k to build up in both transformations as before the qmi in
each transformation can be made as small as possible but cannot in general be zero the
representation of the conditional landauer reset protocol as a cto in which the computational
subsystem c is thought of as the catalyst inasmuch as it returns to the starting state after
two successive operations is given in figure 13
35 subspace representations of computational and noncomputational operations
in 2232 we discussed some of the basic properties of open quantum systems with
multiple asymptotic states evolving under the gksl approximation a key aspect of the
asymptotic subspace ashs  is that the evolution after gksl relaxation supports the full
dynamics available to closed quantum systems in other words ashs  supports any dynamics that can be expressed by a hilbert space of states evolving under a hamiltonian in this
b  governs the dynamics of ashs  after the gksl relaxation this
case the hamiltonian h
provides an extremely powerful framework to represent reversible computing operations
if we can represent rc operations for closed system dynamics we can automatically get a
representation for rc operations in gksl dynamics as we saw in 2123 the most general
52 of 68
framework for representing a computational subsystem is with the dfs sum hs  i hdfsi 
where each dfs hdfsi represents a computational basis element ci 
when examining the dynamics on hs  this immediately gives us a way of distinguishing
computational and noncomputational operations in particular we note that since each dfs
corresponds to a specific computational basis element a computational operation must transfer
states from one subspace to another conversely a noncomputational operation cannot transfer
states from one subspace to another therefore it must only be able at most to rearrange states
within each subspace a direct consequence of this is that noncomputational operations
must commute with the dfs structure of the computational system whereas computational
operations in general have no such restrictions and permit coherences between different
computational subspaces during the immediate period of computational operation a visual
representation of these two different kinds of operations is provided in figure 14
figure 14 the representation of computational and noncomputational operations in a hilbert space
such as ashs  a computational operations blue arrows which transfer between different computational states blue circles as discussed in 2122 each computational state corresponds to a distinct
orthogonal dfs gray with the overall hilbert space corresponding to the direct sum of these b
noncomputational operations yellow arrows which cannot transfer between different computational
states and thus can only transfer protocomputational states within the same dfs note that a direct
consequence of this is that noncomputational operations must commute with the dfs structure
our interest here is in classical computing rather than quantum computing as a result
we expect no quantum coherences to develop between different computational subspaces
quantum coherences may only exist within a dfs representing a single computational state
however computational operations of the type shown in figure 14a necessarily induce coherences these are indeed characteristic of the transfer between one subspace and another as a
result immediately after a computational operation ashs  will appear as a single space
for our computer to remain a classical computer then we require that this space dephase
into the dfs sum we expect faster than the computers ability to resolve distinct times this is
showing in figure 15 this provides us with a dephasing timescale which can in fact offer
a way to distinguish between classical quantum and approximately classical computing
representations as we tune the dephasing timescale here by approximately classical
we mean those operations where the dephasing timescale is on the same order as the computer resolution timescale the relative strength of the dephasing and computer resolution
timescales and the consequences of tuning this relative strength will be of significant interest
for future work
its an almost trivial statement to note that any matrix can be represented as the sum of
two other matrices however the distinction between computational and noncomputational
operations discussed above and the point that a computational operation necessarily mixes
53 of 68
figure 15 the dephasing of ashs  from a single subspace to a dfs direct sum for classical reversible
operations this dephasing must occur faster than the computers ability to resolve distinct times ie
on a timescale faster than the computer can see classical and quantum computing operations can be
distinguished by the relation between this timescale and the computer resolution timescale
the different computational dfss to temporarily make a single large space provides us with
an interesting decomposition of such operations in particular we note that a computational
operation which appears as an operator mixing all of the states in ashs  can be decomposed
into a noncomputational part which commutes with the dfs structure and a pure computational part which contains all of the information involving transfer of states between dfs
blocks and thus all of the information regarding the actual computational content of the operation this decomposition is shown in figure 16 a central property of gksl dynamics with
multiple asymptotic states derived in 18 and discussed there and in 19 is the nontrivial
quantum geometric tensor over ashs  that emerges and the dependence that the dynamics
exhibits on the qgt notably different shapes of the asymptotic subspace exhibit different
geometric signatures thus computational operations which mix different dfs states will have
a different quantum geometric signature than noncomputational operations in light of the
decomposition of computational operations into noncomputational and pure computational
operations this also means that each of these parts will exhibit distinct quantum geometric
signatures which can identify the computational and noncomputational part as an added
benefit we expect this decomposition to provide additional intuition for the distinction mentioned above between landauers principle and the fundamental theorem the discussion of
this will be provided in much greater detail in the forthcoming work examining the quantum
geometric properties of rc operations in general
beyond simply distinguishing between computational and noncomputational operations
the discussion in 213 highlights how essential it is to distinguish between the different types
of computational operations  deterministic irreversible deterministic reversible stochastic
irreversible and stochastic reversible as further discussed in 214 these types of operations
are themselves comprised of a set of primitive computational state transitions namely the
bijections merges and splits as discussed in figure 5 as such in order to understand the
representations of the different types of reversible and indeed irreversible classical operations we must first find a representation of these different types of operations although the
nature of bijections and merges is somewhat selfevident the case of splits must be handled
with slightly more care since they can be generally expected to result in temporary coherences which will typically quickly decohere as with the decomposition of computational
operations these will in all likelihood exhibit distinct quantum geometric signatures in lieu
of the quantum geometric signatures of different asymptotic subspaces discussed in 1819
along with the previouslymentioned issues regarding quantum geometric signatures of rc
operations the discussion of this will be addressed in the forthcoming work centering on the
quantum geometric properties of reversible computing operations more broadly
54 of 68
figure 16 decomposition of a computational operation left into a noncomputational part middle which commutes with
the dfs structure that distinguishes different computational states and a pure computational part right which contains all
of the information regarding the transfer of states between different dfs blocks and thus all of the information regarding
the computational part of the operation notably because the quantum geometric tensor of ashs  as a single space has a
different shape than that of ashs  as a dfs sum the qgt of each of these will naturally be distinct as well as such the
noncomputational part of a computational operation will have a different measurable quantum geometric signature to the pure
computational part of a computational operation
4 discussion
41 essential consistency of the classic rc formulation with neqt
an important highlevel conclusion supported by this paper is that there is no inconsistency between the simple classic formulation of landauers principle and reversible computing that we reviewed in 3233 and a more detailed treatment based on neqt indeed no
such inconsistency is possible since as we showed the classic formulation can be presented
in a form that makes no equilibrium assumptions whatsoever the only assumptions we
made there were the fundamental unitarity of the underlying quantum evolution which is
also assumed by all of quantum thermodynamics and the treatment of the environment as
immediately thermalizing all ejected information which is equivalent to the markov assumption underlying gksl dynamics as discussed in 35 therefore the more detailed neqt
formulations cannot negate the basic results of 3233 and indeed we showed how to draw
explicit correspondences between a more detailed treatment of classical reversible computing
based on generalized ctos and multiple asymptotic states in gksl and the simpler model
of 21 on which the basic results of 3233 can be based we next discuss a few specific
aspects of this correspondence in more detail
42 cto representations of reversible computing and system boundaries
in 34 we discussed the representation of quantum mechanical models of reversible
computing in terms of the general cto 10 specifically we identified the landauer reset
brq applied to a subsystem q as coming from the interaction between q and a
potentials v
distinct separate subsystem p where q and p are both subsystems of the overall system s
were examining in our to this analysis reinforces the importance of properly drawing the
system boundaries as discussed in 40
the specifics of where we choose to draw the boundaries between each subsystem or
between the overall system and the environment plays a vital role in being able to properly
identify the reset protocol of a system bearing computational degrees of freedom properly
drawing the boundaries makes the distinction as to whether a given reset protocol is a landauer
reset protocol per se or not in 40 we have the example of the reset of a system p coupled to a
copy  referent subsystem q which stores the same computational state as p before reset the
set of transformations on s in this case are given by inp  inq in 1 7 rp  iq in 1 
comparing these to expressions 21 22 and 28 we see that identifying p as the reset
55 of 68
system is commensurate with the landauer reset definitions whereas identifying pq as the
reset system doesnt count as landauer reset specifically identifying p as the reset system
this corresponds to conditional landauer reset
in precisely the same way identifying the system boundaries is essential to representing
reset processes as ctos the cto expression 10 requires a specific shape for the starting
and ending states namely that the overall system s be subdivided into a subsystem p which
locally undergoes the state transformation inp 7 fp and a subsystem q which locally
returns to the same state thus properly identifying the system boundaries plays a vital role
in identifying the effect of the global universal cptp map as a catalytic thermal operation or
some other kind of operation this dependence on system boundaries is indeed a general
feature of resource theories 27 thus when applying the results of rtqt to analyzing
landauer reset protocols and formulating bounds on quantities of interest it is vital to specify
the subsystem boundaries properly these boundaries affect whether or not we can properly
classify a reset as a landauer reset whether or not we can properly classify a cptp map as a
cto and whether or not we can properly relate these two incidentally we saw a specific
example of this earlier in 34 this dependence is what constrained the reset potentials to be
implemented by a separate cataylst subsystem within s as a whole
43 applicability of the markov approximation to reversible computing
the markov approximation has substantial consequences for the kinds of dynamics we
consider over all of u which are worth comparing to our quantum mechanical model of
computing systems in doing so we explicitly preclude the possibility of fluctuations that
can take information from s to e during an intermediate time period and then have that
information return to s at time t  dt instead this assumption is equivalent to saying that
any information that is ejected from the system to the environment cannot be returned to the
system we might be concerned that this might represent an artificial type of information
loss in our model that comes from imposing a limitation on the types of processes we consider
which does not reflect computational systems in the real world in fact the opposite is true
this assumption matches perfectly with our understanding of the thermalization of ejected
correlated information from s
in 32 and 9 we saw that the entropy increase due to landauer reset was a consequence
of the thermalization of mutual information ejected into the environment in particular the
thermalization of entropy ejected into the environment occurs at a time frame much faster than
our ability to capture the dynamics of the system thus in our model the role of fluctuations
between s and e originating from s is suppressed the effect of perturbative fluctuations
looks identical to the effect of environment perturbations this is exactly the kind of behavior
we expect for a system s bearing computational degrees of freedom in a larger open system
evolution the system has no practical way of tracking mutual information that is transferred
to the environment at a given time and then is transferred from the environment back to the
system at a later time any perturbations arising from information that originated from s at
an earlier time appears to s as indistinguishable from perturbations due to e this is also true
for models of computation where the computational degrees of freedom reside in a subsystem
p being acted on by one or more orthogonal subsystems qi of s a crucial part of the model
is that neither p nor any of the qi s are able to track information after it has been ejected
into e and indeed this is a completely physically realistic framework thus the markov
assumption in addition to being a vital calculational tool to retrieve closed form expressions
also represents the realworld dynamics of the system

44 relationship to the stochastic thermodynamics of computation
the stochastic thermodynamics of computation 8100 is a framework for examining the
entropy cost of classical computational systems that has gained substantial prominence in
recent years as such an important question is the relationship between this framework and
the neqt framework and results given in 22122222 which we discuss here
in the stochastic thermodynamics of information the thermodynamic properties of
classical computational systems are examined 8 from the point of view of purely classical
information theory relying on the properties of the continuous probability distributions
of classical random variables that arise therein in this approach classical computation is
represented as a continuoustime markov chain ctmc represented by a directed acyclic
graph dag which in turn represents a set of functions over a given boolean string s  0 1n
of length n then in the stochastic thermodynamics of information framework the entropy
cost of transitions is calculated by examining the difference in the classical relative entropies
ie the kullbackleibler divergences of the ctmc distribution relative to an arbitrary
distribution before and after a single set of state evolutions along the graph this framework
explicitly does not consider the perspective from quantum information theory36 in contrast
with the representation of classical computation in terms of quantum channels eg as in
17101104 instead the thermodynamic properties of computation are derived solely from
examining the entropy production and entropy flow rates of probability distributions which
evolve under this ctmc representation
despite avoiding the quantum information representation for classical computation
and indeed for nonequilibrium dynamics we would expect no differences whatsoever
in the conclusions we get from this framework compared to the framework focusing on
quantum information theory at its core the technique of correlation engineering 912 relies
on performing operations on correlated systems in such a way as to minimize the mutual
information buildup and to make the helmholtz free energy cost of the transition arbitrarily
small as discussed in 221 although 912 and the discussion in 221 have focused on
quantities such as the quantum mutual information the principles of correlation engineering
are in fact completely oblivious to whether the correlations and mutual information quantities
are classical or quantum in nature indeed since the examination in these works of the
effect of correlations on overall entropic cost do not rely on whether or not the system state
commutes with the thermal reference state or the hamiltonian we can freely substitute
classical information quantities such as the kullbackleibler divergence and retrieve valid
statements for correlation engineering of classical thermodynamic systems37
for individual systems in isolation this is precisely what we find the stochastic thermodynamics of computation is completely able to reproduce the results regarding the distinctions
between logical and thermodynamic reversibility found earlier in 2313 specifically the
nowfamous result in those works that logically irreversible operations such as erasure of
a single isolated bit or computational system can be nevertheless thermodynamically reversible has also been reproduced in 8100 this reflects our exact point about the proper
interpretation of landauers principle that we elaborated upon in 32 which is that erasing
bits in isolation when they contain mutual information with other bits results in thermodynamic irreversibility and an amount of entropy increase corresponding to the loss of mutual
information
nevertheless the subject of extending the framework of the stochastic thermodynamics
of computation to correlated systems appears to remain a matter of controversy in particular
in the words of 8 directly this paper will not consider the thermodynamics of quantum mechanical information processing or indeed any aspect of
quantum computation
indeed this precise property is the insight underlying the ordering and thermomajorization curve technique in 29
57 of 68
the example of the thermodynamic reversibility of erasure of a single bit in isolation has
been used to argue that a correlated system cannot realize operations that are both logically
and thermodynamically reversible to within a mutual information difference of   r  as
given in 14 here it appears that the misunderstanding has persisted due to confusing
the matter of isolated versus correlated systems the example in 2313 and reproduced in
8100 continues to focus on the case of an isolated system whereas 9101240 highlight that
correlation engineering relies entirely on reducing the correlation buildup between systems
and applying operations in a way that does not increase the net entropy flow from the overall
system38
it must be emphasized again there is no fundamental disagreement between the results
calculated in 9101240 indeed there cannot be since all of these paths start with precisely
the same set of fundamental assumptions about the underlying dynamics of the system ie
that the dynamics are described by some cptp map which we can express in terms of a larger
subspace as per the stinespring dilation theorem thus although some of the conclusions in
8100 seem to disagree with the consensus of 910121640 this is only a matter of mistaken
identity 8100 has erroneously drawn conclusions about correlated systems from a valid
calculation about the thermodynamic reversibility of a logically irreversible process applied
to an isolated system furthermore although some of the conclusions of 8100 may be drawn
from a mistaken conflation between the properties of isolated and correlated systems it is
worth reemphasizing that the underlying techniques in these works remain completely valid
indeed the stochastic thermodynamics of computation may nevertheless serve as a useful
additional tool to examine correlation engineering of correlated systems39
45 thermodynamically reversible transformations of extended systems
an appropriate caveat to landauers principle could be to mention that even a correlated
state in a computer could in principle be erased in a thermodynamically reversible way if
rather than erasing bits in isolation we instead considered the full space of all possible thermodynamic transformations but what in detail would a concrete protocol for accomplishing
such a transformation look like one such protocol would be to simply unwind the correlations
by running in reverse a reversible computation that could have computed those correlations
in the first place thereby leaving us potentially with an array of independently random input
bits that could then each be thermodynamically reversibly erased in isolation from each other
but note that the existence of protocols such as this one doesnt refute the need for reversible
computing since the protocol itself uses reversible computing to begin with
fundamentally if we wish to be able to construct complex computational processes by
composing them out of local primitive transformations which operate locally on part of the
full computational state then by definition those primitives cannot operate monolithically
on the state of the entire extended system and thus they must be logically reversible if we
wish to avoid entropy increase in the face of the kind of nonlocal correlations which naturally
arise as a matter of course in typical large computations this is not to say that some
radically different alternative basis for computation that was not based on local computational
primitives at all would necessarily be impossible to develop but until that has been done
reversible computing remains the most promising and welldeveloped available avenue
towards performing general digital computing in a thermodynamically efficient way
somewhat more confusingly ixb in 8 appears to use this example to claim that correlated systems cannot realize such operations however example
6 in vb in 8 appears to use a general argument to verify that logically irreversible operations on correlated systems cannot be made thermodynamically
reversible when each irreversible operation is at the subsystem level this is precisely the same principle used in 9101240 the source of the internal
disagreement in 8 remains unclear
this further reinforces how delicate the issue of system boundaries is as discussed in 40
58 of 68
that being said exploration of alternative protocols for thermodynamically efficient
computing may someday also be worthwhile one conceptual example of such an alternative is
illustrated by 105 in which a chaotic dynamical system whose strange attractor is engineered
to encode the state of an extended boolean circuit is monolithically transformed adiabatically
from an old state to a new state of the entire circuit all at once this example illustrates that
thermodynamically efficient alternatives to performing computations via a sequence of local
logically reversible transformations do in fact exist this example even still preserves a kind
of compositionality albeit at a different level in the sense that the structure of the extended
system is still composed out of local interaction hamiltonians representing boolean logical
constraints even though the transformation of the system is monolithic
so the existence of the example of 105 could be cited as partial vindication of assertions
that reversible computing via local transformations is not necessarily the only way to accomplish
digital computation in a thermodynamically efficient way however the results of 105 appear
to suggest that the penalty for nonlocal operation of digital machines is to incur an exponential
increase in time complexitywhich in retrospect is not surprising since otherwise one could
use methods based on 105 to solve npcomplete problems using only polynomial resources
so it may still be the case that reversible computing remains the only physically possible way
to achieve thermodynamically efficient digital computation with only modest ie polynomial
resource overheads
we should also note in passing that apart from 105 many other more analog approaches to physical computing with dynamical systems also exist see 42 of 106 for a
survey as with 105 the evolution of other more analog kinds of conservative dynamical
systems that may be useful for computing could also conceivably be engineered to approach
thermodynamic reversibility although most existing analog computing schemes have not
been specifically designed to do so
46 future directions
although providing a valuable framework both theoretically and for our purposes in
modeling reversible computation the structure of gksl systems with multiple asymptotic
states 1719 leaves several questions remaining these questions are of great interest to
the theory of open quantum systems generally and also offer substantial insights for open
quantum systems models of reversible computing one important question is the question of
energy dissipation for generic nonequilibrium protocols the notion of thermodynamic length
has been developed 107 for gksl systems with single asymptotic states minimization of
this length provides a characterization of the minimal dissipation of the time evolution of a
hamiltonian in an open quantum system meanwhile general thermodynamic uncertainty
relations have also been developed 108 for single asymptotic states these provide a general
set of uncertainty relations between the currents of a system in an asymptotic state and the
entropy production rate of the system in terms of the information geometric metric ie the
fisher information on nonequilibrium asymptotic states extending these notions to multiple
asymptotic states can help us develop expressions of energy dissipation for time evolving
systems for multiple asymptotic states in order to characterize the efficiency of reversible
information processing operations were interested in the dissipation as a function of delay
d d for reversible computing in an open quantum system multiple asymptotic state
framework we want to be able to characterize the minimal dissipation for any hamiltonian
we might want to write that can represent the model were using for a reversible computer
fundamentally both the dissipation and delay will depend quite fundamentally and
intrinsically on the underlying geometry of the asymptotic states from the derivation of an
adiabatic ie berrylike curvature on the space induced by asymptotic states 1819 we
can immediately anticipate that the expression for thermodynamic length in open quantum
59 of 68
systems will depend intricately on this induced curvature given that quantum speeds for
gksl systems are expressed through a suitable metric on the information geometry of states
109 we can expect that the delay can be derived similarly40 by relating the information
geometry metric tensor with the qgt we can derive expressions for the delay and in turn the
dissipation in terms of the qgt this can then provide us with dissipation as a function of
delay
the development of d d will involve as intermediate steps several quantities which
will be of interest to the open quantum systems community as a whole such as the thermodynamic length and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for gksl systems with multiple
asymptotic states these will be essential for understanding properties of open quantum
systems which have direct bearing on classical reversible computing operations the bearing
that these properties will have on rc operations per se also depends on the particulars of how
rc operations are represented in open quantum systems we have here provided some of
the initial groundwork for these representations but several specific details which are vital
for understanding rc operations and the application of open quantum system properties to
rc remain to be developed in full here we have identified several key remaining details 
specifically the quantum geometric signature that different rc operations will have the representations of merges and splits in the framework of gksl dynamics with multiple asymptotic
states and the specific timescale under which the result of a computational operation dephases
to retrieve the dfs sum structure characteristic of classical rc operations these details are
currently being developed in a forthcoming work but they are likely not an exhaustive list of
the specific characteristics of open quantum systems representations of rc operations
5 conclusions
at this time much work remains to complete the task of fully fleshing out a useful
physical theory of classical reversible computing based on the tools of modern quantum
thermodynamics and quantum information our goal in this article was to lay some key
conceptual foundations for that effort point the way towards further progress that can be
made and review some important preliminary results
our primary conclusion thus far from this line of work is that the core insights from
the classic theory of the thermodynamics of computing which originally motivated the field
of reversible computing rather than being contradicted by the modern nonequilibrium
quantum thermodynamics perspective are to the contrary supported by it we argued
that the most appropriate understanding of landauers principle is as a statement about
the absolute increase in total entropy that is required when correlated information is lost
and reviewed the theorems showing that only computational operations that are fully or
conditionally logically reversible can avoid such increases when applied to subsystems that
exhibit correlations to other subsystems as is normal for subsystems that contain computed
information in addition we provided a complementary way of seeing conditional and
unconditional landauer reset in terms of catalytic thermal operations which helps shed
some light on the underlying nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic principles at play
distinguishing the reset processes
even in its early stages of development the gksl dynamical perspective on computational operations in open quantum systems is already showing quite surprising implications
of interest both on a purely theoretical level as well as for applications to reversible computing
models in particular we see that the quantum geometric properties of the space supporting
rc operations play a central role in governing these operations and the dynamics of systems
to elaborate slightly note that the delay is not necessarily directly bounded by the quantum speed limit which is defined in terms of dynamical energy
invested not energy dissipated however we can expect that the derivation of the delay will still involve considerations of the speed limit to the extent that
dissipation can be bounded as a fraction of the dynamical energy
60 of 68
supporting reversible computation this offers a tantalizing glimpse into the rich geometrical
structure which underpins and can help support rc operations and suggests that the discovery of these signatures generally can support reversible computational operations in exotic
structures much more work remains to be done in teasing out the geometric structure of rc
operations with implications of substantial interest both to reversible computing engineering
and the theory of open quantum systems generally
in conclusion we see that there is a potentially enormous longterm practical value to
be gained through seriously studying the limits and potentialities of physical mechanisms
designed to efficiently implement reversible computational processes with an eye towards
making technologies for general digital computing far more efficient in this article we have
reviewed a number of key theoretical tools from modern nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics which we believe will be useful for continuing this line of work and investigating
the physics of reversible computing in more depth we intend to continue this effort in future

appendix a minimumenergy scaling for classical adiabatic technologies
in this appendix we briefly present the derivation for the scaling of minimum energy
dissipation for reversible technologies such as racmos 231 that obey classic adiabatic
scaling and that can be characterized in terms of relaxation and equilibration timescales41
first we assume as is the case for perfectly adiabatic technologies such as 30 that
the total energy dissipation per clock cycle ediss in a reversible circuit can be expressed as a
sum of switching losses and leakage losses
ediss  esw  elk 
and further that switching and leakage losses depend on the signal energy esig and transition
time ttr approximately as follows
ttr
ttr
elk  esig  clk  
esw  esig  csw 
note that this particular scaling analysis does not extend to families of technologies that may potentially offer some approximation to a landauzener
type of exponential quantum adiabatic scaling such as rqca see 233
62 of 68
where r  e are the relaxation and equilibration timescales respectively and csw  clk are small
dimensionless constants characteristic of a particular reversible circuit in a specific family of
technologies such as 30 in practice although these specific formulas are only approximate
they approach exactness in the regime r fi ttr fi e 
then now treating a2a3 as exact we can write
ediss  esig csw r 
 lk  ttr 
ttr
we can collect the constants absorbing them into adjusted timescales r0  csw r and e0 
e clk  so
0 1
ediss  esig r 
 0  ttr 
ttr
setting the derivative of a5 with respect to ttr equal to zero we find that ediss is minimized
when
r0 2  0 
ttr
or in other words when
ttr 
r0 e0 
at which point esw and elk are equal the minimum energy dissipation per cycle is then
ediss  2esig
thus for any given reversible circuit design in a family of technologies with given values
of the constants csw  clk  in order for ediss to approach 0 as the technology develops we must
have that the ratio of equilibrationrelaxation timescales e r   and if the relaxation
timescale r is fixed this implies that also the minimumenergy value of the transition time
ttr   these requirements were mentioned in 231
more specifically in order to increase the peak energy efficiency of a reversible circuit
by a factor of n  in a given family of technologies obeying classic adiabatic scaling this
requires that the timescale ratio e r must be increased by n 2  and assuming r is fixed
the transition time ttr for minimum energy will increase by n 
appendix b vectorization of the operator algebra on quantum states
in ordinary quantum mechanics expressions such as 52 56 and 60 can be easily
solved using operator algebra techniques this same principle holds for operators which
operate on other operators eg l operates on density matrices   dhs  known as
superoperators since the space of l2 bounded operators
d bh
es  forms
h aihilbert space in
b b
b  the exact same
its own right under the hilbertschmidt inner product a b  tr a
operator algebra techniques can be applied to examining superoperators
a simple way of explicitly writing down these techniques for the l2 bounded operators
is using the process of vectorization which we very briefly discuss here following the excellent
presentation in 19 succinctly vectorization is the process of rewriting matrices in fm  n
as vectors in fmn via the mapping vihw 7 vi  wi here f is the field r or c that
the matrices live over in terms of a basis bi iin 1 of hs  the vectorization of an operator
b  bhs  appears as
b   ci bi i 7  aii 
c i  bi i 
63 of 68
as a concrete example the vectorization of a 2  2 matrix appears as
 b 
the doubleket notation for vectorized matrices acts largely the same as the familiar dirac
notation42

b is given by  a
 the hermitian adjoint of  a

b  tr a
 the hilbertschmidt inner product is given by a
b is given by 1 a
 thus the trace of a
 the basis bi iin 1 of bhs  gives a corresponding basis of bhs  bij
  bi i b j 
 from this structure changing the basis of hs changes the basis of bhs  and thus the
b  bhs  and the superoperaexplicit decompositions of the vectorized operators a
tors  
however the basis change in hs directly reflects a basis change in bhs  transforming
bi i 7 ci i directly corresponds to the transformation bij  bi i b j 7 cij  ci i c j 
thus we dont need any extra information in the transformation everything can be
expressed entirely in terms of what lives in bhs  without needing to further reference
hs 
 an additional complication that doesnt appear with ordinary hilbert spaces is the operator
algebra structure bhs   bhs   bhs  thus we need to describe the vectorized
