abstractwe investigated inductive power transfer ipt
through a rectangular slab of saltwater our inductivelycoupled
transmitters and receivers were made from loopgap resonators
lgrs having resonant frequencies near 100 mhz electric fields
are confined within the narrow gaps of the lgrs making it
possible to strongly suppress the power dissipation associated
with electric fields in a conductive medium therefore the power
transfer efficiency in our system was limited by magnetic field
dissipation in the conducting medium we measured the power
transfer efficiency as a function of both the conductivity of
the water and the resonant frequency of the lgrs we also
present an equivalent circuit model that can be used to model
ipt through a conductive medium finally we show that using
dividers to partition the saltwater volume provides another means
of enhancing power transfer efficiency

i i ntroduction
loopgap resonators lgrs are electricallysmall highq
resonators that can be used to make sensitive measurements
of the electromagnetic em properties of materials at rf
and microwave frequencies 1 2 shown in fig 1a the
cylindrical lgr clgr consists of a conducting tube with
a narrow slit cut along its length this structure can be
accurately modeled as a series lrc circuit the effective
capacitance and inductance are determined by the geometry of
the resonator gap and bore respectively currents run along the
inner surface of the lgr bore and power dissipation associated
with both conductive and radiative losses contribute to the
resontors effective resistance 1 3 radiative losses can be
suppressed by joining the two ends of the clgr to form a
toroid that confines the magnetic fields 4 a schematic of
the toroidal lgr tlgr is shown in fig 1b parts c
and d of fig 1 show crosssectional views of the clgr
and tlgr with the important dimensions labeled part d
of the figure also shows a coupling loop suspended within
the bore of the tlgr the coupling loop is made by shortcircuiting the center conductor of a coaxial cable to the outer
conductor and is used to inductively couple signals into and
out of the resonator in the same way clgrs can be excited
and probed by placing coupling loops near the ends of the
resonator bore 5
we thank nserc for providing funding for this project
in this section we give a simple description of how lgrs
can be used to make sensitive measurements of the complex
permittivity and conductivity of materials the resonant frequency 0 and the resonator quality factory q0 are modified
by the electrical properties of materials placed in the lgr
gap current flow across the lgr gap has two components
1 a displacement current that depends on the permittivity of
the material and 2 charge transfer via a conduction current
that depends on the conductivity of the material
the gap admittance is given by yg  jr c0  rx1 
where  is angular frequency r  0  j00 is the complex
permittivity of the gap material c0 is the capacitance of the
gap when it is empty and rx is the resistance due to the
gap geometry and the conductivity  of the gap material
expressing rx1  at  c0 0  where a is the gap area
and 0 is the permittivity of free space allows one to write
yg   j   
c0 
assuming radiative losses have been suppressed using either
a clgr with an em shield or a tlgr
pthe effective resistance
of the lgr can be written as r  r0 0  where r0 is the
resistance at the resonant frequency 0 of the empty resonator
and the  12 frequency dependence is due to the skin depth
 in this case the impedance of the lgr with a filled gap
becomes z  r1  jl0  jc1  where

and 0  1 l0 c0 is the resonant frequency of the empty

therefore measurements of 0 and q0 with the lgr gap
empty followed by measurements of 1 and q1 with the gap
filled can be combined with 4 and 5 to determine 0 and
00  1 0  if either of the 00 or  loss terms are dominant
as is often the case then either 0 and 00 or 0 and  can
be independently determined this type of analysis has been
used to study the em properties of air water saltwater liquid
nitrogen and methyl alcohol 3 6
it is also worth noting that in an analogous way the
magnetic properties of materials can be investigated by filling
the bore of a lgr with the material of interest 712
iii i nductive p ower t ransfer
more recently we have developed efficient midrange inductive power transfer ipt systems using lgr transmitters and
receivers 13 the term midrange implies wireless energy
exchange over distances that are several times the largest
dimension of the transmitterreceiver 14 15 figures 2a
and b show the experimental setups of the clgr and tlgr
ipt systems respectively in these figures power is transferred
wirelessly through a slab of saltwater in the case of the tlgr
system the transmit and receive resonators are formed by
dividing a complete tlgr with resonant frequency 0 into
two equal halves this division of the of the tlgr does not
significantly alter the flow or distribution of charge in the
structures and results in a pair of identical splittlgrs with
resonant frequencies approximately equal to 0 
compared to helical and spiral resonators typically used in
ipt systems lgrs have the advantage that they allow for
some shaping of the em fields in the space surrounding the
powertransfer link specifically electric fields are strongly
confined to the narrow gap of the lgrs for ipt through
a conductive medium such as saltwater this is an important
advantage because excluding the conducting medium from
the gap region effectively eliminates electric field power
dissipation which is proportional to e 2  filling the gap with a
lowloss dielectric such as teflon or al2 o3  is a simple way
to isolate the electric fields in the gap from the conducting
medium for ipt through a conductive medium there will
also be power losses associated with the oscillating magnetic
fields we consider this source of dissipation in section iv
the splittlgr system has the additional advantage that
the magnetic field strength outside the resonators is weak
everywhere except between the transmitter and receiver 13
this field configuration limits the exposure of nearby individuals to em fields which is especially important in highpower applications for power transfer through a conducting
medium the clgr configuration has magnetic power dissipation throughout the entire volume of space surrounding the
pair of resonators in contrast for the tlgr configuration the
magnetic field dissipation is primarily confined to the spatial
volume directly between the bores of the transmit and receive
resonators

we now present an approximate calculation of the power
dissipation expected from an oscillating magnetic field in a
conducting medium although not rigorous the results identify
parameters that are important for practical designs figure 3
shows an example of a transmit or receive resonator immersed
in a medium of uniform conductivity  although the figure
shows a clgr the calculations that follow can be applied to
both the clgr and splittlgr geometries
fig 2 photographs of ipt through a 37cm thick slab of saltwater for both the a clgr and b splittlgr systems the coarse and fine dividers used
with the splittlgr system are also shown in b the 102 m gaps in the clgrs are so narrow that they are not clearly visibile in the photograph
current loop of fig 3 is given by
p  e 2 g  2 r3 02 b02 x sin2 0 t dr dx
fig 3 schematic of the geometry used to estimate the magnetic power
dissipated by the conducting medium
we assume an oscillating magnetic field of the form
bx  b0 x cos 0 t where 0 is the resonant frequency of
the lgr the xaxis is chosen to coincide with the axis of
the lgr bore in any plane perpendicular to the xaxis b0 is
assumed to be uniform for r  r0 and zero for r  r0  here
r is the radial distance measured from the xaxis and r0 is the
radius of the lgr bore in the region between the transmit and
receive resonators b0 will initially decrease as it moves away
from the transmit resonator and then increase as it approaches
the receive resonator the power dissipation is estimated by
first finding the induced emf e around a circular loop of radius
r due to the changing magnetic flux we then estimate the
resistance along the path followed by the resulting current
next the power dissipation associated with each infinitesimal
current loop is calculated finally the contributions from all
current loops within a plane of width dx are summed
consider the infinitesimal ring of inner radius r  r0 
outer radius r  dr and width dx as shown in fig 3 the
magnetic flux  through the ring induces a current i which
flows along the circumference of the ring and through a crosssectional area given by dr dx therefore the conductance of
this infinitesimal ring is g   dr dx 2r the induced
emf e is calculated from ddt which in the assumed
geometry is approximately e  r2 0 b0 x sin 0 t as a
result the power dissipation associated with the infinitesimal
the power dissipated by all current loops in a disk of
thickness dx is obtained by integrating p with respect to r
from zero to r0  the radial range over which b0 x is assumed
to be nonzero and constant evaluating this integral and taking
a time average over one period yields
fiz r0
hdp i 
p  16 r04 02 b02 x dx
finding the total power dissipated in the space between the
transmit and receive resonators requires an integration with
respect to x and a suitable model for the spatial dependence
of b0 x
fortunately 7 already reveals a number of useful insights
first the magnetic power dissipated by the conductive medium
is proportional to the conductivity  second for a fixed
conductivity power dissipation can be reduced by decreasing
either 0 or r0  in section v we describe a set of experiments
designed to separately test each one of these inferences we
first note that since 0  1r0  the frequency can be decreased
by increasing the size of the lgr 1 3 however this is
not a good strategy because magnetic power loss varies by
r04 which is much more significant than the 02 dependence
shown in 7 instead it is best to design the lgr to be as
small as possible and then lower the resonant frequency by
filling the gap with a lowloss and highpermittivity dielectric
a potential dielectric material for the capacitive gap is mgdoped ba sr tio3 which can simultaneously have very low
loss tangents and relative permittivities as high as 103 16

fig 4 peak s21  as a function of conductivity the horizontal dashed lines are placed at 3 db the vertical dotted lines indicate the critical conductivity
of the various systems investigated a clgr ipt with the system resonant frequency tuned to three different values the critical conductivity decreases with
increasing frequency b tlgr ipt with and without dividers used to suppress induced current loops in the saltwater the solid line is a fit to the circuit
model shown in fig 5
sheets of acrylic and epoxy was used to contain the saltwater
the tank was 440 mm thick and made using acrylic sheets
that were 37 mm thick the width and height of the tank were
large enough that the magnetic field linking the transmit and
receive resonators passed through the 366mm thick saltwater
slab
the design details of the lgrs are described elsewhere 13 however we note that with a teflon dielectric
filling the gaps the resonant frequencies of the clgrs and
splittlgrs were 100 mhz and 120 mhz respectively
for both the clgr and splittlgr systems data was
collected as follows first the water tank was filled with
1 l of deionized water with a base resistivity of 154 m cm
the lgr transmitter and receiver were then placed in contact
with the two sides of the tank and the coupling loops were
tuned to achieve optimal power transfer efficiency next the
vna was used to record an s21  frequency sweep and the
conductivity of the water was measured using a beckman rc16c conductivity bridge this procedure was repeated as nacl
was added to the water in small amounts at a time for each
concentration of nacl the salt was allowed to completely
dissolve and the tuning of the coupling loops was refined
before acquiring the data
figures 4a and b show the peak value of s21  in decibels
as a function of conductivity for the clgr and splittlgr
ipt systems respectively for all of the various datasets
shown peak s21  is approximately flat at low conductivity
before dropping off steeply above a critical conductivity that
we denote c  qualitatively this behaviour can be understood
in terms of the equivalent circuit model of a fourcoil ipt
system shown in fig 5 in this circuit rt and rr represent
the intrinsic effective resistances of the lgrs and r accounts
fig 5 an equivalent circuit model of a fourcoil ipt system operating in a
conducting medium the signal source has output impedance z0 and supplies
voltage vs and z is the load impedance the resistance r divides the
induced emf between the transmitterreceiver resonators and the conducting
medium
for additional magnetic losses due to the saltwater at low
conductivity rt  rr fl r and s21  is approximately independent of  however above c  r dominates and the s21 
peak drops as  is increased the solid line in fig 4b is a fit
to the splittlgr data using a model for s21  calculated from
the equivalent circuit the fit assumed r  a where a is
the only free fit parameter and depends on the experimental
geometry the other circuit parameters were obtained from a
separate analysis of the splittlgr system when transmitting
power across an air gap 13 the fit is excellent and returned
a bestfit value of a  581  007  102 2 m
a power transfer efficiency versus frequency
the clgr and splittlgrs were each made from two
identical halves that bolt together to form the complete res
onator the dashed line in fig 1a indicates the conducting
joint in the clgr inserting thin strips of copper tape
each 89 m thick between this joint provided a simple way
of increasing the gap dimension t thereby decreasing the
capacitance while making only a negligible change to r0 and
the inductance this strategy combined with extracting the
teflon dielectric from the gap was implemented to increase
the operating frequency of the clgr ipt link above the
base frequency of 100 mhz while keeping the resonator size
2 r0  w fixed figure 4a shows the peak s21  as a
function of conductivity for three different clgr resonant
frequencies as seen from the frequency dependence of the
critical conductivity c  the system performance degrades as
ipt operating frequency is increased this observation is
consistent with 7 and the analysis presented in section iv
b suppressing largeradius current loops
finally we repeated the peak s21  versus  measurements
for the splittlgr system after inserting dividers into the
saltwater bath the dividers were used to partition the saltwater
in an effort to suppress largeradius current loops equation
7 suggests that the magnetic power dissipation is a strong
function of r0  the maximum radius of the induced current
loops therefore using dividers to reduce the average size of
the current loops is expected to enhance the ipt efficiency
the semitransparent lines in fig 1d indicate the position
of the coarse divider used in our experiments the coarse divider made from thin plastic strips is also shown in fig 2b
the circular data points in fig 4b show peak s21  as a
function of  when the coarse divider was in place as anticipated the power transfer efficiency improved and c doubled
from 075 1 m1 without a divider to 15 1 m1 with
the coarse divider we repeated the measurements using a fine
divider also shown in fig 2b made by stacking and gluing
sheets of corrugated plastic with parallel 35 mm  35 mm
channels to get the saltwater to penetrate into the narrow
channels 5 ml of dish soap was added to act as a surfactant
we first verified that the added soap did not alter the s21 
versus  data with no divider in place as shown in fig 4b
the fine divider caused c to increase to 20 1 m1  at a
conductivity of 50 1 m1  typical of seawater the coarse
and fine dividers improved the peak power transfer efficiency
by 34 and 66 db respectively
vi c onclusion
we have demonstrated ipt through saltwater using lgr
transmitters and receivers below a critical conductivity c 
dissipation is dominated by losses that are intrinsic to the
lgrs however above c  magnetic power dissipation by
the saltwater becomes important and the power transfer efficiency rapidly drops we showed that the critical conductivity
increases as the lgr resonant frequency is decreased for a
resonator of fixed size using dividers to partition the saltwater
volume we found that restricting the size of the induced
current loops in the conducting medium provided another
means to enhance the power transfer efficiency all of these
observations are consistent with an approximate calculation of
the expected magnetic power dissipation due to a conducting
medium our results suggest that the highest efficiency will be
achieved by simultaneously minimizing the resonator size and
resonant frequency for lgrs these design criteria are best
met by filling the narrow gap of the resonators with a highr
and lowloss dielectric
we are currently experimenting with lgr transmitters
and receivers equipped with watertight seals used to exclude
saltwater from the gaps and bores of the resonators the seals
allow us to completely submerge the lgrs in a saltwater
bath and work with testbeds that more closely replicate the
conditions expected in practical applications
