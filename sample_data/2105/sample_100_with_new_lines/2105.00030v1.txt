of controlled vocabularies or standards and so on these tasks
vary and depend on the type of data being curated the scope
and focus of the organization doing the curation and the
designated community the curators seek to serve 68 chao
cragin and palmer 9 derive a typology of data curation
concepts activities and terms through a qualitative study of
earth science researchers and show how the typology can
support cost analysis of different curatorial activities however
further work is needed to examine the efficacy of these tasks
across different data types and to empirically demonstrate the
costs and benefits of the activities to a repository and a user
community
the use of project management systems eg jira asana
trello in largescale curatorial settings presents us with a
rich potential data source to study curatorial actions through
routine use of systems such as jira data curators at icpsr
generate a corpus documenting data curation work and the
frequency of specific curatorial activities these data offer an
abundant source of information about the impact and efficacy
of different curatorial processes and given their scale and
structure computational methods are useful for analyzing
them icpsr adopted jira to facilitate existing work practices

the escience community has called for improved data
social sciences data archive the interuniversity consortium
for political and social research icpsr at the university of curation tools and analysis to support new ways of doing
michigan we ask 1 what are the main tasks of curatorial work science 11 digital data archives like icpsr are critical

abstractthis paper describes a machine learning approach
for annotating and analyzing data curation work logs at icpsr
a large social sciences data archive the systems we studied
track curation work and coordinate team decisionmaking at
icpsr repository staff use these systems to organize prioritize
and document curation work done on datasets making them
promising resources for studying curation work and its impact
on data reuse especially in combination with data usage analytics
a key challenge however is classifying similar activities so that
they can be measured and associated with impact metrics this
paper contributes 1 a schema of data curation activities 2
a computational model for identifying curation actions in work
log descriptions and 3 an analysis of frequent data curation
activities at icpsr over time we first propose a schema of
data curation actions to help us analyze the impact of curation
work we then use this schema to annotate a set of data curation
logs which contain records of data transformations and project
management decisions completed by repository staff finally we
train a text classifier to detect the frequency of curation actions
in a large set of work logs our approach supports the analysis of
curation work documented in work log systems as an important
step toward studying the relationship between research data
curation and data reuse
index termsdata curation research infrastructures machine
learning text classification workflows
to curate data products is often rendered invisible to those
outside of such archives out of an impulse to create a pristine
dataset that deliberately obscures the curators mark on it 14
however curators specialized disciplinary knowledge and
labor is essential to the enterprise of data curation 15 our
research values curators specialized knowledge by making
their labor explicit and measurable
this paper describes a study of jira work logs to better
understand common curation activities as a first step toward
connecting curation activities with data reuse and impact
we recognize that like any documentation system icpsrs
curation work logs are incomplete and vary in specificity
even with the adoption of systems like jira some curation
work goes undocumented or is obscured by the level of
recorded detail therefore our results tell a partial story about
curation activities we likely underestimate how often actions
are performed however these estimates serve as a baseline
for defining categories of curation activity and measuring the
frequency and effort time of various categories of curatorial
actions performed on social science datasets
we identified eight main categories of tasks that are frequently recorded in curation work logs two of which were
noncuration or other kinds of activities eg creating training
materials attending staff meetings excluding these quality
checks initial review and planning and data transformation
were the most frequent and time consuming curatorial activities
recorded across all of the studies in our analysis on average
curators spent more time on studies assigned higher levels
of curation confirming that applying more intensive sets of
curation actions requires more staff time
our analysis covers a period of transition as icpsr standardized its curation work we observed changes in curation actions
over this time across levels of curation and between icpsr
archives the average amount of time spent curating studies
has been decreasing since 2017 signaling possible increases in
efficiency in icpsrs curation practices for example fewer
instances of data transformation were performed over time on
deposits in topical archives while initial review and planning
became more common in the icpsr general archive however
the frequency of data transformation remained constant while
initial review and planning were performed more often
for intensively curated studies initial review and planning
was recorded more frequently than it was for nonintensive
studies communication was also recorded more frequently for
intensively curated studies although this decreased over time
to analyze data curation work we contribute
1 a schema of data curation activities
2 a computational model for identifying curation actions
in work log descriptions and
3 an analysis of the frequency and effort associated with
particular curation activities
as several researchers in this area have noted 17 18
the term is often illdefined with little explication of the
specific activities that comprise data curation in an effort
to clarify what is meant by data curation a number of
researchers and practitioners have defined it by describing
what data curation enables they define data curation as
the management and promotion of data from the point of
its creation ensuring the fitness of data for contemporary
purposes and making data available for discovery and reuse
17 19 as actions taken on data sets at any stage of their
existencethat enhance their use or reuse value 20 and as
the process of managing research data throughout its lifecycle
for longterm availability and reusability 21 johnston and
colleagues 22 call attention to repository curators as the key
actors in data curation describing it as work and actions taken
by curators of a data repository in order to provide meaningful
and enduring access to data
to better get at what precisely this work and these actions
are several studies have developed lists and taxonomies of
specific curation tasks however we have found that existing
vocabularies of curatorial actions are not readily applicable to
workflow documentation at icpsr the language of curation
documented in the literature differs from the terminology that
curators we studied used in practice for instance johnston
and colleagues 22 create a ranked list of 47 individual
curation activities based on focus groups with researchers to
identify the curation activities they most valued resulting in
documentation ranked first chain of custody second
and secure storage third many terms describe automated
actions applied to all data in a largescale repository like icpsr
eg terms of use use analytics and secure storage
and hence are not useful in studying the daytoday work of
human data curators furthermore while many of the activity
definitions eg use metadata to link the data set to related
publications dissertations andor projects that provide added
context for how the data were generated and why would be
readily recognized by the curators we studied the terms eg
contextualizing are not consistent with the language icpsr
curators use to characterize their work
the data practices and curation vocabulary dpcvocab 9
was derived from interviews with data managers in the earth
sciences the dpcvocab links data curation practices with
products curation workflows and curation roles and functions
including stakeholders and stewards one of the key aims
was to create a practical vocabulary for curators that could
be used in the curation of datasets from all fields of science
within the curatorial actions and functions category the
dpcvocab includes categories of activities that are synonymous
with the function of an archive like icpsr eg ingest
representation provenance management data storage policies
and preservation however it places the handson work with
data that is often part of curation work eg validating data as
ii background
research data practices performed primarily by the scientists
a data curation activities
who created the data lee and stvilia 21 identify 14 research
data curation plays a critical role in enabling accessibility data activities and actions in an institutional repository which
discovery reuse preservation and data sharing 16 yet span communication about data curation needs managing and
sharing data ensuring data accessibility and reevaluating
data for long term preservation but again these do not align
with icpsr workflows finally the rdatdwg curatorial
metadata and attribution model 23 proposes an abstract data
model for describing and citing curatorial work rather than
prescribing specific curatorial tasks it allows curators to receive
credit for work however this model is meant to be applied
in conjunction with an existing taxonomy of curatorial work
and does not outline curatorial tasks
this breadth of vocabularies regarding curatorial actions
reflects the diversity of data curation contexts and domains
and points to a need for further research on the nature
of data curation work these vocabularies were developed
through interviewbased methods not by examining existing
documentation therefore they are not ideal for supporting text
extraction and classification of curatorial work logs though
there appear to be highlevel commonalities between these
vocabularies more specific accounts of data curation are needed
to render this important work visible and to support institutions
in assessing the efficacy of their own curatorial pipelines in
the section that follows we outline data curation pipelines at
icpsr so as to foreground the development of our own data
curation taxonomy
b data curation at icpsr
prior studies suggest that the adoption of standards can make
implicit institutional practices like data curation more explicit
so that efforts and funds can be prioritized 24 in 2017 icpsr
took a significant step toward standardizing curation work by
centralizing curation staff into an organizational unit icpsrs
entire repository of social science data is organized around
several thematic collections or topical archives with each
archive corresponding to a particular social science research
audience eg the national addiction  hiv data archive
and the national archive of computerized data on aging
prior to the 2017 reorganization each topical archive within
icpsr employed its own team of curators leading to unique
projectspecific approaches to curating data following the
reorganization icpsr also established a set of written curation
standards that grouped specific curatorial actions and outputs
into three different curation levels that vary with respect to
the amount intensiveness and complexity of effort required
as well as the end product
all studies deposited at icpsr receive a base level of
curation called level 1 curators conduct a disclosure risk
review and create a study webpage with subject terms and
relevant study information including a description title authors
and relevant notes level 1 curation also includes an icpsr
codebook and data files for all major statistical software
packages level 2 builds on level 1 further improving
the usability of data by ensuring missing values are identified
and documented acronyms and abbreviations are spelled out
spelling is checked and corrected and labels are checked
for completeness and readability level 3 is icpsrs most
intensive level of curation it develops custom documentation
for the data and adds survey question text to variables so that
they can be indexed and searched this level is also applied to
nontabular or nonnumeric data such as gis and qualitative
data in developing our curatorial schema in section iiib
we include actions that are performed on every study across
curation levels but which vary in intensiveness for example
disclosure risk review is applied to all studies but level 3
curation tends to involve more steps such as reviewing all
variables and survey question text for disclosive information
c recording curation activities
in an additional move to systematize the curation workflow
icpsr adopted jira to document prioritize and communicate
curation work jira is a highlycustomizable webbased tool
most commonly used by software developers to plan track and
release software previous studies have performed text mining
on issue tracking systems to glean behavioral insights into the
communication styles of developers 25 systems like jira offer
new ways to document and analyze the data curation process
given the need to rationalize return on investments for data
curation 26 we are interested in studying work management
systems to better understand the effects of particular curation
activities on data
at icpsr a curation ticket or issue is synonymous with a
curation request therefore we use the terms interchangeably
jira tickets are the primary means for making the request to
curate a study often made up of multiple files the tickets
list the necessary curation tasks communicate about curation
track timestamped milestones and document work from start
to resolution ie study release
iii m ethod
jira tickets contain work logs which describe the curation
work performed on deposited data figure 1 to identify
curation actions in the work logs we first developed a schema
of curation activities and then manually labeled a subset of work
logs according to the type of data curation activity that each
described we trained a supervised classifier using the labeled
data to predict curation actions in unlabeled work logs we
compared results from two classification models complement
naive bayes and stochastic gradient descent to a baseline
model that applied labels proportionally below we describe
our corpus our preprocessing workflow our annotation schema
and labeling method and our classifier in more depth
a jira ticket corpus and preprocessing
we analyzed a corpus of jira tickets created between
february 2017 and december 2019 the start date coincided
with icpsrs adoption of the jira system we omitted tickets
created from 2020 onward as curation was still in progress for
many of these at the time of writing we included only tickets
with at least one work log entry written by icpsr staff during
curation the corpus of 669 jira tickets corresponded to 566
unique studies
we deidentified work log text by replacing curators names
with linked anonymous identifiers we segmented the work log

of curation activities within the work logs was not consistent checks tend to happen at the end of other actions commufor example descriptions of quality checks included phrases nication for study is done as needed throughout the curation
such as selfchecks 1qc and addressing identified issues process while we acknowledge similarities between the two
many curation actions were also described with generic phrases terms we distinguished between documentation and study
for example wrapping up study and running scripts imply metadata as the standalone humanreadable descriptive files
activities that include quality checks but are not explicit enough codebooks record layouts questionnaires technical reports
to classify as such without more context work logs tended etc and machinereadable descriptive information respectively
to overgeneralize work so that broad categories rather than we included other as a category to capture curationrelated
specific actions were captured descriptions of work also varied actions outside of our designated categories we also identified
noncuration actions which we removed from our analysis as
in complexity ranging in length from 1 to 204 words
reported in section iv
we uploaded a proportional random sample of jira tickets
b manual annotation schema
across curation levels 13 to a webbased annotation tool brat
to account for the variety in the work log descriptions 28 we applied the schema to manually annotate a set of 789
we developed a schema of curation activities we focused labeled curation actions from 10 randomlyselected tickets to
on curatorial actions that vary in application across studies use as training data for text classification
by curation level and relative amounts of time spent more
background and definitions for icpsrs curation levels are c computational model for text classification
given in section iib we first consulted with icpsr interour objective was to classify curation actions in unlabeled
nal documentation and curation supervisors to identify an curation work logs methods like supervised classifiers reduce
exhaustive list of curation actions we then sorted these actions the labor needed to detect and distinguish specialized curatorial
according to how frequently they were performed ie across language in short unstructured text 29 30 we chose a
all studies vs as needed and how variable time spent on supervised approach that leveraged the manual annotations to
them was ie a consistent amount of time vs dependent train a machine classifier to recognize curation activities our
on the dataset we used this initial set of frequent actions labeled data had many instances of quality checks and fewer
with high variability in our first annotation attempts we then instances of study level metadata figure 2 to train a classifier
iteratively revised the schema as a team until we settled on to predict curation actions we split the labels generated in
eight comprehensive mutually exclusive categories of curatorial brat into 80 training and 20 testing datasets we removed

a defining curatorial actions
the annotation schema of curation activities we developed
figure 3 allowed us to control for variation in curator
styles and changing norms in the use of jira at icpsr over
time given our interest in understanding the variation in
curation work across studies we included actions that varied
in frequency and effort we initially tested annotation with
a schema of 25 terms that included frequent instances of
each example in table i eg designate missing values as

variation in detail of work log descriptions this proved to be

classifier gave the best predictions for the test classes
we applied the trained classifier to identify curatorial actions
in the unseen jira work logs work log syntax showed that
curators used new line and carriage key delimiters along with
line breaks and periods to separate curation actions in their
work logs we used these delimiters to segment work log
descriptions into short fragments resulting in 12995 unseen
curation sentence fragments we then predicted a curation
action for each fragment using our trained model
iv r esults
our schema defines the main tasks of data curation work at a
large data science repository icpsr we find that the coverage
of the schema is sufficient to characterize and distinguish
general categories of intensive curatorial actions we use our
computational model to detect curation actions in jira tickets
we interpret the model to understand the variety in the language
of curation including sources of confusion that the classifier
encountered finally we analyze the output of the classifier to figure 3 revised schema with activities distinguished by curation levels
characterize the degree to which curatorial work varies over l1l3

is internally consistent while smaller in size there was also work including documentation and communication does get
complete agreement between all predictions of metadata related recorded but is not logged as frequently or for as long of a
actions when the model made mistakes it confused data duration in aggregate as other kinds of actions like quality
transformation with other classes we inspected the mislabeled checks and data transformations
instances and noticed that classes with the least confusion also
our study covered a period of institutional transition starting
exhibited more homogeneity in the language used eg quality in 2017 to interpret how curation actions changed over this

it is in initial review and planning and data transformation checks and data transformations were the most frequently
activities that are part of these general classes of curation recorded actions across curation levels and archives figure 4

icpsr general archive and all other topical archives grouped
we describe our corpus of jira tickets along with information under other topical archives
about the amount of time spent on curation table iii
from 2017 to 2019 data transformation communication
more time on average was spent curating level 3 studies and other related curation actions decreased while initial review
supporting the idea that higher levels of curation tend to be and planning and documentation increased despite this the
more time intensive relatively less time was spent curating proportions in which curation actions are applied across studies
studies in one of icpsrs large topical archives  the bureau of is consistent in the aggregate across curation levels and archives
justice statistics bjs within the national archive of criminal for our corpus of jira tickets in recent years icpsr has
justice data  compared to the icpsr general archive and been emphasizing the automation of repetitive curation tasks
all the other topical archives combined the average amount to prioritize valueadded work that requires human expertise
of time spent curating studies has also been decreasing since icpsr curators may be spending more time on actions like
2017 signaling possible changes in curation practices or their initial review of data and quality checks and less time on
efficiency
data transformation due to this shift in priorities additionally
alongside other actions eg asked about the content for
string responses and if any additional information could be
provided making it difficult in some cases to differentiate
discrete curation actions in cases where curators described
transforming data or revising documentation in response to a
quality check we labeled the action as a quality check even
though data transformation and documentation may have also
been relevant
figure 4 proportion of curation actions recorded by study curation level
archive and year
thorough initial reviews may expedite data transformation
v d iscussion
workflows many data curation workflow models 34 35
envision curation as a set of easily identifiable sequential and
discrete steps the reality of work is much harder to itemize
however in our analysis we find examples of curators working
in parallel rather than sequentially which complicates many
accounts of data curation and data science workflows and
which may explain why some instances of similar work fall into
different categories second the schema of curatorial work
we have developed can be compared to taxonomies rooted
in other contexts 9 and thereby support a more nuanced
understanding of data practices across disciplines
we also introduced a machine learning classifier that detected
curation activities identified in our schema the classifier
performed well in detecting the most frequent categories of
curatorial actions communication for study quality checks and
data transformation however no classifier is perfect ours
included in some cases the classifier was confused by what
constituted a discrete action or distinctions between categories
of complementary actions such as data transformations and
quality checks an example of a mislabeled work log was went
through processing history files which was manually labeled
as a quality check because it referred to a person reviewing
the files that curators generate when editing data however
the classifier labeled it data transformation likely because
other work logs with processing history files referred to the
process of generating that document instead of reviewing it
such examples highlight compound multipart or iterative
decisions recorded by data workers which are difficult to
render visible without an indepth understanding of the work
context
a implications for future work
prior studies of curation work have primarily focused on
1 measuring curation activities our analysis in secarticulating the activities that fall under the category of data tion iiia focuses exclusively on the work log portion of
transformation 5 9 33 our results surface other kinds the jira ticket we plan to incorporate other parts of the ticket
of curation activities like quality checks and initial review we such as the comments which describe curatorial decisions in
additionally show that these metalevel review activities tend greater depth and incorporate the voices of project supervisors
to be even more frequent than data transformation we also and managers in addition to curation staff analysis of the
find that activities like metadata creation documentation of amount of time logged in jira tickets will also allow us to
curatorial work and communication with other stakeholders further understand the intensity of specific curatorial actions
take considerable time regardless of curation level and archive eg examining the differences between time estimated and
this broader portrait of curatorial work is important in the actual time required for curating studies we will also
developing data curation pipelines and best practices going triangulate our findings from this study with analysis available
forward further work is needed to understand the impact from processing history files and through qualitative interviews
of these separate tasks on increasing the value of deposited with curators processing history files are internal documents
data accounting for the differential impacts of curation tasks that contain commented syntax with statistical commands
may help to define some of the value of depositing data in a used to transform the deposited data files they document
trusted repository for example it is unclear whether individual all work done and changes made to deposited data supporting
researchers or teams preparing data for selfdeposit attend to reproducibility for data curation as new waves of data are added
quality checks with as much detail as professional curators
to a study these files are referenced in work logs and provide
this study contributes a novel schema of data curation more granular information about specific actions including data
activities though specific to the workflows of icpsr we transformations and documentation steps this will provide
believe it has several applications beyond this first the method richer detail about how work is coordinated within the curation
used to develop the schema may be adapted in other contexts unit and by staff outside of it
both to facilitate the analysis of similar collections of work logs
adding a second level of granularity to our schema will
and also to foster a better understanding of curatorial work and allow us to detect and differentiate specific curation activities
this will involve a second round of annotation with a version deposited data we also recognize that the transcripts curators
of the more detailed schema in section iiib we are also generate in jira are public within the organization that means
interested in understanding typical sequences of curation that the comments of subordinates eg curators are visible
actions in workflows and which actions tend to cooccur to those with power eg supervisors directors prior work
our computational model in section iiic incorporates both acknowledges that what can be part of any public transcript
individual words and bigrams preserving common sequences is also a matter of struggle 37 we must remember that
of terms in work logs rather than modeling work log text some comments or work descriptions will be purposefully
as an unstructured bag of words to improve the classifier vague or missing in order to resist preservation domination or
we will account for the order in which curation activities other forms of control plantin 36 argues that data processors
tend to occur including factors for order of operations could use microresistance such as socializing and communicating
address some of the confusion exhibited by the classifier for expertise to avoid the alienation that can accompany their work
example initial review and planning tends to happen at the future analysis must take into account the power dynamics at
beginning of curation work while quality checks occur prior play in creating this documentation
to and immediately after release of a study
prior studies of issue tracking systems like jira have
we will also compare frequent curation actions by archives mitigated similar issues by narrowly constraining their analysis
to characterize the impacts that standardization efforts have had to issue resolution time or by extracting sentiments from
on curation work at icpsr over the past several years eg developer discourse 25 38 the detection of noncuration
how adopted or mandated curation practices have percolated actions however gives a more complete picture of a curator
through the organization identifying curation work is a first participating in the wide range of activities that an organization
step towards analyzing the relationship between data curation values but that extend beyond traditional curation work eg
and use the larger goal of our research is to connect curation professional development icpsrs practice of capturing these
activities with measures of data use and impact including trust activities and our models ability to detect them raise larger
in data and in the archive itself 14 36
questions about what it means to meaningfully engage human
2 understanding the impact of organizational structure curators in an increasingly standardized curation pipeline
on curation work we believe our analysis has revealed activities like professional development that are important
the continued impact of legacy organizational structures on to archives and their employees are not readily captured by
curatorial work icpsr moved curation work out of topical taxonomies of curatorial action and it will continue to be
archives and into a central unit in 2017 which changed important to account for these kinds of resources as we support
the relationships between curators archives and data the the humans in the data curation loop any model that doesnt
organization then adopted jira to track and manage curation account for these activities is missing a critical part of what it
requests and work the work logs available for analysis did means to be an employee in any organization
not extend far enough back to reveal traces of icpsrs prior
3 characterizing data curation  its not always a pipeline
organizational structure and heterogeneity between topical our itemized approach to detecting curation activities fits a
archives however we did see evidence of evolving work narrative in which the data processing pipeline is theorized as
practices following the centralization of the curation unit the a factorylike workflow 36 in interrogating the limits of our
adoption of jira and standardized levels of curation during own approach we ask what a system like jira might afford
the initial months of jira use curators broke curation requests data workers in resisting both invisibility and accounting one
into multiple tickets with one ticket for each phase of curation possible example of passive resistance to such invisibility is
while in later years each curation request was a single ticket the variety of ways the jira system is used our analysis of
that covered all phases
ticket length and complexity of syntax showed differences in
additional context about jira implementation including the ways that curators used the jira system the amount of
reporting artifacts is needed to interpret our findings data detail that curators included in their entries approximated by
transformations likely include work that curators do to make the length of work log entries varied from the detailed to
data compatible with icpsrs tools and methods in such the minimal or vague eg worked on curating study this
cases there is effort spent that is unique to the institution and also suggests variability in the value individual curators place
indirectly about improving the data curators must also track on work logs some may view work logs as administrative
work by projects and so they use jira tickets to indicate all busywork and therefore document the bare minimum while
hours worked which include noncuration activities while we others may incorporate work logs into their personal task
removed noncuration actions from our analysis they accounted management practices seeing a benefit to adding more detail
for a sizable portion of logged actions this high level of non worklogs make curators work more visible make it possible to
curation activity may not be reported in the same way in other acknowledge contributions and capture divisions of labor these
systems where curators are not required to keep track of their goals are in line with plantins 36 steps to the emancipation
work hours in this way clerical work and other miscellaneous of data workers balancing the visibility and exposure that
tasks are a necessary part of daily work in a large organization work logs create is a critical challenge for organizations that
but capturing these as part of a curation workflow obscures employ them we look forward to further exploring the benefits
some of the higher value efforts made to improve the quality of and risks of rendering curatorial work visible
vi c onclusion
our annotation schema suggests that curation work is not
limited to data transformation or adequately captured by
pipeline analogies instead curatorial actions include many
types of work such as communication and documentation
that have not been effectively captured in prior descriptions
our computational model identifies myriad curation actions
and provides a mechanism for measuring their frequency and
duration by automating the analysis of curation work logs
we enable research that studies evolving curation activities
we illustrate the kinds of insights our model can reveal about
curation work many of the activities that are core to the
curators work eg communicating about a study reviewing
curation plans do not fit neatly into pipeline metaphors or
narrow depictions of curation work instead we show that
planning communication and quality review are central to the
curation work of data archives
