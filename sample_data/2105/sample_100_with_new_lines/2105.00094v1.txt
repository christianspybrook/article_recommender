abstract timevariable polarization is an extremely valuable observational tool to probe the dynamical physical conditions of blazar jets since 2008 we have been monitoring the flux and linear
polarization of a sample of gammaray bright blazars at optical frequencies some of the observations were performed on nightly or intranight timescales in four optical bands providing information on the frequency and time dependence of the polarization the observed behavior is similar
to that found in simulations of turbulent plasma in a relativistic jet that contains a standing shock
andor a helical background magnetic field similar simulations predict the characteristics of xray
synchrotron polarization of blazars that will be measured in the future by the imaging xray polarimetry explorer ixpe

observations of linear polarization lp of blazars provide a probe of the underlying
magnetic field structure that is thought to play an important role in the dynamics of the
relativistic jet flows as well as particle acceleration in these objects the current paradigm
for the production of jets involves magnetic fields that are twisted by differential rotation
of the ionized gas in orbit about the black hole eg 13 the magnetic field should
therefore be strong and helical from the base of the jet at least out to the end of the accelerationcollimation zone acz 46 beyond which turbulence might destroyor be superposed onthe helical ordering such turbulence may result eg from currentdriven
instabilities eg 7 or interactions with the external medium since the jets of blazars
are observed to accelerate out to parsec scales 8 the magnetic launching model predicts
that the helical field geometry should persist out to these scales and that the greatest
doppler beaming of the radiation can occur parsecs from the black hole
most blazar jets contain a stationary compact core near the upstream end plus
bright knots some of which are essentially stationary while others move down the jet
with superluminal apparent velocities eg 9 the core seen on microwave very long
baseline interferometric vlbi images can be modeled as a standing roughly coneshaped recollimation shock 10 or the site where the jet becomes opaque to synchrotron
selfabsorption 11 depending on frequency the knots can be explained as propagating
internal shocks 12 or simply as plasmoids of enhanced magnetic field andor density of relativistic electrons the optical synchrotron emission in blazars can arise from the
core or knots or possibly from the acz upstream of the core where the predicted helical
magnetic field should dominate over any turbulent component
each of the structures mentioned above has a characteristic predicted lp pattern that
can be compared with observations

a plasmoid would likely have a slowly changing mean magnetic field direction
which might be altered in the observers frame if the plasmoid accelerates causing a modest 180 rotation of the position angle  of lp 12 the lp is expected to show only
slight if any frequency dependence across the optical bands
a moving shock amplifies the magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal ie
parallel to the shock front if the shock normal is aligned with the jet axis and if the magnetic field ahead of the shock is highly tangled  will be observed to be parallel to the jet
axis unless the shock is viewed exactly faceon in which case the degree of lp could be
nearly zero if the preshock magnetic field is disordered if the shock normal is oblique
to the jet axis  can be oblique as well 13 acceleration of electrons which includes any
positrons that are present at the shock front followed by radiative energy losses that are
more severe for higher postshock energies causes stratification such that the higherfrequency emission occurs over a smaller layer behind the shock front this steepens the
spectrum and increases both the mean lp and the level of variability 14 it is possible
that the ordering of the magnetic field transverse to the shock normal decays with distance
from the shock front in which case the lp can become weaker and change in position
angle 15 the gradient of maximum electron energy with distance from the shock front
then causes a decrease in lp as the transverse field decays that is more pronounced at
higher frequencies subsequently the degree of lp reaches a minimum of zero followed
by a switch of  to 90 from the jet direction both of which occur first at higher frequencies
a helical magnetic field tends to produce lp with  oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the jet axis 16 an offaxis emission feature eg a slow magnetosonic
shock can cause rotation of  by 180 as it spirals down the helical field pattern whose
field lines propagate at nearly the speed of light 17 unless the twist of the helical field
reverses such rotations should always be in the same sense eg clockwise
plasma with a randomly tangled magnetic field should have a low mean degree of
lp p  p n   where n is the number of magnetic cells each with a random magnetic field direction 18 and p  which depends weakly on the slope of the
synchrotron spectrum is typically in the range of 6875 the observed value of p is predicted to fluctuate over time with a standard deviation p  p 2 19 the value of 
should vary across the full range often mimicking systematic rotations that can exceed
180 but occurring in random directions ie either clockwise or counterclockwise
a standing conical shock compresses the magnetic field behind the shock front to
form a distinctive lp pattern if the emission is resolved with vlbi at a typical viewing
angle relative to the jet axis the pattern can be described roughly as radial 182021
dong et al 22 carried out simulations of emission resulting from kink instabilities
finding that the degree of lp is anticorrelated with the flux density during flares independent simulations of kink instabilities by 23 feature timedependent differences between the optical and xray lp parameters of blazars whose xray emission is mainly
synchrotron radiation
testing of these predictions requires monitoring of the flux density and lp of blazars
at multiple frequencies with intensive time coverage here we present results of such
monitoring observations along with some simulations generated with the numerical turbulent extreme multizone temz model 1924 we compare the empirical trends with
the predictions of temz and other models
2 methods observations
the authors carried out a comprehensive multiwaveband monitoring program of 37
ray bright blazars from 2008 to mid2020 a modified version of the program with
changes in the source list and vlbi monitoring strategy continues the sample was selected based on ray flux optical flux and declination accessible with northernhemisphere telescopes the study reported here focuses on eleven of these objects that we

observed at multiple optical frequencies either on several consecutive nights or multiple
times during a single night
21 multifrequency optical observations of linear polarization
the optical lp data discussed here were obtained by us with the 183m diameter
perkins telescope which is located in flagstaff arizona usa and was operated by lowell observatory through 2018 after which boston university assumed ownership and operation the flux density and polarization was measured within the johnson i r v and
b bands with the prism camera wwwbueduprism which includes a polarimeter with
a halfwave plate that is rotated through four position angles to measure the stokes q and
u parameters the instrumental polarization was determined by observations of unpolarized stars while the lp position angle was calibrated with polarized stars in the same field
as the blazar corrections for optical extinction and for mkn421 and bl lac host galaxy
starlight have been made as described by 25
on most nights polarization measurements were carried out only at r band during
nights when all four filters were used the observations cycled through the bands so that
a measurement at one band was offset by 440 min from that of another band because of
this frequency and time dependence can be entangled if changes in polarization occur on
timescales shorter than one hour during periods of intranight variability
22 vlbi images with the very long baseline array
throughout the 12 years of optical observations reported here we imaged roughly
once per month the millimeterwave structure of the jets of the blazars on scales as small
as 01 milliarcseconds mas with the very long baseline array vlba at a frequency
of 43 ghz vlbabublazar program see supplementary materials the various
steps of the data processing are described by 26 this results in images in both total and
linearlypolarized intensity with an angular resolution that is typically 015 mas in the
eastwest direction and 0204 mas depending on declination in the northsouth direction here we use the images to compare the position angle of polarization  seen in the
images with the optical values
23 gammaray and xray fluxes
in this study we present xray and ray light curves in order to assess the level of
nonthermal activity during the periods of closelysampled optical polarization measurements we have derived ray fluxes at photon energies from 01 to 200 gev from publicly
available data measured by the large area telescope of the fermi gammaray space telescope we processed the data in the standard manner using software the latest ray
background models and analysis threads supplied by the fermi science support center fermigsfcnasagovsscdata the flux was calculated with a maximumlikelihood
algorithm that assigns detected photons to the various sources in the field from the lat
10year source catalog 4fgldr2
we have calculated xray fluxes from data obtained by the xray telescope xrt of
the neil gehrels swift telescope which includes observations proposed by us and publicly
available data from other programs the data processing employed the latest versions of
the heasoft data analysis software and caldb calibration data base photons were extracted from a circular region of radius 70 surrounding the source position and the
background was determined from an annulus of inner radius 88 and outer radius 118
centered on the source the backgroundsubtracted photon counts per energy channel
data were fit with the program xspec in terms of a powerlaw spectrum with photoelectric absorption based on the galactic foreground neutral hydrogen column density

the diversity in the behavior of the different blazars four of which are quasars and
seven of which are classified as bl lac objects is striking the degree of optical polarization popt is highly variable in all 11 objects but in six of the blazars 3c 66a oj287 0954 
658 3c 279 mkn501 and bl lac  is often stable to within   20 of the jet direction as measured on a scale of 1 mas for years but also highly variable some of the time
in the other five cases 0716  714 mkn421 1156  195 pks 1510089 and cta102 there
is no discernable pattern in the longterm behavior of the optical polarization the degree
of optical polarization is usually higher than that of the 43 ghz core for the objects without longterm trends in the optical polarization this implies that the optically emitting
region involves fewer turbulent cells than in the radio core see item 4 in section 1 in
four out of five of these nopattern blazars  is within 20 of  in the nearestepoch 43 ghz vlba image pks 1510089 is the exception it may be common then for
the optical synchrotron emission in blazars to arise from a portion of the core region 27
it is also possible that an ordered component of the magnetic field in the core is present
upstream of the core eg a helical field associated with the acceleration and collimation
zone of the innermost jet as inferred previously in the cases of bl lac and pks 1510089
2829
significant nighttonight and intranight variability of the polarization occurs at various levels for all of the 11 blazars these shortterm variations include significant frequency dependence only some of which follows the trends expected from time variability
coupled with the offsets in time of the measurements in the different bands
4 discussion
41 polarization of synchrotron emission from a turbulent relativistic jet
the observed degree of linear polarization which is highly variable and always
much less than the uniformfield case of 6875 for synchrotron radiation requires a
strong disordered component of the magnetic field on the other hand the frequent alignment to within 20 of  with the jet direction and  implies that there is usually
an ordered component as well note that  is similar to the jet direction except possibly for 1156  295 whose jet direction is northward but otherwise ambiguous the inner
jet of oj287 is oriented toward the northwest which is not apparent in the image in figure
1c 30 alignment of the polarization with the jet direction can be attained if the ordered
component is aligned perpendicular to the jet axis after correcting for relativistic aberration eg 16 such an alignment could correspond to a helical magnetic field eg 16
compression by a moving 31 or standing 20 shock or by some other process
based on these considerations we interpret our observational results in terms of a
superposition of ordered and disordered magnetic fields we do so by employing the numerical temz model 1924 the model features thousands of turbulent cells of plasma
that is flowing down a jet at a relativistic velocity optionally the plasma can cross a
standing shock which is likely to be coneshaped eg 2024 a helical magnetic field
of adjustable relative strength and geometry can be superposed on the turbulent component see 32 for evidence indicating the presence of a helical component the temz
model includes radiative energy losses of the electrons as well as optionally selective
acceleration of electrons when particle acceleration occurs as the turbulent plasma crosses
a shock one expects more efficient diffusive shock acceleration of the highestenergy particles in locations where the local magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal the
socalled subluminal particle acceleration regime since the particle then has time to
execute multiple crossings of the shock front 3334 this causes a volume filling factor

that is lower at higher frequencies which in turn steepens the synchrotron spectrum at
optical to xray frequencies and the inverse compton spectrum at ray photon energies
the smaller volume at higher frequencies affects the polarization if the magnetic field has
a strong turbulent component since fewer turbulent cells are involved as discussed in 
1 this lower value of n increases the mean degree p of lp as well as the amplitude of
time variations of p and 
the temz code calculates the multifrequency flux density from synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering as well as the lp of the synchrotron emission at
various frequencies as a function of both time and location within the jet the codes spatial grid consists of up to 168 columns of cells across the jet and 112 cells along each column each cell has its own field direction the turbulent magnetic field and density are
implemented via a scheme similar to although more continuous than that of 35 each
cell belongs to 4 nested zones of different dimensions for each zone the density ne and
turbulent magnetic field vector bturb are selected at random from a lognormal distribution
eg 3637 at the upstream and downstream zone boundaries these parameters are
varied smoothly in between the boundaries a given cells density and magnetic field vector is then the sum of the values of its zones weighted according to the kolmogorov spectrum which gives higher weight to the larger zones as found in simulations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence eg 38 this scheme produces the spaghetti
magnetic field pattern characteristic of turbulence 39 for an example in this study we
employ a version of the code that is a modification of that described in 19 it includes a
turbulent vortical component of the velocity of each zone 4041 which is relativistically
added to the systemic velocity vector of the jet flow the turbulent velocity is determined
in a similar manner as the turbulent magnetic field with the kolmogorov spectrum applying to the 4velocity vturb 4243 the physically motivated specification of a lognormal
distribution of ne and bbc
of the largest zones and a kolmogorovspectrum dependence
of the quantities on zone size restrict sthe number of free parameters of the model
time variability of the emission from the model jet occurs as the values of bturb ne
and the maximum energy of relativistic electrons change in each cell from one time step
to the next the magnitude and direction of bturb are both important since the synchrotron
emission coefficient is proportional to b sin hi  where  is the angle between the
magnetic field and the line of sight as measured in the plasma frame and  is the spectral
index with flux density fl   i  where  is frequency at higher  the number of cells
with electrons of sufficient energy to radiate at that frequency decreases ie n  is
lower so p and p are both higher see  1 fluctuations in n  caused by the
random changes in bturb and neand therefore in the ability of individual cells to contribute
to the emission at lead to variations in fl  p and 
we have run the temz code a number of times to sample how the time and frequency dependence of lp depends on the presence of a standing shock andor ordered
helical magnetic field component here we report on some trends that we have found and
relate them to the data presented in section 2 we plan a more extensive survey of parameter space in the future to explore the full range of predicted behavior and to determine
whether and how different models that produce some similar observational signatures
eg p  p   and  can be distinguished from each other
42 results of temz simulations
we present results of simulations of some temz runs that can be compared with the
lp observations presented in section 2 the selected parameters correspond roughly to a
typical observed spectral energy distribution sed of a blazar which naturally leads to
strong variability based on the timescales of energy losses of the radiating electrons here
we focus on how the presence of a standing conical shock and relative levels of turbulent
versus helical magnetic field components affect the behavior of the lp for examples of
light curves and seds from temz simulations see 192444

figure 2ae present left a scatter plot of the difference of p and  at optical b band
and i band and right a sample 2day polarization vs time curve for optical i r and b
bands the latter was extracted over a random 16 timestep interval from a total of 5000
time steps per run each of which is represented in the scatter plot the runs all use the
same angle between the jet and line of sight 3 angle of standing conical shock front to
the jet axis 8 preshock bulk lorentz factor 6 and pitch angle of helical field  90
so the ordered component of the field is toroidal as approximately expected if rotation of
the flow winds the field tightly in the outer acz a maximum turbulent velocity of
34c lorentz factor of 2 is set for these simulations that level is rarely reached when
the velocity in each zone is selected randomly and velocity vectors from different zones
are added when the magnetic field is 99 helical the variations with both time and optical frequency are very slight the variations are stronger as the helical field is weakened
to an intermediate level of 40 of the total field at lower levels of helical field however
the variations are only marginally stronger this is because of the presence of the shock
turbulent plasma that is compressed by such a shock affects the lp in a similar manner as
the helical field for the selected viewing angle and lorentz factor favoring values of  that
are more aligned with the jet direction 1620 the scatter plot of pi  pb vs pi indicates that the mean polarization is higher at higher optical frequencies an effect that is
stronger when pi is higher this is caused by the smaller number of cells with electrons
of high enough energy to radiate at higher frequencies as discussed above the simulated
frequency dependence of popt is weak when the helical field is stronger than 50 while
the frequency dependence of  is weak until the helical field is less than 30 of the
total

43 comparison of simulations with data
although we have not yet amassed enough multifrequency optical lp monitoring
data to compare statistically with the simulations inspection of figures 14 allows us to
draw some general conclusions regarding the ability of different models to explain the
observational behavior of the blazars in our sample it is obvious that the case of 99
helical field figure 2a is incompatible with the level of variability of lp of the blazars
the mild variability and frequency dependence of the standing shock plus 60 helical
field case figure 2b are somewhat weaker than observed however the noshock 60
helical field case figure 3a produces a sufficient level of variability without a shock the
essentially random values of  observed in 0716  714 mkn421 1156  195 pks
1510089 and cta102 figure 1aefhk cannot accommodate a helical field stronger
than 40 unless the viewing angle is 0 but in that case popt would be close to zero much
lower than observed for the other six blazars both a standing shock andor a helical field
up to 60 are compatible with the data

with high xray fluxes the temz code simulates the xray lp as a function of time when
the magnetic field strength and highest electron energies are sufficient to produce a high
flux of xray synchrotron radiation among the blazars studied here mkn421 and
mkn501 which are very bright xray sources see figure 1ei are prime candidates for
ixpe observations we have run the temz code with parameters that roughly reproduce
the sed of mkn421 figure 5 compares the simulated xray and optical lp the variability
is somewhat stronger at xray energies and the degree of xray polarization is almost
always higher at xray energies than at optical frequencies this agrees with the conclusion of 45 who considered a turbulent plasma without a shock or helical field the short
timescale of variability of lp 20 min in the simulations implies that exposure times of
hours could result in lpvector averaging that will lead to a lower measurement of px than
actually occurs we point out on the other hand that mkn421 is less distant than the other
potential ixpe blazar targets as such it has a lower luminosity and is physically smaller
and therefore variable on a shorter timescalethan its higherredshift more luminous
counterparts its xray flux is also high enough to determine whether the xray lp becomes stronger as one shortens the integration time of the measurement

our observations of short timescale lp variability at different optical frequencies
demonstrate that substantial intranight and nighttonight frequencydependent fluctuations of popt and  are common simulations with the temz code produce results that
resemble the observed lp behavior of our sample of eleven blazars successful comparison between the simulated and empirical time and frequency dependence of lp requires
a substantial disordered component of the magnetic field as expected if the jet plasma is
turbulent we thus support with a larger sample the conclusions of 46 who carried out
similar intensive optical lp observations of 0716  714 and 47 who similarly observed
bl lac on the other hand our study also allowsor in many cases requiresan ordered
component that partially aligns the field with the jet direction
in sources such as mkn421 where electrons are accelerated to energies high enough
to produce synchrotron xray emission the xray lp should nearly always be somewhat
stronger than that at optical frequencies xray lp in blazars with such emission is therefore expected to be detectable with ixpe the xray polarization vector should however
fluctuate on shorter timescales than at optical frequencies in some blazars this could require short integration times in order to avoid vector averaging that would significantly
decrease the measured degree of lp below the actual value
we plan to continue our study by carrying out a statistical analysis of the longterm
lp observations of our full sample at optical and other frequencies we will accompany
this with an expanded exploration of the simulated behavior of the time and frequency
dependence of lp with the temz model the goal is to provide a framework within which
the complex emission properties of blazars can be characterized and perhaps understood
