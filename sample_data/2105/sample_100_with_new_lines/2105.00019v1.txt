abstract
high resolution uv spectra of stellar h i lyman lines from the hubble space telescope hst provide observational constraints on the winds of coronal main sequence
stars thanks to an astrospheric absorption signature created by the interaction between
the stellar winds and the interstellar medium we report the results of a new hst survey
of m dwarf stars yielding six new detections of astrospheric absorption we estimate
massloss rates for these detections and upper limits for nondetections these new
constraints allow us to characterize the nature of m dwarf winds and their dependence
on coronal activity for the first time for a clear majority of the m dwarfs we find
winds that are weaker or comparable in strength to that of the sun ie   1  
however two of the m dwarfs have much stronger winds yz cmi m4 ve   30
  and gj 15ab m2 vm35 v   10   even these winds are much weaker
than expectations if the solar relation between flare energy and coronal mass ejection
cme mass extended to m dwarfs thus the solar flarecme relation does not appear
to apply to m dwarfs with important ramifications for the habitability of exoplanets
around m dwarfs there is evidence for some increase in  with coronal activity as
quantified by xray flux but with much scatter one or more other factors must be
involved in determining wind strength besides spectral type and coronal activity with
magnetic topology being one clear possibility

introduction
most stars are known to exhibit some degree of mass loss and for many types of stars these
stellar winds play an important role in stellar evolution this is even true for the rather weak winds
of cool main sequence stars which provide the means by which these stars shed angular momentum
slowing their rotation with time matt et al 2012 gallet  bouvier 2013 2015 johnstone et al
2015ab ahuir et al 2020 the solar wind which is believed to be representative of this type
of wind is a hot fully ionized wind with a relatively low mass loss rate of   2  1014 m
yr1  finley et al 2019 provide estimates of the rate of angular momentum loss for the sun
associated with this wind based on direct measurement understanding how the solar rotation
has evolved with time is an active area of theoretical research vidotto 2021 but this requires
observational constraints on the winds of solarlike stars with various ages to constrain the solar
wind evolution suzuki 2013 suzuki et al 2013 airapetian  usmanov 2016 rville et al 2016
shoda et al 2020
the solar winds existence is a natural consequence of the heating processes that generate the
hot solar corona t  106 k the exact nature of these processes is still uncertain but coronal
heating is clearly associated with the conversion of magnetic energy to thermal energy cranmer
2012 cranmer  winebarger 2019 the solar corona and solar wind are therefore linked to the
solar dynamo that generates magnetic fields in the suns outer convection zone that then emerge
through the photosphere resulting in sunspots and other manifestations such as the hot corona
that represents the suns outermost atmospheric layer
hot stellar coronae are most easily observed in xrays and xray observations from missions
such as einstein rosat chandra and xmmnewton have proven that xray emitting coronae are
ubiquitous for main sequence stars with spectral types later than about a5 v schmitt et al 1985
gdel 2004 this makes sense as stars later than a5 v should all have outer convection zones
that can house stellar dynamos for generating the magnetic fields that ultimately lead to stellar
coronae and coronal xray emission in contrast stars earlier than a5 v possess fully radiative
interiors with no outer convection zone to host a dynamo
given that all main sequence stars later than a5 v seem to have hot coronae it is generally
assumed that all have coronal winds analogous to the solar wind as well however it has been
difficult to verify this and to study how coronal winds vary with stellar age activity and spectral
type because coronal winds are very hard to detect and study observationally such winds have
densities that are too low and they are too highly ionized to provide the kinds of spectral diagnostics
that are used to study more massive winds such as the radiation pressure driven winds of hot
stars puls et al 2008 and the warm winds of cool giants and supergiants wood et al 2016
hfner  olofsson 2018 rau et al 2018
besides the solar wind no coronal wind has ever been directly detected to this day attempts
to detect radio freefree emission from the ionized coronal winds have led only to nondetections
upper limits on massloss rates from these nondetections are orders of magnitude stronger than
the solar wind indicating that radio observations may not be sufficiently sensitive to provide many
useful diagnostics for the foreseeable future fichtinger et al 2017 another direct method to
try to detect coronal winds is through xray emission generated by charge exchange between the
ionized wind and interstellar neutrals that approach the star but once again there has not yet been
a successful detection wargelin  drake 2002
the only existing measurements of coronal winds rely on diagnostics that detect the winds
indirectly one such diagnostic is that of slingshot prominences for certain very rapidly rotating
stars variable h absorption transients have been observed that are believed to be indicative
of material at chromospheric temperatures trapped within very large prominences that lie far
above the stellar surface collier cameron  robinson 1989 for at least some of these stars
jardine  collier cameron 2019 have recently argued that the h absorption can be used to
estimate a plausible stellar mass loss rate the idea being that the absorption is sampling coronal
wind from the star that is temporarily trapped in the giant prominence subsequently cooling to
chromospheric temperatures in the process the material therefore is temporarily observable via
h absorption until the slingshot prominence erupts and releases the material back into the stellar
wind massloss rates inferred from this diagnostic are 24 orders of magnitude stronger than the
solar wind this is intuitive since these rapidly rotating stars are much more active than the sun
jardine  collier cameron 2019
another indirect wind diagnostic is absorption from evaporating exoplanetary atmospheres
that transit in front of the star this absorption has been detected in spectroscopic observations of the h i lyman line by the hubble space telescope hst vidalmadjar et al 2003
lecavelier des etangs et al 2010 bourrier et al 2016 these observations are normally seen as
being of interest due to their diagnostic potential for studying exoplanetary atmospheric structure
and evolution eg ekenbck et al 2010 kislyakova et al 2014 schneiter et al 2016 but they
may be equally valuable for providing measurements of the stellar wind as the amount of absorption
depends in part on the density and velocity of the stellar wind at the exoplanet as demonstrated
by vidotto  bourrier 2017 for the m dwarf gj 436
however the indirect wind diagnostic that has provided the most numerous wind measurements so far is astrospheric lyman absorption analogous to absorption that is also observable
from our own heliosphere in the immediate vicinity of the sun hydrogen in the interstellar medium
ism is partly ionized and partly neutral as the sun moves through the ism the ism plasma is
heated compressed and decelerated as it piles up outside the suns heliopause which is the contact
surface separating the plasma flows of the ism and the solar wind thanks to charge exchange the
characteristics of the plasma outside the heliopause are transmitted to the ism neutrals as well
creating what has been called a hydrogen wall outside the heliopause when linsky  wood
1996 analyzed the lyman emission observed from the two components of the very nearby bi
nary  cen ab g2 vk0 v they found that ism absorption could not account for all of the
absorption observed within the chromospheric emission line the excess absorption could be explained as a combination of absorption from the hydrogen wall around our own heliosphere and
the analogous hydrogen wall around  cen ab gayley et al 1997
stronger stellar winds will lead to larger astrospheres and thicker hydrogen walls with higher
column densities and more lyman absorption thus the astrospheric lyman absorption can
be used as a diagnostic of stellar wind strength this technique has been applied to numerous stars
including  cen ab wood et al 2001 2005ab 2014 wood 2018 the astrospheric absorption
diagnostic has provided more coronal wind constraints than any other diagnostic but there are still
only 16 astrospheric detections leading to 16 published stellar mass loss rate   measurements
ranging from   015 m  for dk uma g4 iiiiv to   100 m  for 70 oph ab k0 vk5 v
the astrospheric absorption signature implies that astrospheres might in principle be detected in
emission from stellar lyman photons scattered in the hydrogen walls however the expected
surface brightness is very low and an attempt made to detect this emission was unsuccessful
wood et al 2003
this paper focuses on new astrospheric lyman absorption constraints for m dwarf stars
as there are only two prior astrospheric detections for m dwarfs one is ev lac m35 ve with
  1 m  wood et al 2005a this is a surprisingly modest wind considering that this is one
of the most notoriously active flare stars known which might have been thought to have a strong
wind just due to coronal mass ejections cmes associated with the flaring drake et al 2013
the second detection is a very recent result for a much less active star gj 173 m1 v with
  075 m  vannier et al in preparation our goal here is to dramatically increase the
number of wind constraints for m dwarfs using new hst observations enough to truly characterize
the winds of m dwarf stars for the first time and assess how they vary with coronal activity
new m dwarf observations from hst
we here analyze the h i lyman absorption observed toward nine nearby m dwarf stars
observed by the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis instrument on board hst the
observations are listed in table 1 in choosing our target stars we have focused on early m dwarfs
which will have higher line fluxes than later type m dwarfs and will probably have stronger more
detectable winds simply due to larger surface areas we use the gliesejahreiss catalog numbers
for the star names in table 1 with the exception of yz cmi gj 285 where we use the variable
star name by which that star is more commonly known
all of our chosen targets are within 7 pc the close proximity not only increases the line fluxes
which maximizes the signaltonoise sn of our spectra but also greatly improves the odds of
detecting the astrospheric lyman absorption signature for other reasons that we now describe
within 7 pc 10 out of 13 independent lines of sight toward cool main sequence stars previously

observed by hst have yielded successful detections of astrospheric absorption but this detection
fraction decreases dramatically as stellar distance increases wood 2018
the primary reason for the low astrospheric detection likelihood beyond 7 pc is that the sun
lies within a fully ionized region of the ism called the local bubble lb which stretches about
100 pc from the sun in most directions vergely et al 2010 welsh et al 2010 lallement et al
2014 the fully ionized plasma that predominates within the lb injects no neutrals into astrospheres embedded within it meaning no hydrogen wall structures and therefore no astrospheric
absorption regardless of wind strength however there are small clouds of cooler partially neutral
material within the lb and our sun happens to lie within one of these this is why we observe
heliospheric lyman absorption for some lines of sight and why for nearby stars we often see the
analogous astrospheric absorption from the hydrogen wall around the observed star but odds
of successful astrospheric detection decrease quickly beyond 7 pc with all or most nondetections
beyond this distance likely being due to the ism around the star being fully ionized one particularly unfortunate implication of this is that such nondetections do not even yield useful upper limits
for massloss rates however this is not necessarily true within 7 pc where the high astrospheric
detection fraction is consistent with the ism within that distance being partly neutral meaning
that nondetections can be interpreted as being due to weak stellar winds wood 2018
we use spectra processed using the standard hststis software available in the hst archive
as indicated in table 1 the primary hststis observation for each target is an exposure of a
spectral range containing the primary line of interest h i lyman at 1216  in most cases the
e140m grating is used to observe the 11501700  region for the two most active m dwarfs
with the highest expected line fluxes yz cmi and gj 644b e140m was replaced by the higher
resolution e140h grating at the cost of reducing the spectral coverage to 11601360  for ease
of scheduling the observations were separated into two separate visits explaining the two separate
e140m or e140h observations listed for each target in table 1 we coadd the individual spectra
into a single spectrum for our analysis
for each target in addition to the faruv fuv e140me140h spectrum we also obtain
a high resolution spectrum of the nearuv nuv 25742851  region using the e230h grating
which contains the mg ii hk lines at 2803 and 2796  respectively and also fe ii lines at 2600
and 2586  there are two reasons these lines are of interest one is that the ism mg ii and fe ii
absorption lines allow us to study the ism velocity structure and the second is that the mg ii
chromospheric emission lines are useful models for the shape of the intrinsic stellar h i lyman
emission line
with regards to the first point the mg ii and fe ii ism lines are very narrow which is why
they allow us to study the ism velocity structure along the line of sight to our observed stars this
is not really possible for the broader ism h i and d i deuterium lyman absorption where the
individual velocity components are completely blended knowledge of the ism velocity structure
improves the accuracy of the analysis of the h id i lyman line where the primary purpose
is to separate the ism lyman absorption from any heliospheric or astrospheric absorption that
might be present
with regards to the second point our analysis of the h i lyman line requires the reconstruction of the stellar chromospheric h i lyman emission line which is highly absorbed by the very
broad ism h i absorption the mg ii hk emission lines provide a useful model for the intrinsic
shape of the stellar h i lyman emission line as mg ii hk and h i lyman are all highly
opaque chromospheric lines with similar profiles in the solar spectrum
some additional comment is necessary for the gj 644b observation in the hst archive the
target is listed as gj 644a which is an m3 v star however in the optical gj 644a is nearly
identical in brightness with gj 644b which is a spectroscopic m4 vm4 v binary furthermore
the a and b components of this system are close enough  02 separation that both are in the
target acquisition image the b component ended up slightly brighter than the a component in
this image so it is the b component that was acquired and observed by hst whether the a or
b component is observed is unimportant for our purposes as the stars are close enough to reside
within the same astrosphere and therefore the astrospheric absorption should be identical toward
both see section 42
absorption line analysis
the mg ii and fe ii lines
although our focus is on searching for and measuring astrospheric h i lyman absorption this
absorption is highly blended with ism absorption so our analysis necessarily involves measurements
of ism absorption along the line of sight los to each of our target stars these measurements
are naturally of interest in their own right providing new information about the character of the
ism in the solar neighborhood we first concentrate on ism absorption lines of mg ii and fe ii in
the e230h spectra the narrowness of these lines is useful for revealing the velocity structure of
the ism toward the star for consideration in the following lyman analysis
figure 1 shows the mg ii k lines of our nine m dwarf target stars plotted on a heliocentric
velocity scale the chromospheric emission lines all show a selfreversal near line center which is
typical for earlier type stars as well two separate mg ii lines are seen for gj 644b as this is a
297 day spectroscopic binary sgransan et al 2000 mazeh et al 2001 with the binary observed
near quadrature where the velocity difference between gj 644ba m4 v and gj 644bb m4 v
is large enough to almost completely separate the two lines
the stellar mg ii lines are all very narrow compared to those observed from other types of
cool stars this is expected since m dwarfs are the least luminous of main sequence stars and
for high opacity chromospheric resonance lines like mg ii hk there is a known relation between
line width and stellar absolute magnitude eg cassatella et al 2001 this relation is generally
fig 1 hststis e230h spectra of the mg ii k lines of our nine m dwarf target stars at
2796  plotted on a heliocentric velocity scale fits to the ism absorption lines seen within the
chromospheric emission lines are shown in red with two ism components inferred for the gj 273
gj 205 and yz cmi lines of sight dashed lines no ism absorption is seen toward gj 860a or
gj 588 with the expected location of the absorption vertical red line too far from the emission
line
referred to as the wilsonbappu effect wilson  vainu bappu 1957 the narrowness of the lines
complicates the analysis of the ism absorption lines in various ways
for most of the stars in figure 1 narrow ism absorption is superposed on the stellar mg ii
emission but in a couple cases the narrowness of the mg ii emission means that the ism absorption
misses the lines entirely for these two stars gj 860a and gj 588 figure 1 shows the expected location of the absorption based on the local interstellar cloud lic flow vector of redfield  linsky
2008 unlike earlier type main sequence stars m dwarfs provide no nuv continuum emission
to provide background flux for the ism absorption lines if they miss the chromospheric mg ii
emission even for the other cases where the ism absorption lands within the emission line the
narrowness of the emission causes problems with inferring the shape of the emission background
for the absorption for example it makes it harder to separate the ism absorption from the selfreversal of the mg ii emission when the ism absorption is near line center eg gj 15a gj 273

2002 2004 and described more briefly below both the h and k lines are fitted simultaneously though figure 1 shows only the stronger k line the best fit is determined by 2 minimization bevington  robinson 1992 the fits include corrections for instrumental broadening
hernandez et al 2012 for three lines of sight gj 273 gj 205 yz cmi fitting the data requires
two separate ism components as shown in figure 1 each absorption component is defined by
three paramters the central velocity v doppler broadening parameter b and column density
n  the parameters resulting from our fits are listed in table 2 note that the quoted 1 uncertainties only include random errors induced by the noise in the data and do not include systematic
errors such as uncertainties in the shape of the background line profile which likely dominates the
uncertainties in the analysis for each detected ism component we have used the cloud radial
velocities and local ism maps from redfield  linsky 2008 to identify likely nearby clouds responsible for the absorption and these are listed in the fourth column of table 2 absorption from
the lic the cloud in which the sun resides is seen in all but three directions gj 588 gj 644b
and gj 860a the reason it is not seen in three cases is presumably that we are close to the edge
of the lic in those directions for gj 588 and gj 644b this is unsurprising based on the shape
of the lic inferred by linsky et al 2019 however the lack of lic absorption toward gj 860a
is unexpected suggesting that the lic model may require revision in that direction
the ism absorption toward gj 644b nearly misses the emission lying in the far blue wing of
the line the measured doppler parameter of the single ism component fitted to this absorption
b  48  22 km s1  is suspiciously high suggesting that multiple ism components are probably
present but the low sn this far in the wing of the line does not allow us to confirm the presence
of multiple components
there are two fe ii lines in our e230h spectra that can in principle provide further ism
absorption diagnostics with rest wavelengths of 25866500  and 26001729  these lines can be
measured in the same way as mg ii hk however the stellar fe ii emission lines are significantly
narrower and weaker than the mg ii lines thus in most cases the ism lines either miss the stellar
emission entirely or are observed with insufficient sn for useful measurements to be made we
report fe ii measurements for only yz cmi gj 338a and gj 887 in table 2
the h i lyman line
the h i lyman lines of our nine target stars are shown in figure 2 for each profile the
chromospheric emission line is greatly obscured by absorption this absorption consists of very
broad fully saturated absorption from h i in between the star and earth and much narrower
absorption from deuterium d i which is 033  blueward of the h i absorption the d i
absorption is entirely interstellar but the h i absorption can include contributions from heliospheric
andor astrospheric absorption it should be noted that narrow geocoronal lyman emission has
been removed from the spectra this removal can be problematic if the geocoronal emission is
blended with any of the emission observed from the star wood et al 2005b however for all
 11 
fig 2 hststis spectra of the h i lyman lines of our nine m dwarf target stars the
chromospheric emission lines are obscured by very broad h i absorption and narrow d i absorption
033  blueward of the h i absorption fits to the absorption are performed which involves
reconstruction of the stellar line profile over the absorption the dashed lines indicate the ism
absorption alone inferred for each los assuming selfconsistency between h i and d i in only two
cases gj 273 and gj 644b does this fit the data the other cases all show excess h i absorption
either heliospheric absorption on the long wavelength side of the line shown in green andor
astrospheric absorption on the short wavelength side of the line shown in red
our observations the geocoronal emission is a weak narrow emission line completely within the
saturated core of the ism absorption unblended with any of the stellar emission and therefore easy
to remove
hydrogen is the only element abundant enough for the heliospheric andor astrospheric hsas
absorption signature to be detectable in the analysis of the lyman lines the d i absorption is
crucial as the presence of hsas absorption reveals itself through discrepancies between the h i
and d i absorption profiles our analysis mirrors many past studies and is described most extensively in wood et al 2005b the h i and d i absorption lines are fitted simultaneously using 2
minimization taking into account the two hyperfine components of the h i and d i lines we force
the h i and d i absorption features to have selfconsistent central velocities eg vhi  vdi
and doppler parameters given that the h i and d i lines are dominated by thermal broadening
the latter constraint means that bhi  2  bdi finally the dh ratio has been found to be
 12 
constant within the lb with a value of dh  156  105 wood et al 2004 so in the fits we
force the column density ratio of d i to h i to be consistent with this value in this way all three
of the h i parameters are actually related to d i meaning that in a singlecomponent fit to the
h id i absorption there are actually only three free parameters
in the few cases where the mg ii analysis has indicated multiple ism components see table 2
we include these components in the lyman analysis though the components are hopelessly
blended in the broader h i and d i lines in the h id i fits the velocity separation of the
components is forced to be consistent with the mg ii fit for simplicity we also simply force the
components to have the same column density ratio as in the mg ii fit and we assume that the
components have identical doppler parameters parameters fixed in this fashion are identified with
parentheses in table 2
the lyman analysis not only involves fitting the absorption but also reconstructing the
intrinsic stellar lyman profile in the process which is not trivial considering the broad extent
of the h i absorption in the log n hi  180 column density regime represented by our nearby
target stars the lorentzian natural line opacity profile is relevant as well as the gaussian thermal
doppler core the full opacity profile is a voigt profile which is a convolution of the lorentzian and
gaussian components the wing absorption apparent far from line center in figure 2 is associated
with the former while the doppler core of the opacity profile affects the width of the saturated
core of the absorption
in the analysis an initial guess is made for the background shape of the stellar lyman
line with guidance from the profile of the mg ii lines which like lyman are highly opaque
chromospheric resonance lines that have similar profiles in the solar spectrum after an initial fit is
made to the data the residuals of the fit are then used to modify the assumed stellar line profile to
improve the fit further iterations are made if necessary the selfreversals inferred from mg ii are
generally preserved in this process but in practice the absorption fit parameters are little affected
by the exact shape of the stellar profile near line center
every effort is made to find an acceptable fit to the data assuming only ism absorption
however we are successful in only two of the nine cases gj 273 and gj 644b for the other stars
the ismonly fits are poor presumably due to the presence of hsas absorption contributing to
the h i absorption but not d i using yz cmi as an example figure 3a explicitly shows the best
ismonly fit to the data which is clearly unacceptable the fitted d i absorption is too broad
this implies that the widths of the h i and d i absorption are inconsistent with h i too broad
relative to d i in other words there must be excess h i absorption beyond that from the ism
but not d i because of the much lower column density in this line furthermore the fitted d i
absorption profile is blueshifted relative to the observed absorption suggesting that the excess h i
absorption is primarily on the blue side of the line which is indicative of an astrospheric absorption
detection
the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption produce excess absorption on opposite sides of the
 13 
fig 3 a a fit to the h id i lyman line of yz cmi assuming only ism absorption is
present with residuals shown below the fit the h i and d i absorption are forced to be selfconsistent and the resulting fit is poor b a twocomponent fit to the lyman line representing
absorption from both the ism green dashed line and from the stellar astrosphere black dotted
line the combination of the two components thick black line fits the data the hatched region
explicitly indicates the excess absorption due to the astrosphere
ism absorption allowing us to the distinguish between the two when detectable the heliospheric
absorption is apparent as excess absorption on the right side of the ism absorption this redshift is
due to the deceleration and deflection of ism material as it approaches the heliopause in contrast
the astrospheric absorption is blueshifted relative to the ism absorption for the same reason with
the difference being due to our viewpoint outside the astrosphere instead of inside
for the seven cases where hsas absorption is present it is necessary to estimate the nature of
the excess h i absorption with another fit for this purpose we add another absorption component
to the fit that is designed to approximate the hsas absorption regardless of whether the excess
absorption is heliospheric astrospheric or some combination of the two figure 3b shows an
example of the resulting fit for yz cmi consistent with excess absorption on the blue side of the
line which is the astrospheric signature there is a hint of excess on the red side of the line as
well which could be a sign of heliospheric absorption but we do not consider the excess sufficiently
convincing to deem this a heliospheric detection
 14 
as shown in figure 2 we find evidence for astrospheric signatures in six of the spectra gj 887
gj 15a gj 860a gj 205 yz cmi and gj 338a and heliospheric signatures in only three cases
gj 860a gj 205 and gj 588 the detectability of heliospheric absorption depends primarily
on two factors the first is the ism h i column density which if high enough will broaden the
ism absorption enough to obscure the heliospheric signature the second is the angle of the los
relative to the ism flow direction seen by the sun with the heliospheric absorption much easier to
detect closer to upwind directions wood et al 2005b for the three heliospheric detections we
verify that the inferred heliospheric absorption is consistent with expectations by comparing the
observed excess absorption with that predicted by a heliospheric model from wood et al 2000
which we have found in past analyses to be successful in reproducing observed heliospheric lyman
absorption we will say little more about the heliospheric absorption as we are here more interested
in the astrospheric detections and what they imply about the winds of their associated stars
the final h i lyman fit parameters are listed in table 2 we include the parameters of
the hsas components although the properties of the heliosphere andor astrosphere cannot
be successfully quantified using fits of this nature hydrodynamic models are required for any
meaningful quantitative analysis of the hsas absorption as will be described in the next section
finally we note in passing that the intrinsic stellar lyman profiles are also useful products
of this analysis from such profiles integrated lyman line fluxes can be measured which are
excellent diagnostics of stellar chromospheric activity the lyman line fluxes from our analysis
are listed and discussed by melbourne et al 2020 and linsky et al 2020
analysis of m dwarf astrospheric absorption
summary of m dwarf wind constraints from hst
the central goal of our project is to characterize the winds of m dwarf stars using all available
constraints to that end in the top section of table 3 we have compiled a list of all m dwarfs with
relevant lyman observations from hst that can at least in principle yield wind constraints we
include stars within 7 pc that are nondetections since within 7 pc nondetections can possibly provide upper limits for  see section 2 stars listed include the ones mentioned in section 1 namely
the astrospheric absorption detections for ev lac and gj 173 wood et al 2005a vannier et al
in preparation and the transiting exoplanet absorption constraint for gj 436 vidotto  bourrier
2017 also listed is the upper limit for proxima cen from wood et al 2001 another astrospheric nondetection ad leo is also listed wood et al 2005b and we here assess whether these
data can provide a useful  upper limit
the nine target stars of our new hst observing program account for most of the rest of
the m dwarfs in table 3 the exceptions are three additional very nearby stars these include
gj 729 which is part of the megamuscles project hst program go15071 melbourne et al

2020 linsky et al 2020 the other two are gj 699 and gj 411 the analysis of which will be
described elsewhere youngblood et al in preparation they and gj 729 are all astrospheric
nondetections and like the ad leo case noted above we here try to infer upper limits for   the
second section of table 3 lists other  measurements from astrospheric lyman constraints as
previously compiled by wood 2018 finally the bottom section lists slingshot prominence stars
with  measurements from jardine  collier cameron 2019
in the case of binary stars the companion stars are listed if they are nearby enough that
both stars will lie within the same astrosphere meaning that the astrospheric absorption will be a
diagnostic of the combined winds of both stars for example the gj 860ab binary m3 vm4 v
has a separation of only 24  corresponding to a planeofsky distance of only 96 au easily close
enough for both stars to reside within the same astrosphere for gj 644ab there are actually
three stars involved with the observed spectroscopic binary gj 644b m4 vm4 v separated
from gj 644a m3 v by 023  corresponding to a distance of only 15 au
the vism quantity in table 3 is the ism flow speed seen by the star in stellar rest frame and  is
the angle betwen the upwind direction of the ism flow and our los to the star these are quantities
that must be known to infer  from an astrospheric absorption detection as will become clear in
section 42 computing vism and  requires knowledge of the stellar radial velocity and proper
motion very well known for such nearby stars and obtainable from the simbad database and
the lic flow vector from redfield  linsky 2008 given that multiple ism velocity components
are often seen toward even very nearby stars other ism flow vectors besides that of the lic clearly
exist near the sun and may exist around some of our observed stars particularly the ones with
multiple mg ii components see figure 1 however within 7 pc the multiple ism components
when present are generally closely spaced in velocity meaning that the different ism vectors are
similar thus our universal assumption of the lic vector should be a decent approximation as
an example the existence of aur cloud absorption toward gj 273 means that gj 273 probably
lies within the aur cloud instead of the lic using the aur cloud vector from redfield  linsky
2008 we estimate vism  65 km s1 and   86 for gj 273 representing only a small change
from the vism  75 km s1 and   89 values computed using the lic vector
the  column in table 3 lists inferred mass loss rates with new results being described below
in section 42 for four of the previously studied binaries the  has been divided between the
two stars as described by wood 2018 we will be seeking to relate  to coronal activity so
coronal xray luminosities in ergs s1  are also listed based mostly on rosat allsky survey
measurements schmitt  liefke 2004 for binaries that have been resolved in xrays we list
separate log lx values for both stars
finally when comparing  and log lx for stars of different sizes it is appropriate to normalize
by stellar surface area so we also list in table 3 the stellar radii that we are assuming for the m
dwarfs the radii are mostly from houdebine et al 2019 however for gj 644ab no individual
radii measurements exist for the three individual stars in this system so we simply assume a typical
 17 
radius for midm dwarfs r  03 r  for all three stars
hydrodynamic modeling of astrospheres
our hst survey of nearby m dwarfs has yielded detections of astrospheric absorption in six
of nine cases the 67 astrospheric detection percentage is consistent with the high detection
fraction previously found for stars within 7 pc wood 2018 this in turn is consistent with the
notion that the local ism within 7 pc is predominantly like the warm partly neutral ism known
to surround the sun as opposed to the fully ionized ism that more generally characterizes the lb
it is therefore likely that the three nondetections of astrospheric absorption are due to weak stellar
winds meaning that we will be able to infer upper limits for the stellar wind massloss rates for
these nondetections
estimating stellar massloss rates from astrospheric absorption requires guidance from hydrodynamic models of the astrosphere analogous to models of the global heliosphere that have been
computed for decades to confront heliospheric observations from spacecraft such as voyager and
the interstellar boundary explorer ibex analogous to past studies wood et al 2005a 2014
the code we use to model the astrospheres is a 25d axisymmetric multifluid code that treats
the plasma as a single fluid but the neutral hydrogen as multiple fluids corresponding to distinct
heliospheric regions in which charge exchange yields different populations of neutrals which do not
equilibrate with the plasma or with each other due to the low densities zank et al 1996 the
neutral and plasma fluids interact primarily through charge exchange interactions involving an
electron jumping from a neutral h atom to a proton
the heliospheric model that has long represented the starting point for our analysis is one that
has consistently demonstrated its ability to reproduce heliospheric absorption detected for various
lines of sight in various directions while assuming plausible values for the ism boundary conditions
of the heliosphere including the local isms flow velocity in the solar rest frame vism  26 km s1
wood et al 2000 2005b we have already noted its success in reproducing the heliospheric
absorption seen for three of our nine observed lines of sight
an astrospheric model assuming a solar massloss rate is computed by changing vism in the
heliospheric model to the value appropriate for the star see table 3 while keeping everything else
the same in order to experiment with different assumed stellar massloss rates we simply vary
the assumed stellar wind density at the inner boundary which is typically at 1 au from the star
from such models we can compute the absorption predicted by the model by integrating along
the los through the astrosphere with a direction defined by the  value in table 3 higher 
values naturally lead to larger astrospheres larger hydrogen wall column densities and therefore
more lyman absorption rather than varying the stellar wind density to modify   we could
alternatively vary the stellar wind velocity vw  however along the lower main sequence stellar
mass and radius happen to vary in such a way that the surface escape speed is relatively constant
 18 
this provides some reason to believe that the winds of lower main sequence stars might all have
similar speeds given that the solar wind velocity is similar to the suns surface escape speed of 618
km s1  the astrospheric absorption is to first order determined by the size scale of the astrosphere
which depends on the stellar wind ram pressure pw  since pw   vw  mass loss rate estimates
will vary inversely with the assumed vw wood et al 2002
we have in the past estimated that  values measured in this way should be accurate to within
about a factor of two wood et al 2005a with important systematic uncertainties including the
unknown degree of variation in ism properties from star to star and possible differences in stellar
wind speed the accuracy of the physics in the heliosphericastrospheric modeling code is another
source of uncertainty but this model dependence is not as crucial as one might suppose because
the approach of extrapolating the astrospheric models from a heliospheric model that reproduces
the heliospheric absorption makes the procedure somewhat semiempirical the physics of how an
astrospheres size and lyman absorption properties respond to changes in vism and stellar wind
density is relatively simple depending on the balance of ram pressure between the two flows so
these changes should be relatively insensitive to the details of the physics in the model being used
thus there is little reason to believe that replacing our code with more sophisticated ones that are
now available would change our conclusions significantly more sophisticated models include ones
that are fully 3d including heliospheric and ism magnetic fields and ones with a fully kinetic
treatment of the neutrals eg izmodenov et al 2009 pogorelov et al 2013 opher et al 2015
figure 4 shows the lyman lines of the six m dwarfs with newly detected astrospheric absorption zooming in on the blue side of the h i absorption profile where the astrospheric absorption
lies the figure also shows the absorption predicted by a variety of astrospheric models with different assumed massloss rates after being added to the ism absorption astrospheric absorption
naturally increases as  is increased due to a larger astrosphere with a thicker hydrogen wall and
higher h i column densities along the observed los through the astrosphere
judging which model best reproduces the observed absorption involves some degree of subjectivity the discrepancy with the data naturally varies along the side of the h i absorption profile
it is generally more important to fit the data near the base of the absorption than higher along the
side of the profile because reasonable adjustments to the shape of the assumed stellar lyman
emission profile can in principle improve discrepancies at higher flux levels such corrections are
harder near the base of the absorption as the necessary adjustments to the stellar profile would
introduce implausible fine structure into the profile
the  values that best fit the data are listed in table 3 and figure 5 shows h i density maps
for the bestfit astrospheric models the highest h i densities along the los to the star are in the
hydrogen wall region which is the parabolashaped reddish or purplishred region seen in each
panel this is where the ism material is piled up outside of the stellar astropause with the outer
edge of the hydrogen wall marking the location of the stellar bow shock it is this hydrogen wall
region that generally dominates the astrospheric absorption signature not just due to the higher
 19 
fig 4 the blue side of the h i lyman lines for the six new astrospheric absorption detections
the green dashed lines show the ism absorption and the blue lines show the additional astrospheric
absorption predicted by models assuming various massloss rates
h i densities but also due to the decelerated flow speeds and relatively high temperatures at that
location as the ism passes through the stellar bow shock it is heated as well as compressed and
decelerated it turns out that the situation is somewhat different for yz cmi as will be described
in section 43
the size of the astrospheres in figure 5 varies tremendously depending on both vism and
  the smallest astrosphere is that of gj 205 with an upwind bow shock distance of only about
30 au due to both a high ism flow speed of vism  70 km s1 and a low massloss rate of
  03   this can be compared with the huge astrosphere of yz cmi with an upwind bow
shock distance of 2000 au due to both a low ism flow speed of vism  20 km s1 and a high
massloss rate of   30   it is from these bestfit astrosphere models that we can confirm
that the astrospheres of the binaries gj 15ab gj 860ab and gj 338ab are indeed large enough
to encompass both members of the binary meaning that the stellar wind that is being diagnosed
is that of the combined winds of both stars
turning our attention to the astrospheric nondetections within 7 pc we note that there are
eight of these listed in table 3 for one of them proxima cen there is already a published upper
limit of   02   we now seek to infer upper limits for the other seven stars for gj 729
 20 
fig 5 maps of h i density for the astrospheric models that yield the best fits to the data in
figure 4 the laminar ism wind seen by the star comes from the right solid lines indicate the
observed sunstar line of sight
and ad leo we ultimately conclude that no useful  constraints can be inferred primarily due
to the very low vism values for these stars see table 3 this greatly complicates the astrospheric
modeling in part due to the kinds of physical effects discussed in the next subsection about yz cmi
which also has low vism though not nearly as low as gj 729 and ad leo
the lyman spectra of the remaining five m dwarf astrospheric nondetections are shown in
figure 6 where we are once again zooming in on the blue side of the h i absorption line where
the astrospheric absorption would be if any had been detected we note again that the original
analyses of gj 699 and gj 411 are presented elsewhere youngblood et al in preparation for
each star models are constructed assuming different  to see how large  must be for there to
have been detectable astrospheric absorption for the observed los analogous to the situation for
the astrospheric detections there is some subjectivity in deciding how much excess astrospheric
absorption must be predicted beyond that from the ism before it should be considered detectable
figure 6 illustrates the predicted absorption of the models that we decide represent the upper
limits these range from   01  for gj 411 to   5  for gj 588 and gj 644ab
the h i number density maps of the upper limit astrospheric models are shown in figure 7
the lines of sight to gj 588 and gj 644ab are particularly downwind which is not advantageous
 21 
fig 6 the blue side of the h i lyman lines for five astrospheric absorption nondetections
for which we infer upper limits for   the green dashed lines show the ism absorption and the
blue lines show the additional astrospheric absorption predicted by the models that produce just
enough absorption that we deem the absorption to be likely detectable thereby defining our 
upper limit
for detecting astrospheric absorption missing the most detectable part of the hydrogen wall this
in part explains the relatively high upper limits for  for these stars the upper limit models for
gj 699 and gj 411 have upwind bow shock distances of only about 10 au due primarily to high
vism  considering that these are upper limits these astrospheres are clearly very small easily the
most compact astrospheres inferred so far using the astrospheric lyman absorption diagnostic
considering all the m dwarf  constraints from table 3 together we now have actual 
measurements for nine stars and upper limits for six for 13 of the 15 m dwarfs the results are
consistent with the winds being comparable or weaker to the solar wind weak winds for m dwarfs
are not surprising considering the small size of these stars however m dwarfs can be surprisingly
active with frequent and energetic flares so higher  values might have been expected as well
there are two m dwarf  measurements that clearly stick out for being unusually high gj 15ab
with   10   and yz cmi with   30   before discussing the implications of these
results further it is necessary to discuss some important and unique characteristics of the yz cmi
astrosphere
 22

yz cmi new physics for astrospheric absorption
heliospheric and astrospheric lyman absorption has been detected for many lines of sight
toward nearby stars despite h i column densities that are 3  5 orders of magnitude lower than
the ism h i column densities for these lines of sight astrospheric absorption is nevertheless
detectable because as the ism approaches an astrosphere it is heated and decelerated as it nears
the astropause which is the boundary separating the plasma flows of the stellar wind and the
ism the heating results in a broader absorption profile which helps to extend the astrospheric
absorption in wavelength beyond that from the ism and the deceleration shifts the absorption
blueward creating the excess blueside absorption that characterizes the astrospheric absorption
signature
both the heating and deceleration effects are highly dependent on the ism flow speed seen by
the star vism  the sun sees vism  2608  021 km s1 wood et al 2015 this happens to
correspond to a flow with a mach number of m  1 leading to much debate in the space physics
community about whether there is a bow shock in front of the heliosphere or whether no real
shock exists and that the pileup region outside the heliopause is better characterized as a bow
 23 
wave zank et al 2013 even without a bow shock there will still be adiabatic deceleration
compression and heating of the material in the bow wave and there is no truly dramatic decrease
in heliospheric absorption for the bow wave case with m  1 compared to a bow shock case with
m  1 zank et al 2013 nevertheless it is no accident that nearly all the astrospheric detections
listed in table 3 have vism higher than the solar example this makes the existence of a bow
shock far less ambiguous than for the sun producing more heating and deceleration of the ism
outside the astropause than the solar case making the astrospheric absorption more detectable
in selecting targets for our hst m dwarf observing program we tried to avoid stars with low
vism  nevertheless an exception was made for yz cmi for our sample we wanted to include
at least a couple very active m dwarfs which still had to be within 7 pc for reasons discussed in
section 2 the best available target after gj 644 was yz cmi we have been rewarded for this
choice by the clear detection of astrospheric absorption for this star see figure 3 despite the low
vism  20 km s1 value furthermore our astrospheric models are indeed able to reproduce the
absorption well with a sufficiently high massloss rate of   30  see figure 4 however
examination of the yz cmi astrospheric model reveals that the astrospheric absorption has an
origin somewhat different from other astrospheric detections which requires more discussion
like all other cases of astrospheric absorption hydrogen wall neutrals are the source of the
absorption which are a population of neutral h created by charge exchange with the ism protons
that have been heated by passage through the bow shock or by compression in the bow wave the
difference for yz cmi is that the absorption is not coming primarily from the hydrogen wall itself
where neutral h densities are highest the yellow and reddish region along the los in figure 5
but from neutrals very near and inside the astropause the blue and green region along the los
in figure 5 the neutrals have an unexpectedly high temperature in this location explaining why
they produce more absorption than the bulk of the particle population in the hydrogen wall region
to explore this further figure 8 shows maps of number density and temperature for protons
and for neutral h h0  for the   30  yz cmi model the h and h0 temperatures
within the hydrogen wall are generally rather low t  15 000 k such temperatures are expected
given the low vism  20 km s1 speed of the ism flow and are not conducive to producing
detectable astrospheric absorption another problem is the lessthanideal crosswind los to the
star there will be some blueward shift of the hydrogen wall flow relative to the ism flow due
to deflection around the astrosphere but not as much as if the los were upwind in short it
is questionable whether the yz cmi hydrogen wall could yield detectable astrospheric absorption
even for high values of  
however the h  temperature is actually surprisingly high just outside the astropause with
t  6104 k although densities are significantly lower here the large size of the astrosphere means
that there is still a significant amount of charge exchange happening thereby creating significant
numbers of hydrogen wall neutrals with these high temperatures some of which can cross the
astropause and dominate the part of the los inside the astropause since our multifluid code
 24 
fig 8 maps of h and h0 number density and temperature for the   30  yz cmi
model locations of the termination shock ts and astropause ap are indicated the straight
solid black line indicates our los to the star
uses a single maxwellian fluid to represent all neutrals produced by charge exchange within the
hydrogen wall the mixture of hot neutrals produced very close to the astropause with the cooler
neutrals produced in the bulk of the hydrogen wall yield h0 temperatures along the los that are
t  30 000  50 000 k near and inside the astropause see figure 8d despite the relatively low
h0 densities in this area the huge astrospheric size means that there is still sufficient h i column
density for these neutrals to yield detectable absorption this absorption exceeds that from the
much denser but much cooler hydrogen wall itself and this is actually the source of the absorption
shown in figure 4
the conclusion is that the immediate source of the astrospheric absorption signature for
yz cmi is charge exchange with this surprisingly hot h just outside the astropause but what
is heating the h there the answer is that it is being heated by outward heat transport across
the astropause from neutrals created by charge exchange inside the astropause some of which then
cross the astropause and dump their energy outside of it via another charge exchange interaction
figure 9 provides an illustration of the sequence of two charge exchange interactions that allow this
to happen the inner astrosheath region just inside the astropause is very hot as it is characterized
by stellar wind that is heated significantly by its passage through the termination shock however
this region has very low densities see figure 8a although ism neutrals can penetrate the as

in purple can be transported across the astropause and there heat the plasma
tropause and charge exchange there in most cases there are too few of these interactions for them
to be important however the yz cmi astrosphere in figure 8 is so large that there are enough of
these inner astrosheath neutrals created to transport significant amounts of energy out of the inner
astrosheath and into the part of the hydrogen wall just outside the astropause with the energy
deposited via another charge exchange reaction potential effects of this kind of anomalous heating
have been discussed before in the context of heliospheric models eg zank et al 2013 but with
yz cmi we have for the first time encountered a case where this heating across the astropause
has become more important than any heating occurring within the actual bow shockwave with
regards to yielding detectable h i absorption
one downside to the different physics involved in the yz cmi astrospheric absorption signature
is that it undoubtedly increases the uncertainty in our  measurement the arguments in section 42 about the relative unimportance of model dependence for the  measurements no longer
apply since the physics of the yz cmi absorption is significantly different from the physics of the
heliospheric lyman absorption in the baseline heliospheric model from which all of the astrospheric models are basically extrapolated this is definitely a case where further modeling efforts
would be worthwhile particularly models that include a fully kinetic treatment of the neutrals the
enhanced uncertainty in the yz cmi measurement is problematic considering how important this

measurement potentially is representing the highest  per unit surface area yet detected via the
astrospheric lyman absorption diagnostic nevertheless in our discussion of the ramifications of
our new  measurements in the next section the high yz cmi  measurement will be assumed
valid
implications of the m dwarf wind measurements
relating  and coronal activity
with the new m dwarf  measurements provided here we can try to characterize the winds
of m dwarfs for the first time this is most naturally done in a plot like figure 10 showing mass
loss rate per unit surface area plotted versus xray surface flux this is done not only for the m
 27 
dwarfs but for the other stars listed in table 3 as well for the solar data point the mean solar
xray luminosity assumed is from judge et al 2003 this would vary by about a factor of 4 over
the course of the activity cycle ayres 2020
trying to relate  with fx is natural given that hot coronae represent the source regions
of coronal winds the existence and basic characteristics of the solar wind can to first order be
understood as simple thermal expansion from the hot solar corona parker 1958 nevertheless it
is far from obvious a priori that  and fx should be correlated given that coronal xray emission
originates from coronal loops which are closed magnetic fields with both footpoints tied to the
photosphere while coronal wind will be coming from open field regions with only one footpoint
tied to the photosphere and the other end of the field line extending out into the astrosphere for
the sun no correlation between  and fx is observed during the solar activity cycle cohen 2011
nevertheless figure 10 seems to show a general trend of increasing  with fx  albeit with
lots of scatter a power law fit to the data points excluding the subgiantgiant stars yields
  fx077004  as shown in the figure this is a somewhat flatter relation than the   fx134018
result previously reported for the gk stars alone excluding  boo a and  1 uma wood et al
2005a the impression of a wide range of  at a given fx value is greatly increased with the
inclusion of the numerous new m dwarf data points the m dwarf measurements suggest that
main sequence stars with a given fx value can have  values that vary by up to two orders of
magnitude this impression relies heavily on the two m dwarfs with surprisingly strong winds
gj 15ab star 6 with   10  and yz cmi star 13 with   30   the gj 15ab
measurement is well over an order of magnitude higher than the   015  05  measurements
for gj 860ab gj 205 and gj 338ab stars 8 11 and 15 which have similar fx  at a
higher activity level the yz cmi measurement is 30 times higher than that of ev lac star 10
despite similar fx 
the yz cmi data point is also notable for being the one astrospheric lyman measurement that overlaps with the region of figure 10 occupied by the slingshot prominence winds the
slingshot prominence stars are all characterized by extremely rapid rotation the fastest rotator among the stars with astrospheric measurements is indeed yz cmi with prot  278 days
diez alonso et al 2019 but this is still much slower than the slingshot prominence stars with
prot  05 days jardine  collier cameron 2019 nevertheless villarreal dangelo et al 2018
find that both yz cmi and ev lac are rotating fast enough to be in the centrifugal confinement
regime that could allow the slingshot prominence phenomenon to exist and they estimate potential
mass loss rates for yz cmi and ev lac of up to   07  and   028   respectively
these are lower than our measurements and therefore consistent it is possible that some fraction
of the wind that we are detecting for yz cmi and ev lac could consist of slingshot prominence
material
considering only the gk dwarfs in figure 10 the impression is of a comparatively tight relation
between  and fx for log fx  60 with the two surprisingly low  values with log fx  60
 28 
suggesting a change of behavior in the  fx relation for log fx  60 in the past this had
been referred to as a possible wind dividing line wood et al 2005a 2014 the existence of
such a dividing line is clearly weakened by the new m dwarf measurements with their inclusion
the two low gk dwarf data points no longer appear clearly inconsistent with the high gk dwarf
measurements seen at slightly lower activity given the high degree of scatter apparent in the loose
 fx relation
the  measurements available to date now imply that coronal wind strength is not dependent
solely on spectral type and coronal activity though this inference relies heavily on just two of
the new m dwarf measurements without the gj 15ab and yz cmi data points figure 10
would suggest that m dwarfs all have rather low   regardless of activity and their winds may
be exhibiting different behavior compared to the gk dwarf winds at moderate to high activity
with only two strong m dwarf winds found to date it would be helpful in the future if other
examples of strong m dwarf winds could be found to provide support for the gj 15ab and
yz cmi measurements
our wind measurements can be compared with predictions from theory for example cranmer  saar
2011 use an alfvn wave driven wind model to predict massloss rates for a wide range of cool
stars however their predictions for m dwarfs are very low   0005   clearly inconsistent
with our results cranmer  saar 2011 suggest that m dwarf winds may actually be dominated not by alfvn wave driving but by cmes a possibility we will return to in section 54
other alfvn wave based models infer more substantial m dwarf winds without resorting to cmes
vidotto et al 2014 alvaradogmez et al 2016 mesquita  vidotto 2020 these models predict
increases in wind strength with stellar activity qualitatively consistent with the observed relation
in figure 10 although quantitative comparison with the models is complicated by the extensive
scatter in the data for example suzuki et al 2013 predict   fx082  in good agreement with
the observed   fx077004  it is possible that mass loss might depend on magnetic complexity
as well as diskaveraged magnetic flux garraffo et al 2015 which could in principle contribute to
the scatter
the effects of wind variability
one possible interpretation of the scatter in the relation between coronal activity and wind
strength seen in figure 10 is that this is due to wind variability in this interpretation the discrepancy between the winds of the similar stars ev lac and yz cmi is simply due to temporal
variability rather than being indicative of any fundamental difference in wind behavior for these
stars evalulating this possibility requires an evaluation of the timescale over which our wind
measurements are applicable
this timescale will depend on the length of time it takes a wind ram pressure signal to reach
the hydrogen wall region well beyond the astropause this naturally depends on the size of the
 29 
astrosphere for the solar example it takes the solar wind roughly 6 months to make it to the
termination shock at which point it is decelerated to even slower speeds this means that it takes
many years for any change in solar wind pressure to register at the heliopause timedependent
modeling of the heliosphere eg pogorelov et al 2013 suggests only a very weak variation in
heliopause distance even on activity cycle timescales and heliospheric absorption is coming from
even further distances from the sun as a consequence we do not expect there to be any observable
change in heliospheric lyman absorption even on decadal timescales let alone shorter ones
returning to the ev lacyz cmi comparison the ev lac astrosphere is somewhat more
compact than the heliosphere wood et al 2005a due to higher vism  but the yz cmi astrosphere
is much bigger see figure 8 our large  value for yz cmi will be characteristic of the average
mass loss over a period of many decades if not centuries depending on the exact stellar wind
speed if the astrosphere of yz cmi has ever been smaller and characteristic of a weaker wind like
that of ev lac it has not been for a long time in general attributing the scatter in figure 10 to
wind variability seems unlikely due to the lack of sensitivity of the astrospheric wind measurements
to short timescale variability
relating  and magnetic topology
if spectral type and coronal activity level are not solely determinative of   what is the
missing factor one likely candidate is coronal topology it is possible to envision two stars with
similar fx values but with the coronal emission and associated magnetic field distributed very
differently across the stellar surface which could lead to different wind properties exploring this
possibility requires knowledge of the magnetic field topology of our sample of stars fortunately
information about this is in fact available for many of the stars in the table 3 sample thanks to
spectropolarimetric measurements morin et al 2008b a recent survey of such observations for m
dwarfs is provided by kochukhov 2021 in this section we try to relate our wind measurements
to field properties inferred by the spectropolarimetric analyses
the m dwarfs in our sample with spectropolarimetric constraints are ev lac morin et al
2008b yz cmi morin et al 2008b proxima cen klein et al 2021 and gj 205 hbrard et al
2016 there are nine other stars in table 3 with spectropolarimetric measurements these include
studies of 61 cyg a  eri  ind  1 uma and  boo ab which vidotto et al 2016 previously
sought to relate to wind properties and finally we also consider studies of gj 892 folsom et al
2018  and fionnagin et al 2021 and v347 peg morin et al 2008a this last star being one
of the slingshot prominence stars
figure 11 provides an illustration of the spectropolarimetric differences amongst the stars in
our sample it is essentially a reproduction of figure 10 but with symbols used to indicate various

fig 11 a reproduction of figure 10 but symbols are used to indicate properties of the magnetic
topology inferred from spectropolarimetry where available as indicated by the key to the right of
the plot the size of the symbol indicates the magnitude of the square of the surface field the color
of the symbol indicates the relative amount of poloidal and toroidal field with dark blue being
purely toroidal and dark red being entirely poloidal and the shape of the symbol indicates the
degree of axisymmetry with a decagon representing a purely axisymmetric field and a star with
narrow arms representing a symmetric field a point is plotted for a solar minimum sun star

the color of the symbols indicates the relative importance of poloidal and toroidal fields and the
shape of the symbols indicates the degree of axisymmetry of the field a point is plotted for the
sun at solar minimum vidotto 2016
as expected the more active stars with the higher fx values tend to have the stronger fields
as indicated by the larger symbol sizes in figure 11 there is nevertheless a very wide range in 
among these more active stars the three stars with the weakest winds stars 27a 30 and 31
have the most toroidal dominant fields suggesting a possible connection between toroidal fields and
weak winds as for the m dwarf stars that are our focal point here the ev lacyz cmi comparison
is once again of particular interest stars 10 and 13 the biggest spectropolarimetric difference
between these two stars lies in the inferred degree of field axisymmetry with yz cmi possessing
a very axisymmetric field and ev lac exhibiting a strong departure from axisymmetry it is
ev lac that seems more unusual in the morin et al 2008b sample of m dwarfs implying that
 31 
yz cmi may be more typical of very active m dwarfs however ev lac also is a somewhat
slower rotator than the other stars in the sample with prot  437 days see et al 2019 estimate
similar magnetic filling factors for ev lac and yz cmi although their analysis does not distinguish
between open and closed magnetic fields
the picture of the yz cmi field provided by morin et al 2008b is that of a highly dipolar axisymmetric field however the spectropolarimetric data is open to interpretation and
shulyak et al 2014 provide a somewhat different picture of the overall field topology of yz cmi
in their analysis they find evidence for a significant zerofield component for the surface of yz cmi
in contrast to the other active m dwarfs in their study this could be interpreted as a stellar analog
for coronal holes which on the sun are locations of weak surface fields and open field lines where
high speed wind streams are escaping
the ev lacyz cmi dichotomy is not the only example of two seemingly similar active
m dwarfs with surprisingly different field properties another example is the gj 65ab binary
bl cetiuv ceti consisting of two very similar very active midm dwarfs which nevertheless
have very different magnetic topologies kochukhov  lavail 2018 this difference is likely connected to differences in xray and radio behavior for these two coeval stars which has persisted for
decades gary  linsky 1981 audard et al 2003 ideally wind measurements would be made for
gj 65a and gj 65b separately to see how the differences in these coeval stars impact their winds
but the astrospheric absorption technique will not work as the two stars are close enough to share
the same astrosphere meaning that only the combined strength of the two stellar winds could be
measured
besides ev lac and yz cmi the only other two m dwarfs in our sample with both astrospheric
 constraints and spectropolarimetric measurements are gj 205 star 11 and proxima cen star
1 which are less active and have much longer rotation periods the former has a very poloidal
axisymmetric field topology analogous to yz cmi albeit with a much weaker overall field strength
as expected for a more inactive star with a lengthy rotation period of prot  336 days despite the
topological similarities with yz cmi the stellar wind of gj 205   03   is over two orders
of magnitude weaker than that of yz cmi per unit surface area like gj 205 proxima cen also
has a long rotation period prot  898  40 day and a wind much weaker than that of yz cmi
  02   but unlike gj 205 its magnetic topology more resembles ev lac with significant
deviation from axisymmetry
the large scale field topology of a star is ultimately tied to the properties of its internal
dynamo which also determines the nature of any longterm activity cycle it might have in studies
relating activity cycle periods with rotation rates there is a suggestion of a bimodality in dynamo
operation for stars with relatively fast rotation periods of prot  22 days the two modes consist
of an inactive branch with very short activity cycles pcyc  5 yr and an active branch with much
longer cycles brandenburg et al 1998 metcalfe et al 2016 there is a hint of possible bimodality
in figure 10 as well for the more active stars separating ones with low  and those with high  
 32 
this impression is particuarly acute for the m dwarfs with gj 15ab and yz cmi having winds
over an order of magnitude stronger than all the other m stars it is worth noting that ev lac has
a reported short activity cycle of pcyc  5 yr mavridis  avgoloupis 1986 while the similarly
active yz cmi with a much stronger wind has a much longer activity cycle of pcyc  275 yr
bondar  katsova 2018
clearly more work is needed to explore how  and magnetic topology might be related for stars
of various spectral types and activity levels particularly valuable would be spectropolarimetric
measurements for gj 15ab to try to explain why that binary has such a strong wind
are m dwarf winds dominated by cmes
the solar wind is characterized by a more or less continuous steady flow of plasma from the
corona however there is a transient component to the wind namely the cmes the mass lost from
the sun due to cmes is over an order of magnitude less than the suns total mass loss mishra et al
2019 but the cmes are still numerous enough to be important in many contexts such as space
weather impacts on the earth and other planets particularly at times of solar maximum solar
flares are often associated with cmes though it is important to note that there are slow cmes
that occur with no associated flare and indeed no associated surface activity at all particularly
at solar minimum wood et al 2017 conversely although it is true that strong m and xclass
flares on the sun are usually found to be associated with a fast cme emanating from above the
flare site this is not always the case sun et al 2015
for the sun a strong correlation is found between flare strength as quantified by xray luminosity and cme mass eg aarnio et al 2011 given that we have very limited observational
knowledge about the nature of cmes emanating from other stars it is natural to apply solar
flarecme relations to active stars that flare more frequently and energetically in order to estimate what cmes might contribute to the stellar winds of these stars moschou et al 2019
however doing this for truly active stars invariably leads to conclusions that such stars should
have winds hundreds or thousands of times stronger than the solar wind simply due to cmes
alone eg drake et al 2013 odert et al 2017 such conclusions are in obvious conflict with our
astrospheric wind measurements which suggest only modest massloss rates for m dwarfs
young rapidly rotating active m dwarfs are well known for particularly frequent and energetic
flaring and ev lac and yz cmi within our sample of m dwarfs are two of the most notorious
sources of massive flares these include true superflares eg kowalski et al 2010 including one
for ev lac that triggered a gamma ray burst detector and is estimated to have produced xray
fluxes at flare peak that exceeded the quiescent bolometric luminosity of the star osten et al 2010
we note that a large uv flare occurred right at the end of our stise140h yz cmi observation
in addition to a few smaller flares given the frequency of such activity as demonstrated further in
the recent study of maehara et al 2021 even the relatively large   30  value that we find
 33 
for yz cmi seems surprisingly modest let alone the older   1  measurement for ev lac
clearly the strong connection between flares and fast massive cmes on the sun cannot
extend to flare stars like ev lac and yz cmi for such stars cmes must be far less common or
far less massive than one might expect given the frequent flaring there are other observations that
support this conclusion attempts to detect radio type ii bursts from flaring m dwarfs associated
with cme shocks have so far proved unsuccessful crosley  osten 2018ab villadsen  hallinan
2019 another observational signature that has been occasionally observed during flares and
interpreted as indicating a cme eruption is doppler shifted emission or absorption in optical
hydrogen balmer lines during flares as a cme signature this is imperfect as it is more of a
signature of an erupting prominence than a cme but on the sun such prominence eruptions
often end up embedded within cmes wood et al 2017 systematic attempts to detect balmer
signatures have generally found that they are very rare and this rarity could indicate that stellar
cmes are not as frequent from active stars as one might think leitzinger et al 2020 muheki et al
2020 odert et al 2020
the sun itself provides examples of what may be happening on active flare stars as there
are many solar cases of strong flares with no associated cmes at all the most recent and best
studied examples are flares from active region ar 12192 this was the biggest active region of the
last solar cycle and the most productive of strong flares particularly in 2014 october but almost
none of the flares from ar 12192 had associated cmes sun et al 2015 thalmann et al 2015
on the sun this behavior is unusual but on active stars perhaps this is the norm the cause of
this may be strong magnetic field overlying active regions that confines the flare and inhibits cme
eruption numerical simulations of cmes on active stars made in recent years include models of
such confined eruptions alvaradogmez et al 2018 2019a 2020b
despite the difficulties in detecting cmes on other stars we still cannot rule out the possibility
that the stellar winds that we are detecting for m dwarfs are cmedominated our measurements
will typically be indicative of the average wind ram pressure over years if not decades see section 52 and there is currently no way to tell whether this ram pressure signal is dominated by
cmes or quiescent wind
implications for m dwarf exoplanet habitability
one important application of our new m dwarf wind measurements is to better understand
the environment of exoplanets around such stars remarkably nearly half of the m dwarfs listed
in table 3 are already known exoplanet hosts proxima cen gj 699 gj 411 gj 887 gj 15a
gj 273 gj 338b and gj 436 planets in habitable zones around m dwarfs are of particular
interest due to the ubiquity of m dwarfs it seems likely that most planets in stellar habitable
zones within the galaxy will be orbiting m stars dressing  charbonneau 2015 one of these in
fact exists around our nearest stellar neighbor proxima cen angladaescud et al 2016
 34 
the habitable zones of m dwarfs are much closer to the stars than for later type stars so
planets in such locations will potentially be exposed to much higher particle fluxes from stellar
winds assessments of the potential impact of this wind exposure on planets in m dwarf systems
have been underway for some time eg vidotto et al 2013 garraffo et al 2016 dong et al 2017
alvaradogmez et al 2019b 2020a and these studies will greatly benefit from the constraints
on m dwarf winds provided here
the question of whether m dwarf habitable zone planets are truly habitable is in part tied to
the question of whether intense exposure of such stars to stellar flares cmes and energetic particles would make habitability impossible eg khodachenko et al 2007 youngblood et al 2017
however we have noted in the previous section that cmes from m dwarfs may be much less
common than generally thought despite the high flare rate so perhaps cme exposure is not as
big a factor for habitability as often supposed furthermore since in the solar example damaging interplanetary energetic particles originate from cme shocks rather than from flares if fast
cmes are less common than generally thought perhaps energetic particle fluxes are also lower
fraschetti et al 2019 exoplanets in m dwarf habitable zones will certainly be exposed to high
xray fluxes both from quiescent coronal emission and flares there is no avoiding that but it
remains highly questionable whether cmes and energetic particles from stellar activity are a major
factor
summary
we report on the results of an analysis of h i lyman lines of nine m dwarf stars observed by
hststis for purposes of studying astrospheric lyman absorption and estimating  for these
stars our results allow us to truly characterize the coronal winds of m dwarfs for the first time
our findings are summarized as follows
1 six of our nine hststis targets yield successful detections of astrospheric lyman absorption
this high detection fraction is consistent with previous studies of stars within 7 pc consistent
with the idea that the local ism within 7 pc is analogous to the warm partially neutral ism
that surrounds the sun rather than the fully ionized plasma that predominates within the
local bubble
2 with our new measurements there are now nine m dwarf  measurements and six meaningful
 upper limits based on hst lyman studies of these 15 constraints 13 are consistent
with weak winds of   1   however even if generally weak early m dwarfs seem to
have coronal winds comparable to that of the sun when normalized by surface area there
are two m dwarfs that appear to have unusually strong winds yz cmi m4 ve   30 
and gj 15ab m2 vm35 v   10 
3 the nature of the astrospheric absorption for yz cmi is somewhat different than any observed

before due mainly to the very low ism flow speed of vism  20 km s1 seen by the star
the heating in the hydrogen wall is here mainly from heat transport across the astropause
via charge exchange rather than heating at a bow shock
4 a new plot of  per unit surface area versus fx for all main sequence stars including the
new m dwarf measurements suggests a general increase of  with coronal activity but with
a roughly two order of magnitude scatter of  about the   fx077004 trend line this
argues that coronal activity and spectral type alone do not determine wind properties with
magnetic topology being one possible extra factor involved the evidence for a wind dividing
line previously suggested for gk dwarfs at a log fx  60 is now much weaker
5 the m dwarf wind measurements are inconsistent with the kind of supermassive cmedominated
wind that would be expected if the solar relation between flare energy and cme mass were
extrapolated to active m dwarfs thus the flarecme connection that seems so strong on
the sun eg aarnio et al 2011 does not seem to apply to m dwarfs however it is still
possible that the winds that we detect for m dwarfs could be cmedominated rather than
quiescent in nature
6 the new m dwarf wind constraints have important ramifications for the habitability of exoplanets around these stars particularly the implication that cmes may not be nearly as prevalent
around such stars as is sometimes assumed
