abstract
we present a global interpretation of higgs diboson and top quark production and decay
measurements from the lhc in the framework of the standard model effective field theory
smeft at dimension six we constrain simultaneously 36 independent directions in its parameter space and compare the outcome of the global analysis with that from individual and
twoparameter fits our results are obtained by means of stateoftheart theoretical calculations
for the sm and the eft crosssections and account for both linear and quadratic corrections
in the 12 expansion we demonstrate how the inclusion of nlo qcd and o 4 effects is
instrumental to accurately map the posterior distributions associated to the fitted wilson coefficients we assess the interplay and complementarity between the top quark higgs and diboson
measurements deploy a variety of statistical estimators to quantify the impact of each dataset in
the parameter space and carry out fits in bsminspired scenarios such as the topphilic model
our results represent a stepping stone in the ongoing program of modelindependent searches
at the lhc from precision measurements and pave the way towards yet more global smeft
interpretations extended to other highpt processes as well as to lowenergy observables

introduction
a powerful modelindependent framework to constrain identify and parametrise potential
deviations with respect to the predictions of the standard model sm is provided by the standard model effective field theory smeft 13 see also 4 for a review a particularly
attractive feature of the smeft is its capability to systematically correlate deviations from
the sm between different processes for example between higgs and top quark crosssections
or between highpt and flavor observables
a direct consequence of this model independence is the high dimensionality of the parameter space spanned by the relevant higherdimensional eft operators indeed the number of
wilson coefficients constrained in typical smeft analyses can vary between just a few up to
the several tens or even hundreds depending on the specific assumptions adopted concerning
the flavour family nonuniversality of the couplings and cpsymmetry structure among
others of the uvcomplete theory for this reason the full exploitation of the smeft potential for indirect new physics searches from precision measurements requires combining the
information provided by the broadest possible dataset
the phenomenology of the smeft has attracted significant attention with most analyses
focusing on specific sectors of the parameter space and groups of processes some of these
recent studies have targeted the top quark properties 58 the higgs and electroweak gauge
sector 911 single and double gauge boson production 1215 vectorboson scattering 14
16 17 and flavour and lowenergy observables 1820 among several others furthermore
analyses that combine the constraints of different groups of processes in the eft parameter
space such as the higgs and electroweak sector with the top quark one 21 or top quark
data with bmeson observables 22 23 have also been presented these and related studies
demonstrate that a global interpretation of the smeft is unavoidable and makes possible
benefiting from hitherto unexpected connections such as the correlation of the lhcb flavour
anomalies 24 25 at the bmeson scale with the highpt tails at the lhc 15 26
with the ultimate motivation of performing a truly global eft interpretation of particle
physics data the smefit fitting framework was developed in 7 and applied to the analysis of the top quark properties at the lhc as a proofofconcept this novel eft fitting
methodology inspired by techniques deployed by the nnpdf collaboration to determine the
protons parton distribution functions pdfs 2731 made possible constraining the wilson
coefficients associated to 34 independent dimensionsix operators that modify the production
crosssections of top quarks our results improved over existing bounds 32 for the wide majority of directions in the smeft parameter space and in several cases the associated wilson
coefficients were constrained for the first time subsequently smefit was extended with the
bayesian reweighting method 33 developed for pdfs 34 35 which allows one constraining
the eft parameter space a posteriori with novel measurements without requiring a dedicated
fit smefit has also been recently applied for the first smeft interpretation of vector boson
scattering data 14 from the full run ii dataset
in this work we complement and extend the smefit analysis framework of 7 in several
directions first and foremost we extend the dimensionsix eft operator basis in order to
simultaneously describe topquark measurements together with higgs boson production and
decay crosssections as well as with weak gauge boson pair production from lep and the
lhc specifically we consider higgs signal strengths differential distributions and simplified
template crosssection stxs measurements from atlas and cms taken at runs i and ii
furthermore we account for the most recent topquark observables from the run ii dataset
such as updated measurements of fourtop top quark pair in association with a z boson
and differential singletop and top quark pair production we also include the differential
distributions in gauge boson pair production from lep and the lhc which constrain complementary directions in the eft space in addition we account in an indirect manner for
the information provided by electroweak precision observables ewpo from lep 36 by
means of imposing restrictions on specific combinations of the eft coefficients
a second improvement as compared to 7 concerns the fitting methodology on the one
hand the monte carlo replica fitting method has been upgraded by means of more efficient
optimizers and the imposition of postfit quality selection criteria for the replicas on the
other hand we have implemented a novel independent approach to constrain the parameter
space based on nested sampling ns by means of the multinest algorithm 37 as opposed
to the replica fitting method which is an optimisation problem ns aims to reconstruct
the posterior probability distribution given the model and the data by means of bayesian
inference we have crossvalidated the performance of the two methods and demonstrated
that they lead to equivalent results the availability of two orthogonal fitting strategies
strengthens the robustness of smefit and facilitates the combined interpretation of data from
different processes
from the combination of the improved fitting framework and the extensive input dataset
we derive individual twodimensional and global marginalised bounds for 36 independent
directions and 14 dependent ones in the eft parameter space the eft crosssections
used inthis analysis account for either only the linear or for both linear and quadratic effects
o 2 and o 4 respectively and include nlo qcd corrections whenever available
we demonstrate in detail how the inclusion of nlo qcd and o 4 corrections in the
eft calculations is instrumental in order to accurately pin down the posterior distributions
associated to the fitted wilson coefficients
by means of information geometry and principal component analysis techniques we quantify the sensitivity of each of the input datasets to the various wilson coefficients we validate
these statistical diagnosis tools by means of a series of fits restricted to subsets of processes
such as higgsonly and toponly eft analyses specifically we quantify the interplay between
the topquark and higgs measurements in the determination of eft degrees of freedom sensitive to both processes such as the modifications of the top yukawa coupling furthermore we
explore how the eft fit results are modified when additional uvinspired theory restrictions
are imposed in the parameter space and present results for the case of a topphilic model
the paper is organised as follows first of all sect 2 discusses the operator basis flavour
assumptions the fitted degrees of freedom and the topphilic scenario then sect 3 describes
the topquark higgs and diboson datasets that are used as input to the analysis together with
the corresponding sm and eft calculations the methodological improvements in smefit
together with the description of the fit settings are presented in sect 4 the main results
of this work namely the combined smeft interpretation of topquark higgs and diboson
measurements at the lhc are presented and discussed in sect 5 finally in sect 6 we
summarise and discuss future steps in this project
supplementary information is provided in three appendices in app a we present the
comparison between the sm and smeft theory predictions with the experimental datasets
used as input to the fit in app b we describe the implementation of the higgs signal strength
measurements then in app c we discuss how the results of this work are rendered publicly
available and provide usage instruction
eft description of the top higgs and electroweak sectors
in this section we collect the definitions and conventions that will be used to construct the
dimensionsix operators and the associated degrees of freedom dofs relevant for the theoretical description of the processes considered in this analysis these are operators that modify
the production and decay of higgs bosons and top quarks at hadron colliders precision electroweak measurements from lepslc and gaugeboson pair production crosssections both
at lep2 and at the lhc
first of all we provide explicit definitions for the operators and for the physical eft coefficients adopted in this work as well as the corresponding notational conventions following
the recommendation of the lhc top quark working group 32 as well as the strategy of
our previous work 7 in the topquark sector we fit specific degrees of freedom closely related to the experimental measurements instead of directly using the warsawbasis operator
coefficients our degrees of freedom are therefore linear combinations of the warsawbasis
operator coefficients which appear in the interference with sm amplitudes and represent
interactions of physical fields after electroweak symmetry breaking these combinations are
then aligned with physically relevant directions of the parameter space and thus have a more
transparent physical interpretation they also represent the maximal information that can
be extracted from measuring a certain process
we will then discuss how the constraints provided by the electroweak precision observables
ewpos from lepslc can be approximately accounted for by means of a series of restrictions on the eft parameter space we also discuss theoretical constraints on the operator
coefficients following a more restrictive assumption about the uvcomplete theory namely
the socalled topphilic scenario finally we discuss several theoretical relations that must be
satisfied by the eft crosssections following the requirement that physical crosssections are
positivedefinite quantities
operator basis and degrees of freedom
conventions let us start by summarizing the notation and conventions that are adopted
in this work concerning the relevant dimensionsix smeft operators here we follow the
notation of the warsaw basis presented in 3 in this notation flavour indices are labelled
by i j k and l lefthanded quark and lepton fermion su2l doublets are denoted by qi  i 
the righthanded quark singlets by ui  di  while the righthanded lepton singlets are denoted
by e   without using flavor index given the special role of the topquark in this work we
use q and t to denote the lefthanded topbottom doublet and the righthanded top singlet
instead of using q3 and u3  the higgs doublet is denoted by  the antisymmetric su2
tensor by   i 2      and we define
 id     id   id   
 id i     i id   id   i  
where  i are the pauli matrices in the following ga
  w  and b stand for the su3
strong and su2l and u1y weak gauge field strengths respectively and the covariant
derivatives include all the relevant interaction terms for instance the gluon field strength
tensor is given by
abc b c
g  g 
   g   g  gs f
where ga
 is the gluon field a b c are color indices in the adjoint representation gs is the
strong coupling and f abc are the structure constants of su3 similar definitions hold for
the electroweak wi and b  field strength tensors for instance one has
  wi   wi  gw ijk wj wk 
where gw is the su2l coupling constant
flavour assumptions the number of independent dimensionsix operators can be unfeasibly large if all three generations of the sm fermions are taken into account there are
2499 in total 38 with 572 fourfermion operators that are in principle relevant for topquark physics 39 in this analysis we follow closely the strategy which we adopted in our
previous topquark sector study 7 and that has been documented in the lhc top quark
working group note 32 we implement the minimal flavour violation mfv hypothesis 40 in the quark sector as the baseline scenario a slight difference is that instead of a
u 2q  u 2u  u 2d flavour symmetry among the first two generations we now impose
the u 2q  u 2u  u 3d symmetry under the assumption that the yukawa couplings are
nonzero only for the top quark this flavour assumption is consistent with the smeftnlo
model 41 the implementation of automated oneloop calculation in the smeft which we
will use to the provide theoretical inputs for our global fit as discussed in the next section
as a result of the different flavour assumption the eft parameter space is further reduced
compared to 7 in particular the coefficients of operators with righthanded bottom quarks
are either set to zero or set equal to the corresponding downquark ones furthermore we then
slightly relax our assumptions by keeping the bottom and charm quark yukawa operators in
our fit to account for the current lhc sensitivity to these parameters all other light quark
yukawa operators are set to zero since we do not expect to have any sensitivity on their
coefficients
concerning the leptonic sector the adopted flavour symmetry is u 1  u 1e 3  also
following 32 this assumption sets all the lepton masses as well as their yukawa couplings
to zero in the sm while leaving independent parameters for each leptonantilepton pair of a
given generation this is then relaxed by including the  yukawa operator to account for
the expected lhc sensitivity arising from dedicated measurements in practice the lepton
flavor assumptions do not have implications for the eft fit given the constraints from zpole
measurements at lep and slc see the discussion below
purely bosonic operators table 21 reports the purely bosonic dimensionsix operators
that modify the production and decay of higgs bosons as well as the interactions of the
electroweak gauge bosons for each operator we indicate its definition in terms of the sm
fields and the notation that we will use both for the operators and for the wilson coefficients
these operators modify several important higgs boson production and decay processes that
are or will become accessible at the lhc as well as the production of gauge boson pairs
both in electronpositron and in protonproton collisions
one can comment on some interesting features of the operators defined in table 21
to begin with the operators ow b and od are the ones often identified as the s and t
oblique parameters though this identification is basisdependent and is not strictly correct
in the warsaw basis together with several of the twofermion operators listed in table 22
they are severely constrained by the zpole and w pole measurements available from lep
and slc but with 2 linear combinations left unconstrained these two combinations in
turn modify the electroweak triple gauge boson tgc couplings and the higgselectroweak
interactions they are thus constrained mainly by the diboson measurements at the lep2
and the lhc as well as the higgs measurements at the lhc we will discuss this property in
more detail in the following section the operator ow generates a tgc coupling modification
which is purely transversal and is hence constrained only by diboson data
the rest of the bosonic operators listed in table 21 modify only the higgs boson couplings

table 21 purely bosonic dimensionsix operators that modify the production and decay of higgs
bosons and the interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons for each operator we indicate its
definition in terms of the sm fields and the notational conventions that will be used both for the
operator and for the wilson coefficient the operators ow b and od are severely constrained by
the ewpos together with several of the twofermion operators from table 22
and represent degrees of freedom that are accessible only with higgs data first the operators
ow and ob modify the interaction between higgs bosons and electroweak gauge bosons
at the lhc they can be probed for example by means of the higgs decays into weak vector
bosons h  zz  and h  w  w   as well as in the vectorbosonfusion vbf process and
in associated production with vector bosons hw and hz in addition the og operator is
similar but introduces a direct coupling between the higgs boson and gluons it therefore
enters the higgs total width and branching ratios the production cross section in gluon fusion
channel as well as the associated production channel tth finally the od operator generates
a wavefunction correction to the higgs boson which rescales all the higgs boson couplings in
a universal manner
twofermion operators table 22 collects using the same format as in table 21 the
relevant warsawbasis operators that contain two fermion fields either quarks or leptons
plus a single fourlepton operator from top to bottom we list the twofermion operators
involving 3rd generation quarks those involving 1st and 2nd generation quarks and operators
containing two leptonic fields of any generation we also include in this list the fourlepton
operator o 
the operators that involve a topquark field either q lefthanded doublet or t righthanded singlet are crucial for the interpretation of lhc topquark measurements interestingly all of them involve at least one higgsboson field which introduces an interplay
between the top and higgs sectors of the smeft for example the chromomagnetic dipole
operator otg and the dimensionsix yukawa operator ot are constrained by both top quark
measurements such as tth associated production as well as higgs measurements such as

table 22 same as table 21 for the operators containing two fermion fields either quarks or leptons
as well as the fourlepton operator o  the flavor index i runs from 1 to 3 the coefficients indicated
with  in the second column do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom in the fit but are
rather replaced by cqi  cqi  and ctz defined in table 23
higgs production through gluon fusion furthermore the electroweakdipole operators otw
and otb  as well as the current operators oq and ot  can be constrained by the associated
production of single topquarks and higgs bosons as well as by the loopinduced higgs decays
into a z final state
in table 22 we also list operators that contain light quark 1st and 2nd generation and
leptonic fields of any generation the light quark operators enter the higgs production
through the v h and vbf channels as well as the diboson processes these operators also
modify the higgs boson width and branching ratios for example the higgs decay width to
q q  becomes modified by operators that induce an effective zhq q vertex such as ou 
the leptonic operators are relevant for the same reason once we account for the leptonic
decays of the higgs and gauge bosons in addition indirect contributions arise from the o1 
o2  and o operators which modify the measurement of the fermi constant gf  and this
affects the extracted sm parameters they therefore introduce a universal contribution to all
electroweak interactions and are relevant for v h vbf and for the diboson channels

table 23 additional degrees of freedom defined from linear combinations of the twofermion operators listed in table 22 the first two dofs modify the ttz couplings while the third combination is
introduced for consistency with the first one these are the dofs that enter at the fit level replacing
those marked with  in table 22
we point out that most of the operator coefficients defined in table 22 correspond directly
to degrees of freedom used in the fit except for three of them which are indicated with a 
in the second column instead following ref 32 three additional degrees of freedom are
defined from the linear combinations indicated in table 23 these are the dofs that enter
at the fit level replacing those marked with a  in table 22
finally we note that as mentioned above here flavour universality in the leptonic sector
is not imposed and thus the coefficients of the operators involving bilinears in the electron
muon and tau lepton fields are in principle independent in total we have 23 independent
fit parameters defined from twofermion operators plus in addition the fourlepton operator
c  however in practice this flexibility will not be relevant for the present fit due to the
constraints from the ewpos to be discussed next
the role of electroweak precision observables at this point one should note that a
subset of the dimensionsix operators defined in tables 21 and 22 are already well constrained
by the electroweak precision observables ewpo 42 measured at the zpole 36 and the
w pole at the lep and slc electronposition colliders given in particular the high accuracy
of these lep measurements these constraints are known to dominate in many cases when
compared to those provided by the lhc crosssections specifically the operators sensitive
to the ewpo are the following with definitions presented in tables 21 and 22

note that with i  1 2 3 these add up to 16 operators rather than the 10 which would
correspond to the flavour universal configuration in the leptonic sector
fourteen linear combinations of the coefficients associated to these 16 operators are constrained by the lep ewpos 43 leaving therefore only two linear combinations unconstrained these two remaining unconstrained directions can be determined from the information contained in diboson production crosssections 38 44 45 as well as by the higgs
production and decay measurements
for completeness the 14 linear combinations of bosonic and twofermion wilson coefficients which are constrained by the ewpos measured at lep are the following

where g1 and gw are the corresponding electroweak couplings
while in this work we do not explicitly include any ewpo data in the present fit we still
need to account for the information that they provide on the smeft parameter space this
is achieved by assuming that the ewpos are precise enough to allow us to set the 14 linear
combinations of eq 25 to zero in our fit the remaining two degrees of freedom can be
parametrized by say cw b and cd  if the following replacements are made

these relations will emulate the impact of lep ewpos in the fit and allow us to produce a
consistent fit without explicitly including the ewpos
thanks to these 14 constraints the 7 and 24 operators listed in tables 21 and 22 respectively are then reduced to 17 independent degrees of freedom to be constrained by the
lhc experimental data and the lep diboson crosssections this allows us to set bounds
on all operator coefficients listed in tables 21 and 22 of course the bounds on the 16
operators of eq 24 will be highly correlated as indicated by eq 27 when presenting
results for the independent dofs for example when evaluating the fisher information matrix
or the principal components we will select cw b and cd  with the understanding that the
replacements of eq 27 have been made note that it has been argued that the diboson
channels at the lhc can in principle compete with ewpo 46 47 which indicates that in
an accurate fit one should always include the full set of ewpo constraints explicitly as has
been done for example in the combined higgselectroweak fits of 10 21 we however leave
this option to future work
fourfermion top quark operators we finally discuss the fourquark operators which
involve the top quark fields and thus modify the production of top quarks at hadron colliders
the dimensionsix fourfermion operators sensitive to top quarks can be classified into two
categories operators composed by four heavy quark fields top andor bottom quarks and
operators composed by two light and two heavy quark fields the physical degrees of freedom
corresponding to fourheavy and twolighttwoheavy interactions that we use in the present
analysis are constructed in terms of suitable linear combinations of the four fermion coefficients
in the warsaw basis whose corresponding operators are defined as

where recall that i j k l are fermion generation indices in table 24 we provide the definition
of all degrees of freedom that enter the fit in terms of the coefficients of warsaw basis operators
of eq 28 within our flavour assumptions the coefficients associated to different values of
the generation indices i i  1 2 or j j  1 2 3 will be the same
comparing with our previous eft analysis of the top quark sector 7 in this work
due to the different flavor assumptions several degrees of freedom that were used there as
independent fit parameters are now absent in particular the coefficients c1qtqb and c8qtqb
are set to zero in addition fourheavy operators that involve righthanded bottom quarks
are not free parameters anymore the correspondence between these fourheavy degrees of

table 24 definition of the fourfermion degrees of freedom that enter into the fit in terms of the
coefficients of warsaw basis operators of eq 28 these dofs are classified into fourheavy upper
and twolighttwoheavy bottom part operators the flavor index i is either 1 or 2 and j is either 1

furthermore we do not have c18
qbtb in the present fit anymore these considerations explain
why the 11 fourheavy operators of our previous study are now reduced to the 5 listed in
table 24
all in all in total we end up with 5 degrees of freedom involving four heavy quark fields
and 14 involving two light and two heavy quark fields for a total of 19 independent parameters
at the fit level associated to fourquark operators the more stringent flavour assumptions
restricting the fourheavy operators imply that the constraints that we will obtain in the
present fit for the fourfermion operators will be superior thanks to these new constraints as
well as the addition of the latest top production measurements from run ii of the lhc
overview of the degrees of freedom we summarise in table 25 the degrees of freedom considered in the present work these are associated either to the wilson coefficients
of warsawbasis operators or to linear combinations of those we categorize the dofs into
five disjoint classes from top to bottom fourquark twolighttwoheavy fourquark fourheavy fourlepton twofermion and purely bosonic dofs we end up with 50 eft coefficients that enter the theory predictions associated to the processes input to the fit of
which 36 are independent the 16 dofs displayed in the last columns are subject to the 14
constraints from the ewpos listed in eq 27 leaving only 2 independent combinations to
be constrained by the fit when presenting results for the independent dofs for example
when evaluating the fisher information matrix we will select cw b and cd  for illustration
purposes then in table 26 we indicate the notation that will be used to indicate the eft
coefficients listed in table 25 in the subsequent sections as well as in the released output
files with the results of the global analysis where again only two of the 16 eft coefficients
labelled in blue are independent fit parameters
the topphilic scenario
the fourfermion operators defined in the previous section and listed in table 24 correspond
to a specific set of assumptions concerning the flavour structure of the uvcompletion of the
standard model however there exist wellmotivated bsm scenarios that suggest further
restrictions in the smeft parameter space spanned by these fourfermion operators therefore phenomenological explorations of the smeft would benefit from comparing results
obtained in different scenarios concerning the possible uv completion from more restrictive
to more general
with this motivation we have implemented a new feature in the smefit analysis framework which allows one to implement arbitrary restrictions in the eft parameter space for
example those motivated by specific bsm scenarios or existing constraints such as those from
ewpo as discussed in the previous section as a proof of concept here we will present results
for the topphilic scenario introduced in 32 this scenario is not constructed by imposing
a specific flavour symmetry but rather by assuming that new physics couples predominantly
to the thirdgeneration lefthanded doublet the thirdgeneration righthanded uptype quark
singlet the gauge bosons and the higgs boson in other words that new physics interacts
mostly with the top and bottom quarks as well as with the bosonic sector the topphilic

table 26 the notation that will be used to indicate the eft coefficients listed in table 25 in the
subsequent sections as well as in the released output files with the results of the global analysis only
two of the 16 eft coefficients labelled in blue are independent fit parameters
scenario satisfies the flavour assumptions that we are imposing in this work but is based on
a more restrictive theoretical assumption
the restrictions in the eft parameter space introduced by the topphilic assumption
lead to a number of relations between the dofs listed in table 25 these relations are the

which can be implemented as an additional restriction at the fitting level therefore we
now have 9 equations that relate a subset of the 14 twoheavytwolight degrees of freedom
listed in table 25 among them which leave 5 independent twoheavytwolight degrees of
freedom the number of operators coupling the top quark with gauge bosons as well as that
of the fourheavy operators is not modified by comparing with table 25 we see that in the
topphilic scenario the eft fit will constrain 41 dofs of which 27 are independent
in principle the topphilic assumption also implies nontrivial correlations between the
lightfermion couplings to the gauge and higgs bosons however following our strategy to
include the ewpo most of them are already set to zero while the two remaining degrees of
freedom are not affected the same assumptions also imply that the light fermion yukawa
operator coefficients are proportional to the sm yukawa couplings as will be shown in sect 5
imposing the additional relations of the topphilic scenario leads to more stringent bounds
on all the relevant wilson coefficients due to the fact that the same amount of experimental
information is now used to constrain a significantly more limited parameter space
crosssection positivity
the constraint that physical crosssections are semipositive definite quantities can also be
accounted for in global smeft analyses this positivity requirement has different implications depending on whether the eft expansion is considered up to either the linear or
quadratic level
the expansion up to linear terms o2  does not automatically lead to positivedefinite
cross sections as in this case the new physics terms are generated by interference with the sm
amplitudes and their sign and size directly depend on the wilson coefficients ci  imposing
the positivity of the cross sections will therefore set possibly onesided bounds on the wilson
coefficients this can be easily implemented in the fitting procedure if helpful in fact we do
not find the need to do so since the fitted experimental data already leads to positivedefinite
crosssections
the expansion up to quadratic terms o4  ie specifically those coming from squaring
the linearly expanded amplitudes obviously automatically leads to positive definite cross
sections no constraints on the wilson coefficients can therefore be obtained or need to be
imposed on the other hand verifying the positivity of the cross section at the quadratic level
provides a sanity check that the theoretical calculation of the various contributions is correctly
performed also taking into account the mc generation uncertainties the conditions that
have to be met are simple to obtain consider the smeft lagrangian
l  lsm 
nop
211

where oi stand for dimensionsix operators and ci are the corresponding wilson coefficients
which we assume to be real any observable calculated using this lagrangian can be written
as a quadratic form

the first line corresponds to the sm contribution where c0 is an auxiliary coefficient that
can be set to unity at the end the second line corresponds to the linear o2  eft
contributions while the third line to the o4  contributions  is by construction a
symmetric matrix1
given that a physical crosssection must be either positive or null the matrix  must
be semipositivedefinite we can therefore use the sylvester criterion that states that a
symmetric matrix is semipositivedefinite if and only if all principal minors are greater or
equal to zero as a simple example the constraints coming from the 2  2 minors are
ii jj  2ij  0 
i j  0    nop 
213
we have verified that the sylvester criterion and eq 213 in particular are satisfied by the
eft calculations used as input to the present analysis
experimental data and theoretical calculations
in this section we present the experimental measurements and the theoretical computations
used to constrain the smeft operators introduced in sect 2 we focus in turn on each of
the three groups of lhc processes that we consider in the current analysis top quark higgs
boson and gauge boson pair production
topquark production data
the topquark production measurements included in this analysis belong to four different
categories inclusive topquark pair production topquark pair production in association with
vector bosons or heavy quarks inclusive single topquark production and single topquark
production in association with vector bosons in the following we present the datasets that
belong to each of these categories topquark pair production in association with a higgs
boson is discussed in sect 32

inclusive topquark pair production the experimental measurements of inclusive topquark pair production included in this analysis are summarised in table 31 for each of
them we indicate the dataset label the center of mass energy s the integrated luminosity
l the final state or the specific production mechanism the physical observable the number
of data points ndat  and the publication reference measurements indicated with a  were
not included in our earlier analysis 7
the bulk of the measurements correspond to datasets already included in 7 at 8 tev
the atlas topquark pair invariant mass distribution 48 and the cms topquark pair normalized invariant rapidity distribution 49 both in the leptonjets final state the cms
topquark pair normalized invariant mass and rapidity twodimensional distribution in the
dilepton final state 50 and the atlas and cms w helicity fractions 51 52 at 13 tev
the cms topquark pair invariant mass distributions in the leptonjets and dilepton final
states based on integrated luminosities of up to l  358 fb1 5355 in addition to these
we now consider further topquark pair invariant mass distributions at 8 tev the atlas
measurement in the dilepton final state 56 at 13 tev and the atlas and cms measurements respectively in the leptonjets and dilepton final states corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of l  358 fb1 57 58 we also include topquark pair charge asymmetry measurements the atlas and cms combined dataset at 8 tev 59 and the atlas dataset
at 13 tev 60
although several distributions differential in various kinematic variables are available for
the measurements presented in 49 50 5358 only one of them can typically be included in
the fit at a time the reason is that experimental correlations between pairs of distributions
are unknown including more than one distribution at a time will therefore result in a double
counting an exception to this state of affairs is represented by the atlas measurement
of 48 which is provided with the correlations among differential distributions unfortunately
they significantly deteriorate the fit quality when an analysis of all the available distributions
is attempted a fact that questions their reliability see also 61 62 we therefore include
only one distribution also in this case in general we include the invariant mass distribution
mtt  whose highenergy tail is known to be particularly sensitive to deviations from the sm
expectations for 49 we include instead the invariant rapidity distribution as in our earlier
analysis 7 due to difficulties in achieving an acceptable fit quality to mtt 
the additional topquark pair measurements considered in this work do not expand the
kinematic coverage in the eft parameter space in comparison to those already included
in 7 nevertheless they provide additional weight for the inclusive topquark pair differential
distributions in the global fit which are known to provide the dominant constraints on several
of the eft coefficients all in all we end up with ndat  94 data points in this category
additional sensitivity to eft effects could be achieved by means of lhc runii measurements with an extended coverage in the invariant mass or transverse momentum however
differential distributions based on luminosities larger than l  36 fb1 are not available yet
the statistical precision of the data and consequently their constraining power remain therefore limited for instance the atlas fully hadronic final state measurement 63 is available
but it exhibits larger uncertainties than in the cleaner leptonjets and dilepton final states
furthermore some measurements are not reconstructed at the parton level as required in our
analysis this is the case of the atlas and cms measurements at high topquark transverse
momentum 63 64 that are based on reconstructing boosted topologies and of the dilepton
distributions from atlas 65 that are restricted to the particle level
concerning theoretical calculations the sm crosssections are evaluated at nlo using

measurements based on l  137 fb1 78 79 for tot ttbb with the atlas and cms
measurements based on l  36 fb1 80 81 these measurements are comparatively more
precise than the measurements already included in 7 thanks to the increased luminosity
concerning topquark pair production in association with an electroweak gauge boson
we include here the atlas total crosssection measurements of ttw and ttz based on l 
36 fb1 82 as well as the cms differential measurements of dttzdpz
t based on l 
78 fb 83 which is the first differential measurement of ttv associated production presented
at the lhc we do not include the still preliminary atlas measurement of tot ttz based
on l  139 fb1 84 the ttv measurements are especially useful to constrain eft effects
that modify the electroweak couplings of the topquark in total we include ndat  20 data
points in the category of tt associated production with heavy quark pairs or weak vector
bosons
theoretical predictions are computed at nlo both in the sm and in the eft we use
mcfm for the sm crosssections and smeftnlo for the eft corrections with nlo qcd

table 33 same as table 31 now for inclusive single t production both in the t and the schannels
inclusive single topquark production we now move to consider the inclusive production of single topquarks both in the tchannel and in the schannel tw associated production
is discussed separately below table 33 displays the information on the experimental data for
these processes that is being considered in the present analysis the dataset in this category
that was already included in our previous analysis 7 consisted at 8 tev of the tchannel total
crosssections and in the topquark rapidity differential distributions from cms 85 86 and
from atlas 87 and in the schannel total crosssections from atlas 88 and cms 89 at
13 tev in the tchannel total crosssections and topquark rapidity differential distributions
from atlas 90 and cms 91 92
here we augment this dataset with one additional measurement namely the cms topquark rapidity differential crosssection for tchannel single topquark production at 13 tev
based on l  359 fb1 93 as customary we consider the distribution reconstructed at
parton level for consistency with the theoretical predictions no differential measurements of
single topquark production based on the run ii dataset have been presented by atlas so
far furthermore while the atlas and cms combination of total crosssections for single
topquark production at 7 tev and 8 tev has been presented in 94 here we include instead
the original individual measurements we end up with ndat  27 data points in this category
the calculation of the sm and eft crosssections has been carried out with the same
settings as for inclusive tt production note that for single top we work with a 5flavour
number scheme 5fns where the bottom quark is considered as massless and thus enters
the initial state of the reaction see 95 for details the nnlo qcd kfactors in the 5fns
are obtained from the calculation of 96
associated single topquark production with weak bosons finally in table 34 we
consider the experimental measurements on the associated production of single topquarks
together with a weak gauge boson v  the dataset in this category that was already part of
our original analysis 7 consisted of the total inclusive crosssections for tw production by

measurements of the tz total crosssections at 13 tev 101 102 in the latter case restricted
to the fiducial region in the w b  q final state
in addition to these datasets we include here several new measurements of tw and tz
production first of all we include a new total crosssection measurement of tw production
by atlas at 8 tev 103 this measurement is carried out in the single lepton channel
and thus does not overlap with 97 which instead was obtained in the two leptons with one
central bjet channel then we include the atlas measurement of the fiducial crosssection
for tz production 104 using the t  q final state in the trilepton channel based on the
full run ii luminosity of l  139 fb1  in this analysis the crosssection measurement
differs from the backgroundonly hypothesis dominated by ttz and dibosons by more than
five sigma and thus corresponds to an observation of this process we also consider the
corresponding measurement from cms where the observation of tz associated production is
reported by reconstructing the t  q final state 105 based on a luminosity of l  774 fb1 
no differential distributions for tz have been reported so far the settings of the theoretical
calculations for these ndat  9 data points are the same as of 7
in addition to these measurements both atlas and cms have measured differential
distributions in tw production at 13 tev based on a luminosity of l  359 fb1 106 107
however these measurements are reported at the particle rather than at the parton level
and therefore they are not suitable for inclusion in the present analysis which is restricted to
topquark level observables we also note that cms has reported on the eft interpretation
of the associated production of topquarks including with vector bosons in an analysis based
on a luminosity of l  415 fb1 108
combining the four categories discussed above the present analysis contains ndat  150
topquark crosssections to be compared with ndat  103 in 7 in sect 53 we will quantify

in higgs production and decay from the lhc run i and run ii
the impact of the new topquark measurements by comparing two fits one based on the
dataset of 7 and one based on the extended topquark dataset included here
higgs production and decay
we now turn to the higgs boson production and decay measurements we consider first
inclusive crosssection measurements presented as signal strengths normalised to the sm
predictions and then differential distributions and stxs measurements
signal strengths first of all we consider the inclusive higgs boson production signal
strengths fi measured by atlas and cms from lhc run i and run ii these signal
strengths are defined for each combination of production and decay channels in terms of
crosssection i and the branching fraction bf as
i  bf
 i  f 
i sm  bf sm
i sm
bf sm
that is as the ratio of the experimentally measured production crosssections in specific
decay channels to the corresponding stateoftheart sm predictions these inclusive signal
strengths can also be expressed as
i sm
h  f 
h  f  sm
h  all
h  all sm
in terms of the partial and total decay widths the measurements of signal strengths that
we consider in the present analysis are collected in table 35 in contrast to the differential
distributions and stxs discussed below these signal strengths are typically extrapolated to
the full phase space and do not include selection or acceptance cuts
for the lhc run i we take into account the inclusive measurements of higgs boson
production and decay rates from the atlas and cms combination based on the full 7 and
8 tev datasets 109 specifically we include the 20 measurements presented in table 8
of 109 these measurements correspond to five different production channels ggf vbf
w h zh tth for five final states  zz w w     bb excluding those combinations that
are either not measured with a meaningful precision or not measured at all we account for
the experimental correlations between the measured signal strengths using the information
provided in 109 in addition to these atlascms combination results from run i we also
include two more signal strengths measurements from run i namely the atlas constraints
on the z and  decays from 110
for the lhc run ii we consider the atlas measurement of signal strengths corresponding to an integrated luminosity of l  80 fb1 111 and the cms measurement corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of l  359 fb1 112 as in the case of the run i signal strengths
we keep into account correlations between the various production and final state combinations the atlas combination contains 16 signal strengths for the ggf vbf v h and tth
production channels and the  zz w w    and bb final states as in the case of run i
measurements are sometimes not available for all final states for a given production channel
for example the h  bb decay is not available for ggf while   is not provided in the case
of v h associate production the cms analysis contains 24 signal strengths measurements
in the ggf vbf w h zh and tth production channels for the same final states as in the
atlas case results for the w w  zz and final states are available for all production
channels while for the other final states     and bb signal strength measurements are
only available for specific production channels in total we have ndat  62 measurements of
higgs inclusive signal strengths from runs i and ii
concerning the theoretical calculations corresponding to these measurements the sm
production crosssections and decay branching fractions are obtained from the associated
experimental publications in turn these represent the most updated available predictions
and are provided in the lhc higgs crosssection working group hxswg reports 113
115 as in the case of topquark production processes eft calculations are obtained at nlo
qcd using madgraph5amcnlo 66 with the smeftnlo model additional details about
the implementation of eft corrections to the higgs signal strengths are provided in app b
differential distributions and stxs table 36 summarizes the experimental measurements of differential distributions and stxs for higgs boson production and decay at the lhc
considered in the present analysis whenever one has a potential double counting between
a signal strength measurement and the corresponding differential distribution or stxs measurement we always select the latter which provides more information on the eft parameter
space due to its enhanced kinematical sensitivity
to being with we consider the atlas and cms differential distributions in the higgs
boson kinematic variables obtained from the combination of the h   h  zz and in
the cms case h  bb final states at 13 tev based on l  36 fb1 116 117 specifically we
consider the differential distributions in the higgs boson transverse momentum pht  these distributions are particularly sensitive probes of new physics for instance through new particles
circulating in the gluonfusion loop
we also include the atlas measurement of the associated production of higgs bosons
v h in the h  bb final state at 13 tev 118 these measurements performed in kinematic
fiducial volumes defined in the simplified template crosssection framework correspond to an
integrated luminosity of l  798 fb1  specifically here we include the data corresponding
to the 5poi parameters of interest category which refers to three crosssections for zh
production in the bins 75  pz
t  150 gev 150  pt  250 gev and pt  250 gev
and two crosssections for w h production one for 150  pt  250 gev and the other for

table 36 same as table 31 for differential distributions and stxs for higgs production and decay
t  250 gev gauge bosons are reconstructed by means of their leptonic decays
then we also include selected differential measurements presented in the atlas run ii
higgs combination paper 111 specifically we include the measurements of higgs production
in gluon fusion gg  h in different bins of pht and in the number of jets in the event these
measurements are presented as i  bzz bzz  since the zz branching fraction is used to
normalise the data we include the 0jet crosssection the 1jet crosssection for pht  60
gev 60  pht  120 gev and 120  pht  200 gev and the  1 jet and  2 jet crosssections
for pht  200 gev and pht  200 gev respectively
furthermore we consider the differential higgs boson production measurements presented
by cms at 13 tev based on an integrated luminosity of l  774 fb1 and corresponding to
the final state  119 the stxs measurements associated to different finalstate topologies
and kinematic values such as pht are presented these inclusive measurements are dominated
by the gluonfusion production channel note that the cms diphoton measurement of 119
supersedes 120 which was based on the 2016 dataset only
whenever available the information on the experimental correlated systematic uncertainties is included as mentioned above the sm theoretical predictions are taken from
the hxswg reports 113115 in total we include ndat  35 measurements of differential
crosssections and stxs on higgs production and decay from the lhc run ii
we note that additional higgs production and decay measurements have been recently
presented by atlas and cms based on the full run ii luminosity of l  139 fb1  two
examples of these are the cms measurement of the pht distribution in the h  w w fully
leptonic final state 121 and the updated atlas measurement of v h associated production in
the bb final state 122 these measurements are however not expected to modify significantly
the results of the present analysis since the constraints they provide on the eft parameter
space are already covered by other measurements and their inclusion is left for future work

table 37 same as table 31 for the differential distributions of gauge boson pair production from
lep2 and the lhc
diboson production from lep and the lhc
we complement the constraints provided by the higgs data with those provided by diboson
production crosssections measured by lep and the lhc the dataset is summarised in table 37 to begin with we consider the lep2 legacy measurements of w w production 123
specifically we include the crosssections differential in cos w in four different bins in the
center of mass energy from s  182 gev up to s  206 gev here w is defined as the
polar angle of the produced w  boson with respect to the incoming electron beam direction
each set of bins with a different centerofmass energy correspond to a different integrated
luminosity ranging between l  1639 pb1 and 6305 pb1  for each value of s there are
10 bins in cos w  adding up to a total of ndat  40 data points the theoretical calculations
of the sm predictions which include higherorder electroweak but not nlo qcd corrections
are also taken from 123 for this process the squared terms in the eft proportional to
ci cj 4 are small and will be neglected
concerning the lhc datasets we include measurements of the differential distributions
for w  z production at 13 tev from atlas 127 and cms 126 based on a luminosity
of l  361 fb1  in both cases the two gauge bosons are reconstructed by means of the
fully leptonic final state whereby events of the type w z      are selected the
different leptonic final states are then combined into an inclusive measurement for the
atlas measurement three fiducial distributions are presented respectively differential in
t  pt and mt  as indicated in table 37 in this analysis our baseline choice will be to

table 38 the number of data points ndat in our baseline dataset for each of the categories of
processes considered here
based on l  139 fb1 129 though here the measured distributions receive contributions
from single z and higgs boson production in addition to those from zz production
the theoretical predictions for the sm crosssections of these lhc diboson processes are
accurate to nnlo qcd and were computed with matrix 130 the eft contributions
for this process include nlo qcd corrections and take into account the constraints from
eq 25 to express the calculation in terms of only three wilson coefficients one being the
triplegauge operator cw w w and the other two the purely bosonic coefficients cd and cw b 
this choice is ultimately arbitrary and has no physical implications any other two coefficients
out of eq 24 would lead to the same results its only motivation is to facilitate the event
generation of the diboson processes
dataset and theory overview and eft sensitivity
we conclude this section by presenting an overview of the datasets considered and of the
corresponding theoretical calculations summarizing their dependence on the eft coefficients
defined in sect 2 and quantifying the sensitivity that each process has on these coefficients
by means of information geometry
dataset overview in table 38 we summarise the number of data points in our baseline
dataset for each of the data categories and processes considered in this analysis as well as the
total per category and the overall total we include 150 97 and 70 crosssections from topquark production higgs boson production and decay and diboson production crosssections
from lep and the lhc respectively in the baseline dataset for a total of 317 crosssection
measurements
overview of theoretical calculations table 39 displays a summary of the theoretical
calculations used for the description various datasets included in the present analysis we
indicate for both the sm and the smeft contributions to the crosssections the perturbative
accuracy and the codes used to produce the corresponding theoretical predictions
dependence on the eft coefficients in order to interpret the results of the global
eft analyses which will be presented in sect 5 it is useful to collect the dependence of the
various datasets described in this section with respect to the degrees of freedom defined in
sect 2 table 310 indicates which eft coefficients contribute to the theoretical description
of each of the processes considered in this analysis recall that the 16 coefficients listed in
eq 24 are related among them by the ewpo relations and that only two of them are
independent
in table 310 we display from top to bottom the coefficients associated to the twolighttwoheavy fourheavy fourlepton twofermion plus bosonic and purely bosonic dimensionsix operators the higgs measurements are separated between the run i and run ii datasets
and in the latter case also between signal strengths and differential distributions and stxs
a check mark outside inside brackets indicates that a given process constrains the corresponding coefficients starting at o2  o4  at lo entries labelled with b indicate
that the sensitivity to the associated coefficients enters via bottominitiated processes which
arise due to contributions from the bpdf in the 5fns adopted here
several observations can be drawn from this table first of all we observe that the
fourheavy coefficients are constrained only by the ttqq production data either tttt or ttbb
such measurements also depend on the 2light2heavy operators as well as on ctg  although
in practice this correlation is small furthermore the fourheavy coefficients are essentially
left undetermined at o 2  and can only be meaningfully constrained only the quadratic
corrections are accounted for one can also note how the twolighttwoheavy operators are
constrained by topquark pair production inclusive and in association with vector bosons
as well as by the tth production measurements as will be shown below by far the dominant
constraints on these coefficients arise from the differential distributions in inclusive top quark
pair production
concerning the twofermion operators most of them are constrained both by top and
by higgs production process recall that the top and higgs sectors are connected among
others by means of the gluonfusion production process with its virtual topquark loop as
well as by tth associated production in particular we note that ct  which modifies the
top yukawa coupling is constrained by these higgs production measurements the purely
bosonic operators exhibit sensitivity only to higgs and diboson processes since these do not
affect the properties of top quarks the diboson data is uniquely sensitive to the triplegauge
coefficient cw w w  which modifies the triple and quartic electroweak gauge couplings as
well as to cd and cw b  which are also constrained by higgs data
the fisher matrix and information geometry the information presented in table 310 does not allow one to compare the sensitivity brought in by different datasets on
a given eft coefficient to achieve this here we adopt the ideas underlying information
geometry 131 and define the fisher information matrix iij as

table 310 overview indicating which eft coefficients contribute to the theoretical description of
each of the processes considered in this global analysis
where e  indicates the expectation value and f exp c indicates the relation between a
set of experimental measurements and the assumed true values of the eft coefficients c
the covariance matrix in the eft parameter space cij c is then bounded by the fisher

are cii  ci 2  i 1 ii and indicate that the smallest possible uncertainty achievable on
the coefficient ci given the input data is ci best  i 1 ii 
for a given set of eft coefficients comparing the values of iij between different datasets
highlights those which provide the highest information the larger the entries of the fisher
matrix the better smaller uncertainty that these coefficients can be constrained by the data
considered the fisher information matrix can also be understood as a metric in model space
if one has two sets of coefficients ca and cb  corresponding to two different points in the eft
parameter space then the local distance between them is defined as
dloc ca  cb    ca  cb i iij ca ca  cb j

an operator such that ci mi  c0i mi  with c0i  bi ci and mi  mi bi with bi being
arbitrary constants however the relative value of iii between two groups of processes is
independent of the choice of operator normalisation and thus conveys meaningful information
for this reason in the following we present results for the fisher information matrix such
that the sum of the diagonal entries associated to a given eft coefficient adds up to a fixed
reference value
fig 31 displays the values of the diagonal entries of the fisher information matrix
eq 39 evaluated for the same groups of processes as in table 310 the normalisation
is such that the sum of the entries associated to each coefficients adds up to 100 we show
results for the fisher information both at the linear level eq 310 and with the quadratic
corrections included eq 39 in the left and right panels respectively the entries in blue
indicate those groups of processes which provide more than 75 of the information on the
corresponding eft coefficient entries in grey indicate relative contributions of less than
the information contained in fig 31 is consistent with that of table 310 but now we can
identify for each coefficients which datasets provide the dominant constraints for instance
one observes that the twolighttwoheavy operators are overwhelmingly constrained by inclu31
sive top quark pair production data except for cqq
for which single top is the most important
set of processes in the case of the twofermion operators the leading constraints typically
arise from higgs data in particular from the run ii signal strengths measurements two exceptions are ct  which at the linear level but not at the quadratic one is dominated by ttv 
and the chromomagnetic operator ctg  for which inclusive tt production is most important
also for the purely bosonic operators the higgs data provides most of the information except
for cw w w  as expected since this operator
is only accessible in diboson processes further
more one observes that the o 
corrections induce in most cases a moderate change in
the fisher information matrix but in others they can significantly alter the balance between

figure 31 the values of the diagonal entries of the fisher information matrix eq 39 evaluated
for the same groups of processes as in table 310 the normalisation here is such that the sum of the
entries associated to each eft coefficient adds up to 100 we show results for the fisher information
matrix both at the linear level eq 310 and with the quadratic corrections included left and right
panels respectively for entries in the heat map larger than 10 we also indicate the corresponding
numerical values note that the sum of the entries over columns does not have a physical interpretation
processes as a representative example some of the twofermion operators such as ct and
cq become dominated by the higgs data only once quadratic corrections are accounted for
another relevant application of the fisher information matrix is the determination of
optimal directions in the eft parameter space by means of principal component analysis
pca and in particular the assessment of whether or not the coefficients basis adopted for
the fit contains flat directions we will discuss this related application in the sect 45
fitting methodology
in this section we describe the fitting methodology that is used in this work to map the
eft parameter space spanned by the higgs diboson and top quark data in addition to
results obtained with the monte carlo replica fitting mcfit method presented in ref 7
now we also determine the posterior probability distributions in the parameter space using
the multinest nested sampling ns algorithm 37 132 a robust sampling procedure that
is completely orthogonal to the mcfit method and that is based on bayesian inference
we begin with a brief discussion of the loglikelihood function and the treatment of uncertainties that is adopted in the fit we then present the individual 2 profiles associated to each
eft coefficient in the quadratic fits and discuss the eventual presence of quasidegenerate
minima subsequently the main features of the ns and mcfit strategies used in the global
fit are summarized including several improvements that have been implemented in the latter technique the results obtained with the two methods are also benchmarked finally
we carry out a principal component analysis pca to determine the linear combinations of
parameters that have the highest and lowest variabilities given our global dataset and assess
the possible presence of flat directions
loglikelihood
the overall fit quality is quantified by the loglikelihood or 2 function defined as
2 c 
exp
ndat
dat 
exp
c  i

c  j

where i
and i c are the central experimental data and corresponding theoretical
predictions for the ith crosssection respectively the total covariance matrix covij  should
contain all relevant sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainties assuming the latter
are normally distributed and that they are uncorrelated with the experimental uncertainties
this total covariance matrix can be expressed as a sum of the separate experimental and
theoretical covariance matrices 133 134
exp
covij  covij

as usual the experimental covariance matrix is constructed from all sources of statistical and
systematic uncertainties that are made available by the experiments as discussed in sect 3
moreover the correlated multiplicative uncertainties are treated via the t0  prescription 135
in the fit while the standard experimental definition is used to quote the resulting 2 values
concerning the theoretical covariance matrix covth  its contributions depend on the
specific type of processes considered in the case of the top quark and lhc diboson production
crosssections we compute the sm predictions using the best possible theoretical accuracy in
doing so we also evaluate the uncertainty associated to the input pdfs and their correlations
as discussed in ref 7 these computations are based on the nnpdf31 notop fit 69 a
global pdf determination based on a dataset that excludes all measurements that are used
in the present smeft analysis
for the higgs production and decay measurements we take instead the sm predictions
from the experimental publications which in turn are collected from the hxswg reports
in such a case the total theory uncertainty is available which includes both pdf errors
and missing higher order uncertainties mhous the total theory uncertainty for higgs
measurements is therefore included in the fit covariance matrix by means of the correlation
prescription provided in the corresponding atlas and cms publications
individual fits from the 2 profiles
individual oneparameter fits correspond to varying a single eft coefficient while keeping
the rest fixed to their sm values while such fits neglect the correlations between the different
coefficients they provide a useful baseline for the global analysis since there the cl intervals
will be by construction looser or at best similar as compared to those of the oneparameters
fits they are also computationally inexpensive as they can be carried out analytically from
a scan of the 2 profile without resorting to numerical methods another benefit is that they
facilitate the comparison between different eft analyses which may adopt different fitting
bases but whose individual bounds should be similar provided they are based on comparable
data sets and theoretical calculations
in the scenario where a single eft coefficient cj  is allowed to vary while the rest are set
to zero the theoretical crosssection for   1 tev given by eq 37 simplifies to
eft
eft
cj   m
 cj mj  c2j mjj 
which results in a quartic polynomial form for the 2 when inserted into eq 41 namely
2 cj  
ak cj k 
restricting the analysis to the linear order in the eft expansion further simplifies eq 44
to a parabolic form
 cj  
ak cj k  20  bcj  cj0 2 
where cj0 is the value of cj at the minimum of the parabola and in this case linear error
propagation gaussian statistics is applicable
to determine the values of the quartic polynomial coefficients ak in eq 44 it is sufficient
to fit this functional form to a scan of the 2 profile obtained by varying the eft coefficient
cj when all other coefficients are set to their sm value the associated 95 cl interval to
the coefficient cj can then be determined by imposing the condition
2 cj   2 cj0   2  591 
we note that if the size of the quadratic o 4 corrections is sizable there will be more
than one solution for cj0 and one might end up with pairwise disjoint cl intervals

figure 42 fig 41 continued
cpw
figs 41 and 42 display the results of quartic polynomial fits to the 2 profiles obtained
in the oneparameter scans of each eft coefficient based on the ndat  317 data points
of the global dataset and the baseline theory settings where higherorder qcd and eft
corrections are accounted for here the absolute 2 is evaluated with the t0 prescription
and we also display the corresponding 95 cl ranges vertical line and the sm expectation
horizontal line we show the 34 profiles associated to the independent eft coefficients in
table 25 which are not constrained by the ewpos these profiles are shown in the following
order fourheavy twolighttwoheavy twofermion and purely bosonic coefficients
from the 2 profiles displayed in figs 41 and 42 one can observe on the one hand how
for several of the coefficients the parabolic approximation performs reasonably well indicating
the dominance of the linear eft corrections on the other hand other coefficients deviate
from the parabolic behaviour in a striking manner including several degrees of freedom that
exhibit two quasidegenerate solutions one being smlike and the other distinctly nonzero
it is important to identify in particular which coefficients display such degenerate solutions
in the oneparameter fits since these might lead to a multimodal posterior distributions in
the case of the global analysis
from the inspection of these 2 profiles one can identify three categories of eft coefficients
whose individual profiles are poorly described by the parabolic approximation first of all one
has the case of coefficients such as the fourheavy operators for which a quartic profile with
two quasidegenerate solutions distributed symmetrically around the sm value is observed
secondly there are coefficients such as cw w w  ctz  and c1tu which display a second solution
far from the smlike one but which corresponds to higher values of the 2  and hence does not
modify the calculation of the cl intervals we note that close to these absolute minima the
parabolic approximation can be reliably adopted in both cases the resulting cl intervals
remain nondisjoint thirdly one finds coefficients that exhibit quasidegenerate solutions
leading to disjoint cl intervals where again one solution is smlike and the other is far from
the sm value examples of this category are the operators that modify the bottom charm
and tau lepton yukawa interactions cb  cc  and c  and the purely bosonic operator
cd  such degenerate solutions are likely to propagate to the global fit where all operators
are simultaneously varied and indeed as will be discussed in sect 5 the presence of these
quasidegenerate minima on the oneparameter fits has consequences at the level of posterior
probability distributions in the global case
another useful application of the parameter bounds obtained from these individual fits is
to help defining in an automated manner the suitable initial sampling ranges for each eft
coefficient in the global fits based on the mcfit and ns approaches with this motivation
the individual bounds corresponding to a given input dataset and settings of the theoretical calculations are evaluated by default before each fitting run let us also mention that
the bounds on the eft coefficients obtained with the method presented here for the oneparameter analyses quartic fits to the 2 profiles are found to be in agreement with the
corresponding results obtained the ns and mcfit approaches
nested sampling
the main approach that is adopted in this work to constrain the eft parameter space is
nested sampling ns specifically the version implemented in the multinest algorithm 37
in comparison to mcfit which is an optimisation problem aimed to determine the bestfit
values for each of the replicas ns is based on sampling the figure of merit 2 to determine its
dependence on the wilson coefficients and locate the region of maximum likelihood since ns
is completely independent from the mcfit procedure its availability makes possible validating
the robustness of the resulting bounds in eft parameter space via two orthogonal methods
the starting point of ns is bayes theorem which allows one to evaluate the probability
distribution of a set of parameters c associated to a model mc given a set of experimental
measurements d
p dm cp cm
p cd m 
p dm
here p cd m represents the posterior probability of the model parameters given the assumed model and the observed experimental data p dm c  lc is the likelihood conditional probability of the experimental measurements given the model and a specific choice
of parameters and p cm  c is the prior distribution for the model parameters the
denominator in eq 47 p dm  z is known as the bayesian evidence and ensures the
normalisation of the posterior distribution
lccdc 
where the integration is carried out over the domain of the model parameters c
the key ingredient of nested sampling is to utilise the ideas underlying bayesian inference
to map the ndimensional integral over the prior density in model parameter space cdc
where n represents the dimensionality of c into a onedimensional function of the form
cdc 
clc
in this expression the prior mass x corresponds to the normalised volume of the prior
density cdc associated with values of the model parameters that lead to a likelihood
lc greater than the parameter  note that by construction the prior mass x decreases
monotonically from the limiting value x  1 to x  0 as  is increased the integration
of x extends over the regions in the model parameter space contained within the fixedlikelihood contour defined by the condition lc   this property allows the evidence to
be expressed as
lxdx 
410
where lx is defined as the inverse function of x which always exists provided the
likelihood is a continuous and smooth function of the model parameters therefore the
transformation from c to x in eq 49 achieves a mapping of the prior distribution into
infinitesimal elements sorted by their associated likelihood lc
the next step of the ns algorithm is to define a decreasing sequence of values in the prior
volume that is now parameterised by the prior mass x in other words one slices the prior
volume into a large number of small regions
1  x0  x1     x  0 
411
and then evaluates the likelihood at each of these values l  lxi  this way all of the li
values can be summed in order to evaluate the integral for the bayesian evidence eq 410
since in general the likelihood lc exhibits a complex dependence on the model parameters c the summation in eq 410 must be evaluated numerically using eg monte carlo
integration methods in practice one draws nlive points from the parameter prior volume
c known as live points and orders the likelihood values from smallest to largest including
the starting value of the prior mass at x0  1 as samples are drawn from the prior volume
the live point with the lowest likelihood li is removed from the set and replaced by another
live point drawn from the same prior distribution but now under the constraint that its likelihood is larger than li  this sampling process is repeated until the entire hypervolume c
of the prior parameter space has been covered with ellipsoids of constrained likelihood being
assigned to the livepoints as the prior volume is scanned
while the end result of the ns procedure is the estimation of the bayesian evidence z as
a byproduct one also obtains a sampling of the posterior distribution associated to the eft
coefficients expressed as
ck  
k  1     nspl 
412
with nspl indicating the number of samples drawn by the final ns iteration one can then
compute expectation values variances and correlations of the model parameters by evaluating
the mc sum over these posterior samples together with their associated weights in the same
manner as averages are carried out over the nrep replicas in the mcfit method
prior volume an important input for ns is the choice of prior volume c in the model
parameter space in this analysis we adopt flat priors defined by ranges in parameter space
for the coefficients c a suitable choice of prior volume where the sampling takes place is
important to speed up the ns algorithm a range too wide will make the optimisation less
efficient while a range too narrow might bias the results by cutting specific regions of the
parameter space that are relevant furthermore using a common range for all parameters
should be avoided since the range of intrinsic variation will be rather different for each of the
eft coefficients as illustrated also by the oneparameter fits reported in figs 41 and 42
taking these considerations into account we adopt here the following strategy first a
single model parameter ci is allowed to vary while all others are set to their sm value cj  0
min
for j 6 i the 2 ci  is then scanned in this direction to determine the values ci
and
max
satisfying the condition  ndat  4 we then repeat this procedure for all parameters
and end up with a hypervolume defined by pairs of values
min
max
 ci
i  1     nop 
413
which then defines the initial prior volume at this point one performs an initial exploratory
ns global analysis using this volume to study the posterior probability distribution for each
eft coefficient our final analysis is then obtained by manually adjusting the initial sampling ranges until the full posterior distributions are captured for the chosen prior volume
for parameters that are essentially unconstrained in the global fit such as the fourheavy
operators in the case of linear eft calculations a hard boundary of 50 50 is imposed for
  1 tev 
performance in order to increase the efficiency of the posterior probability estimation by
ns we enable the constant efficiency mode in multinest which adjusts the total volume
of ellipsoids spanning the live points so that the sampling efficiency is close to its associated
hyperparameter set by the user with 24 cpu cores we are able to achieve an accurate
posterior for the linear eft fits in around 30 minutes using 500 live points a target efficiency
of 005 and an evidence tolerance of 05 which results in nspl  5000 posterior samples
to ensure the stability of our final results we chose 1000 live points and a target efficiency
of 0005 which yields 15  104 samples for the linear analysis and 104 samples for an
analysis that includes also the quadratic eft corrections with these settings our final
global analyses containing the simultaneous determination of nop  36 coefficients take  35
hours running in 24 cpu cores with a similar performance for linear and quadratic eft fits
the ns method is especially suitable to tackle parameter spaces of moderate dimensionality being based purely on sampling it is not affected by limitations in minimisation methods
such as ending up in local minima it is also more robust upon the presence of fluctuations
and does not require specifying certain hyperparameters such as the learning rates which are
used in mcfit the main limitation of ns is that as in all sampling methods the execution
times grows exponentially with nop  the dimensionality of the model parameter space for parameter spaces of dimensionality greater than around 50 the current ns implementation that
we use becomes unpractically slow and mcfit becomes the most suitable strategy available
the monte carlo replica method revisited
the smefit analysis of ref 7 was based on the monte carlo replica approach mcfit
which in turn was inspired by the nnpdf analysis of the quark and gluon substructure of
protons the mcfit method aims to construct a sampling of the probability distribution in
the space of the experimental data which then translates into a sampling of the probability
distribution in the space of the eft coefficients through an optimisation procedure where
the bestfit values of the coefficients for each replica ck  are determined
exp
given an experimental measurement of a hardscattering crosssection denoted by i
stat
sys
with total uncorrelated uncertainty i
and nsys correlated systematic uncertainties i 
the nrep artificial mc replicas of the experimental data are generated as
nsys
artk
exp
k stat
ri i
x k sys
ri i
k  1     nrep 
414
where the index i runs from 1 to ndat and ri  ri are univariate gaussian random numbers
correlations between data points induced by systematic uncertainties are accounted for by
ensuring that ri  ri0   it can be show that central values variances and covariances
evaluated by averaging over the mc replicas reproduce the corresponding experimental values
a fit to the nop degrees of freedom c is then performed for each of the mc replicas
generated by eq 414 these bestfit values are determined from the minimisation of the
cost function
ndat
dat 
artk
ck  i
cov1 ij j

ck  j
415
ij1
where i ck  indicates the theoretical prediction for the ith crosssection evaluated with
the kth set of eft coefficients this process results in a collection of ck bestfit coefficient
values from which estimators such as expectation values variances and correlations are evaluated the overall fit quality is then evaluated using eq 41 where the central experimental
values are compared to the mean theoretical prediction computed by the resulting fit replicas
as mentioned in sect 41 various theoretical uncertainties are also included in the 2
definition for some datasets a consistent treatment of theoretical uncertainties in the fitting procedure means that these are not only included in the fit via the covariance matrix
in eqs 415 but also in the corresponding replica generation in other words the replicas are sampled according to a multigaussian distribution defined by the total covariance
matrix eq 42 which receives contributions both of experimental and of theoretical origin
we therefore account for such errors in the generation of monte carlo replicas 133 using
eq 414
there are numerous advantages of using the mcfit method for global eft analyses first
it does not require specific assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the
fit parameters and in particular does not rely on the gaussian approximation secondly the
computational cost scales in a much milder way with the number of operators nop included
in the fit as compared to ns thirdly it can be used to assess the impact of new datasets in
the fit a posteriori with the bayesian reweighting formalism
in comparison with 7 several improvements have been implemented to increase the
efficiency and accuracy of the mcfit procedure used in this analysis
optimisation in the top quark sector analysis of 7 the minimisation of eq 415 was
achieved by a gradient descent method which relies on local variations of the error function
this choice is advantageous since e k is at most a quartic form of the fit parameters see
eq 44 and its generalisation to multiple operators and therefore evaluating its gradient is
computationally efficient
since in the present analysis our parameter space is more complex the optimiser that
we use now to determine the bestfit values of the degrees of freedom ck within mcfit is
a trustregion algorithm trustconstr available in the scipy package an advantage of
using trustconstr in this context is that it allows one to provide the optimiser with any
combination of constraints on the coefficients including existing bounds this is a rather
useful feature since in many cases of interest one would like to restrict the eft parameter
space based on theoretical considerations such as when accounting for the lep ewpos or
in the topphilic scenario discussed in sect 2
initial sampling range and bounds for each mc replica fit the initial values of the fit
coefficients ck are initialised at random within a predefined range this sampling range
as well as the boundaries imposed on the minimisation procedure for the poorly constrained
parameters are taken to be the same as those used in the nc procedure that is the
sampling ranges for the global fits are derived from a oneparameter 2 scanning procedure
subsequently inflated to cover a sufficiently large parameter hypervolume
crossvalidation given the large dimensionality of the considered eft parameter space
it is conceivable that the optimiser algorithm ends up fitting the statistical fluctuations of the
experimental data rather than the underlying physical law one way to prevent the minimiser
from overfitting the data is to use lookback crossvalidation stopping in this method each
replica dataset is randomly split with equal probability into two disjoint sets known as the
training and validation sets only the data points in the training set are then used to compute
the figure of merit being minimised eq 415 while the data points in the validation set
are monitored alongside the fit the random assignment of the data points to the training or

figure 43 the bestfit values and 95 cl intervals for a global fit based on linear eft calculations
comparing the outcome of the ns and mcfit methods we display the results corresponding to the
50 coefficients listed in table 25 except for c  0 of which 36 are independent fit parameters
validation sets is different for each mc replica and the splitting only occurs for experiments
that contain more than 5 bins in the distribution the fit is run for a fixed large number of
iterations and then the optimal stopping point of the fit is then determined as the iteration
for which the figure of merit evaluated on the validation set eval  exhibits a global minimum
all in all it is found that the risk of overfitting is small and that mcfit results with and
without crossvalidation applied are reasonably similar
quality selection criteria one disadvantage of optimisation strategies such as mcfit is
that as the parameter space space is increased the minimiser might sometimes converge on a
local rather than on the global minimum this is specially problematic in the quadratic eft
fits which often display quasidegenerate minima as illustrated by the 2 profiles of figs 41
and 42 for this reason it is important to implement postfit quality selection criteria that
indicate when a fitted replica should be kept and when it should be discarded here a mc
replica is kept if the total error function of the replica dataset etot  satisfies etot  3
benchmarking fig 43 compares the outcome of global fits obtained with either the ns
or mcfit method all other settings identical specifically here we show the bestfit values
and 95 cl intervals for global fits based on linear eft calculations we provide the results
corresponding to the 50 coefficients listed in table 25 except for c  which is set to zero by
the ewpos of which 36 are independent fit parameters we will further discuss the physical
interpretation of these results in sect 5 here we only aim to establish that the two methods
indeed lead to equivalent results
the comparison of fig 43 demonstrates that in general the two methods are in excellent
agreement both in terms of bestfit values and of the corresponding uncertainties this said
for specific coefficients one observes small differences with mcfit in general tending to provide

2 value
figure 44 comparison of the 2 distributions evaluated over replicas and posterior samples in
global linear eft fits based on the mcfit and nc methods respectively the corresponding 95 cl
intervals on the eft coefficients are displayed in fig 43
somewhat looser bounds the reason for this behaviour is that optimisationbased methods
such as mcfit can be distorted by fitting inefficiencies such as when the optimiser finds a
local rather than global minimum this phenomenon is further illustrated in fig 44 which
compares the 2 distributions evaluated over replicas and posterior samples in the mcfit
and nc methods respectively we observe that the mcfit distribution exhibits broader tails
implying that the bounds obtained this way might in some cases be slightly overconservative
fig 43 as well as the corresponding benchmark comparison for fits based on quadratic
eft calculations demonstrates that results obtained with either ns or mcfit are statistically
equivalent in the rest of this work we will adopt ns as the baseline method since its not
affected by potential inefficiencies in the minimisation procedure and as discussed above can
produce global fits within a reasonable execution time
principal component analysis
principal component analysis pca represents a valuable tool to identify the combinations
of degrees of freedom that exhibit the largest and smallest variabilities in a linear algebra
problem this identification has many applications for instance a large gap in variability
suggests that the effective dimensionality of the problem is smaller than the nominal one and
thus dimensional reduction methods are advantageous to simplify the solution furthermore
directions in the parameter space with very small variability are difficult to constrain from data
and are identified with flat directions such flat directions might compromise the reliability
of the obtained results ie in hessian eft fits3
the pca method can also be exploited to efficiently carry out linear smeft fits 136
here we apply the pca technique combined with singular value decomposition svd
to global fits based on linear eft calculations the goal is to ascertain the presence of
possible flat directions identify large gaps in variability between the principal components
and determine the relation between the physical fitting basis and these principal components
the starting point is the expression for the crosssection as a function of the eft coefficients
eq 37 truncated at the linear order
c  m
nop
eft
ci mi 
m  1     ndat 
416
where recall that we have set   1 tev we then define a matrix k of dimensions ndat  nop
eft
and dimensionless components kmi  mi expm  where expm is the same total experimental error that appears in the evaluation of the fisher information matrix eq 39 by
means of svd we can decompose this matrix k as
k  uwv  
417
where u v  is a ndat ndat nop nop  unitary matrix and w is an ndat nop diagonal matrix
with semipositive real entries called the singular values which are ordered by decreasing
magnitude the larger a singular value the higher the variability of its principal component
and the higher the likelihood that this component will be well constrained from the fit
the elements of the symmetric matrix v in eq 417 contain the principal components
associated to each of the nop singular values these correspond to a linear superposition of
the original coefficients that is we have that
pck

where the larger the value of the squared coefficient a2kl  the larger the relative weight of the
associated eft coefficient in this specific normalised principal component by means of
the matrix v and its inverse one can rotate between the original fitting basis and the one
defined by the principal components
fig 45 displays the singular values i  that is the elements of the diagonal matrix w
in the decomposition of eq 417 for the nop  36 principal components associated to the
global fit settings summarised in tables 25 and 38 from the definition of the matrix k a
singular value i  1 corresponds to a direction in the parameter space where the magnitude
of the linear eft corrections is of the same size as the associated experimental uncertainties
we observe that there are three flat directions principal components with vanishing singular
value which as shown below can be associated to linear combinations of the fourheavy operators except for these three flat directions there are no large hierarchies in the distribution
of singular values indicating that the physical dimensionality of our problem coincides with
that of the chosen fitting basis the principal component with the highest singular value is
dominated by the bosonic operator cd  which modifies the higgsgauge interactions and is
well constrained by the ewpos
then fig 46 displays a heat map with the values of the squared coefficients a2ki that
relate the original fitting basis to the principal components eq 418 and whose associated
eigenvalues are displayed in the upper panel for those entries with a2ki  01 we also indicate
the corresponding numerical value since the principal components are normalised the sum

figure 45 the distribution of singular values i the elements of the diagonal of the matrix w 
for the principal components evaluated for the global fit settings summarised in tables 25 and 38 in
the linear eft approximation where the pca analysis is carried out there exist three flat directions
with vanishing singular values associated to the fourheavy operators
of the entries associated to a given row in the heat map adds up to unity note also that in
this table we have chosen the purely bosonic coefficients cw b and cd to represent the two
directions that are left unconstrained by the ewpos see the discussion in sect 21
from fig 46 one can observe that some principal components pck  are dominated by
a single eft coefficient from the fitting basis examples of this are cd for k  1 cg
k  7 these pcs have associated reasonably
k  2 cb k  3 ctg k  4 and cqq
large singular values k  10 and therefore one expects that the corresponding coefficients
will be well constrained from the fit other principal components are instead composed by a
superposition of two or at most three coefficients for instance cw b and cq are combined
into pc14 and pc15 with similar weight each on the other hand several pcs arise instead
from the combination of a large number of eft coefficients without any of them dominating
this is the case eg for pcs associated to combinations involving of the twolighttwoheavy
operators such k  22 23 and 25 where no single squared coefficient a2ki is larger than 04
the three flat directions vanishing singular values observed in fig 45 can be traced back
to linear combinations for fourheavy operators specifically to the following combinations

where we dont indicate the contributions with a2ki  01 this implies that in a linear eft
fit one can only constrain two directions out of the five fourheavy operators considered
these flat directions disappear only once we consider the quadratic corrections to the tttt
and ttbb crosssections

figure 46 heat map displaying the values of the squared coefficients a2ki that relate the original
fitting basis to the principal components eq 418 whose associated singular values were reported
in fig 45 for the entries with a2ki  01 we also indicate the corresponding numerical value
represents a sensible option for which welldefined constraints will be obtained from the fit
up to the previous caveat concerning the fourheavy operators therefore in our case there is
no advantage in carrying out the fit in the rotated basis spanned by the principal components
eq 418 rather than in the original one furthermore the lack of large hierarchies in the
distribution of singular values reflects the fact that the true dimensionality of the problem
coincides with that of the original basis
while for the global dataset genuine flat directions are either absent or removed by
quadratic corrections this might not be in general the case if we consider fits to reduced
datasets in such scenario one could consider deploying the pca method to reduce the
dimensionality of the eft parameter space by removing the directions with singular values
below some threshold before inverting back to the physical basis we note that a similar strategy has been successfully applied to construct compressed hessian pdf sets in 137 138
however in this work we use pca as a diagnosis tool to guide the selection of the fitting
basis and postpone to future work its application to carry out eft fits in the pc rotated
basis
results
we now present the main results of this work the determination of the bestfit values confidence level intervals and posterior probability distributions associated to the nop  50 eft
coefficients of which 36 are independent listed in table 25 from the global interpretation
of higgs top quark and diboson crosssection measurements as motivated in sect 4 the
results shown here have been obtained with the ns approach and we have verified that
equivalent results are obtained with the mcfit method
first of all we discuss the quality of the fit both for the total and for individual datasets
second we present the bounds and posterior probability distributions for the various eft
coefficients assess their consistency with the sm hypothesis and determine their pattern
of crosscorrelations third we study the dependence of our results on the choice of input
dataset in particular with fits based only on top or higgs data as well as on that of the
theory settings where the impact of the nlo qcd corrections to the eft crosssections
is quantified finally we present eft fits in the topphilic scenario where the parameter
space is restricted by constraints motivated by specific uvcomplete models the comparison
between sm and smeft theory predictions with the experimental dataset used as input to
the fit is then collected in app a
fit quality
to begin with we investigate the quality of the fit in terms of the 2 values for the individual
datasets as well as for the global one the values that will be provided here correspond to a
modified version of eq 41 specifically
ndat
dat d
exp
cov1 ij
exp

where the average over the theory predictions is evaluated over the the nspl samples provided by ns and the covariance matrix is evaluated with the experimental definition 139
note that in general the average over theory predictions does not correspond to the theory
prediction evaluated using the average value of the wilson coefficients
6 i
due to the presence of the quadratic corrections to the eft crosssections
with the figure of merit defined in eq 51 we collect in tables 51 and 52 the values of
the 2 per data point corresponding to the baseline settings of our analysis we display both
the values based
on the sm
theory predictions as well as the bestfit smeft results obtained
with o 2 and o 4 calculations note that for ease of reference in these tables each
dataset has associated a hyperlink pointing to the original publication for those datasets for
which more than one differential distribution is available we indicate the specific one used
in the fit then table 53 presents the summary of these 2 values now indicating the total
values for each group of processes as well as for the global dataset furthermore the results
of tables 51 and 52 are graphically represented in fig 51
let us discuss first the 2 results evaluated in terms of the groups of processes listed in
table 53 one can observe that the global 2 per data point improves from 105 when using
sm theory to 096 linear and 101 quadratic once smeft corrections are accounted for

total
table 53 summary of the 2 results listed in tables 51 and 52 we indicate the total values for
each group of processes as well as for the global dataset
considering the fit quality to the various groups of processes we observe that the description
of the inclusive topquark pair crosssections is clearly improved once eft corrections are
accounted for with 2  136 in the sm decreasing to 114 and 123 in the linear and quadratic
eft fits respectively for the rest of the datasets and in particular for the higgs and diboson
measurements the overall eft fit quality is similar to that obtained using sm calculations
inspection of the 2 values associated to individual datasets reported in tables 51 and 52
as well as their graphical representation from fig 51 reveals that in some cases the agreement between the prior sm theoretical calculations and the data is poor this is the case
in particular for some of the inclusive tt datasets such as atlastt8tevljetsmtt and
cmstt13tevdilep2016mtt binned in terms of the topquark pair invariant mass distribution mtt  such relatively high values of the 2 do not necessarily imply the need for
some new physics effects but could also be explained by issues with the modelling of the
experimental systematic correlations in differential distributions as discussed for the atlas
8 tev leptonjets data in 61 68 140 nevertheless when all the inclusive tt datasets are
considered collectively a reasonable value of 2sm  136 for the ndat  94 data points in the
fit is obtained in sect 53 we will assess the stability of the global fit results by presenting
fit variants with the individual datasets that lead to a poor 2 removed we will also study
variants where distributions sensitive to the high energy behaviour of the eft such as mtt
in top quark pair production have their bins with mtt  1 tev removed from the fit
beyond the inclusive tt datasets there are some other instances of a suboptimal agreement
between sm theory and data in all cases there exist comparable measurements of the same
process either from the same experiment at a different centerofmass energy s or from a
different experiment at the same value of s for which the 2 reveals good consistency with
the sm these include cmsttbb13tev when comparing with the same measurement based

figure 51 graphical representation of the results of tables 51 and 52 displaying the values of the
2 per data point eq 51 for the all datasets used as input in the fit the 2 values are shown for
the sm and for the two global
 smeft baseline fits based on theory calculations at either the linear
o 2 or quadratic o 4 order in the eft expansion
on the full 2016 luminosity and cmstw13tevinc where again the atlas measurement
at the same s exhibit as good 2  all in all one finds a reasonable description of the global
input dataset when using sm crosssections which is further improved in the eft fit
for the rest of this section when presenting the results of fits corresponding to variations
of the baseline settings such as fits based on reduced datasets we will only indicate the 2
values associated to groups of processes using the same format as table 53 rather than to
individual datasets and comment when required on the results for the latter
constraints on the eft parameter space
following this assessment of the fit quality we move to present the constraints on the smeft
parameter space that can be derived from the present global fit we will present results for
the nop  50 wilson coefficients listed in table 25 with the understanding that only 36 of
them are linearly independent4 specifically we provide the 95 confidence level intervals for
each eft coefficients study their posterior probability distributions evaluate the pattern of
their correlations and compare the marginalised bounds with those obtained in individual
fits where only one coefficient is varied at a time we will also assess the overall consistency
of the fit results with respect to the standard model hypothesis the results discussed here
correspond
to the global dataset with the baseline theory settings for both o 2 and
o 4 theory calculations fits based on either reduced datasets or different theory settings
are then discussed in sects 53 and 54 respectively
we note that the ewpo constraints of eq 27 set the fourlepton operator to zero c  0 and hence
we exclude this coefficient from the plots and tables of this section

figure 52 the normalised posterior probability distributions associated to each of the nop  50
fit coefficients considered in the present analysis for both the linear and quadratic eft fits note
that the xaxis range is different in each case from top to bottom and from left to right we display
the fourheavy twolighttwoheavy twofermion and purely bosonic coefficients only 36 of these
coefficients are independent as indicated in table 25
posterior distributions fig 52 displays the normalised posterior probability distributions associated to each of the nop  50 fit coefficients considered in the present analysis for
the linear blue and quadratic orange eft fits as discussed in sect 43 the ns prior
sampling volumes have been optimised to ensure that the posterior distribution associated to
each coefficient is fully contained within them one can observe how in general the o 4
corrections modify significantly the distributions that is obtained from the linear fits for
instance by shifting its median or by decreasing its variance for several coefficients the posterior distributions would be poorly described in the gaussian approximation and in some
cases one finds multimodal distributions such as for the yukawa operators cc  cb  and c 
such doublehumped distributions can be traced back to the quasidegenerate minima in the
individual 2 profiles reported in figs 41 and 42 we can also observe how the fourheavy
coefficients can only be meaningfully constrained in the quadratic fit all in all inclusion
of the quadratic eft corrections modifies in a significant manner the posterior distributions
associated to most of the fit coefficients as compared to the linear approximation

figure 53 the bestfit median value of the eft coefficients ci 2 and their associated 95
cl intervals for the global fits based on either linear or quadratic eft calculations whose posterior
distributions are represented in fig 52 the dashed horizontal line indicates the sm expectation
confidence level intervals from the posterior probability distributions displayed in
fig 52 one can derive the marginalised 95 cl intervals on the eft coefficients both
for the linear and quadratic fits these results are collected in table 54 for   1 tev and
represented graphically in fig 53 in addition table 54 also includes the corresponding
obtained in individual ns fits where only one operator is varied at a time and the rest are
set to their sm values recall the 2 profiles from figs 41 and 42 we will further discuss
the outcome of these individual fits below
from the marginalised bounds displayed in fig 53 one can observe how the uncertainties
associated to the fit coefficients are in general reduced in the quadratic fit in comparison to
the linear one the 95 cl interval is disjoint for the yukawa coefficients cb and c  in the
quadratic fit with both a smlike solution and a second one far from the sm for the linear
fit we find that all eft coefficients agree with the sm expectation at the 95 cl level for
the quadratic fit instead this is not the case for two of the twolighttwoheavy coefficients
specifically for c1tu and c8qu  these deviations from the sm predictions can be traced back to
the quadratic corrections entering the highenergy tt differential crosssections
the global fit results of fig 53 are further scrutinized in fig 54 which displays both the
magnitude of the 95 cl intervals and the 68 cl residuals compared to the sm hypothesis
associated to the linear and quadratic eft fits in the upper panel the horizontal line
indicates the boundaries of the sampling volume used for the poorlyconstrained coefficients as
explained in sect 43 from these comparisons one can observe how the inclusion of quadratic
corrections leads to markedly more stringent bounds for most of the fit coefficients a trend
which is specially significant for the fourheavy unconstrained in the linear fit and twolighttwoheavy operators which modify the properties of the top quark the only exception are
the yukawa coefficients since there the quadratic corrections introduce a second degenerate
solution thus enlarging the magnitude of the cl interval

figure 54 the magnitude of the 95 cl intervals top and the value of the 68 cl residuals
compared to the sm hypothesis bottom panel for the fit results displayed in fig 53
the 68 cl residuals displayed in the bottom panel of fig 54 are defined by
rci  
ci eft  ci sm 
i  1     nop 
with ci eft being the median of the posterior distribution from the eft fit ci sm  0 and
ci is the total fit uncertainty for this parameter we can observe that rci   1 for most
of the fit coefficients both for the linear and quadratic cases with exceptions in the case of
the twolighttwoheavy coefficients such as c1qd in the linear fit and c1tu in the quadratic one
nevertheless for a large enough number of eft coefficients one would expect a fraction
of these residuals to be larger than unity even if the sm is the underlying theory fig 55
then displays the normalised distribution of these fit residuals while these coefficients are
correlated among them see the following discussion and thus cannot be treated as independent variables the shapes of these distributions are reasonably close to a gaussian specially

where nspl denotes the number of samples produced by ns hci i indicates the mean value of
this coefficient and as in fig 53 ci is the corresponding uncertainty standard deviation
the values of eq 54 are displayed in fig 56 separately for the linear and quadratic fits
we display only the numerical values for the pairwise coefficient combinations for which the
correlation coefficient is numerically significant ci  cj   05 the pairs ci  cj  that do not
appear in fig 56 have a correlation coefficient below this threshold
we observe how the majority of the fit coefficients are loosely correlated among them
that is their correlations being   05 one also finds that while several of the twolighttwoheavy coefficients turn out to be strongly correlated at the linear eft level this pattern
disappears once the quadratic corrections are accounted for concerning the twofermion
operators the correlation patterns present at the linear level are also often reduced in the
quadratic fits for instance ctz displays a strong correlation with cb at the linear level
which is then washed out by the quadratic effects the purely bosonic operators exhibit in
general more stable correlations for example cw b is strongly anticorrelated with cd in a
manner which is similar in the linear and the quadratic fits furthermore we do not find any
pair of fit coefficients where the quadratic corrections flip the sign of their correlation
in general from fig 56 one can conclude that only a moderate subset of wilson coefficients end up being strongly anticorrelated among them after the fit specially so once

figure 56 the correlation coefficients ci  cj  between the eft coefficients in the linear left and
quadratic right panel fits we only display the entries with significant anticorrelation   05
pairs of coefficients ci  cj  that do not displayed here have a correlation coefficient below this threshold
quadratic eft corrections are taken into account this finding is partially explained by our
wide input dataset which makes possible constraining independently most if not all the eft
degrees of freedom
individual fits as motivated in sect 42 individual oneparameter fits have several
important applications these include representing a benchmark reference for the global fit
results where the obtained bounds can only loosen as compared to oneparameter fits the
95 cl bounds associated to the oneparameter linear and quadratic eft fits were reported
in table 54 and the corresponding graphical comparison with the marginalised global fit
results is displayed in fig 57
considering first the results of the linear fits one can observe how in all cases the individual
bounds are tighter or at most comparable than the marginalised ones by a large amount
around a factor ten or more in most cases these differences are particularly striking for some
of the twofermion operators in particular for ctz  as well as for bosonic operators such as
cb and cw  for which the differences between the individual and marginalised results can
be as large as two orders of magnitude specifically in the cases of ctz and cb  the 95 cl
intervals are increased as follows when going from the individual to the marginalised fits
ctz 
004 0010 individual
15 58 marginalised 
cb 
0005 0002 individual
07 03 marginalised 
this effect clearly emphasizes the importance of adopting a fitting basis as wide as possible
in order to avoid obtaining artificially stringent bounds simply because one is being blind
to other relevant directions of the parameter space one important exception of this rule
would be those cases where one is guided by specific uvcomplete models which motivate

figure 57 comparison of the magnitude of 95 cl intervals in the global marginalised and
individual fits at the linear top and quadratic bottom level see also table 54
the reduction in the parameter space to a subset of operators we also note that the triple
gauge operator cw is one of the few coefficients whose individual and marginalised bounds
are identical this can be traced back to the fact that this operator is very weakly correlated
with other coefficients see also fig 56 being constrained exclusively by the diboson data
inspection of the corresponding results from the quadratic fits bottom panel of fig 57
reveals that the differences between individual and marginalised bounds are in general smaller
as compared to the linear case this effect is particularly visible for the twolighttwoheavy
and the fourheavy operators for which one finds that the individual fits underestimate the
magnitude of the 95 cl interval by around a factor two on average rather than by a factor
10 as in the linear case the situation is instead similar to the linear fits for the twofermion
and the purely bosonic operators and for example now also for ctz  cb and cw one finds
large differences between marginalised and individual fits one should point out however
that even on those cases where the magnitude of the bound does not vary much the central

figure 58 representative results for twoparameter fits carried out at linear order in the eft we
display the 95 cl ellipses obtained for different data subsets and for the complete dataset labelled
as all data 2d for reference we also show the marginalised bounds obtained in the global fit
the black square in the center of the plot indicates the sm value
bestfit values can still shift in a nonnegligible manner this is illustrated by the twolighttwoheavy operators c1tu and c8qu  for which one obtains
c1tu 
016 001 individual
030 010 marginalised 
055 022 individual
101 009 marginalised 
c8qu
hence for instance while c1tu agrees with the sm at the 95 cl in the individual fit this is
not the case in the marginalised one from this comparison one can conclude that for the
twolighttwoheavy and the fourheavy operators most of the sensitivity is already captured
by the individual fits once quadratic corrections are included
twoparameter fits to complement the insights provided by individual fits it can also
be instructive to carry out twoparameter fits specially to investigate the relative interplay
between specific pairs of eft coefficients in such fits two coefficients are allowed to vary
simultaneously while the rest are set to zero to illustrate the information that can be provided
by such twoparameter fits fig 58 displays representative results for fits performed at the
linear order we display the 95 cl ellipses obtained when different subsets of data are used
as input as well as for the complete dataset labelled as all data 2d for reference we
also show here the marginalised bounds obtained from the global fit
to begin with the upper panels of fig 58 display twoparameter fits for the three possible
pairwise combinations of the ct  ctg  and cg coefficients which connect higgs production in
gluon fusion with top quark pair production see also the fisher information table of fig 31
these comparisons illustrate the relative impact of the various dataset in constraining each
coefficient for example from the ct  ctg  fit we see that the sensitivity of ctg is driven by tt
data while the higgs measurements have a flat direction resulting in a elongated ellipse when
top and higgs data are combined the resulting 95 cl ellipse is much smaller as compared
to the results obtained separately from the two groups of processes note that as in the case
of the individual fits reported in fig 57 also for twoparameter fits the obtained bounds are
more stringent as compared to the global marginalised results similar considerations apply
to the cg  ctg  fit while from the cg  ct  one learns that the sensitivity is still dominated
by the higgs signal strengths rather than by the differential crosssection measurements
then the bottom panels of fig 58 display twoparameter fits involving the twolight38 8
twoheavy coefficients c18
qq  cqq  ctu  ctd  and ctq  all of which are constrained mostly from top
quark pair differential distributions as indicated by the fisher information matrix here the
scope is to illustrate the relative sensitivity provided by some of the tt datasets that enter
the fit singleinclusive mtt distributions the doubledifferential mtt  ytt  distributions and
ttv measurements the results confirm both that the mtt distributions completely dominate
the fit of these coefficients and that the marginalised cl ellipses are rather broader than for
the twodimensional fits the latter is again in agreement with the results of the individual
linear fits reported in the upper panel of fig 57
dataset dependence
the discussion so far has focused on the output of the global fits obtained for the baseline
dataset summarised in tables 31 to 34 here we aim to assess the dependence of these
results with respect to the choice of input dataset with this purpose we consider here fits
for the following variations
 a fit which includes only top quark measurements this fit makes possible quantifying
the interplay between the top and the higgs data in the global fit
 a fit which includes only higgs boson production and decay data which provides complementary information as compared to the toponly fit
 a fit which includes only top quark measurements but now restricted to the same
dataset as in our original study from 7 this comparison allows one to assess the
impact in the toponly eft fit of the new lhc top quark measurements that have
become available in the last two years
 a fit where the diboson data is removed to determine how much weight the diboson
crosssections carry in the global fit results
 a fit where all highenergy bins defined as those bins probing the region e  1 tev are
removed the motivation for such a fit is to study how important are the constraints
provided by the highenergy region in the global fit results which in turn is an important
input to establish the validity of the eft approximation
 a fit where those datasets displaying poor agreement with the sm crosssections are
removed specifically here one removes the datasets whose 2 differs by more than 3

table 55 same as table 53 for eft fits obtained from variations of the baseline dataset we list
the results of the following fits including only top quark measurements either for the 2018 or the
current dataset a higgsonly dataset without the diboson crosssections with the highenergy bins
excluded and with the datasets with a poor 2sm excluded in all cases the quadratic eft corrections
are accounted for the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of data points in the case that
these are different from those of the baseline settings listed in the second column
from their statistical expectation assuming the sm hypothesis while such disagreements between data and sm theory could very well indicate hints of bsm physics they
can also be explained by for example issues with the experimental correlation models
hence this fit allows us to verify to which extent the global fit results are determined
from the datasets that disagree the most with the sm predictions
note that as explained in sect 3 for the purposes of categorisation into datasets the tth
crosssections are considered part of the higgs measurements furthermore we note that all
these fits are based on quadratic eft calculations and that the constraints provided by the
ewpos on the eft parameter space are always accounted for
to begin with table 55 collects the values of the 2 per data points for eft fits obtained
from variations of the input dataset we list the results of the various fits described above
including only top quark measurements either from the current or the 2018 dataset with a
higgsonly dataset without the diboson crosssections with the highenergy bins excluded
and with the datasets with a poor 2sm excluded the numbers in parentheses indicate the
number of data points in the case that these are different from those of the baseline settings
listed in the second column we observe how the description of the higgs crosssections is
essentially unaffected in these fits with reduced datasets concerning the total 2 for the
top data we see that it is stable in the fit where the highenergy bins are removed but that
is markedly improved from 102 to 077 in the fit where the datasets with poor 2sm are
excluded
then in fig 59 we compare the magnitude of the 95 cl bounds same as in the upper
panel of fig 54 between the global fit results with those obtained in the toponly and higgs61
only fits as mentioned above these fits allow us to assess the interplay between the top
and the higgs data in the global analysis in other words to identify what are the main
benefits of the simultaneous mapping of the eft parameter space as compared to carrying
out separate fits to each group of processes first of all we note that the global fit bounds
are more stringent for all the eft coefficients than in either the toponly or higgsonly fit
highlighting the overall consistency of the two datasets secondly the crosstalk of the top
and higgs data is found to be most relevant for the twofermion coefficients ct and cq 
whose bounds are improved by around a factor 2 in the global fit as compared to the toponly
fit another operator that benefits from the global fit is cg  which is unconstrained in the
toponly fit but bound in the global fit is clearly improved as compared to the higgsonly
fit this study shows how by breaking degeneracies one gains information in the global fit
as compared to the partial ones sometimes in unexpected directions in the parameter space
such as for cg in this case
next fig 510 displays a similar comparison as in fig 59 now comparing first the
outcome of the global fit with that of a fit where the diboson crosssections have been removed
and second comparing two toponly fits namely the fit displayed in the upper panel of fig 59
with a fit based on the same dataset as our previous study from 7 the fit without diboson
data demonstrates that the constraints provided by the diboson crosssections are negligible
in comparison with those provided by the higgs data and the ewpos for all coefficients
considered in the fit except for the triple gauge operator cw  this result is consistent with
the fisher information analysis of fig 31 and indicates that apart from cw  the diboson
data does not provide competitive information on the eft parameter space in the context of
a global fit
the comparison of the two toponly fits in the bottom panel of fig 510 illustrates how
for all coefficients the bounds are improved thanks to the more recent lhc measurements5
the improvement is consistent across the board quantifies the additional information brought
in by the new topquark crosssection measurements see table 55 and confirms that the
broader and more diverse the input dataset is the more stringent the resulting constraints
on the eft parameter space that will be obtained
to conclude this discussion of the dataset dependence of our results we consider the
outcome of two more fits first one where the datasets exhibiting poor agreement with the
sm predictions are excluded and second another where all bins sensitive to the highenergy
region defined as e  1 tev are removed the bestfit values and 95 cl intervals of these
two fits are compared with the baseline results in fig 511 as indicated in table 55 in the
fit where those datasets with poor 2sm have been removed one is essentially cutting away
27 points from top quark production mostly from the inclusive tt category the only coefficients that are affected by this reduction in the dataset are some of the twolighttwoheavy
operators whose bounds are somewhat enlarged consistently with the loss of experimental
information specifically this has the consequence that the 95 cl intervals for c1tu and c8qu
now agree with the sm expectation as opposed to the global fit configuration
concerning the outcome of the fit without the highenergy bins as expected the only
differences are observed again for the twolighttwoheavy coefficients the results are similar
as in the previous case an increase in the coefficient uncertainties and an improved agreement
of c1tu and c8qu with the sm predictions from these comparisons one can conclude that
the global fit is not dominated by the highenergy regions where the eft validity could be
recall that now we consider the top yukawa coefficient ct as part of the higgs dataset

in addition to the choice of input dataset another important factor that determines the
outcome of a global analysis such as the present one is the accuracy of the eft theoretical
calculations here we assess the role played at the level of the fit results by the inclusion of
nlo qcd corrections to the eft crosssections as indicated in table 39 our baseline fit
includes these nlo corrections to the eft calculations whenever available so now we switch

them off deliberately to quantify how much they affect the fit outcome6 in the following the
theoretical predictions for the sm crosssections based on the stateoftheart calculations
remain unchanged and only the eft ones are modified as compared to the baseline settings
table 56 compares the values of the 2 for the various groups of processes in quadratic
fits with and without nlo qcd corrections to the eft crosssections as well as for the
associated sm results one can observe how the fit quality worsens if nlo qcd effects are
not accounted for with the total dataset topquark dataset increasing to 2  105 111
from 2  101 102 in the baseline on the other hand the fit quality is essentially
unchanged for the higgs and diboson datasets irrespective of whether or not nlo qcd
corrections are accounted for one can therefore trace back this increase in the 2 values
when lo eft calculations are used to the topquark pair distributions which contribute to
this study is also motivated by the fact that many eft fits rely on lo qcd for the eft crosssections

fig 512 then displays the posterior probability distributions and the corresponding 95

the baseline for instance in terms of a shift in the bestfit values or due to an increase in the
width of the distributions as an illustration the operator that modifies the charm yukawa
interaction cc  exhibits a bimodal distribution once nlo effects are accounted for while
the dominant solution for the ct coefficient is far from the sm in the lo fit but smlike
in the nlo case this comparison highlights how the inclusion of nlo qcd corrections is
necessary to achieve robust results for the fitted eft coefficients alternatively one could
account for the missing higherorder uncertainties mhous in the eft crosssections which

global dataset
table 56 same as table 53 now for fits based on variations of the theory settings as compared to the
baseline ones specifically we provide the results of a fit where the eft crosssections are evaluated
at lo in the qcd expansion as well as those of the topphilic scenario where the parameter space has
been restricted as described in sect 22 in both cases quadratic eft corrections are being included
note that the sm crosssections are always evaluated using stateoftheart theory calculations
are usually neglected using for instance the approach advocated in 133 134 implementing
mhous systematically is expected to improve the overall compatibility of eft fits performed
with and without nlo qcd corrections
interestingly for specific operators such as the twolighttwoheavy coefficients and the
triple gauge operator cw  neglecting nlo corrections leads to both a shift in the bestfit
values but also to somewhat reduced 95 cl intervals such behaviour may arise when
nlo contributions to the quadratic eft crosssections introduce novel new directions in the
parameter space for example with coefficients that are absent at the lo level nevertheless
only once all sources of theory uncertainty are included it will be possible to ascertain in an
unambiguous manner whether or not nlo qcd corrections lead to more precise in addition
to more accurate global eft analyses
in the specific case of the ct coefficient one can verify that the corresponding individual
2 profile analog of fig 42 for lo fits does not exhibit the second solution identified in
fig 512 and hence it must be induced by the crosstalk with other coefficients in the fit to
validate this hypothesis fig 513 displays the outcome of twoparameter quadratic fits for
ct  ctz  and ct  cw  comparing the results of the lo eft fit with its nlo counterpart
in both cases the lo twoparameter fits based on the full dataset favour the solution far
from the sm while the nlo ones instead favour the smlike one the explanation for this
behaviour can be traced back to the fact that the nonsm solution is disfavored by higherorder eft corrections to hz associated production in particular the loopinduced gluongluon
contributions
another remarkable effect of the nlo qcd corrections to the eft crosssections can be

observed as a modification of the correlation patterns fig 514 displays the same correlations
maps as in fig 56 now for global fits based on lo eft calculations at the linear and
quadratic level specially for the linear fits we observe that correlations become more sizable
in general higher fraction of colored entries in the lo case while these are reduced once
nlo corrections are accounted for this feature demonstrates how nlo qcd effects may
reduce parameter correlations by introducing additional sensitivity to the fit coefficients given
the same input dataset
the topphilic scenario
to conclude this section we present results for a global eft fit carried out in the topphilic
scenario defined in sect 22 in this scenario we have the 9 equations of eq 210 that
relate a subset of the 14 twoheavytwolight coefficients listed in table 25 among them
leaving 5 independent parameters to be constrained in the fit given the more constraining

figure 514 same as fig 56 for lo eft calculations in linear left and quadratic right fits
assumptions associated to the topphilic scenario one expects to find an improvement in the
bounds of the twolighttwoheavy eft operators due to the fact that the parameter space
is being restricted by theoretical considerations rather than by data in this case
the values of the 2 for each group of datasets in the topphilic scenario were reported in
table 56 one finds that the 2 to the top quark crosssections is somewhat worsened with
respect to the baseline fit 107 versus 102 while remaining better than in the sm case
the same considerations apply at the level of the total dataset driven by the different fit
quality to the top quark observables while the higgs and diboson data are unaffected this
slightly inferior description of the top quark experimental data in the topphilic scenario can
be explained by the reduction in the eft parameter space which restricts the number of
independent directions that can be explored by the fit as we show below the main benefit
of the topphilic scenario is instead that within its assumptions one achieves more stringent
limits for many of the operators that modify top quark properties
fig 515 displays the 95 cl intervals for the eft coefficients comparing the global
fit results with those of the topphilic scenario the only operators that are affected in a
significant manner turn out to be the twolighttwoheavy operators with the bounds in
several of them such as c1td  c11
qq  and ctq improving by almost an order of magnitude the fact
that only the bounds on the twolighttwoheavy operators are modified is consistent with the
topphilic scenario given that only this specific group of eft coefficients is being constrained
by its model assumptions
it is worth emphasizing at this point that from the technical point of view carrying out
global eft fits with specific restrictions in the parameter space motivated by uvcompletions
such as those arising in the topphilic scenario and leading to fig 515 is relatively straightforward indeed the most efficient fitting strategy would be to start from the broadest possible parameter space and once the corresponding fit has been performed introduce model
assumptions relating eft coefficients in a systematic manner this way one can connect
with specific models for uvcompletions of the sm which typically result in a rather smaller

number of eft coefficients to be constrained from data
summary and outlook
in this work we have presented an extensive interpretation of higgs diboson and top quark
measurements from the lhc in the framework of the standard model effective field theory
by combining the most updated experimental data with stateoftheart theory calculations
both in the sm and in the eft we have provided bounds on 50 directions in the smeft
parameter space of which 36 correspond to independent parameters we have quantified in
detail the relative impact that the different types of processes have in the results of this global
eft analysis both in terms of fits with dataset variations and by means of statistical diagnosis
tools such as information geometry techniques and principal component analysis our analysis
highlights the overall complementarity of the various input processes further motivating the
need for a global interpretation of lhc measurements we have also demonstrated how
within such a global eft analysis genuinely flat directions are essentially absent since each
process and each kinematic bin of a distribution constrains separate combinations of the fit
parameters the robustness of our fitting methodology has been crossvalidated by deploying
two completely independent methods mcfit and ns for mapping the eft parameter space
we have also extensively quantified the role played in the global analysis by the inclusion
of nlo qcd corrections to the eft crosssections whose automation has been recently
achieved we find that the posterior probability distributions of the fit parameters can be
modified in nontrivial ways by these nlo qcd effects shifting the bestfit value modifying
the magnitude of the 95 cl intervals and even inducing multimodal distributions these
findings demonstrate that available lhc data is already sensitive to nlo effects in the eft
crosssections further highlighting the importance of accounting for them in a systematic
manner to achieve both accurate and precise results
one could consider several directions in which the present study could be extended to
begin with one would like to include directly the constraints provided by leps electroweak
precision observables rather than in an approximate manner as done in the present work
furthermore it would be beneficial to add to the global analysis new highpt observables
providing complementary information on the higgs and gauge sectors of the smeft such as
for instance vector boson scattering vbs z production in vector boson fusion vbf or
highmass drellyan production all of them constraining the electroweak interactions other
processes that one might consider in this context are singleinclusive jet dijet and multijet
production which are sensitive to several directions in the parameter space not covered by
other processes specifically to a large number of fourfermion operators
from the point of view of theoretical calculations it would be important to systematize the
study of higherorder terms in the eft expansion considering in particular double insertions
of dimensionsix operators and representative subsets of dimensioneight operators we point
out that within our fitting methodology accounting for these higher order terms is technically
straightforward along the same lines one could extend the fitting formalism to account for
all sources of theoretical uncertainties and their correlations in a systematic manner both for
the sm and for the eft calculations something which is done only partially here in addition
it should be interesting to develop statistically optimal observables for eft analyses such
as those based on deep learning 141143 making possible complementing the constraints
obtained at the level of unfolded crosssections with those extracted directly at the detector
level
another promising research direction is that of combining the global eft interpretation
of highpt observables at the lhc presented here with that of flavour data from lhcb
and from other bfactories such as belle the urgency of a simultaneous eft analyses
of highpt and flavour data has been further highlighted by the recent evidence reported
by the lhcb experiment for the violation of lepton flavour universality lfu in bmeson
decays 25 these findings demand exploiting the flexibility of the eft framework in order
to comprehensively map the allowed signatures of eventual lfu violation in highpt crosssections at the lhc and elsewhere
likewise it would be important to account for the constraints provided by low energy
processes in the smeft parameter space from neutrino data and electric dipole moment
measurements to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the latter case a 41
deviation with respect to the sm expectation has recently been reported 144 confirming and
strengthening one of the most puzzling anomalies in particle physics indeed the ultimate goal
of our program would be a truly global eft interpretation including all processes sensitive to
the soughtfor uv completion of the sm making sure no stone is left unturned in the ongoing
quest to unravel the new particles and interactions that lie beyond the standard model

comparison with experimental data
in this appendix we present a systematic comparison between the experimental data used as
input to the fit with the corresponding theoretical crosssections based both
on the sm and on
the bestfit smeft results either at linear o 2 or at quadratic o 4 accuracy in these
comparisons the experimental measurements will be presented both in terms of unshifted
central values where the error band represents the total uncertainty and once the bestfit
systematic shifts have been subtracted such that the error band contains only the statistical
component note that the evaluation of the shifted data is only possible whenever the full
breakup of the experimental systematic uncertainties is made available by in hepdata if this
is not the case for example when only the full experimental correlation matrix is provided or
no information on correlations is released we will display only the unshifted data
to begin with fig a1 displays the comparison between experimental data and the
bestfit eft theory predictions for linear and quadratic fits in the case of representative
differential top quark pair and single top quark production datasets both the data and the
eft fit results are normalised to the central value of the sm theory prediction this implies
that the more the fit results deviate from unity the larger the bestfit eft effects are for
this specific observable furthermore the error band in the eft prediction indicates the
associated 95 cl interval evaluated over the nspl samples produced by the ns method
from these comparisons one can observe how for some datasets the bestfit eft results
move in the direction of the experimental data for instance in the case of the mtt distributions
at large invariant masses for inclusive tt production this is an important kinematic region
in the fit since energygrowing effects increase the eft sensitivity interestingly in the
highest mtt bins for some of the 13 tev top datasets the 95 cl interval associated to the
eft prediction does not include the sm expectation in the case of the singletop tchannel
differential crosssections the eft fit results are very close to the sm predictions indicating
that eft effects are well constrained for this process at the scale of the present experimental
uncertainties we also note that the uncertainty
band associated to the eft prediction can
turn out to be rather different in the o 2 fits as compared to the o 4 ones with the
latter in general being more precise than the former for the processes considered here

figure a1 comparison between experimental data and bestfit eft theory predictions both for
the linear and the quadratic fits for representative differential top quark pair and single top quark
production datasets both the data and the eft fit results are normalised to the central value of the
sm crosssection the data is presented both with unshifted central values where the band represents
the total experimental error and once the bestfit systematic shifts have been subtracted so that the
error band contains only the statistical component the error band in the eft prediction indicates
the 95 cl interval evaluated over the nspl samples produced by the ns method

tial distributions at 13 tev and the lep diboson crosssections at different centerofmass
energies note that contrary to the rest of the datasets the comparison for the w helicity
fraction is carried out at the absolute rather than at the normalised level concerning the
single top measurements the bestfit eft predictions tend to move towards the experimental
data which in most cases is somewhat higher than the sm prediction for some datasets
such as singletop schannel crosssection at 8 tev and the tw crosssections at 13 tev the
agreement between atlas and cms is at best marginal and thus the eft fit interpolates
between the two measurements a similar behaviour is observed for the tttt crosssections at
13 tev furthermore as was the case for the processes considered in fig a1 the eft fit
uncertainties appear to be reduced in the quadratic case
moving to the lep and lhc diboson datasets one finds that for electronpositron collisions the eft fit result is very close to the sm crosssection with a vanishing uncertainty
this result is likely to be related to the constraints imposed by the ewpos as well as by
the lhc diboson data nevertheless the sm predictions are in good agreement with the
lep data for all four centerofmass energies considered to begin with in the case of the
z distributions in the w  w  and w z

s  13 tev namely the pth distributions summing over all production modes and final states upper
panels and the simplified template crosssection measurements bottom panels corresponding to
the zz left and the  final states right panel
the eft corrections is small except perhaps for the highestenergy bin of the me and mw
distribution similar considerations apply for the cms 13 tev w z dataset where we observe
good agreement between theory and data also for the high pz
t region
concerning the comparison between experimental data and theory calculations for the
higgs production and decay measurements fig a3 displays representative higgs measure
ments from atlas and cms at s  13 tev namely the pth distributions inclusive over
all production modes and final states and the simplified template crosssection measurements corresponding to the zz and the  final states for atlas and cms respectively
then fig a4 summarizes the results corresponding to higgs boson signal strengths for different production mechanisms and decay channels specifically we show the atlascms
run i combination and the atlas and cms run ii measurements at 13 tev note that
by construction in the signal strengths the sm predictions correspond to i  1 see the

figure a4 same as fig a1 for the higgs boson signal strengths corresponding to different production mechanisms and decay channels from top to bottom we show the atlascms run i
combination and the atlas and cms run ii measurements at 13 tev note that by the definition
of the signal strengths the sm predictions correspond to i  1 in all cases see also app b
in the case of the differential higgs distributions we can observe the good agreement both
the sm and the eft predictions within the relatively large experimental uncertainties for
these distributions the eft effects can reach a magnitude of up to a few percent in the global
fit for instance for the cms pth distribution in the quadratic fit the bestfit results are
 15 higher than the sm for the pth  1 tev bin for the case of the signal strengths
also a fair agreement is found though for some combinations of production channel and decay
mode the experimental uncertainties still remain rather large
implementation of higgs signal strengths
in this appendix we describe how the higgs signal strengths have been implemented in
the present analysis for a generic higgs production and decay crosssection denoted as
pp  h  x the experimentally measured signal strength is defined as the product of the
production crosssection times the corresponding branching ratio normalised to the standard
model predictions
exp
pphx 
 exp pp  h  x

 sm pp  h  brsm h  x
which in turn can be expressed as
exp
pphx 
 exp pp  h  x
 exp pp  h  x
 sm pp  h  x
 sm pp  h  x tot
where tot indicates the total higgs width and x is the partial width for the decay into the
specific final state x in this work we assume that the higgs boson decays only to known
particles and hence set to zero its branching ratio to invisible final states the theoretical
prediction corresponding to the measurement of the signal strengths eq b2 in the smeft
is given by
pphx c  
eft
 eft pp  hc  x
 sm pp
 h

at any order in the eft expansion we can express eq b3 as

where the total width is evaluated as the sum of all relevant partial decay widths
pphx c

where x y  and z indicate possible sm final states in which the higgs boson can decay
assuming now that   1 tev and working at linear order in the eft expansion one has

ci i 
eft
c  x
ci x i 
where n is the number of independent dimension6 operators in the fitting basis and i 
and x i  are the absolute eft corrections associated to the production cross section
and partial width respectively corresponding to the operator ci 
inserting now the linear eft expansion into eq b5 one gets

note that in this notation we use  to indicate relative eft corrections while the  always

strengths
usage of smefit results
the results of this work are made available via the website of the smefit project
httpslhcfitnikhefgithubiosmeft
as well as via the corresponding public github repository
httpsgithubcomlhcfitnikhefsmefit
specifically we provide the full set of nspl samples corresponding to the ns fits presented in
this work for the nop  50 wilson coefficients we recall that not all of these coefficients are
associated to independent degrees of freedom and that 14 of them are constrained by the
ewpo relations as discussed in sect 2
these nspl samples provide a representation of the probability density associated to the
eft coefficients from these samples it is easy to evaluate statistical estimators such as
means standard deviations and correlations eg

nspl k1 i

nspl

ci  cj  
c c  hci ihcj i
nspl k1 i j
ci ck 
i j  1     nop 
as well as other estimators such as confidence level intervals and higher moments beyond the
quadratic approximation one should emphasize that as discussed in sect 5 the gaussian
approximation is in general not reliable for most of the eft parameters in the case that the
quadratic o 4 corrections are accounted for
these samples spanning the probability density in the space of eft wilson coefficients
could also be used to quantify a posteriori the impact in the fit of new measurements by
means of the bayesian reweighting method presented in 33
to facilitate the usage of the results presented in this work we also make available via
the github repository a python analysis code that takes as input the samples corresponding
to a specific eft fit and then evaluates means correlations and 95 cl intervals as well
as produces most of the plots and statistical estimators displayed in sect 5 in a future
installment of our global eft analysis we plan to release the full smefit fitting code and
the associated theoretical and experimental inputs together with a complete documentation
and userfriendly examples
