ABSTRACT
The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has an anomalous number of globular clusters, five, for its
stellar mass. There is a longstanding debate about a potential sixth globular cluster (Fornax 6) that
has recently been 'rediscovered' in DECam imaging. We present new Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy
of the Fornax 6 cluster and Fornax dSph. Combined with literature data we identify ∼ 15 − 17
members of the Fornax 6 cluster that this overdensity is indeed a star cluster and associated with the
Fornax dSph. The cluster is significantly more metal-rich (mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.71 ± 0.05)
than the other five Fornax globular clusters (−2.5 < [F e/H] < −1.4) and more metal-rich than the
−1
bulk of Fornax. We measure a velocity dispersion of 5.6+2.0
corresponding to anomalously
−1.6 km s
high mass-to-light of 15<M/L<258 at 90% confidence when calculated assuming equilibrium. Two
stars inflate this dispersion and may be either Fornax field stars or as yet unresolved binary stars.
Alternatively the Fornax 6 cluster may be undergoing tidal disruption. Based on its metal-rich nature,
the Fornax 6 cluster is likely younger than the other Fornax clusters, with an estimated age of ∼ 2
Gyr when compared to stellar isochrones. The chemodynamics and star formation history of Fornax
shows imprints of major events such as infall into the Milky Way, multiple pericenter passages, star
formation bursts, and/or potential mergers or interactions. Any of these events may have triggered
the formation of the Fornax 6 cluster.
Keywords: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies, Globular star clusters
1. INTRODUCTION

The Fornax dSph (hereafter, Fornax) is the fourth
most massive satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, in terms
of stellar mass. It has an extended star formation history, with major star formation at old ages (> 10 Gyr
ago), a subsequent burst at ∼ 4.6 Gyr, and recent intermittent episodes (Rusakov et al. 2021). The chemodyCorresponding author: Andrew B. Pace

namics of red-giant branch stars show that a relatively
metal-rich stellar population is centrally concentrated
and kinematically cold, and a metal-poor population is
more spatially extended and dynamically hot (Battaglia
et al. 2006; Walker & Peñarrubia 2011). There is evidence for mergers in the kinematics and spatial distribution (Amorisco & Evans 2012; del Pino et al. 2017).
Fornax is unusual in its large number of globular clusters (GC) and mass in GCs compared to other galaxies of similar stellar mass (M? ∼ 2 × 107 M )(Huang
& Koposov 2021). In particular, the relation between
number of GCs and dwarf galaxy host mass becomes
stochastic for galaxies slightly larger than Fornax (e.g.,

2

A.B. Pace et al.

Forbes et al. 2018). There are 5 "bright" GCs in Fornax that have received significant study of their structural profiles (Mackey & Gilmore 2003), chemistry and
metallicity (Strader et al. 2003; Hendricks et al. 2016),
and ages (de Boer & Fraser 2016). A "sixth" Fornax GC
was first noted by Shapley (1939); however, subsequent
studies debated its nature and whether it was composed
of stars or background galaxies (Verner et al. 1981; Demers et al. 1994; Stetson et al. 1998) and it fell out of the
literature for some time. Recent DECam imaging and
Gaia astrometric data have shown that the Fornax 6
GC (F6) is clearly resolved into an overdensity of stars
(Wang et al. 2019a).
Besides the large number of GCs in Fornax, their survival and lack of sinking to the center of Fornax is an
open question that has implications for the dark matter
halo of Fornax. If the Fornax GCs formed at their current positions they would sink to the center of Fornax
in several Gyr from dynamical fiction in a cuspy dark
matter halo (Goerdt et al. 2006). In contrast, if Fornax
has a cored dark matter halo, the sinking time increases
to ∼ 10 Gyr. There is other evidence from the chemodynamics and multiple stellar populations that suggests
that Fornax contains a cored dark matter halo (Walker
& Peñarrubia 2011; Amorisco et al. 2013). However, the
unknown formation location of the GCs can relax constraints on the underlying dark matter halo and 'cuspy'
solutions are not excluded (Shao et al. 2020). The peculiar radial distribution of the GCs may be evidence for
a dwarf-dwarf merger in Fornax (Leung et al. 2020).
Here we present Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy that
confirms that the F6 globular cluster is a coherent stellar structure, distinct from the Fornax dSph, and whose
kinematics and chemistry we measure. In Section 2 we
present our observations and auxiliary data and also
present our velocity and metallicity measurements with
the Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy. In Section 3 we discuss Fornax membership, the membership, kinematics
and metallicity of F6, and discuss the nature of F6 and
compare it to other GCs. In section 4, we conclude and
summarize our results.
2. DATA

2.1. M2FS Spectroscopy
We present results from new spectroscopic observations of Fornax stars that we obtained using the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS; Mateo et al. 2012)
at the 6.5-m Magellan/Clay Telescope at Las Campanas
Observatory, Chile. M2FS is a dual-channel, multiobject echelle spectrograph that offers various options
for spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, and is
fed by up to 256 fibers that can be deployed over a field

cluster identified in this work.

of diameter 0.5◦ . We used a configuration that covered the approximate range 5130 - 5190 Å at resolution
R ∼ 24, 000.
2.1.1. Target Selection
We used photometry from the Dark Energy Survey
(Year 1; DES Collaboration et al. 2018), combined with
astrometry from Gaia (DR2; Gaia Collaboration et al.
2018a ) to select red giant branch (RGB) candidates
along the line of sight to Fornax. In Figure 1 we show a
80" by 80" false color grz coadded image centered on the
F6 cluster made with the Legacy Survey Sky Viewer1
(Dey et al. 2019). The F6 members identified in this
work are denoted with green circles (see Section 3.2).
We considered a given star to be an RGB candidate if its
r-band magnitude and g −r color (both corrected for extinction using the dust maps of Schlegel et al. 1998 with
extinction coefficients from DES Collaboration et al.
2018) placed it within  magnitudes of an old (age =
12 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1.5) theoretical isochrone
computed using the PARSEC package (Bressan
et al.
q
2 ,
2012). We adopted a tolerance of  = 0.22 + σg−r
where σg−r is the color's observational error. We then
filtered these RGB candidates according to the parallax

Magellan/M2FS Spectroscopy of Fornax 6
measured by Gaia, discarding those with nonzero parallax detected at ≥ 3σ significance.
For the remaining RGB candidates, we assigned targeting priority based on proximity of the Gaia-observed
proper motion to the Fornax mean reported by the Gaia
Collaboration et al. (2018b): (μα , μδ ) = (0.376, −0.413)
in units of mas yr−1 . Specifically, we awarded 'points'
to stars according to the following: 5 points for having
proper motion within 12 km s−1 (Fornax's line-of-sight
velocity dispersion) of Fornax's mean (assuming distance 150 kpc), plus three (two, one) additional points
if the proper motion is within one (three, five) times the
star's proper motion uncertainty from Fornax's mean
proper motion. When allocating fibers within a given
M2FS field, we randomly selected amongst the RGB
candidates having the largest available point total, up to
a maximum of 232 targets, leaving up to 24 fibers to observe regions of blank sky for the purpose of background
subtraction.
2.1.2. Observations and Data Reduction
Between the years 2018 and 2020, we observed 8 Fornax fields with M2FS. Table 1 lists central coordinates
(which coincide with the location of a bright star used
for wavefront sensing) for each field, along with the date
of observation, total exposure time, number of targeted
stars and number of stars with successful measurements.
Four fields targeted the F6 cluster and surrounding Fornax dSph and four targeted the outskirts of the galaxy.
We process all M2FS spectra using a custom-built
Python-based pipeline that, where applicable, incorporates modules that are publicly available as part of
the Astropy software package (Astropy Collaboration
et al. 2013, 2018). Complete details will be provided
by Walker et al. (in preparation). Briefly, we use
standard procedures to perform overscan, bias, dark
current and gain corrections. We identify and trace
the 2D aperture corresponding to each spectrum, and
then extract the one-dimensional spectra by taking the
weighted averages of pixel counts along the direction
approximately orthogonal to the dispersion axis. We
use spectra acquired during twilight to perform flat-field
and wavelength-dependent throughput corrections, and
we use spectra of a Thorium-Argon-Neon arc lamp, acquired before and after each science exposure, to perform wavelength calibration. We propagate the variance
in each pixel through all processing steps.
Following the procedure of Walker et al. (2015b,a,
2016), we model each spectrum using a library of
synthetic templates that cover a grid with dimensions of effective temperature Teff , surface gravity log g,
and [Fe/H] metallicity. In addition to these stellar-

3

atmospheric parameters, we also obtain estimates of
the line-of-sight velocity, vlos . After imposing a quality
control filter that requires median signal-to-noise ratio
S/N> 0 (sky over-subtraction can result in unphysically
negative S/N) and velocity error v < 5 km s−1 , the
M2FS sample includes 980 observations of 804 unique
Fornax stars. The resulting M2FS catalog for Fornax is
listed in Table 2.
2.2. Systematic errors
In order to determine systematic errors for the velocities and metallicities determined from M2FS spectra, we use repeat measurements of all stars observed
with M2FS (using the same instrument configuration as
for Fornax); Walker et al. (in preparation) will provide the complete catalog resulting from these observations. The targets are primarily dSphs but also include several globular clusters. Overall, there are 14437
pairs and 5646 pairs where both measurement passes
our quality cuts. We model the pair-wise velocity differences as a mixture of a Gaussian with an outlier model
(Section 4.1 of Li et al. 2019). The final uncertainty
is treated as a systematic error plus a scaling parame2

ter, σv,calib
systematic + (kv σv,obs ) , where σv,obs is
taken from the previous section. For the velocity and
metallicity systematic errors, we find kv = 0.95 ± 0.02,
σv, systematic = 0.59 ± 0.02 km s−1 , k[Fe/H] = 1.08 ± 0.03,
and σ[Fe/H], systematic = 0.04 ± 0.01. We adopt the median values for our analysis.
2.3. Additional Data
We use photometric and astrometric data from the
Gaia EDR3 catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2020).
We only utilize astrometric data that passed the following cuts: ruwe < 1.4 (Lindegren et al. 2020) and
|C ∗ | ≤ 3σC ∗ (G) (Riello et al. 2020). We include additional Magellan/MMFS spectroscopic data from Walker
et al. (2009a) which increases the number of Fornax
members by ∼ 2400 stars. This data is ideal improving
the Fornax dSph velocity distribution near F6 to assist
with the separation between the dSph and F6 stars.
2.4. Final Spectroscopic Sample
In order to combine the MMFS and M2FS samples
we must correct for zero point velocity shifts and verify
that the velocity errors of the two samples are not biased relative to one another. Finding a small velocity
offset between two different catalogs is not uncommon,
given different instruments and methodology for velocity measurements. Furthermore, previous analysis has
concluded that the errors in the Fornax MMFS data set
are underestimated (Minor 2013). There are 4113 velocity measurements of 3304 stars with the combined

MMFS and M2FS samples and there are 200 pairs of
measurements between MMFS and M2FS. We compare
repeat velocities between MMFS and M2FS using the
normalized
q difference between two observations, ∆ =
2 + σ 2 , and find that ∆ = −0.16 km s−1
(v1 −v2 )/ σv,1
v
v,2
and σ∆v = 1.2 km s−1 between the repeat measurements. After applying an offset of −0.4545 km s−1 and
scaling the errors by a factor of 1.355 to the MMFS data
we find ∆v = 0 and σ∆v = 1 km s−1 . Out increase in
error of the MMFS Fornax velocities by a factor of 1.355
is similar to the correction applied by Minor (2013).
To determine the systematic velocity and error of stars
with multiple measurements, we fit the multi-epoch data
with a normal distribution with a free mean and dispersion parameter. The mean parameter and statistics on
its posterior distribution are used for combined velocity
measurement. We use the median and the 84, 16% confidence intervals for the measurement and error, respec-

tively. This process will account for stars with evidence
of velocity variation as the mean will have a larger error than the individual measurements (representing our
ignorance of where it has been observed in its period, in
the case of binaries). We have compared this to other
common methods for combined velocity measurements,
such as computing the weighted mean velocity, and either the variance of the weighted mean or standard deviation of the mean velocity for the measurement error.

−2 −1/2
The variance of the weighted mean ( Σi σv,i
) underestimates the measurement error if there is velocity
variability. In this manner our combined measurements
are more robust to velocity variation.
Many MW stars can be immediately identified with
Gaia EDR3 astrometry (e.g., Pace & Li 2019). In particular, stars with non-zero parallax, $ − 4σ$ > 0, and
large proper motion (relative to a star at the Fornax
dSph distance) are nearby dwarf stars in the Galac-

tic foreground. We identify stars with large velocities
by comparing the tangential velocity to the MW escape velocity assuming the star is at the distance of
Fornax. The escape velocity computed with galpy using the potential MWPotential2014 with a larger halo
mass, Mvir = 1.6 × 1012 M (Bovy 2015). We then
compute vtan from the proper motion, assuming all
stars are at the distance of Fornax and account for
the Sun's reflex motion, assuming (U , V , W ) =
(11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km s−1 , with a circular velocity of
220 km s−1 (Schönrich et al. 2010). We consider stars
to be MW foreground stars with a loose cut of vtan −
4.5σvtan < vescape . MW stars identified in this manner
are not excluded from the modeling but are fixed as MW
stars to help determine the MW velocity and metallicity distribution (e.g., Pace et al. 2020). Overall, there
are 167 MW stars identified in this manner. We further
apply a loose color-magnitude selection in G − GRP vs
G based on candidate members selected by velocity and
proper motion. The combined M2FS and MMFS catalog is included in Table 3.

Table 4. Literature and derived properties of the Fornax dSph and the Fornax 6 Globular cluster. The number of members
(N) for the dSph includes both dSph and cluster members. N=2989 with pdSph > 0.9 and N=14,15 with pF6 > 0.5, 0.9. The
citations are: W19a (Wang et al. 2019b), W19b (Wang et al. 2019a), M18 (Muñoz et al. 2018). rh is the half-light radius along
the major axis.

of F6 by RF6 < 10 × rh, F 6 of which 7 are likely MW
foreground stars2 . The velocity distribution of stars
within RF6 < 3 × rh, F 6 is more tightly clustered than
the stars with RF6 > 3 × rh, F 6 as shown in Figure 2.
The nearby stars cluster around vlos ∼ 51 km s−1 which
is ∼ 4 km s−1 away from the Fornax dSph mean velocity.
To be more quantitative we explore two mixture models to identify foreground MW, Fornax dSph, and F6
stars. The first is a mixture model between the MW
and the Fornax system (Section 3.1). It is clear from
Figure 2, that the F6 radial velocity does not have a
large offset relative to the Fornax dSph. The small
number of F6 stars in the sample will not influence the
properties of the dSph (there are only 23 stars within
RF 6 < 3 × rh,F 6 ). The second mixture model is then
applied to the Fornax system members and separates
the F6 stars from the dSph (Section 3.2).

3.1. Fornax System Membership

We will use the subscript F6 to refer to properties of the cluster
(e.g., rh, F 6 is the half-light radius of F6) or measurements relative to the cluster (e.g., RF6 is the projected radial distance from
the center of F6).

We use a conditional likelihood based mixture model
(e.g., Martinez et al. 2011; Horigome et al. 2020),

L(α|R) = f (R)LdSph (α|R) + (1 − f (R))LMW (α|R) (1)
where α is the data vector (α = {vlos , μα? , μδ , [Fe/H]
}) and f (R) is the local membership probability and is
given by:
f (R) = ΣdSph (R)/(ΣdSph (R) + ΣMW (R)).

(2)

Here Σ(R) is the projected stellar density distribution.
We model the conditional likelihood instead of the full
likelihood due to the difficulty in modeling the spectroscopic selection function.
For both components, we model the velocity and
metallicity distributions as normal distributions and the
proper motion distribution as multi-variate normal distribution. For the dSph proper motion distribution we
fix the dispersion to 12 km s−1 as Gaia EDR3 proper motions are not precise enough to measure internal motions
(∼ 0.017 mas yr−1 ). For the dSph spatial distribution,
we model it with a King radial profile (King 1962):

distribution of the entire sample. The coordinate system is rotated such that the major axis aligns with the x-axis. Two ellipses

Where Re2 = x2 + y 2 /(1 − )2 is the elliptical radius,
rc is the core radius, rt is the tidal radius, and  is the
ellipticity. Here x and y are along the major and minor
axis respectively, which are rotated with respect to the
on-sky plane by the position angle, θ. For the spatial
parameters, we assume the following Gaussian priors
based on deep photometric measurements from Wang
et al. (2019b):  = 0.31 ± 0.002, θ = 42.2 ± 0.2 deg,
rc = 22.3 ± 0.10 , and rt = 77.5 ± 0.40 . For brighter
dSphs, two parameter radial density profiles are found
to be better fits (Muñoz et al. 2018) and the outer regions of the Fornax dSph are found to fall off more
steeply than a Plummer radial distribution (Moskowitz
& Walker 2020). We assume the MW foreground stars
are uniformly distributed within the Fornax region.
Overall, the 10 free parameters for the dSph distribution are: v and σv (velocity), [Fe/H] and σ[Fe/H] (metallicity) and μα? , μδ (proper motion), and , θ, rc , and

rt (spatial). The dispersion terms (σv and σ[Fe/H] ) are
modeled with Jeffreys (log-uniform) priors, the mean
parameters with uniform priors and the spatial parameters with Gaussian priors. The 8 parameters for the
MW model are: vM W and σv,M W (velocity), [Fe/H]MW ,
σ[Fe/H],MW , μα?,M W , μδ,M W ,σμα?,M W , σμδ,M W . Similar
to the dSph parameters, the dispersion parameters are
modeled with Jeffreys priors and the mean parameters
with uniform priors. There is one additional parameter,
NdSph /NM W , which is relative normalization parameter
in the fraction term. To determine membership, p, we
compute the ratio of the dSph likelihood to total likelihood (Pace et al. 2020).

3.2. Membership and Properties of Fornax 6
To determine the properties and membership of F6, we
utilize a mixture model composed of the Fornax dSph
and F6 with all stars identified as Fornax members in the
previous model (pdSph > 0.9). We do not include proper
motion measurements as Gaia EDR3 measurements are
not precise enough to differentiate between the cluster
and dSph due to the large distance of the system. The

bility pdSph > 0.9 which we consider our membership
threshold. We include the membership probabilities
(pdSph ) in Table 3. In Figure 3, we show the spatial,
velocity, metallicity, and proper motion distributions of
our Fornax sample.
The values for v and σv are similar to previous results with the MMFS sample (Walker et al. 2009b) and
other Fornax kinematic studies (e.g., Battaglia et al.
2006). The new M2FS observations increase the number of members known at large radius. We identify 165
members between 2 < R/rh < 3.4. We find Fornax to be
more metal-poor than previous Keck/DEIMOS data by
∆[F e/H] ∼ −0.2 (Kirby et al. 2013). The classical satellites are known to contain metallicity gradients (Kirby
et al. 2011) and the mean metallicity difference is likely
due to our more extended sample, tracing the outer regions. The median elliptical radius is Rell /rh ∼ 0.4 and
Rell /rh ∼ 1 for the Keck/DEIMOS and Magellan/M2FS
data sets, respectively. When we add a metallicity gradient option to the model ([Fe/H](R) = [Fe/H]0 + mR),
we find that the radial gradient is quite large, m =
−0.28 ± 0.02 dex R−1
or m = −0.84 ± 0.07 dex deg−1 .
h
This is larger than the (unresolved) value reported by
Kirby et al. (2011) and is again due to our extended
spatial sample.
The radius versus metallicity and velocity versus
metallicity panel of Figure 3 show evidence for chemodynamical sub-populations in Fornax. The metal-rich
component is more centrally concentrated and kinematically colder whereas the metal-poor component is more
extended and kinematically hot. This has been previously observed in Fornax (e.g. Battaglia et al. 2006;
Walker & Peñarrubia 2011) and will be explored further
in furture works.
Our proper motion measurements agrees within errors
with McConnachie & Venn (2020) but is discrepant with
Vitral (2021), both of which are based on Gaia EDR3
proper motions. Our results differ within the statistical
errors to previous Gaia DR2 measurements (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018b; Fritz et al. 2018), with the offset
likely due to proper motion zero-point systematic errors
in the DR2 catalog. These systematic errors have decreased by at least a factor of two in the EDR3 catalog.

Figure 4. Corner plot of properties of Fornax 6 based on
the model 1 mixture model. The parameters from left to
right are: mean velocity (v, km s−1 ), velocity dispersion (σv ,
km s−1 ), mean metallicity ([Fe/H]), and metallicity dispersion (σ[Fe/H] ). Both dispersions are modeled with Jeffreys
priors and the metallicity dispersion is constrained to be
σ[Fe/H] < 0.16 at 95% confidence interval.

F6 spatial distribution is modeled as a Plummer distribution (Plummer 1911). Similar to the dSph model,
the spatial parameters are varied with Gaussian priors
based on the parameters from Wang et al. (2019a) and
are listed in Table 4. The velocity and metallicity distributions of F6 are modeled with Gaussian distributions.
The properties of the F6 cluster we find are: v F6 =

−0.71−0.05 , and σ[Fe/H],F6 = 0.03−0.02 . The properties of the Fornax dSph are unchanged compared to the
previous model. The corner plot of these parameters
is shown in Figure 4. We find a total membership of
ΣpF 6 = 17.3 ± 2.7 in the cluster, with 15 and 14 stars
having membership larger than 0.5 and 0.9, respectively.
The F6 parameters are summarized in Table 4. From the
members we identify, we measure the systemic proper
motion of F6 to be μα? = 0.392 ± 0.026 mas yr−1 and
μδ = −0.448 ± 0.042 mas yr−1 . The F6 systemic proper
motion is consistent with the Fornax dSph after considering the large errors. We note that the Fornax dSph
systemic proper motions errors are ∼ 1 km s−1 whereas
the F6 errors are ∼ 25 km s−1 .
In Figure 5, we summarize the properties of stars near
F6 (RF6 < 10 × rh,F6 ) and show their spatial distribution, velocity distribution, metallicity distribution, and

location on color-magnitude diagrams colored by their
membership identified in the model. The F6 members
are tightly clustered within RF6 < 3 × rh,F6 and around
[Fe/H] ∼ −0.7 and v ∼ 50 km s−1 . We have included the
F6 members (pF 6 > 0.5) in the false color grz image centered on F6 in Figure 1. The distribution of Fornax 6
members is similar to the Fornax dSph in the colormagnitude diagram( GBP − GRP , G). There are two
stars within 2 × rh,F 6 considered F6 non-members. The
first is considered a non-member due to its large velocity
offset to F6 (v ∼ 82 km s−1 ) and the second is due to its
metallicity relative to the F6 mean ([F e/H] ∼ −1.2).
The velocity distribution of F6 (Figure 2) is nonGaussian.
The majority of the stars are peaked
at v ∼ 52 km s−1 and there are ∼ 5 stars with
32 . v . 50 km s−1 . All stars with smaller velocity that contain metallicity measurements match
the metallicty of the cluster.
We explore the
two most extreme outliers in more detail.
We
will refer to these two stars as star1 (Gaia EDR3
source id=5062218162109188096, Rf or6 /rh,F6 = 0.4,
v = 36.6 ± 1.1, [Fe/H] = −0.73 ± 0.25) and star2 (Gaia

1.8, v = 41.5 ± 0.7, [Fe/H] = −0.72 ± 0.10). Both are
close to the cluster and have a metallicity that matches
with the cluster but are 2.6σ and 1.5σ outliers in velocity. If we exclude star1 and recompute the kinematics

and if we exclude both we find v = 51.7−0.9 km s ,
−1
σv = 2.7+0.9
. The exclusion of these two stars
−0.6 km s
then changes the kinematics by ∆v ∼ 0.3 − 2.0 km s−1
and ∆σv ∼ 1.7 − 3.0 km s−1 . When star1 is excluded,
it is a 3.2σ outlier (4.4σ when both star1 and star2 are
excluded) from Fornax 6 and sigma-clipping algorithms

typically exclude stars at greater than 2.58 − 3σ. When
both star1 and star2 are excluded, star2 is a 2.9σ outlier, right on the boundary for inclusion/exclusion from
the kinematics. For both stars their spatial position
and metallicity favor their membership in F6 however
their velocities are either inconsistent (star1) or only
marginally consistent (star2). While we did not use the
Tef f or log g in our membership model we have verified that all F6 members, including star1 and star2, are
consistent with being on the red-giant branch.
Due to the non-uniform spatial sampling of the spectroscopy, we explore an additional mixture model. Instead of modeling the entirety of the Fornax dSph member, we limit our modeling to a localized sample of stars
near the Fornax 6 cluster (specifically R < 10 × rh,For6 ).
In this mixture model we consider the spatial distribution of the Fornax members to be approximately constant within this small region.
With this model, we find the properties of F6 to be:
+3.9
+0.08
v = 52.1+0.9
−2.7 , σv = 2.3−2.2 , [Fe/H] = −0.71−0.09 , and
+0.16
σ[Fe/H] = 0.07−0.05 . In this case, the velocity dispersion
is not fully resolved and contains a tail in the posterior
that extends to zero. We find a total membership of
∼ 10.2 in the cluster, with 10 and 4 stars having membership larger than 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. In this
model, both star1 and star2 are considered Fornax dSph
members instead of F6 members. With both models we
find [Fe/H] ∼ −0.7 and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion. The velocity dispersions disagree due
to the membership of the outlier stars. Including or excluding these stars changes the velocity dispersion and
inferred mass-to-light ratio but the not the mean metallicity. If these stars are members it is possible that they
are binary stars and have inflated the velocity disper-

sion. Similar cases of inflated velocity dispersion have
been seen in the Boötes II and Triangulum II ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies (Koch et al. 2009; Ji et al. 2016; Kirby
et al. 2015, 2017). In both cases, small sample sizes
and single epoch data led to inflated results. Unfortunately, we only have one epoch for both star1 and star2.
One of the main differences between the two F6 mixture
models is how the Fornax spatial density is modeled;
this difference results in ∼ 5 − 7 fewer stars considered
members. This change in model/prior is effectively a different manner to account for the spectroscopic selection
function which is difficult to model and characterize.
We estimate the dynamical mass of F6 using the mass
2
estimator: M (< 1.8Rh ) ≈ 3.5 × 1.8Rh σlos
G−1 from
+2.0
Errani et al. (2018). With σv = 5.6−1.6 km s−1 this
+4.2
gives M (< 1.8Rh ) = 5.2−2.6
× 105 M , and dynamical
mass-to-light ratio Υ(1.8Rh ) = M (1.8rh )/LV (1.8Rh ) =
96+78
−48 (LV (1.8Rh ) ≈ 0.76LV,T oT for a Plummer profile). In the cases of removing the outlier stars, we find
Υ(1.8Rh ) ∼ 49 and Υ(1.8Rh ) ∼ 22 when removing star1
and both stars, respectively.
Based on the F6 projected position relative to Fornax
(∆R ∼ 270 pc) and its radial velocity (∆v ∼ 4 km s−1 )
it is clear that F6 is associated with the Fornax dSph.
While the majority of its derived properties (size, luminosity, metallicity, and metallicity spread) are consistent with a globular cluster type system its velocity
dispersion is larger than expected. If F6 is a globular
cluster (i.e., dark matter free), the predicted velocity
dispersion is σv ∼ 0.8 − 1.2 km s−1 for stellar mass-tolight ratio between 1 to 2. This is a factor of ∼ 5 less
than the value we measure in our mixture model. σv
is typical for ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, however, their
mass-to-light ratios tend to be larger, Υ1/2 > 100 (e.g.,
Simon 2019). The other properties of F6 are not characteristic of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. In particular, all
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are much more metal-poor; all
have [Fe/H]. −2 (Simon 2019). This suggests that the
large velocity dispersion and mass-to-light ratio may be
due to Fornax dSph interlopers, tidal disruption, and/or
unresolved binaries. Based on these properties we classify F6 as a globular cluster and it is the sixth globular
cluster of the Fornax dSph. This confirmation increases
the globular cluster specific frequency of Fornax, which
was already large for its luminosity. The globular cluster
specific frequency is defined as SN = NGC ×100.4(MV +15)
(Harris & van den Bergh 1981). We find SN = 24.8 for
Fornax (without F6 it is SN = 20.7).

Figure 6. Velocity dispersion and metallicity dispersion
distribution of the 1000 permutation tests. Each test has
12 random Fornax members with metallicity measurements
and 3 additional members only with velocity measurements,
mirroring the F6 sample. Kinematic and metallicity properties similar to a globular cluster (i.e., F6) are highly unlikely
to arise from a chance alignment.

we performed a number of data permutation tests. We
concentrate on whether we can match the low velocity
and metallicity dispersions of F6 which are properties
that are characteristic of globular clusters. For these
tests we randomly drew, without replacement, a subset
of stars from the Fornax dSph sample (excluding all stars
within 10 × rh,F 6 of F6) and computed the kinematics
and metallicity of this subset. To match the properties
of the F6 sample, we selected 12 stars with metallicity measurements (we additionally excluded stars with
[Fe/H] > 0.5 to match the quality of the Fornax 6
members) and then 3 stars without metallicity measurements. We additionally limited the Fornax sample to the
central pointings. We then computed the kinematic and
metallicity properties of this subset and repeated this
1000 times.
In Figure 6, we examine the velocity dispersion and
metallicity dispersion distributions from the permutations results and compare them to the best fit F6 properties (orange point). While there are a number of samples that are consistent within 1-sigma of the metallicity
dispersion (9.1%) or velocity dispersion (1%) of F6, only
1 permutation (0.1%) is consistent with both a low velocity and metallicity dispersion similar to F6. In summary, in the Fornax dSph, it is extremely unlikely to
find by chance a clustering of stars with properties similar to F6. In addition, the F6 members are spatially
concentrated (R . 10 ) in contrast to the permutation

A related question is how likely is it to find a Fornax star with F6-like velocity and metallicity properties

Magellan/M2FS Spectroscopy of Fornax 6
near F6. The probability to find a F6-like star drawn
from a Fornax dSph-like distribution is 2-4%. A F6-like
star is defined as −0.79 < [Fe/H] < −0.63 and either
46.8 < vlos < 54.2 km s−1 or 43.2 < vlos < 57.8 km s−1
where the difference in percentage accounts for the potential non-zero velocity dispersion. In the current sample there are 5 Fornax members within 3 half-light radii
of F6. If the outlier stars (star1 and star2) are considered Fornax stars and not F6 stars this would increase
to 7. If 5 stars are drawn from a Fornax-like distribution
the probability that no stars have F6-like properties is
82-90% and for 7 stars the probability is 76-86%. It is
unlikely to have a Fornax star that has the F6-like properties located near the cluster but it is not excluded. As
there are two outlier F6 stars it is possible that this has
occurred.
3.4. Tidal Disruption of Fornax 6
Depending on the line-of-sight distance to the F6 cluster relative to the Fornax dSph, there may be strong
tidal forces on the cluster. One potential signature of
tidal disruption is the presence of a velocity gradient.
The disrupting MW satellite Tucana III contains a large
velocity gradient (∼ 8 km s−1 deg−1 ) along its short tidal
tails (Li et al. 2018). To search for a velocity gradient we
modify the mean parameter of the velocity component
of the likelihood: v → v + vg χ(θg ). Here, vg is the velocity gradient magnitude and χ(θg ) is the distance along
the velocity gradient axis which is rotated by an angle
θg . This adds two additional velocity parameters (vg ,
θg ). We apply this model to stars identified as F6 members and weight each star by its membership probability.
For simplicity we only model the velocity distribution.
We use the MCMC code emcee to sample the posterior
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013).
With the F6 stars identified above we find a gradient that is consistent with zero (vg = 2.7 ±
4.4 km s−1 arcmin−1 ).
If we remove the two outlier stars the significance increases (vg = 2.6 ±
2.7 km s−1 arcmin−1 ) but is still consistent with no gradient. If we use the members identified with the second
−1
F6 mixture model, we find vg = 4.5+2.1
arcmin−1
−2.2 km s
◦
with θg = −36 ± 20 . We do not find any strong evidence for the presence of a velocity gradient. If there
is a velocity gradient a larger spectroscopic sample is
required to identify it.
To estimate the tidal force of Fornax on
F6 we compute the Jacobi radius, rj
=
(MF 6 /MdSph (rF 6 )/3)1/3 rF 6 (Binney & Tremaine 2008).
Assuming an NFW halo for Fornax with a scale radius
of 3 kpc and a scale density of 0.044 M pc−3 , we find
rj ∼ 17 − 29 pc if F6 is a purely stellar system with

11

Υ = 2, and rj ∼ 60 − 100 pc if instead the measured
velocity dispersion is representative of the mass profile
of F6 (Υ ∼ 100). In both cases, the range denotes a
line-of-sight distance between 0-1 kpc and a projected
distance of 270 pc. For a purely stellar F6, the Jacobi
radius is smaller than the size of the system, suggesting
that F6 should be undergoing tidal disruption, which
may explain its larger elongation compared to the other
Fornax GCs. If the larger velocity dispersion is representative of F6, than the cluster should be bound
as the Jacobi radius is larger than the cluster. Any
conclusions drawn about the Jacobi radii and potential
tidal disruption depend on the membership of the two
outlier candidates (star1 and star2). We note that rJ
will be larger if Fornax has a cored profile (Wang et al.
2019a). If the true velocity dispersion is on the low end
or there is some inflation of the velocity dispersion due
to a velocity gradient then F6 could be disrupting but
if the high velocity dispersion is representative then the
cluster members would be bound.
It has been found that in the Fornax system, a large
fraction of the metal-poor stars belong to the 4 metalpoor globular clusters, up to 20-25% (Larsen et al.
2012b). It is therefore interesting to determine the fraction of the metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]> −1) located in F6
compared to the number of metal-rich stars in the Fornax dSph. To account for the sampling bias we compare
the stellar mass in F6 to the fraction of stellar mass in
Fornax that is metal-rich. In our M2FS sample, we find
57% of the Fornax stars have [Fe/H]> −1. Using the
MV values in Table 4 and assuming that both F6 and
Fornax have the same stellar M/L, we find that ∼ 0.6%
of the metal-rich stars in the Fornax system are located
within the F6 cluster. This estimation may be biased
if the M2FS metallicity distribution is not representative of the Fornax metallicity distribution due to spatial
sampling. In summary, we find that just ∼ 0.6% of
the metal-rich stars belong to the F6 cluster, which is
a much lower than the fraction of metal-poor stars that
belong to the metal-poor globular clusters.
One possible reason for the difference in globular cluster stellar fraction between F6 and the metal-poor clusters is that more F6 stars have been tidally stripped.
We have examined the spatial distribution of stars with
metallicity similar to F6 (−0.9 < [Fe/H] < −0.5) in
the M2FS sample to search for direct evidence of mass
loss. We see no obvious concentration of metal-rich stars
around the F6 cluster nor tidal tail like features originating from the cluster. The F6-like stars are more centrally concentrated than the bulk of the Fornax sample
but this subset of stars follows the general trend of observing more metal-rich stars in the central regions of

Fornax (i.e., a negative metallicity gradient). If there
are disrupted F6 stars in the bulk of Fornax, a larger
sample of stars with more precise metallicities or light
element abundance measurements are required to identify them. For example, a tidally stripped M54 star has
been identified in the Sagittarius dSph based on its nitrogen and aluminum abundances (Fernández-Trincado
et al. 2021).
3.5. Age
One of the last remaining pieces of the F6 properties
is the age of the system. In Figure 7, we compare the
colors and magnitudes of F6 members in GBP − GRP
vs G to several theoretical isochrones from the MESA
Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST; Dotter 2016; Choi
et al. 2016). All isochrones are fixed to [Fe/H]=-0.7, the
best-fit metallicity measured from the F6 members, and
we vary the age of the isochrone (1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 Gyr).
For comparison, nearby Fornax dSph stars are included,
though isochrones for their measured metallicities are
not plotted. The isochrone with an age of 2 Gyr provides the best approximate fit for the F6 stars. If we
use G − GRP instead of GBP − GRP we reach a similar
conclusion.
Work on the star formation history of the Fornax dSph
measured with deep HST photometry found a major star
formation episode at old ages (> 10 Gyr), with a second
recent burst at ∼ 4.6 Gyr, and intermittent star formation in recent times ∼ 0.2 − 2 Gyr (Rusakov et al.
2021). The age estimation based on the comparison
to the isochrones matches the more recent intermittent
star formation. In addition, the photometric metallicity from the star formation histories of Rusakov et al.
(2021) roughly matches [F e/H] ∼ −0.7 at 2 Gyr. The

Fornax dSph star formation episode at ∼ 2 Gyr may
have triggered the conditions necessary to form the F6
cluster. The most recent pericenter of Fornax based on
Gaia DR2 proper motions is tp = 1.7+1.7
−0.3 Gyr which
corresponds to the most recent star formation (Rusakov
et al. 2021). The previous pericenter time corresponds
roughly to the 4 − 6 Gyr burst.
There is evidence of past mergers in the kinematics
and chemistry of the Fornax stars. For example, the
red-giant branch split is split into 2-3 chemo-dynamic
populations (Battaglia et al. 2006; Walker & Peñarrubia
2011; Amorisco & Evans 2012). These three groups have
[Fe/H] ∼ −1.8, −1, −0.65. which may correspond to the
inital old star formation episode (> 10 Gyr), the second
burst (∼ 4.6 Gyr), and the most recent burst (∼ 0.2 − 2
Gyr) (Rusakov et al. 2021). Amorisco & Evans (2012)
found that the intermediate population and the metalrich population have a misalignment between their angular momentum vectors suggesting that Fornax is a
merger of a bound pair. del Pino et al. (2017) find rotating sub-populations in the Fornax chemo-dynamics
and a change in direction for stars of ∼ 8 Gyr suggests
that a dwarf galaxy merger occurred around this time.
Similar evidence is found by the misalignment between
the youngest stars in Fornax and the old stellar population (Wang et al. 2019b).
The history of the Fornax dSph is complex, with multiple episodes of star formation, some evidence of mergers, and pericenter passages that may correspond to the
formation time of F6. While we have provided a simple
estimate of the age, future more accurate age measurements are required to conclusively identify any of these
events with F6.
3.6. Comparison to Other Globular Clusters
The main peculiarity of F6 compared to other Fornax
GCs is that it is much more metal-rich than the other
five Fornax clusters. In Figure 8, we compare the luminosity, metallicity, and half-light radius of F6 to other
GCs in the Local Group. This includes: the other five
Fornax GCs (Mackey & Gilmore 2003; Letarte et al.
2006; Larsen et al. 2012a), the Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph3
3

The Sgr dwarf is undergoing strong tidal disruption from the
MW and has prominent tidal tails (e.g., Majewski et al. 2003;
Ramos et al. 2020). There are four Sgr GCs associated with the
core of the galaxy (Arp 2, NGC 6715, Terzan 7, Terzan 8) (Da
Costa & Armandroff 1995) and four associated with the tidal tails
(NGC 2419, NGC 5824, Palomar 12, and Whiting 1) (e.g., Law &
Majewski 2010; Massari et al. 2019; Kruijssen et al. 2020). There
are other GCs suggested to be members of Sgr system associated
with the tidal tails but the membership of these GCs is more
tentative (NGC 4147, Pal 2, NGC 6284) (e.g., Law & Majewski
2010; Bellazzini et al. 2020).

(Arp 2, NGC 2419, NGC 5824, NGC 6715, Palomar 12,

1996, 2010 edition), and other dwarf galaxy hosts (WLM
(Hodge et al. 1999; Stephens et al. 2006), Eridanus II
(Simon et al. 2021), And I (Caldwell et al. 2017), And

2019), Pegasus dIrr (Cole et al. 2017; Leaman et al.
2020), and NGC 6822 (Hwang et al. 2011, 2014)). Compared to other GCs, F6 is its large size for GCs at a

similar metallicity. Almost all GCs with [Fe/H]> −1.25
have smaller sizes (rh < 5 pc). The GC in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Eridanus II is analogous in size and
luminosity as F6 but the Eri II GC metallicity is more
metal-poor ([Fe/H] ≈ −2; Zoutendijk et al. 2020; Simon et al. 2021). The closest direct analog to F6 is
the Palomar 12 GC, which is a Sgr GC located in the
trailing arm of the Sgr stream. The Sgr dSph has three
more metal-rich clusters, Palomar 12, Whiting 1, and
Terzan 7, similar to F6. Excluding the Sgr GCs, the
other dwarf galaxy GCs are generally more metal-poor
than the MW distribution in contrast to F6.
In Figure 9, we show the age-metallicity distribution of
globular clusters in the Fornax dSph, Sagittarius dSph,
and MW (age measurements are from de Boer & Fraser
2016; Kruijssen et al. 2019). The F6 globular cluster
lacks an age measurement and we instead displays its
metallicity as a horizontal line. The MW GCs form two
tracks, an old- metal-rich clump (in-situ) (upper right)
and an accretted track where the GCs are correlated in
their age and metallicity. If we assume F6 follows the
same age-metallicity accretted relation as the MW, we
predict it to be ∼ 6 − 10 Gyr. In particular, Palomar 12
has an age∼ 9.1 Gyr. We note that all three metalrich Sgr GCs have ages 9.1 Gyr or younger. This age
range overlaps with the infall time of the Fornax dSph,
tinfall = 10.7+0.8
−3.1 (Fillingham et al. 2019), suggesting
that there could be a relation between the formation of
F6 and the infall of the dSph. This formation time is
older than what we estimated based on the Gaia colormagnitude diagram and more precise photometry is required to accurately measure age and determine when
in the evolutionary history of Fornax the F6 cluster was
formed.
4. CONCLUSION

14

A.B. Pace et al.

We present Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy of the Fornax dSph and the Fornax 6 (F6) globular cluster. We
measure 980 new radial velocities and metallicities of
stars which we combined with previous MMFS spectroscopy (Walker et al. 2009a) and Gaia EDR3 astrometry. With this spectroscopic sample we are able to identify members of the F6 cluster and Fornax dSph. Our
main findings are as follows:
• We identify 2989 members of the Fornax dSph
and measure a velocity dispersion of 12.1 km s−1 ,
a mean metallicity of −1.22, a metallicity dispersion of 0.48 and a metallicity gradient of
−0.28 dex R−1
h . With an efficient Gaia DR2 target selection, a number of these stars (165) are at
large radii (R/rh > 2). This is one of the largest
Fornax samples and will be useful for future kinematic analyses.
• We identify 15-17 members of the F6 cluster and
confirm that F6 is distinct in velocity and metallicity from Fornax dSph stars (see Figure 5).
−1
We measure v F6 = 50.5+1.7
and σv,F6 =
−1.7 km s
+2.0
−1
5.6−1.6 km s . The small offset in radial velocity
between F6 and the Fornax dSph combined with
its spatial location confirms that the F6 is associated with the Fornax dSph. There are two velocity
outlier stars that may be inflating σv,F6 . If they
are excluded from the Fornax 6 sample, the velocity dispersion is consistent with zero. We measure
+0.05
[Fe/H]F6 = −0.71−0.05
and σ[Fe/H],F6 = 0.03+0.06
−0.02
which is more metal-rich than the bulk of the Fornax dSph stars and the other five Fornax GCs.
We estimate that 0.6% of the metal-rich stars
are located within the F6 cluster whereas a much
larger percentage of the metal-poor stars in the
Fornax system are located within the other GCs
(20-25% are located within F1,F2,F3,F5; Larsen
et al. 2012b). Excluding the velocity dispersion,
the metallicity, size (rh,F 6 ∼ 11.3 pc), and luminosity (MV ∼ −4.8) of F6 suggest that it is a GC.
• We have compared F6 to other GCs in the MW
and other dwarf galaxy systems (see Figure 8).
When compared to other metal-rich GCs, F6 has
the largest physical size. However, its size and
luminosity is similar to other metal-poor GCs in
the MW and dwarf galaxy GCs. F6 has properties similar to the metal-rich GCs of Sagittarius.
In particular, Palomar 12 is an excellent analog
based on [Fe/H], Rh , and MV .
• Given the metal-rich nature of the F6 cluster
([Fe/H]∼ −0.7), it is almost certainly younger

than the other Fornax GCs (age< 10 Gyr) which
places the formation after infall into the MW
(tif ∼ 10.7 Gyr; Fillingham et al. 2019). From
Gaia photometry and MIST isochrones we estimated an age of 2 Gyr. Fornax has an extended star formation history (Rusakov et al.
2021) and potential dwarf galaxy mergers (Amorisco & Evans 2012; del Pino et al. 2017). There
are star bursts at ∼ 2, 4 Gyr that correspond to
the two most recent pericenter passages (Rusakov
et al. 2021; Fritz et al. 2018). Any of these events
could have triggered the necessary conditions for
the formation of the F6 cluster. More precise photometry is required to improve the measurement
of the age and identify the origin of the cluster.
The survival of the Fornax globular cluster system is
arguably at odds with dynamical fictions arguments and
has been used as evidence for a cored dark matter halo
of the Fornax dSph. Future analysis of this problem
should include F6, as the inner clusters (F3,F4,F6) are
the most impacted by different dark matter halos. While
the systemic proper motion of F6 relative to Fornax is
currently not well constrained, in future Gaia data releases the proper motions will be more informative and
assist with addressing the 'Fornax timing problem.'
