ABSTRACT
We present a new ground-based optical transmission spectrum of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-103b
(Teq = 2484 K). Our transmission spectrum is the result of combining five new transits from the
ACCESS survey and two new transits from the LRG-BEASTS survey with a reanalysis of three archival
Gemini/GMOS transits and one VLT/FORS2 transit. Our combined 11-transit transmission spectrum
covers a wavelength range of 3900–9450 Å with a median uncertainty in the transit depth of 148 partsper-million, which is less than one atmospheric scale height of the planet. In our retrieval analysis
of WASP-103b's combined optical and infrared transmission spectrum, we find strong evidence for
unocculted bright regions (4.3σ) and weak evidence for H2 O (1.9σ), HCN (1.7σ), and TiO (2.1σ),
which could be responsible for WASP-103b's observed temperature inversion. Our optical transmission
spectrum shows significant structure that is in excellent agreement with the extensively studied ultrahot
Jupiter WASP-121b, for which the presence of VO has been inferred. For WASP-103b, we find that
VO can only provide a reasonable fit to the data if its abundance is implausibly high and we do not
account for stellar activity. Our results highlight the precision that can be achieved by ground-based
observations and the impacts that stellar activity from F-type stars can have on the interpretation of
exoplanet transmission spectra.

1. INTRODUCTION

Ultrahot Jupiters (Teq & 2000 K) are becoming increasingly targeted for studies of their atmospheres (e.g.,
Haynes et al. 2015; Evans et al. 2016, 2017, 2018; Nugroho et al. 2017; Sheppard et al. 2017; Arcangeli et al.
2018; Hoeijmakers et al. 2018; Lothringer et al. 2018;
Lothringer & Barman 2019; Hoeijmakers et al. 2019; Fu
et al. 2020; Gibson et al. 2020; Changeat & Edwards
2021). In part this is due to their high temperatures
leading to large atmospheric scale heights and relatively
cloud-free atmospheres, as condensation is suppressed.
This latter point makes hotter planets particularly favorable for atmospheric studies, as the majority of studied
exoplanets show muted features due to clouds and hazes
(e.g., Sing et al. 2016; Wakeford et al. 2019). However,
the amplitudes of water features decrease as equilibrium
temperatures rise above 2500 K due to the thermal dissociation of water and impact of H− opacity (e.g., Arcangeli et al. 2018; Lothringer et al. 2018; Parmentier
et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2020).
Recently, several ultrahot Jupiters have revealed a
plethora of atomic absorption in high-resolution transmission spectra (e.g., Hoeijmakers et al. 2018, 2019,
2020; Sing et al. 2019; Yan et al. 2019; Cabot et al.
2020; Ehrenreich et al. 2020; Gibson et al. 2020; Nugroho et al. 2020; Borsa et al. 2021; Yan et al. 2021).
These planets also show the strongest evidence for temperature inversions among exoplanet atmospheres, such
as in WASP-121b (Evans et al. 2017; Mikal-Evans et al.
2020), WASP-33b (Haynes et al. 2015; Nugroho et al.
2017), WASP-18b (Sheppard et al. 2017; Arcangeli et al.
2018), WASP-76b (Fu et al. 2020), and WASP-103b
(Kreidberg et al. 2018). However, of these exoplanets
only WASP-121b, WASP-33b, and WASP-76b show evidence for TiO or VO (albeit in some cases this evidence
is disputed, e.g., Merritt et al. 2020; Borsa et al. 2021),
which have long been predicted to be responsible for hot
Jupiter temperature inversions (e.g., Hubeny et al. 2003;
Fortney et al. 2008; Spiegel et al. 2009).
In this paper we present a new optical transmission
spectrum of WASP-103b that reveals tentative evidence
(2.1σ) for TiO in its atmosphere, which may be responsible for the planet's observed temperature inversion (Kreidberg et al. 2018).

1.1. WASP-103b

NSF Fellow

WASP-103b, discovered by Gillon et al. (2014), is
an ultrahot Jupiter (M = 1.51 ± 0.11 MJ , R =
1.623+0.051
−0.053 RJ , Teq = 2484 ± 67 K; Delrez et al. 2018).
Its high equilibrium temperature owes to the fact that it
orbits its F8V host star in 0.93 days (Gillon et al. 2014;
Delrez et al. 2018). Because of its very high temperature, WASP-103b has a large scale height of 600 km,
which contributes 152 ppm to the transit depth (assuming the parameters from Delrez et al. 2018 and a mean
molecular weight of 2.3 amu).
WASP-103b has been the target of atmospheric studies on several previous occasions. Southworth et al.
(2015) presented a transmission photometry study of the
planet using transits acquired in seven different photometric bands, from g 0 to z 0 . They found a steep slope
(gradient, α(λ) = 19.0 ± 1.5) in their transmission spectrum rising towards their bluest wavelength bins and
extending over ∼10 atmospheric scale heights. Southworth et al. (2015) concluded unocculted starspots were
unlikely to cause the observed slope due to the lack of the
host star's photometric variability (Gillon et al. 2014)
and the temperature of the host (Teff = 6110 K), which
they suggested was too hot for significant spot-induced
activity.
Southworth & Evans (2016) subsequently revisited
the earlier transmission spectrum of Southworth et al.
(2015) after new high-resolution photometry revealed
the presence of a blended background star (Wöllert &
Brandner 2015; Ngo et al. 2016). While correcting for
this third light source did reduce the gradient of the
slope in their data to α(λ) = 11.2 ± 0.9, it remained significantly steeper than expected for Rayleigh scattering
(α(λ) = 4).
Turner et al. (2017) extended the observations of
WASP-103b to the near-UV with ground-based observations of the planet in the U band. The transit depth
they derived was consistent with the bluest bin of Southworth & Evans (2016), indicating that the optical slope
may not continue to rise into the near-UV.
The presence of a slope in the optical transmission
spectrum of WASP-103b was challenged by Lendl et al.
(2017), who presented results using the multi-object
spectrograph GMOS on the Gemini-North telescope.
They found no signs of the strong slope reported by
Southworth et al. (2015) and instead found the atmosphere to be cloud-free with absorption from sodium and
potassium.
Following these studies in transmission, Cartier et al.
(2017) presented HST/WFC3 secondary eclipse observations of WASP-103b. Their near-IR emission spectrum was featureless to a precision of 175 ppm, finding

An ACCESS & LRG-BEASTS transmission spectrum of WASP-103b
the planet's atmosphere to be approximately isothermal
over the wavelength range probed (1.1–1.7 μm). However, they also noted that a thermally inverted atmosphere and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with
C/O > 1 were consistent with their data.
Delrez et al. (2018) presented 16 new ground-based
secondary eclipses of WASP-103b in the z 0 and KS
bands, and combined these with the HST/WFC3 results of Cartier et al. (2017). They found the z 0 and
HST/WFC3 observations to be best fitted with a vertically isothermal atmosphere. However, they detected
an anomalously deep eclipse in the KS band, which suggested the presence of a thermal inversion, but they
noted that the KS band is not expected to contain
strong spectral features and so could not explain this
feature. They additionally reanalyzed the transit data
from Southworth et al. (2015), finding consistent results,
indicating that the slope seen by Southworth & Evans
(2016) is inherent to the data and not dependent on the
data reduction method.
Kreidberg et al. (2018) presented phase curve measurements of WASP-103b observed with HST/WFC3
and Spitzer/IRAC. They found the phase curves to show
large amplitudes and negligible hot spot offsets, indicating poor circulation of heat from the day side to the
nightside of the planet. In the WFC3/IR/G141 bandpass (1.1–1.7 μm), Kreidberg et al. (2018) found the
phase-resolved spectra to be consistent with blackbodies with brightness temperatures ranging from 1880 K on
the nightside to 2930 K on the day side. However, they
observed a significantly higher brightness temperature
in the Spitzer 4.5 μm band that is likely due to CO in
emission, indicating a thermal inversion in the planet's
atmosphere. As a result, Kreidberg et al. (2018) speculated that either TiO, VO, or FeH may be present in the
planet's upper atmosphere. By running atmospheric retrievals on their infrared data, they found WASP-103b
to have a 23+29
−13 × solar metallicity atmosphere but did
not detect water, which they attributed to its dissociation.
Most recently, Wilson et al. (2020) presented new
VLT/FORS2 data of WASP-103b covering the wavelength region of 4000–6000 Å. By running retrievals on
the combined VLT, Gemini, and HST transmission spectrum, they found the optical transmission spectrum to
be featureless, with evidence for Na at 2σ, but they did
detect H2 O at 4σ confidence.
Given the contrasting results regarding WASP-103b's
optical transmission spectrum and the potential for a
previously undetected species at optical wavelengths
giving rise to the planet's temperature inversion, we
present here a new optical transmission spectrum of

3

WASP-103b. Our new transmission spectrum combines five transits from the ACCESS survey on Magellan/Baade (Jordán et al. 2013; Rackham et al. 2017;
Bixel et al. 2019; Espinoza et al. 2019; McGruder et al.
2020; Weaver et al. 2020, 2021) and two transits from
the LRG-BEASTS survey on the William Herschel Telescope (Kirk et al. 2017, 2018, 2019; Louden et al. 2017;
Alderson et al. 2020). We combine these new transit
observations with a re-analysis of the published Gemini/GMOS data (Lendl et al. 2017) and VLT/FORS2
data (Wilson et al. 2020), and include these with
the published HST/WFC3/IR/G141 and Spitzer/IRAC
transmission spectrum of Kreidberg et al. (2018) for our
retrieval analyses.
This paper is organized as follows. We describe the
observations in Section 2, the data reduction in Section 3, our light curve fitting procedures in Section 4,
and our corrections for third-light and night-side contamination in Section 5. We present the transmission
spectrum of WASP-103b in Section 6 and interpret it
using the petitRADTRANS and POSEIDON retrieval
frameworks in Section 7 and Section 8, respectively. We
discuss our results in Section 9 and, finally, summarize
our conclusions in Section 10.
2. OBSERVATIONS

2.1. ACCESS
We observed five transits of WASP-103b in the 2015–
2017 observing seasons with the Inamori-Magellan Areal
Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) (Dressler et al.
2011) on the 6.5-m Magellan Baade Telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory. Our observation design largely
mirrored that of previous ACCESS observations (Jordán
et al. 2013; Rackham et al. 2017; Bixel et al. 2019; Espinoza et al. 2019; McGruder et al. 2020; Weaver et al.
2020, 2021). For each observation, we used the f /2 camera of IMACS in multi-object spectroscopy mode with
2×2 binning (0.4 00 pixel−1 ). Conditions were clear for all
observations except the first two nights ('ACCESS n1'
and 'ACCESS n2'), for which passing clouds impacted
the data quality during the 2.6-hr transit for ∼1 hr and
∼0.25 hr, respectively. Further details of these observations are provided in Table 1.
We used a custom multislit mask with large slits (10 00
wide by 21 00 long) for collecting spectra of WASP-103
and six comparison stars simultaneously. After the first
three observations, we redesigned the mask so that each
spectrum would only be dispersed across a single chip.
The second mask includes six comparison stars as well,
four of which are repeated from the first mask (Table 2).
We designed the two science masks for use with the 300
line/mm and 150 line/mm grisms, respectively, though

4

Kirk et al.

the second is also compatible with the 300 line/mm
grism over a narrower wavelength range. For each science mask, we also made a mask with narrow (0.5 00 ) slits
for wavelength calibration. After the first two unfiltered
observations, we began using the WB5600–9200 filter
to block any potential contribution from second-order
light. For our final Magellan/IMACS observation, we
used the GG495 filter for increased sensitivity at bluer
optical wavelengths.
We selected exposure times to provide a maximum
count rate of ∼35,000 analog-to-digital units (ADU) in
order to remain within the linear regime of the IMACS
CCDs (see Section 3.8 of Bixel et al. 2019). We used
the "turbo" readout mode for the first three transits
and opted for the slightly slower and less noisy "fast"
readout mode for latter transits.
For each observation, we collected a series of quartz
lamp flats with the same mask, disperser, and binning
as the science frames. Immediately before or after the
science observations, we also collected a series of exposures of HeArNe lamps through the narrow-slit calibration mask to aid with wavelength calibration.
2.2. LRG-BEASTS
The LRG-BEASTS transits of WASP-103b were observed on the nights of 1 Jun 2016 (referred to as 'LRGBEASTS n1' hereafter) and 26 Jun 2016 (referred to
'LRG-BEASTS n2'). Both transits were observed with
the low-resolution (R ≈ 300) grism spectrograph ACAM
(Benn et al. 2008) on the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in La Palma. This is the same instrument
as has been used in the previous five LRG-BEASTS
studies (Kirk et al. 2017, 2018, 2019; Louden et al. 2017;
Alderson et al. 2020).
Unlike IMACS, ACAM is a long-slit spectrograph. For
both of the LRG-BEASTS nights, we used the wide
7.6 0 × 40 00 slit, allowing us to simultaneously observe the
spectrum of WASP-103 and a comparison star through
the same slit. While a wide slit is useful to avoid differential slit losses between the target and the comparison,
it does mean that other stars can fall within the slit
and whose light can contaminate both the target and
comparison1 . We therefore had to balance our desire to
have a comparison star with a similar magnitude and
color to the target while avoiding both possible contaminating stars and the edges of the detector. For our
LRG-BEASTS observations of WASP-103, we selected
the bright HD 149891 as our comparison star, which has
1

Wöllert & Brandner (2015) and Ngo et al. (2016) is unavoidable
at the spatial resolution of the spectrographs used here.

a V magnitude of 8.7 and B −V color of 1.1. By comparison, WASP-103 has a V magnitude of 12.1 and B − V
color of 0.6.
Given the brightness of the comparison, we had to use
short, 9 second exposures to avoid saturation. In order
to reduce the overhead, we used a fast readout mode
and we windowed the CCD into two windows ([530:800,
1100:3100] for the target and [1302:1572, 1100:3100] for
the comparison), which reduced the overhead to 5 s.
On the first night, we acquired 1400 spectra of the
target with an airmass varying between 1.40 → 1.08 →
1.43. The moon did not rise during our observations on
this night. On the second night we took 1068 spectra of
the target with an airmass varying between 1.09 → 1.08
→ 1.70, with a moon illumination of 58% at a distance
of 108◦ from the target. Biases, tungsten lamp flats, sky
flats, and CuAr plus CuNe arc spectra were taken at the
start and end of both nights.
2.3. Gemini/GMOS and VLT/FORS2 transits
Three transits of WASP-103b were observed with the
Gemini North GMOS multi-object spectrograph on 27
Jun 2015 ('GMOS n1'), 10 Jul 2015 ('GMOS n2'), and 3
May 2016 ('GMOS n3'). A single transit of WASP-103b
was observed using VLT/FORS2 on 1 May 2017. This
was the same transit as observed by ACCESS ('n5'). For
all GMOS and FORS2 transits, two comparison stars
were observed in addition to WASP-103. We refer the
reader to Lendl et al. (2017) and Wilson et al. (2020)
for a description of these observations.
3. DATA REDUCTION

3.1. ACCESS
We reduced the Magellan/IMACS data using our custom Python-based pipeline described previously (Jordán
et al. 2013; Rackham et al. 2017; Bixel et al. 2019;
Espinoza et al. 2019; McGruder et al. 2020; Weaver
et al. 2020, 2021). The pipeline performs standard
procedures for multi-object spectroscopy, including bias
and flat calibration, bad-pixel and cosmic-ray correction, sky subtraction, spectral tracing and extraction,
and wavelength calibration. It outputs for each observation sets of wavelength-calibrated 1D spectra for the
target and comparison stars and arrays of state parameters useful for detrending systematics. These include
time, airmass, x and y detector positions of the spectra,
sky background level, and the full-width half-maximum
(FWHM) of the spectra. As with previous ACCESS
studies (Rackham et al. 2017; Bixel et al. 2019; Espinoza
et al. 2019; McGruder et al. 2020; Weaver et al. 2020,
2021), we found that flat fielding introduced additional
noise into our high-SNR science images, and so we ul-

timately chose not to apply a flat-field correction. To
extract the 1D spectra, the ACCESS pipeline uses standard aperture photometry. For all nights, we used a
15-pixel-wide aperture, corresponding to 6 00 , which we
selected to limit the impact of seeing variations while
also leaving adequate space in the spatial direction for
estimating the sky background.
The extracted, wavelength-calibrated mean-averaged
spectra for each ACCESS observation of WASP-103 are
shown in Figure 1.
3.2. LRG-BEASTS
To reduce the LRG-BEASTS long-slit data, we used
the same custom-made Python scripts as used in Kirk
et al. (2017, 2018, 2019) and Alderson et al. (2020), and
we refer the reader to those papers for a more in depth
description of the process.
In brief, the pipeline performs bias removal, tracing
of the target and comparison spectra, standard aperture photometry using a linear polynomial interpolated
across the stellar spectra (in the spatial direction) to
estimate the sky background, cosmic-ray removal, and
wavelength calibration.
Master biases were created for each night and subtracted from the science data before extraction. For the
first night 257 bias frames were median-combined to cre-

flat-field correction. In a test-run on LRG-BEASTS n1,
we found that the use of a flat-field led to an identical
transmission spectrum but with uncertainties ∼ 10 %
larger than without the use of the flat-field.
We experimented with our choice of aperture width to
extract the stellar spectra, finding an aperture width of
26 pixels to be optimal for night 1 and 40 pixels for night
2 (owing to the poorer seeing conditions). The optimal
aperture width was determined as the aperture width
that produced the minimum standard deviation following a fit of an analytic transit light curve with a cubic in
time polynomial to the resulting white light curve. We
note that the plate scale of ACAM is 0.25 00 pixel−1 .
The extracted, wavelength-calibrated LRG-BEASTS
spectra of WASP-103 are shown in Figure 1.

For the Gemini/GMOS and VLT/FORS2 transits, we
used the stellar spectra as reduced by Lendl et al. (2017)
and Wilson et al. (2020). Importantly, we followed the
approach of both Lendl et al. (2017) and Wilson et al.
(2020) in using only one of the two comparison stars
observed in those studies. This was due to the second
comparison star leading to an increase in the noise in
the data.
3.4. Binning scheme and light curve creation
Given the number of different transits used in our
analysis, and the subsequently different wavelength coverage, we opted for a straightforward binning scheme
comprised of 150 Å-wide wavelength bins from 3900–
9450 Å. The bins and nightly mean-averaged spectra of
WASP-103 from all 11 transits are shown in Figure 1.
We note that we excluded the four bins of the Gemini/GMOS data that included chip gaps.

observed on each of the 11 nights used in our analysis,
grouped by instrument and with an offset applied for clarity. The different spectral shapes are a result of the different
instrument throughputs. The dashed vertical lines indicate
the edges of 37 150-Å-wide bins we used to generate the
spectroscopic transit light curves.

20 Å-wide bins, we additionally constructed separate
20 Å-wide bins centered on the sodium doublet and each
of the two absorption lines in the potassium doublet.
Using our 150 Å and 20 Å-wide wavelengths bins, we
then created the spectroscopic light curves by integrating the spectra of the target and comparison stars over
these wavelength ranges. The white light curves were
created by integrating over the full wavelength range
used for each night.
For the LRG-BEASTS, GMOS, and FORS2 data, the
target's light curves were divided by the comparisons'
light curves at this point to correct for telluric absorption. However, the ACCESS light curves were treated
differently due to the principal component analysis used
in the ACCESS fitting routine (Section 4.1).
The white light curves for all 11 transits are shown in
Figure 2.
4. LIGHT CURVE FITTING

Here we describe the different procedures we used
to fit the ACCESS, LRG-BEASTS, and archival light
curves. For both ACCESS and LRG-BEASTS, these
surveys have custom pipelines (GPTransSpec for ACCESS, gppm fit for LRG-BEASTS), written independently in Python, to perform the fitting. We refer the
reader to the previous papers in the ACCESS and LRGBEASTS series for more detail. In Section 6.5, we com-

pare the outputs of the two procedures on an identical
data set and find excellent agreement between the two
approaches.
We note that we treated the system parameters
in two separate ways for all of our light curve fits
with GPTransSpec and gppm fit. Firstly we fixed the
planet's orbital period (P = 0.9255456), scaled semimajor axis (a/R∗ = 2.999) and inclination (i = 87.3) to
the values of Southworth et al. (2015). These were the
system parameters used by Kreidberg et al. (2018) for
their IR transmission spectrum of WASP-103b and our
choice of a consistent set of system parameters allows
for more accurate stitching of multi-epoch transmission
spectra for our later retrieval analysis. We refer to this
set of fits as our 'fixed system parameters' fits. However,
we also ran fits to our light curves with these system parameters as free parameters, which allows us to report
updated system parameters. We refer to this set of fits
as our 'free system parameters' fits.

4.1. Fitting the ACCESS light curves
4.1.1. Model setup
We extracted transmission spectra from the Magellan/IMACS datasets with the procedure introduced by
Espinoza et al. (2019) and detailed further in subsequent
ACCESS studies (Weaver et al. 2020; McGruder et al.
2020). We refer here to this procedure and the code
implementing it as "GPTransSpec".
In short, we model the target light curve in magnitude
space as a linear combination of the transit signal and
'nuisance' signals introduced by instrumental systematics and observing conditions. We model the transit
signal using the analytic expressions of Mandel & Agol
(2002) as implemented in batman (Kreidberg 2015). The
systematics, on the other hand, are modelled as a sum
of two components. The first component is a set of
basis signals obtained by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of comparison stars (see
Jordán et al. 2013; Espinoza et al. 2019, for details), and
thus the raw light curves are modelled directly, not the
differential light curves. The second component comes
from a Gaussian process (GP, e.g., Gibson et al. 2012),
where we use external parameters as regressors. The
motivation for this two-component systematic modelling
is that the PCA signals inform our modelling of common systematics to both the target and the comparison stars (due to, e.g., atmospheric conditions), while
the GP component allows us to incorporate systematics which are particular to our target lightcurve (e.g.,
position-dependent systematics, spectral profile fluctuations, etc.).

dividing by the comparison star and with each offset by -0.015 in flux. The red line shows the best-fitting transit + systematics
models. We note that the ACCESS light curves are shown as WASP-103's light curve divided by the 'best' comparison's light
curve. However, these differential light curves are not used in the ACCESS fits, as explained in Section 4.1, and so do not
include a best fit model. Middle panel: the detrended light curves following the removal of the systematics model. The gray

applied (-0.003) to allow for a zoomed-in view. The right-hand axis lists the RMS in ppm for each transit's residuals, along
with the RMS in 30 minute bins.

The number of basis signals N obtained from our PCA
analysis equals the number of comparison stars by the
very definition of PCA. However, typically only a subset n < N of those basis signals is actually informative
for explaining/reconstructing the comparison (and target) star lightcurves, with basis signals having larger
eigenvalues being the most important for this reconstruction. While in Jordán et al. (2013) the number
of basis signals was decided via cross-validation, in Espinoza et al. (2019) Bayesian model averaging was used
instead, where models using the n = 1, 2, ..., N most important basis signals were fitted to the data, with the
transit lightcurve parameters on each of these fits being
later weighted by their log-evidences to report the final,

"model-averaged" parameters. We use this same technique here in order to account for the uncertainty on the
number n of "optimal" basis signals.
We incorporate the GP in our modelling framework
using the george Python package (Foreman-Mackey
et al. 2017). In each of our fits, we use a multidimensional squared-exponential kernel, using as regressors the airmass, x position of the trace, y position of
the trace, full-width at half maximum (FWHM), sky
background and time as input variables. We assume a
quadratic limb-darkening law for our transit lightcurve.
Rather than fitting directly for the linear and quadratic
coefficients (u1 and u2), GPTransSpec uses the change
of variables introduced in Kipping (2013) (u1 → q1,

8

Kirk et al.

u2 → q2). In this way GPTransSpec treats both limb
darkening coefficients as free parameters with uniform
priors to prevent unphysical values.
In total, for each ACCESS white light curve fit,
GPTranSpec fits for n coefficients, which weigh the PCAretrieved basis signals and 13 free parameters for both
the transit lightcurve and the GP component. The latter parameters are the limb-darkening coefficients (q1
and q2), the six inverse length scales of our squared exponential GP kernels (τ1 ,...,τ6 ), the amplitude of the GP
(a), a white noise term which accounts for an underestimation of the photometric error bars in the light curves
(σ 2 ), time of mid-transit (TC ), the scaled planetary radius (RP /R∗ ) and a normalization factor (f ) to account
for imperfect normalization of the light curves.
We used a wide uniform prior in log space for a between 10−10 and 0.01, and used a gamma prior on
the GP length scales with shape parameter unity, following the approach of, e.g., Gibson et al. (2012) and
Evans et al. (2015). Finally, we also placed a wide uniform prior on σ 2 , bounded by 10−10 and 0.01 in millimagnitudes2 (mmag2 ), which corresponds to 0.01 − 100
mmag bounds on the uncertainty in the photometric error bars. We used wide uniform priors on the transit
parameters to prevent unphysical values.
For the 'free system parameters' white light curve fits
(where we wanted to refine the system parameters but
which are not used in our final transmission spectra), we
additionally fitted for the scaled semi-major axis (a/R∗ )
and the inclination of the planet's orbit (i).
To explore the parameter space, GPTransSpec uses
nested sampling via the PyMultiNest package (Buchner
et al. 2014) with 1000 live points.
4.1.2. Application of the model
Prior to fitting the ACCESS light curves, we inspected
the differential (target/comparison) light curves for each
comparison star for all ACCESS nights. This enabled us
to remove significant outliers from our photometry and
to check whether all the comparison stars had similar
noise characteristics to the target star and thus would
be useful for inclusion in our GPTransSpec fitting. For
all ACCESS nights we ended up using 5 of the 6 available
comparison stars, with the same comparison stars used
for nights that had a common slit mask (Table 1).
We removed any data points from the light curves that
were taken at airmasses greater than 2 and those that
corresponded to cloudy conditions. These were defined
as frames where WASP-103's flux dropped below 80 %
of its nightly maximum. For ACCESS n1, a significant
portion (30 %) of the transit was contaminated by clouds
and clipped before fitting (Figure 2). For ACCESS n2,

10 % of the transit was cloudy. For the remaining three
ACCESS nights, no data points were clipped. We note
that we compared the results of fitting the light curves
with and without this data clipping step and find the
resulting transmission spectra to be consistent, but the
data clipping leads to greater precision.
Following the fits to the ACCESS white light curves,
we used the best-fitting systematics model from each
night to remove the common mode systematics in the
spectroscopic light curves prior to fitting. This reduces
sources of noise that are common among the spectroscopic light curves and provides greater precision in the
resulting transmission spectra. We then fitted the spectroscopic light curves with GPTransSpec but this time
holding the time of mid-transit (TC ) fixed to the nightly
best-fitting value.

4.2. The LRG-BEASTS procedure
4.2.1. Model setup
Like ACCESS's GPTransSpec, LRG-BEASTS's
gppm fit simultaneously fits quadratically limbdarkened transit light curves (Mandel & Agol 2002),
via the batman Python package (Kreidberg 2015), together with a Gaussian process (also using the george
Python package; Ambikasaran et al. 2015) to model
correlated noise in the data.
Unlike GPTransSpec, gppm fit uses Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform the sampling of parameter space, via the emcee Python package (ForemanMackey et al. 2013). It also fits the differential light
curves, unlike GPTransSpec which fits the raw stellar
light curves in its PCA.
While gppm fit also uses quadratic limb darkening,
we instead hold the quadratic limb darkening coefficient
(u2) fixed to a theoretical value calculated by the Limb
Darkening Toolkit (LDTk, Parviainen & Aigrain 2015).
To calculate these values we used the stellar parameters
of Delrez et al. (2018). We then only fitted for the linear
coefficient (u1), for which we used a uniform prior to
prevent unphysical values.
To fit the systematics in the light curves, we used a
combination of squared exponential GP kernels, taking
various ancillary data (airmass, FWHM, etc.) as input
variables. We specify which variables were used for each
night in the following subsections. These kernels each
had a separate length scale (τ ) but shared a common
amplitude, a. We additionally included a white noise
kernel, defined by the variance σ 2 , to account for white
noise not captured by the photometric error bars. We
fitted for the natural logarithm of these values and fitted
for the inverse length scale following previous studies

An ACCESS & LRG-BEASTS transmission spectrum of WASP-103b
(e.g., Gibson et al. 2012, 2017; Evans et al. 2017, 2018;
Kirk et al. 2019; Alderson et al. 2020).
Prior to fitting the data, the input variables were
standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by
the standard deviation, following the procedure of, e.g.,
Evans et al. (2017, 2018); Kirk et al. (2019) and Alderson et al. (2020). This gives each input variable a mean
of zero and standard deviation of unity and helps the
GP determine the inputs of importance for describing
the noise characteristics.
Similar to Gibson et al. (2017) and Alderson et al.
(2020), we placed truncated uniform priors in log space
on the GP hyperparameters. The amplitude, a, was
bounded between 0.01 and 100× the out-of-transit variance and the length scales were bounded between the
minimum spacing and twice the maximum spacing of
data points of the standardized variables. For the white
noise term, we placed wide uniform priors in log space
bounded by 10−8 and 2.5 × 10−7 , which corresponds to
100–5000 ppm bounds on the uncertainty in the photometric error bars.
Prior to fitting the white and spectroscopic light
curves with gppm fit, we fit a transit model multiplied
by a cubic polynomial using a Nelder-Mead algorithm
(Nelder & Mead 1965) to remove > 4σ outliers from our
light curves. This typically clipped at most 1–2 points
per light curve.
To find the starting values for the GP hyperparameters, we optimized the GP model to the out-of-transit
data prior to fitting each light curve. The MCMC chains
were subsequently started with a small scatter around
these values. Following the george documentation2 ,
gppm fit runs two sets of chains for each light curve,
with the second set of chains started with a smaller scatter around the best-fitting values from the first chain.
For all our light curve fits with gppm fit, the number
of walkers equalled 6 × np (where np is the number of
free parameters) for 10000 steps each (split across the
first and second runs as explained above).
4.2.2. Application of the model
Prior to fitting the LRG-BEASTS white and spectroscopic light curves, we binned the data from both nights
to a time resolution of 60 s. This reduced the number
of data points to be fitted for all LRG-BEASTS light
curves from 1400 to 337 for night 1 and from 1068 to
255 for night 2. We did this for computational reasons
as GPs scale as O(n3 ) for n data points.
For LRG-BEASTS night 1 we used five GP kernels,
each taking one of airmass, FWHM, x position of the
2

trace, y position of the trace and sky background as
input variables. Due to the additional noise in LRGBEASTS night 2 (Figure 2), we additionally included
time with a sixth GP kernel for the analysis of these
light curves. In total for the LRG-BEASTS white light
curve fits, there were 10 free parameters (TC , RP /R∗ ,
u1, a, τ1 ,...τ5 , σ 2 ) for night 1 and 11 for night 2 (with
the addition of the time kernel).
Similar to the ACCESS procedure, we then removed
the common noise models from the spectroscopic light
curves prior to fitting. We also again fixed TC to the
best-fitting values from the white light curve fits.
4.3. Fitting the GMOS and FORS2 light curves
To fit the Gemini/GMOS and VLT/FORS2 light
curves, we used the same gppm fit code as we used
to fit the LRG-BEASTS light curves. For the GMOS
data we again used 5 squared exponential GP kernels to
fit the systematics in the data, with each taking one of
airmass, FWHM, position angle, y position of the trace,
and sky background as input variables. For the VLT
data, we followed the approach of Wilson et al. (2020)
in modelling the systematics with a single GP kernel,
taking time as the input variable, combined with a linear in time polynomial. The white light curve fits to the
GMOS and FORS2 data are shown in Figure 2.
As with the ACCESS and LRG-BEASTS transits, we
removed the common noise systematics model from the
spectroscopic light curves prior to fitting. As we show
in Section 6.3, our resulting GMOS and FORS2 transmission spectra are in good agreement with the initial
analyses of Lendl et al. (2017) and Wilson et al. (2020),
giving us confidence in the repeatibility of our results.
4.4. Comparing GPTransSpec with gppm fit
As an additional test of our light curve fitting routines,
we generated a set of ACCESS differential light curves
by dividing each night by the single 'best' comparison
star (as shown in Figure 2). The best comparison star
was chosen as the comparison star that lead to the smallest median absolute deviation in the out-of-transit flux.
We then ran these light curves through the same procedure as described in Section 4.2. The results of this test
are presented in Section 6.5 and show excellent agreement between GPTransSpec and gppm fit.
5. CORRECTING FOR THIRD-LIGHT AND

NIGHTSIDE CONTAMINATION
Due to the presence of the blended contaminant within
the WASP-103 spectra, we had to correct our resulting transmission spectra for this. To perform this correction, we followed a similar process to that used in

Southworth & Evans (2016); Cartier et al. (2017); Lendl
et al. (2017); Turner et al. (2017) and Delrez et al.
(2018). We used PHOENIX (Husser et al. 2013) stellar
models for the target (Teff = 6110 K, log g = 4.22 cgs,
[Fe/H] = 0.06 dex, Delrez et al. 2018) and contaminant
(Teff = 4400 ± 200 K, Cartier et al. 2017), and scaled
these to have the correct J-band magnitudes (Cartier
et al. 2017). We then calculated the ratio of the contaminant's flux to the target's flux for each of our wavelength bins as defined in Section 3.4.
Figure 3 shows the contamination ratios we calculate as compared with those measured by Wöllert &
Brandner (2015); Ngo et al. (2016); Southworth & Evans
(2016); Cartier et al. (2017); Lendl et al. (2017); Delrez
et al. (2018) and Wilson et al. (2020). This figure shows
the good agreement between our calculated flux ratios
and these previous studies. The third-light correction
factors for our wavelength bins are given in Table 4.
To apply these flux corrections to our resulting transmission spectra, we used the following equation (e.g.,
Kreidberg 2018)
dcorr = dobs (1 + Fcont (λ)/FW103 (λ)),

(1)

where dobs are the observed transit depths, Fcont (λ) is
the flux of the contaminant, FW103 is WASP-103's flux
and dcorr are the corrected transit depths.
In addition to correcting for the contamination of the
nearby star, we also considered dilution of the transit depth by the planet's nightside flux given the high
equilibrium temperature of the planet (e.g., Kipping &
Tinetti 2010). While the effect is small in the optical, it

can lead to a significant change in the infrared, as shown
by Kreidberg et al. (2018) for WASP-103b.
Kreidberg et al. (2018) used their Spitzer phase curve
observations to measure the nightside temperature of
WASP-103b, finding it to be 1700 K. We then used a
PHOENIX model for the star and a blackbody at the
nightside temperature to calculate the flux dilution in
each of our wavelength bins from the nightside of the
planet.
The nightside flux corrections were applied to our resulting transmission spectra using the following equation
(e.g., Kipping & Tinetti 2010; Kreidberg 2018)
dcorr =

dobs
,
1 + FN S (λ)/FW103 (λ)

(2)

where FN S (λ) is the flux from the nightside of the
planet. Figure 4 shows our calculated correction factors
(the denominator in Equation 2) along with those used
by Kreidberg et al. (2018). This figure demonstrates
that the effect of the planet's nightside is significantly
larger in the infrared as compared to the optical. In
the wavelength range covered by our optical data, the
maximum correction factor (corresponding to the reddest wavelength bin) leads to a 13 ppm change in the
transit depth. While we have applied this correction to
our final transmission spectra, this correction is only 8 %
of the typical error in the transit depths of our combined
transmission spectrum and thus is negligible.
6. RESULTS

6.1. White light fits

An ACCESS & LRG-BEASTS transmission spectrum of WASP-103b

Table 3 lists the system parameters we derive from
the 'free system parameters' fits to our 11 white light
curves. We note again that these results were not the
ones used for our final transmission spectra, where we
instead used the parameters of Southworth et al. (2015),
as used by Kreidberg et al. (2018).
The RP /R∗ values in Table 3 are those after correcting
for the third-light contamination and planetary nightside flux (Section 5). This shows that while there is good
overall agreement, there is scatter in each of these parameters. We plot the RP /R∗ derived from each of our
transits from both the 'fixed' and 'free' system parameters fits, along with the values of Southworth & Evans
(2016), Lendl et al. (2017), Delrez et al. (2018) and Wilson et al. (2020) in Figure 5. This demonstrates that
while there is some variation in RP /R∗ , each of our 11
transits are within 1–2σ of the weighted mean. We note
that ACCESS n5 and VLT/FORS2 are observations of
the same transit epoch.
6.3. Transmission spectrum
In Figure 6, we show the transmission spectra resulting from all 11 of our ground-based transits, following the correction for the third-light contamination and
planetary nightside flux. The nightly transmission spectra in the top panels of Figure 6 have had offsets applied
to ensure they have the same nightly mean RP /R∗ as
the weighted mean RP /R∗ from all 11 nights, as discussed in Section 6.2. The nightly transmission spectra
for all instruments are given in Tables 6 and 7 in the
Appendix.
Figure 6 shows there is good overall agreement between each of the transits' transmission spectra. The
most notable difference comes in the LRG-BEASTS
transmission spectra, where the spectra diverge at blue

The results of our fits to the white light curves are
shown in Figure 2. We note that we also include the
differential ACCESS light curves in Figure 2, which correspond to the target's light curve divided by the best
comparisons' light curve, for ease of comparison with the
other 6 transit light curves. However, we did not actually fit the differential ACCESS light curves but instead
fit the raw stellar light curves as described in Section 4.1.
As the number of transits and wavelength bins resulted in over 322 spectroscopic light curves, we only include example fits to our ACCESS and LRG-BEASTS
data in the Appendix (Figs. 16 and 17). The rest of our
light curve fits can be found online3 .

wavelengths (although they are still consistent within
1σ, other than in the bluest bin).
We also note that the Na signal is much deeper in the
first LRG-BEASTS night. As an additional check, we
performed light curve fits to five 30 Å-wide bins centered
on Na to see whether this was caused by systematics related to the 20 Å bin being too narrow. In this case we
found the central Na bin to remain deep but a neighbouring bin to be anomalously shallow, giving us reason
to question the authenticity of the deep LRG-BEASTS
n1 bin. This behaviour did not occur for any of the 11
other transits we analysed. We are unsure of the causes
of this deep Na bin, however we tried different treatment
of the stellar limb darkening (fixed vs. free coefficients),
GP inputs and GP kernels (Matérn 3/2 vs. Squared Exponential), and the use of a flat field, and found these
made no difference to the depth of the bin.
Notably, however, our final 11 transit-combined transmission spectrum changes by 1σ regardless of whether
the second LRG-BEASTS night or the LRG-BEASTS
Na result is included. This is the advantage of combining 11 data sets. As a result, we do not exclude the
LRG-BEASTS data from our final transmission spectrum.

In Figure 6, we also plot the Gemini/GMOS and
VLT/FORS2 transmission spectra as derived by Lendl
et al. (2017) and Wilson et al. (2020). This shows the
good agreement between our re-analysis of these data
sets and the previously published analyses. We believe that the small differences between our analysis of
the Gemini/GMOS data as compared to the analysis of
Lendl et al. (2017) could be due to the different system
parameters used and different systematics modelling approaches used.
In Figure 7, we show the weighted-mean transmission
spectra for each instrument and the 11-transit weightedmean combination. In this figure, all the spectra have
been corrected for the third-light contamination as described in Section 5.
Figure 7 shows an excellent agreement between all four
instruments. This also highlights the precision we have
achieved in our combined transmission spectrum with
a median uncertainty on the transit depth of 148 ppm.
The transmission spectrum shows considerable structure, with an upwards slope from ∼ 4000 to 5200 Å, before dropping towards 5600 Å and rising again towards
6200 Å. There is also a bump in the spectrum at around
7000 Å and a deeper transit centered on the Na doublet at 5893 Å, which we discuss in more detail in the
following subsection.
6.4. Significance of the Na bin
In order to estimate the significance of the sodium
detection in our combined transmission spectrum (Figure 7), we fitted a straight line across the neighbouring

bins between 5625 and 6075 Å where the continuum is
rising. This is the same process used to estimate the
significance of sodium as used in, e.g., Nikolov et al.
(2016); Carter et al. (2020) and Alderson et al. (2020).
Comparing the difference between our Na bin and the
fitted continuum, we find the Na bin is higher at 3.1σ
confidence.
At face value this appears significant. However, when
we exclude the LRG-BEASTS Na bin from our combined transmission spectrum, which we believe could be
affected by systematics (Figure 6), the significance of
Na by this method drops to 2.8σ. While the inclusion
of the LRG-BEASTS Na bin changes the transmission
spectrum by < 1σ, owing to the fact we are combining
11 data sets, we favour our conservative 2.8σ evidence
for Na, considering to the possible systematics affecting
the LRG-BEASTS Na bin. Wilson et al. (2020) detect
Na at 2.0σ confidence while Lendl et al. (2017) find signs
of strong Na absorption. Based on our analysis, we cannot claim a significant detection of Na in WASP-103b's
atmosphere.
6.5. Comparing the ACCESS & LRG-BEASTS fitting
pipelines
As an additional check of our results, we also fitted
the ACCESS light curves with the LRG-BEASTS fitting code (gppm fit, Section 4.2). Figure 8 shows the
comparison between our final transmission spectra from
both methods, prior to applying the third-light correction. This shows the excellent agreement between the
two fitting routines despite the different approaches to

Figure 6. The individual transmission spectra from all 11 transit observations are shown in the upper panels of all 3 figures.
The lower panels show the weighted mean of the 5 ACCESS transits (upper left figure), 2 LRG-BEASTS transits (upper right
figure), and the 1 FORS2 plus 3 GMOS transits (lower center figure). In the lower figure, we also include the Gemini/GMOS
transmission spectrum as presented in Lendl et al. (2017) and the VLT/FORS2 transmission spectrum as presented in Wilson
et al. (2020).

the stellar limb darkening, systematics models, sampling
algorithm, and the priors on the transit and systematic
models' parameters. Figure 8 demonstrates our results
and conclusions are not dependent on the different fitting methods used.

6.6. Impact of third-light correction
As described in Section 5, we had to correct our transmission spectrum for the flux of the blended contaminant (4400 ± 200 K, Cartier et al. 2017). In Figure 9 we
plot the pre- and post-third-light-corrected transmission
spectra. We additionally include (in dotted lines), the
impact of the contamination assuming the effective temperature of the contaminant ± the 1 and 2σ uncertainties reported by Cartier et al. (2017), which shows that
the uncertainty in the contaminant does not result in a
significant change in the transmission spectrum. This
was also found by Lendl et al. (2017).

Figure 9 demonstrates that while the third-light correction has a significant impact over a broad wavelength
range, changing the transmission spectrum from gently
sloping down towards red wavelengths to sloping upwards, it has a minor impact on the more localised features, such as the dip at ∼5600 Å, the Na bin, and the
bump at ∼7000 Å. We explore the impact this correction
has on our retrievals in Section 8.
7. FORWARD MODELS & RETRIEVALS WITH

PETITRADTRANS
To interpret WASP-103b's transmission spectrum, we
used both forward models and retrieval analyses using two seperate codes, firstly using petitRADTRANS
(Mollière et al. 2019).
Given the significant structure seen in WASP-103b's
transmission spectrum, its hot equilibrium temperature,
and the evidence for a thermal inversion in its atmosphere, we generated forward models using petitRAD-

TRANS that included only TiO, VO, and FeH as optical opacity sources. We assumed a cloud-free isothermal atmosphere at the equilibrium temperature of the
planet (2489 K), and took the planet's surface gravity
and stellar radius from Delrez et al. (2018). For these
exploratory forward models, we assumed atmospheric
mass fractions for TiO, VO, and FeH of 0.1 %. Importantly, as we discuss later, these initial TiO and VO
forward models use the Plez (1998, 1999) line lists as is
the default for petitRADTRANS.
The forward models of TiO and VO are shown in Figure 10 along with a flat line. We do not include the FeH
model, owing to the poor fit to the shape of the spectrum. These exploratory models show that, while none
of these models provide an acceptable χ2 , both TiO and
VO can fit the downturn in the transmission spectrum
we observe in the blue, while only VO is able to replicate
the downturn seen at ∼5600 Å.
In order to test this hypothesis further, we also ran a
retrieval using petitRADTRANS. We used an MCMC,
through emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), to sample

the parameter space with 240 walkers, each with 4200
steps. We fitted for the abundances of CO, H2 O, CH4 ,
NH3 , CO2 , H2 S, Na, K, TiO, VO, and FeH. We also fitted for the surface gravity and reference pressure. Following the petitRADTRANS retrieval example4 , we also
fitted for 6 parameters that defined the temperaturepressure profile, although we note that these were poorly
constrained. The abundances of IR species were also
poorly constrained. However, the retrievals did constrain the volume mixing ratio (VMR) of VO to be
4
−5.65+0.46
−0.64 dex, which is about 10 × the solar abundance (Woitke et al. 2018). The TiO abundance was
unconstrained, instead bumping up against the lower
boundary of the uniform-in-log-space prior (−10 dex).
This agreed with our forward model analysis that the
transmission spectrum is better matched with VO than
TiO, when using the Plez line lists. The retrieved model
using the Plez line lists is also shown in Figure 10.
Motivated by our retrievals run with POSEIDON
(Section 8), we also generated a VO forward model with
petitRADTRANS but using the updated VO line list

model is shown in green in Figure 10. The difference
between the orange and green models in Figure 10 is
just the choice of VO line list, all other parameters were
equal. This demonstrates how the choice of VO line list
used makes a significant difference to the gradient of the
slope in the blue and, to a lesser extent, the shallower
transit depths seen around 5600 Å. However, we note
that the goodness of fit is unaffected by the choice of
line list.
8. RETRIEVALS WITH POSEIDON

We additionally conducted a retrieval analysis of
WASP-103b's transmission spectrum with the POSEIDON atmospheric retrieval code (MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017).
While our petitRADTRANS retrieval (Section 7) focused on our optical transmission spectrum, our POSEIDON analysis further considers the addition of the near-infrared HST /WFC3 and
Spitzer /IRAC observations from Kreidberg et al. (2018).
Our POSEIDON retrievals also include a prescription
for unocculted stellar heterogeneity, which is a potential
source of bias in exoplanet transmission spectra (e.g.,

McCullough et al. 2014; Oshagh et al. 2014; Rackham
et al. 2017, 2018, 2019).
Our POSEIDON retrievals consider a wide range of
atmospheric and stellar properties. We include the following chemical species with both prominent absorption
features over our wavelength range and an expectation of
occurrence in hot giant planet atmospheres (e.g. Sharp
& Burrows 2007; Madhusudhan et al. 2016): Na, K, H−,
TiO, VO, AlO, CrH, FeH, H2 O, CO, CO2 , and HCN. In
our initial exploratory retrievals, we also included opacity from Li, Fe, Fe+, Ti, Ti+, H3 +, SiO, TiH, SiH,
CH4 , NH3 , N2 O, NO2 , and NO but found these to be
unconstrained and so did not include them in our final
analysis.
Besides the line absorption from these species, POSEIDON also includes collision-induced absorption from
H2 -H2 and H2 -He pairs and Rayleigh scattering. We
allow for inhomogenous clouds and hazes following the
prescription in MacDonald & Madhusudhan (2017). We
assume an isothermal temperature profile, given the
quality of the present observations (Rocchetto et al.
2016). Our treatment of unocculted starspots or fac-

(2018). In short, the heterogeneity 'contamination factor' (Rackham et al. 2017) is computed by interpolating stellar models from the Castelli-Kurucz 2004 atlas
(Castelli & Kurucz 2003) using the pysynphot package
(STScI Development Team 2013).
In total, our POSEIDON retrievals have a maximum
of 22 free parameters. The planetary atmosphere is defined by the volume mixing ratios (Xi ) of the 12 chemical
species listed above, the terminator temperature (T ),
a reference radius at 10 bar (Rp, 10 bar ), and the fourparameter cloud and hazes prescription from MacDonald & Madhusudhan (2017). The stellar heterogeneity
contribution is described by the covering fraction of the
active regions on the stellar disc (fhet ) and the temperatures of the active regions (T∗, het ) and stellar photosphere (T∗, phot ), respectively. For retrievals including
the data from Kreidberg et al. (2018), we opted to fit for
a relative offset, δrel , between our optical transmission
spectrum and the IR transmission spectrum (noting that
instrumental offsets in the optical data were taken care
of in Section 6.2). We ascribe uniform-in-the-logarithm
priors on the mixing ratios (10−16 to 10−1 ) and uniform
priors on T (400 to 3000 K), Rp, 10 bar (0.85 − 1.15 Rp ),
fhet (0 to 0.5), T∗, het (0.65 to 1.2 T∗, phot,apriori ), and
δrel (± 1000 ppm). Since the stellar photosphere temperature is well-known a priori, we place an informative
Gaussian prior on T∗, phot (mean: 6110 K; standard deviation: 160 K - Gillon et al. 2014). The cloud and haze
priors are as in MacDonald & Madhusudhan (2017).
We ran POSEIDON on four combinations of our new
optical dataset and the IR transmission spectrum of
Kreidberg et al. (2018): the optical data alone following
the application of the third-light correction ('Ground
Corrected'); the optical data alone prior to the application of the third-light correction ('Ground Uncorrected'); the HST and Spitzer data without the optical data; and the third-light-corrected optical data combined with the HST and Spitzer data. For each dataset,
we conducted Bayesian parameter estimation and model
comparisons via the nested sampling algorithm MultiNest (Feroz & Hobson 2008; Feroz et al. 2009, 2019;
Buchner et al. 2014), with 4,000 live points per retrieval.
We report the results from our retrievals in Table 5.
The main result is that the optical data reveals tentative evidence for TiO (∼ 2σ), while also showing strong
evidence of contamination from unocculted stellar heterogeneities. We discuss these results in more detail in
the following subsections.

8.1. On the optical data alone

17

Our retrieved spectra for both the third-light corrected and uncorrected optical data are shown in Figure 11 (top panels). Prior to the third-light correction
(Section 5), there is a gentle upwards slope towards blue
wavelengths which is best fit by unocculted cool active
regions. Following the third-light correction, the spectral morphology changes into a steep downwards slope
best explained by unocculted hot active regions, which
we interpret as faculae. Quantitatively, the evidence for
stellar activity increases from 1.5 to 4.0σ following the
third-light correction (see Table 5). Clearly the thirdlight correction makes a significant impact on the conclusions about stellar activity.
We additionally infer tentative evidence for atmospheric TiO absorption from our optical data. This TiO
inference persists for both the uncorrected and thirdlight corrected data, changing from 2.3 to 1.7σ following
the third-light correction. The TiO mixing ratio, however, is poorly constrained from the optical data alone.
No other chemical species are favored by our Bayesian
model comparisons with POSEIDON, with 2 σ upper
limits on their mixing ratios reported in Table 5. The
non-detection of Na, despite the 20-Åbin centered on
the Na D-lines being ∼3σ deeper than the surrounding continuum (Section 6.4), is likely due to the lack of
pressure-broadened Na wings in the surrounding data
points (e.g., Nikolov et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2021).
The tentative evidence for TiO from POSEIDON is an
interesting contrast with our earlier petitRADTRANS
retrieval (Section 7), which instead inferred VO without
the need for TiO. To better understand this discrepancy, we ran additional retrievals with both codes varying properties such as the prior ranges on the VMRs
and the top of atmosphere pressure. Ultimately this
made little difference. The most notable difference we
identified is that POSEIDON uses updated ExoMol line
lists for VO and TiO, resulting in considerably different
optical band shapes compared to the petitRADTRANS
VO and TiO cross sections (see Figure 10). However,
as we discuss in Section 9.1, we cannot be certain that
this is the cause the disagreement. Indeed, our 4σ preference for unocculted faculae with POSEIDON (for the
corrected data) automatically considered VO as an alternative explanation via the Bayesian evidence computations. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of
stellar heterogeneity in our POSEIDON retrievals is the
more likely cause of the disagreement.
8.2. On the IR data alone
Our IR-only retrievals on the HST/WFC3 and
Spitzer/IRAC data from Kreidberg et al. (2018) weakly
favor unocculted faculae and H2 O. We find a lower

18

Kirk et al.

detection significance for faculae than that from the
optical-only corrected spectrum (2.4σ vs. 4.0σ). This is
expected, since the influence of unocculted stellar heterogeneities is largest at short wavelengths (e.g., Rackham et al. 2018, 2019). The retrieved heterogeneity parameters from the IR data are consistent with those from
our 'Ground Corrected' retrieval (Table 5), giving us
added confidence in this interpretation. Our inference
of H2 O is marginal at best (1.7σ) and notably less significant than that found by Wilson et al. (2020) (4.0σ).
We believe this discrepancy is due to our consideration
of stellar heterogeneities, which were not included in the
retrieval analyses of Wilson et al. (2020). Finally, we
note that TiO is not inferred from our IR-only retrievals,
though the upper limit on its abundance is consistent
with the 'Ground Corrected' retrieval. In all, these consistent findings between each portion of the transmission spectrum strengthen the conclusions derived from
the combined optical and IR data set.
8.3. On the combined optical and IR data
Our retrieval of the combined optical+IR data, shown
in Figure 11 (bottom panel), identifies strong evidence
of unocculted faculae (4.3σ) and tentative evidence for
TiO (2.1σ), H2 O (1.9σ), and HCN (1.7σ). The inferred
faculae are ∼ 350 K hotter than the stellar photosphere
with a coverage fraction of 22+12
−9 %. The fitted offset
between the optical and IR data is 210+83
−85 ppm, consistent with the 1σ uncertainties in our optical transmission spectrum. Due to the weak evidence for individual
molecules, we also derived the combined significance of
TiO + H2 O + HCN from a Bayesian model comparison
with all three species excluded. We find that the significance of at least one of TiO, H2 O, or HCN, is 2.8σ.
Therefore, we conclude there is moderate evidence for
molecular opacity from WASP-103b alongside the stellar faculae contamination.
We illustrate the contributions of each chemical
species and the unocculted faculae to our best-fitting
POSEIDON model in Figure 12. This figure demonstrates that unocculted faculae still induce a slight
downward slope between the red and blue ends of the
HST/WFC3/IR/G141 bandpass, explaining why our
IR-only retrievals also favor unocculted faculae. Unlike
our retrievals with petitRADTRANS, we see that POSEIDON does not fit the dip in the transmission spectrum around 0.55 μm, which may be due to the ExoMol line lists used (Figure 10) or the inclusion of faculae – we discuss this more in Section 9.1. We note
that the 'minimal' model shown in this figure uses only
those parameters required to fit the combined optical
+ IR data (i.e. without unconstrained chemical species

or cloud parameters). This 9-parameter model achieves
a minimum reduced chi-square of χ2ν = 1.36, which we
consider an excellent fit to our transmission spectrum
of WASP-103b. The full posterior corresponding to this
best-fitting model is shown in Figure 13, with the parameter constraints also given in Table 5. We caution,
however, that our recommended atmospheric and stellar properties are those from the 'full' optical + IR retrieval (see Table 5), since the full retrieval accounts for
marginalization over the entire parameter space.
Our inferred atmospheric properties for WASP-103b
are summarized in Table 5. We find a TiO mixing ratio
of −7.31+2.14
−2.06 dex, broadly consistent with expectations
for a solar abundance atmosphere at WASP-103b's equilibrium temperature (Woitke et al. 2018). The retrieved
H2 O mixing ratio, −3.28+1.46
−4.08 dex, spans a wide range
from super-solar to sub-solar abundances. The latter is
consistent with the suggestion by Kreidberg et al. (2018)
of H2 O dissociation in WASP-103b's atmosphere. We
suggest that Wilson et al. (2020)'s tighter constraint on
the H2 O abundance of ∼40× solar, without sub-solar
solutions, may arise from the absence of marginalization over unocculted faculae in their retrievals. A hint
of HCN near 1.6 μm (see Figure 12) emerges only from
our combined optical + IR retrievals, though the abundance is poorly constrained with the present data. Future observations of WASP-103b can serve to confirm
the presence of TiO, H2 O, and/or HCN, while strengthening their abundance determinations.

9. DISCUSSION

9.1. The optical transmission spectrum of WASP-103b
As shown in Section 7, our petitRADTRANS retrievals that do not include stellar activity favor VO, albeit with an implausibly high volume mixing ratio (Figure 10). However, retrievals that do include the impacts
of stellar activity significantly favor stellar-activity contamination with tentative evidence for TiO (Section 8).
This may be due to the different opacity at bluer wavelengths; the Plez (1999) VO line list used by petitRADTRANS leads to a steeper drop off than the ExoMol line
list used by POSEIDON (Figure 10). As a result, the
POSEIDON retrievals with the ExoMol line list necessitate unocculted faculae to fit the downwards trend we
observe at blue wavelengths (Figure 12).
In order to place WASP-103b into context, we compare our transmission spectrum with that of another ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-121b (Delrez et al. 2016). WASP121b's equilibrium temperature of 2358 ± 52 K is 130 K
cooler than WASP-103b's, and it orbits an F6 dwarf,
compared to WASP-103, which is an F8 dwarf.

Figure 11. Retrieved transmission spectra of WASP-103b by POSEIDON. Each panel shows the median retrieved model (blue
line) and associated 1 σ and 2 σ confidence regions (purple contours) from three separate retrievals of different datasets: our
third-light and nightside corrected optical spectrum (top left); our uncorrected spectrum (top right); and the combination of
our corrected optical spectrum with the WFC3 and Spitzer data from Kreidberg et al. (2018) (bottom). A 210 ppm offset has
been applied to the infrared data to represent the median retrieved offset between the ground and space-based observations.
The corrected optical spectrum is best fit by unocculted stellar faculae with residual hints of atmospheric TiO. The uncorrected
optical spectrum also contains hints of TiO, but with unocculted stellar spots rather than faculae. The full, corrected, optical
+ infrared spectrum of WASP-103b is best fit by unocculted faculae and hints of TiO, H2 O, and HCN.

WASP-121b's low-resolution HST/STIS transmission
spectrum (Evans et al. 2018) is shown in Figure 14.
There is an excellent agreement between the transmission spectra of WASP-121b and WASP-103b, particularly between ∼4000 and 6500 Å. Figure 14 additionally
demonstrates our ability to achieve HST-quality transmission spectra from the ground.
Figure 14 also includes the near-UV photometric data
point from Turner et al. (2017). We did not analyze
that data set in the current work nor include it in our
retrieval analysis due to the different system parameters

that Turner et al. (2017) used. However, at face value
this point also seems to follow the subsequent rise in
the transmission spectrum towards the UV, as seen in
WASP-121b.
9.1.1. On the potential for VO & TiO
In the case of WASP-121b, its low-resolution transmission spectral features are taken as strong evidence
for VO (Evans et al. 2016, 2018). In secondary eclipse,
WASP-121b shows water in emission, which is direct evidence for a temperature inversion in the planet's atmo-

Figure 12. Spectral contributions to the best-fitting POSEIDON model of the transmission spectrum of WASP-103b. The
maximum likelihood retrieved spectrum (green shading) is composed of contributions from unocculted faculae (grey), TiO (red),
H2 O (blue), and HCN (orange). The equivalent model without faculae (purple) is shown for comparison. All models include
background atmosphere H2 -H2 collision-induced absorption (CIA) – producing the broad continuum feature centered at 2.2 μm
visible in the faculae-only model. The instrument modes corresponding to each observed dataset are highlighted at the bottom.

sphere (Evans et al. 2017; Mikal-Evans et al. 2019, 2020;
Daylan et al. 2019; Bourrier et al. 2020). It has been suggested that VO is responsible for this temperature inversion (Evans et al. 2017, 2018; Mikal-Evans et al. 2020;
Daylan et al. 2019; Bourrier et al. 2020) although the
presence of this molecule is debated at high-resolution
(Ben-Yami et al. 2020; Cabot et al. 2020; Hoeijmakers et al. 2020; Merritt et al. 2020; Borsa et al. 2021),
leading to suggestions that neutral Fe may instead explain WASP-121b's temperature inversion (Gibson et al.
2020).
Given the similarity between the low-resolution transmission spectra of WASP-103b and WASP-121b, VO
seems a plausible explanation. If present, VO could also
be responsible for WASP-103b's temperature inversion
(Kreidberg et al. 2018).
The comparison to WASP-121b is strengthened when
taking our transmission spectrum with the near-UV
data point of Turner et al. (2017), as this resembles the
same rise in the transmission spectrum towards the UV
as seen in WASP-121b (Figure 14). If this rise does indeed hold, then this would be evidence of a planetary

atmospheric contribution and not unocculted faculae,
which would continue trending downwards towards the
UV. However, we caution that due to the small variations in RP /R∗ seen in our own analysis (Figure 5), any
rise in WASP-103b's transmission spectrum towards the
UV should be confirmed with future HST observations
that cover a broad wavelength range.
In Section 7 we suggested that the different line lists
used by petitRADTRANS and POSEIDON could be
responsible for the different interpretations of WASP103b's transmission spectrum. However, in Evans et al.
(2018), the authors used the ATMO retrieval code which
uses the ExoMol line list for VO (Goyal et al. 2018), like
POSEIDON. Despite this, Evans et al. (2018) still find
strong evidence for VO. This may be because of their
greater spectral resolution (median wavelength bin size
of 97 Å), their coverage of the UV, and the fact that
ATMO does not fit for stellar activity. Taken together,
it is unclear to what extent the choice of line list impacts
our conclusions.
While the comparison between WASP-121b and
WASP-103b is evidence for their similar atmospheric

posterior corresponds to the fit in Figure 12 and the final column in Table 5. The marginalized histograms for each parameter
are overlaid with the median retrieved value and ±1σ confidence levels (blue error bars). The retrieved parameters indicate
strong evidence of unocculted faculae (T∗, het > T∗, phot ), a bounded constraint on WASP-103b's TiO abundance, suggestive (but
weak) constraints on the H2 O and HCN abundances, and a ∼200 ppm relative offset between the optical and infrared datasets.

chemistry (in the absence of stellar contamination), we
caution that the very high VO abundances derived from
our petitRADTRANS retrievals are implausible (Section 7).

However, the retrievals run with POSEIDON (Section 8) favor TiO, although with only marginal significance. Given the updated line lists that POSEIDON
uses and the plausible ∼ solar TiO abundances it finds

Note-Parameters without clear lower and upper bounds (e.g. abundances of undetected chemical species) are represented
by 2σ upper bounds. Cloud and/or haze parameters were completely unconstrained in all our retrievals. The detection
significances were established by nested Bayesian model comparisons with respect to the model in each column. The combined
significance 'TiO + H2 O + HCN' represents the probability of at least one of these molecules influencing WASP-103b's
transmission spectrum. The reduced chi-square and degrees of freedom (d.o.f) are undefined for the WFC3 + Spitzer retrieval
(Nparam > Ndata ); we include this retrieval for comparison with the optical-only and optical + infrared retrievals. While the
'minimal' model provides the best-fit (via the evidence or reduced chi-square), the 'full' models include marginalization over
a wider range of parameters-accounting for overlapping absorption features and other degeneracies-so our recommended
atmospheric and stellar parameters are the 'full' optical + infrared parameters (highlighted in bold / 5th column).

23

for both the optical and IR data, it is perhaps more likely
that TiO is present in WASP-103b's atmosphere. If confirmed by follow-up studies, this would make WASP103b more similar to WASP-33b and WASP-76b for
which TiO and temperature inversions have been observed (Haynes et al. 2015; Nugroho et al. 2017; Fu et al.
2020).
Further high-resolution observations are needed of
WASP-103b to search for TiO and VO via crosscorrelation techniques. In any case, the tentative evidence for these species in our transmission spectrum
is suggestive that they could be responsible for WASP103b's temperature inversion as postulated by Kreidberg
et al. (2018).
9.1.2. On stellar-activity contamination
If instead stellar contamination is the cause of some
structures in WASP-103b's transmission spectrum, then
we can also compare with WASP-121b. WASP-103 is
an F8 dwarf (Gillon et al. 2014) while WASP-121 is an
active F6 dwarf (Delrez et al. 2016).
In the case of WASP-121, it shows no photometric
modulation above the 1 mmag threshold of the WASP
photometry, no emission in the Ca II H and K line
cores, and no spot-crossing events during transit (Delrez
et al. 2016). However, it does show significant RV jitter. Delrez et al. (2016) conclude that this scenario for
WASP-121 can be explained if the star is dominated by
plage (the chromospheric counterpart to photospheric
active regions), with a covering fraction of 8 %. This
is significantly larger than the typical facular coverage
of F6 dwarfs estimated from the variability of Kepler
stars (Rackham et al. 2019). However, under this assumption, WASP-121b's transmission spectrum would
likely also be contaminated. Ultimately though, the rise
in WASP-121b's transmission spectrum at wavelengths
shorter than 4000 Å cannot be caused by unocculted faculae, which would lead to a continued decrease in transit
depth towards bluer wavelengths (e.g., Rackham et al.
2017, 2019).
In the case of WASP-103, it shows a photometric modulation of 5 ± 1 mmag in C14 automated imaging telescope data from Fairborn Observatory (Kreidberg et al.
2018). Gillon et al. (2014) do not report any activity in
WASP-103's RV data but Staab et al. (2017) measure
0

2016) and WASP-52 (Hébrard et al. 2013). Our retrievals that include activity suggest unocculted faculae ∼ 350 K hotter than the surrounding photosphere

Figure 14. Our transmission spectrum of WASP-103b (grey
hexagons) compared to the HST/STIS transmission spectrum of WASP-121b from Evans et al. (2018) (red circles).
The transmission spectra have both been scaled to their respective scale heights: 152 ppm for WASP-103b and 239 ppm
for WASP-121b (derived from Delrez et al. 2016). We also include the near-UV photometric data point from Turner et al.
(2017) (green hexagon).

(Table 5). Our retrieved faculae temperatures are consistent with solar faculae (Topka et al. 1997), while the
relatively large uncertainties in the covering fractions
would only make WASP-103 a 1.5σ outlier as compared
to the Kepler sample (Rackham et al. 2019). However,
as Delrez et al. (2016) and Rackham et al. (2019) discuss, estimates based from photometric modulation do
not necessarily reveal the underlying activity coverage,
particularly in the case of bright regions. Therefore
we do not rule out the large covering fractions of faculae our retrievals with POSEIDON derive, particularly
0
given WASP-103's high log RHK (Staab et al. 2017). UV
spectra are needed to determine whether WASP-103b is
indeed contaminated by unocculted faculae or instead
follows the same trend as WASP-121b.
9.2. Comparison with previous optical transmission
spectra
Figure 15 shows the comparison between our newly
derived transmission spectrum and the previously published results of Southworth & Evans (2016), Turner
et al. (2017), Lendl et al. (2017), and Wilson et al.
(2020). In all cases the transmission spectra have been
corrected for the third-light contamination. We note
that in this figure we applied an offset in RP /R∗ of
0.00065 and 0.0021 to the transmission spectra of Lendl
et al. (2017) and Wilson et al. (2020), respectively, so
that their median RP /R∗ is equal to the median of our

spectrum (purple diamonds) and the previously published
transmission spectra of Southworth & Evans (2016) (orange triangles), Turner et al. (2017) (red pentagon), Lendl

newly derived transmission spectrum. We believe the
larger offset for the Wilson et al. (2020) data is because
those authors used a Gaussian prior on RP /R∗ and took
the mean and standard deviation from Southworth et al.
(2015), who did not account for the third light contamination (Section 5). We have not applied an offset to the
transmission spectrum of Southworth & Evans (2016),
where a steep slope is found, nor to the single wavelength
bin of Turner et al. (2017).
This figure demonstrates the improved precision that
we achieved by combining our 11 transits. It also
shows the slight disagreement between our new transmission spectrum and some of the Gemini/GMOS and
VLT/FORS2 bins of Lendl et al. (2017) and Wilson et al.
(2020), which highlights the benefits of combining many
transits to form our transmission spectrum.
Additionally, we do not see the blueward rise as observed by Southworth & Evans (2016). However, other
than Southworth & Evans (2016)'s bluest photometric
data point, our results are roughly consistent to 1σ. Additionally, Turner et al. (2017)'s near-UV photometric
band indicates a rise towards wavelengths bluer than
our spectroscopic coverage. However, we caution against
reading too much into this due to the different system
parameters used and the offsets in RP /R∗ needed to
bring the spectroscopic data in agreement.
10. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a new ground-based optical transmission spectrum of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-103b.
We have combined 5 new transits from the ACCESS sur-

vey and 2 new transits from the LRG-BEASTS survey
with a reanalysis of 3 published Gemini/GMOS transits
and 1 VLT/FORS2 transit. Our 11-transit combined
transmission spectrum has a median uncertainty in the
transit depth of 148 ppm (< 1H), which is of HST quality and is one of the most precise ground-based transmission spectra to date.
Our optical transmission spectrum shows evidence for
sodium in a 20 Å-wide bin at 2.8σ and significant structure with a downwards slope towards blue wavelengths.
Our transmission spectrum is in excellent agreement
with WASP-121b, another ultrahot Jupiter of comparable temperature for which the presence of VO has been
inferred. In our analysis of WASP-103b's optical transmission spectrum using the petitRADTRANS retrieval
software, we find that VO can provide a good fit to the
planet's spectral features but only if we ignore stellar
activity and use implausibly high VO abundances.
In our separate optical-only retrievals with POSEIDON, which include unocculted stellar heterogeneity
contamination and updated VO and TiO line lists, we
find strong evidence for unocculted faculae (4.0σ), an
absence of VO, and tentative evidence for TiO (1.7σ)
at roughly solar abundances. Given WASP-103's high
0
log RHK , this is our favored conclusion.
When we combine our optical transmission spectrum
with the previously published HST/WFC3/IR/G141
and Spitzer/IRAC transmission spectrum, we find a
slightly higher evidence for unocculted faculae (4.3σ)
and TiO (2.1σ), and weak evidence for H2 O (1.9σ)
and HCN (1.7σ). If TiO is confirmed by future highresolution observations in the optical and HST observations in the UV, this would make WASP-103b the fourth
planet for which evidence of TiO and a temperature inversion have been observed in the same exoplanet.
Our result highlights the precision that ground-based
transmission spectroscopy can reach, in addition to the
need for a careful treatment of stellar activity contamination for exoplanets orbiting F-type stars.

Figure 16. The spectroscopic light curve fits to the 150 Å-wide bins of ACCESS n2, using GPTransSpec. Left-hand panel: the
black points show the detrended data (after removing the PCA and GP components) and the red line shows the best fitting
transit model. Right-hand panel: the residuals to the fits in the left-hand panel. The RMS of these is given in ppm on the
right-hand axis.
