Guaranteeing Completely Positive Quantum Evolution

Abstract. In open quantum systems, it is known that if the system and environment
are in a product state, the evolution of the system is given by a linear completely
positive (CP) Hermitian map. CP maps are a subset of general linear Hermitian
maps, which also include non completely positive (NCP) maps. NCP maps can arise
in evolutions such as non-Markovian evolution, where the CP divisibility of the map
(writing the overall evolution as a composition of CP maps) usually fails. Positive
but NCP maps are also useful as entanglement witnesses. In this paper, we focus
on transforming NCP maps to CP maps through composition with the asymmetric
depolarizing map. We use separate asymmetric depolarizing maps acting on the
individual subsystems.
Previous work have looked at structural physical approximation (SPA), which
is a CP approximation of a NCP map using a mixture of the NCP map with a
completely depolarizing map. We prove that the composition can always be made
CP without completely depolarizing in any direction. It is often possible to depolarize
less in some directions. We give the general proof by using the Choi matrix and an
isomorphism from a maximally entangled two qudit state to qubits. We also give
measures that describe the amount of disturbance the depolarization introduces to the
original map. Given our measures, we show that asymmetric depolarization has many
advantages over SPA in preserving the structure of the original NCP map. Finally,
we give some examples. For some measures and examples, completely depolarizing
(while not necessary) in some directions can give a better approximation than keeping
the depolarizing parameters bounded by the required depolarization if symmetric
depolarization is used.

1. Introduction
Linear Hermitian maps play an important role in many areas of quantum information
science. The evolution of an open quantum system is often clearly non-unitary and
given by a linear Hermitian map [1]. For quantum technologies, knowledge of the error
map allows one to construct efficient quantum error correction codes provided that some
conditions are met [2]. Linear Hermitian maps can be categorized as completely positive
(CP) or non CP (NCP) (defined below) and the latter can be used as entanglement
witnesses [3, 4]. This paper focuses on transforming NCP maps to CP maps via
composition with local asymmetric depolarizing maps. This transformation is important
for research in areas such as entanglement, quantum error correction, and non Markovian
evolution.
When the system and bath are initially uncorrelated, the system is known to evolve
under a completely positive map. This is a map, say Φ, that is not only positive
(maps positive operators to positive operators) but is also positive when extended by
an arbitrary identity map I, i.e., Φ → I ⊗ Φ to act on a larger system. However, it can
be quite difficult to prepare the system such that it starts completely uncorrelated from
its environment. For such cases, it is not known generally how to describe the system
evolution with a CP linear Hermitian map [5–9]. Note, that it is possible in specific
cases for the evolution of a system with initial correlations to the environment to be
CP [10–12]. There is also the process tensor formalism [13, 14], which always results

in CP linear Hermitian maps, but the process tensor acts on input maps and not on
density matrices. In this paper, we are focused on mappings from density matrices to
density matrices.
There is also disagreement on the physicality of NCP evolution maps [15, 16].
However, in the case of non-Markovian evolution the initial CP map tends to be non CP
divisible (i.e., the map cannot be decomposed into CP maps for all arbitrary intermediate
time steps) [13]. This implies that an intermediate evolution map can be NCP [17]. For
this paper, we focus on transforming a given NCP map to a CP map and leave discussions
of physicality of NCP maps for future work. Still, we require the domain of the NCP
map to be restricted so that the output of the map is positive.
The composition of the initial NCP map with an asymmetric depolarizing map
may or may not be CP divisible depending on the strength of the depolarizer (with no
depolarizing, the composition is equal to the initial NCP map, which is trivially not
CP divisible and when we depolarize completely the composition is equivalent to the
completely depolarizing map, which is CP divisible). Thus, this composition may be
useful in the study of non-Markovian evolution.
Positive but NCP maps do not preserve the positivity of some entangled states,
but they do for all separable states. Consequently, they can be used as entanglement
witnesses [18]. The most common witness is the negativity of the partial transpose which
is a necessary and sufficient condition for detecting entanglement for 2×2 or 2×3 systems
[3, 19]. To implement the partial transpose experimentally, Horodecki and Eckert
introduced structural physical approximation (SPA), which is a CP approximation of a
NCP map [20].
In the SPA, the completely depolarizing map is mixed with the NCP map. This
allows us to make the overall map CP. Note that this is equivalent to composing with a
symmetric depolarization map. Symmetric depolarization destroys information equally
in all directions, which preserves the direction of the Bloch, or polarization vector, given
by the original NCP map. However, if we only focus on getting a CP approximation, in
many situations, it is often unnecessary and worse to use symmetric depolarization. For
example, if the NCP map only changes the state in one direction, we likely only need
to depolarize in that direction to get a CP approximation.
In quantum error correction, the goal is to correct for the effects of the error map.
The known necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum error correction require that
the error map is CP [21, 22]. In the case of NCP errors, these known CP necessary and
sufficient conditions can lead to codes that are not in the domain of the error map,
which means that the process as described is not physical [23]. Thus, the results of
this paper may help with correcting for NCP error maps by transforming them via the
asymmetric depolarizing map (ADM) into CP maps. Regardless, the code should still
be in the domain of the original NCP map because a valid quantum state is necessary.
Furthermore, this process of creating a CP composition via the ADM may reduce
the amount of errors effecting the system. For example, if the NCP error map causes a
repolarization error, i.e., it extends the Bloch vector of the input state, the asymmetric

depolarizer that creates a CP composition will eliminate the repolarization error. In
these situations, using the ADM is better than the symmetric depolarizer because the
ADM offers more freedom for minimizing the errors occurring on the input state.
In this paper, we investigate composing the asymmetric depolarizing map with a
NCP map to get a CP composition. We give a novel proof for the complete positivity
of the composition by using an isomorphism between a bipartite maximally entangled
qudit and its qubit representation. From this isomorphism, the positivity of the Choi
matrix is proven. In Section 4.2, we determine the amount of disturbance the ADM
introduces and compare it with symmetric depolarization. Using certain measures, we
provide examples that show the advantages of using ADM. In certain cases, while not
necessary to achieve complete positivity, we can depolarize more in some directions
such that complete positivity of the composition is achieved but with an even higher
value for a measure that we denote M1 , (see Eq. (69)) than would have been attained
by restricting depolarization in all directions to be less than or equal to the amount
required by symmetric depolarization.
2. Background
Here we consider a combined initial system and environment state given by ρSE , where
the system is under our control and the environment is not. The initial system state is
given by the partial trace ρS = trE (ρSE ). Thus, the system evolves as
E(ρS ) = trE (U ρSE U † ),

(1)

where U is a global unitary and E is a superoperator. In the case of an uncorrelated
system and bath, the evolution of the system is given by a completely positive (CP)
map [24]
X
E(ρS ) =
Ei ρS Ei† .
(2)
i

We drop subscripts when it is clear from context which subspace we are considering.
E is CP iff E is positive for all positive inputs and the map E ⊗ In is positive for all
positive inputs for all positive integers n [24]. Complete positivity is also given by the
Choi matrix. Let E : Cn×n → Cm×m . Then the map is CP iff its Choi matrix

is positive [24].
If the system and environment are correlated, the system map may be given by a
not completely positive map (NCP)

where ηi ∈ {±1} and it is necessary that there ∃ηi = −1 [5–9, 24].
The first representation of maps we gave in Eq. (2) and Eq. (4) is called the operator
sum representation (OSR). In this paper, we also use the SMR representation [1] in
describing the system evolution. In SMR, the evolution of the system is given by the
A-matrix A acting on the vectorized form of ρS . This vectorization is given by
X
 X
vec(ρs ) = vec

cij |αi βj i,

where |αi i and |βj i are basis vectors.

Then, the action of A is given by matrix

ρ0 = Aρ,

(6)

where we dropped the text vec for simplification of notation. In index notation, this is
given by [1]
ρ0r0 s0 = Ar0 s0 ,rs ρrs .

(7)

To preserve hermiticity and trace, A also satisfies
As0 r0 ,sr = (Ar0 s0 ,rs )∗ ,

(8)

and

respectively.
There is also the B-matrix B, which is related to A by
Br0 r,s0 s ≡ Ar0 s0 ,rs .

(10)

The B-matrix is often used because the constraints on the A-matrix transfer nicely. The
conditions are hermiticity
Br0 r,s0 s = (Bs0 s,r0 r )∗ ,

and trace preserving

Since B is Hermitian, it has an eigenvector/eigenvalue decomposition

where the C are the eigenvectors and γ the eigenvalues of B. One may write the map

where Aα ≡ |γ(α)|C α so that ηα = ±1. This shows us the relation between the OSR
and SMR representation. It is known that the map is completely positive if and only if
all ηα = 1.

2.1. Structural Physical Approximation
The problem of converting a NCP map to a CP map has been studied under structural
physical approximation (SPA), which was first introduced by Horodecki and Ekert, and
expanded upon by several authors [20, 25–34]. SPAs are often used to approximate the
partial transpose map and detect entanglement [35–49]. In SPA, the NCP superoperator
Φ is approximated by
e
Φ(ρ)
= pLcomp (ρ) + (1 − p)Φ(ρ),

(15)

where Lcomp is the completely depolarizing channel, i.e., Lcomp (ρ) = tr(ρ)I/d, where d
is the dimension of ρ, and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Notice that SPA is equal to the composition
e = L1−p ◦ Φ,
Φ

(16)

where the L1−p is the symmetric depolarization channel which scales the polarization
vector n [50–53] by the factor 1 − p. The symmetric depolarization channel for a single
qubit can be written in OSR as


p
3p
(17)
ρ + (σx ρσx + σy ρσy + σz ρσz ).
L1−p (ρ) = 1 −

We study the composition
e0 = L0 ◦ Φ,
Φ

(18)

where L0 performs asymmetric depolarization on each local state. The asymmetric
depolarization channel for a single qubit can be written in OSR as
1
L(ρ) = [(1 + α + β + γ)ρ + (1 + α − β − γ)σx ρσx
4
+(1 − α + β − γ)σy ρσy + (1 − α − β + γ)σz ρσz ] ,

(19)

where α, β, and γ are the amounts of depolarization in the x, y, and z directions,
respectively. The asymmetric depolarizer does not generally preserve the direction of
e0 can
the Bloch vector of the input state. From the SPA, we immediately see that Φ
be made CP with appropriate (symmetric) depolarization. However, in the SPA it is
necessary that the systems are depolarized symmetrically and equally. Thus, it is not
immediately clear that depolarizing the individual local systems differently leads to a
CP composition.
Using a qudit to qubit isomorphism, we prove that symmetric depolarization is
not necessary. We also show that when using asymmetric depolarization, completely
depolarizing is not necessary in any direction for any of the local systems for Eq. (18)
to be CP. However, we also show that there exist NCP maps that are robust against
depolarization and completely depolarizing is almost necessary.

3. Extending the A-matrix to Higher Dimensions
One might think that a valid A-matrix A is trivially extensible to higher dimensions in
the SMR representation by A ⊗ I. However, this is not true as we show by a simple
counter example below. If we want the tensor product of two A-matrices A1 ⊗A2 to have
the correct action when operating on a two-qubit density operator, we need to focus our
attention to the operator-sum representation. By definition, when an A-matrix acts on
the vectorized form of a single qubit density operator, the resultant state is the same
thing we would have gotten by sending the qubit through a channel expressed in OSR;
that is,
X
(Aρv )d =
Ei ρEi = E(ρ),
(20)
i

where the subscripts d and v represent density and vector forms of an operator,
respectively. An arbitrary two-qubit state has the form

(21)
ρ =

i,j=1
which when acted upon by A1 ⊗ A2 becomes

ρ = A1 ⊗ A2 (I)v ⊗ (I)v + (~r * ~σ )v ⊗ (I)v + (I)v ⊗ (~s * ~σ )v +

tij A1 (σ̂i )v ⊗ A2 (σ̂j )v .
4
i,j=1
The reason we vectorized all of the 2 × 2 sub-matrices in this state is that it
simulates Eq. (20) exactly on the subsystems. Thus, it is the same as if we derived the
operator-sum decomposition for A1 and A2 and then acted upon the state ρAB with
E1 (.) ⊗ E2 (.). A really nice structure occurs when calculating the resultant vectorized
state for a two-qubit system. It turns out that if our state initially has the representation
!
A
B
ρAB =

(23)
C D
then the correct vectorized form of it is given by


Av
 B 
 v 
AB
ρv = 
.
 Cv 
Dv

(24)

Therefore, we can use the normal extension A1 ⊗ A2 if we vectorize our two-qubit state
locally.

Generally, we can simply perform a rotation on some general A-matrix W so that
its rows act on ρv the same way A1 ⊗ A2 does. This equates to the exchange of the rows
3 ↔ 5, 4 ↔ 6, 11 ↔ 13, and 12 ↔ 14, which is essentially a permutation matrix of the
following form:

Therefore, if we want to use the same vectorization, specifically the one given in Eq. (24),
for ρv when acted on by W, we simply apply the rotation R such that W → RWRT .
By doing this, we can always use the vectorization in Eq. (24) to obtain the correct
result. For any amount of qubits d, there exists a permutation matrix that will always
lead to the same vectorization method for any A1 ⊗ A2 ⊗ * * * ⊗ Ad . Hence, the two-qubit
A-matrix of A1 ⊗ A2 is given by RA1 ⊗ A2 R. Note that for this particular permutation
matrix R = RT and R2 = I.
The following example extends a single qubit A-matrix with identity to act on a
two-qubit state.
3.1. Example 1
Let our initial two qubit state be the maximally mixed state
1
(26)
ρAB = IAB .
4
Let us perform the maximal depolarization on system A and leave the system B alone.
We might naturally assume that the global A-matrix can be calculated directly as



A = Lcomp ⊗ I = 
(27)
 ⊗ I.

Then straight-forward calculation gives

1
Avec(ρAB ) = vec Φ+ .

This result is obviously wrong. The correct output state is I. To find the
4
correct A-matrix for the extension to higher dimensions, we can use the OSR. Let
P
EL (ρ) = i Ei ρEi† correspond to the OSR of Lcomp . Then, the extended map is given
by
X
EL ⊗ I(ρ) =
(Ei ⊗ I)ρ(Ei† ⊗ I).

Using Eq. (14) we can return to the SMR representation and get the B-matrix and the
A-matrix. The correct B and A-matrices are

4. NCP to CP
Our goal of transforming a NCP map to a CP map is equivalent to going from an initial
B-matrix with at least one negative eigenvalue to a final B-matrix with all positive
eigenvalues. Equivalently, this is going from Eq. (4) to Eq. (2) in OSR.
4.1. Composition: Asymmetric Depolarization
We use composition with the asymmetric depolarization map, which is also known
as generalized depolarization. Obviously, if we completely depolarize the composition

would be a CP map because we always end up with the maximally mixed state.
Asymmetric depolarization has been studied in other contexts in the past [54–57], but
here we use it to transform a NCP map to a CP map without completely depolarizing.
Note that the ADM is doubly stochastic, i.e., it preserves the identity matrix and it
is trace preserving. We first give the proof for the single qubit A-matrix because the
general case closely follows the same arguments.
Theorem 1. Let the single qubit asymmetric depolarization map be given by

The asymmetric depolarizer in OSR is

L(ρ) = [(1 + α + β + γ)ρ + (1 + α − β − γ)σx ρσx
4
+(1 − α + β − γ)σy ρσy + (1 − α − β + γ)σz ρσz ] .

(31)

Let A be a single qubit trace preserving NCP map. Then, L ◦ A is CP for appropriate
nonzero values of α, β, and γ.
Proof. This depolarizing map is completely positive when the following Fujiwara-Algoet
[58] conditions are satisfied:
|γ ± α| ≤ 1 ± β.

(32)

We can maximally depolarize by letting α = β = γ = 0. We use the Choi matrix
representation. The action of L on the Pauli matrices are
L(σx ) = ασx ,

L(σy ) = βσy ,

and

L(σz ) = γσz .

(33)

The ADM leaves the identity matrixEDinvariant. Next, note that the unormalized

We then use the fact that A is trace preserving, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and a
Hermitian matrix can be expanded in the basis of all possible tensors of Pauli matrices.

the I ⊗ I term. The Choi matrix, Eq. (38), becomes positive as J goes to zero.
We can arbitrarily shrink J asymmetrically by decreasing the values of α, β, and γ
independently. Thus, from continuity, with nonzero values of α, β, and γ, L ◦ A is CP
for some choice of α, β, and γ.
Before proving the general case, we show an isomorphism from maximally entangled
qudits to the basis of tensored Pauli matrices that we will use. This Theorem 2 will be
used to rewrite the Choi matrix in Pauli matrix form.

Theorem 2 and the remark might be useful in other problems. We can now prove
our main theorem.
Theorem 3. Any n qubit trace-preserving NCP map ANCP can be made CP by
composing it with a map that performs asymmetric depolarization on each qubit with
appropriate nonzero values of αi , βi , and γi , where i represents the ith qubit being
depolarized.
Proof. We again make use of the Choi matrix. For a n qubit system, we perform the
ADM on each qubit individually. This action is equivalent to performing
L0 = Πni=1 Li ⊗ I,

(57)

where i represents the ith qubit. We can maximally depolarize by letting αi = βi =
γi = 0. This depolarizing map is completely positive when the following inequalities are
satisfied:
|γi ± αi | ≤ 1 ± βi .

(58)

The action of Li on the Pauli matrices are
Li (σx ) = αi σx ,

Li (σy ) = βi σy ,

and

Li (σz ) = γi σz .

where the mj 's are the products of the appropriate αi , βi and γi constants from the

Choi matrix Eq. (63) becomes positive as J goes to zero. We can arbitrarily shrink J
asymmetrically by decreasing αi , βi , and γi independently. Thus, from continuity, with
nonzero values of αi , βi , and γi , L0 ◦ A is CP.
Remark: Keep in mind that there exist NCP maps that are robust to asymmetric
and symmetric depolarizers. This means that the parameters α, β, and γ must be
extremely close to zero in order to obtain a CP composition with the NCP A-matrix.
For instance, if we define a NCP map to be

√
where κ > 1/2(3 − 5), we see that the parameters of the asymmetric depolarizer
must be less than or equal to 1/κ to get a CP composition L ◦ A. To see this,
we completely depolarize in two directions and determine the constraint on the third
direction. The eigenvalues of the composition with L(1/κ, 0, 0) and L(0, 0, 1/κ) contain
one negative value and the composition with L(0, β, 0) requires β = 1/κ for a CP
composition, which gives the eigenvalues of {1, 1, 0, 0} for the composition. Therefore,
maps where κ becomes increasingly large certainly do not capture any advantages over
the symmetric depolarizer. We can look at the individual directions separately because
we are depolarizing asymmetrically.
Since there exists initial states outside the domain whose eigenvalues of their
resultant states blow up to ±∞ as κ → ∞, we need to check the validity of this
map. Just like the asymmetric depolarizer, we can define a translation of the original
state's Bloch vector with the A-matrix


to perform the action

(66)

on the initial Bloch vector [59]. This transformation will obviously be NCP for any nonzero translation vector {x0 , y0 , z0 } since the image Bloch sphere is not fully contained
in the initial Bloch Sphere. This translation matrix only has a valid physical domain
when the translation vector has a magnitude less than or equal to 2, even though it is
a valid A-matrix for values outside of this interval. This begs the question of whether
or not (64) represents a valid mapping of our qubit. The answer to this question is yes,
it is valid. Figure 1 illustrates the action of this map when κ = 1.
When κ → ∞, we see that the state
ρ=



1
1
I − σx −→ A(ρ) = I − σz

(67)

always leads to a valid state. The domain for the output state increases as κ decreases. In
the limit as κ → ∞, the only valid output is the |1i-state given by the transformation in
(67). So this valid A-matrix can have an operator-sum decomposition with eigenvalues,
in the limit, that blow up to ±∞ while illustrating true robustness to the asymmetric
depolarizing map. It is very interesting how there exists a mapping that is so resistant
to heavy noise in all directions, yet the magnitude of the Bloch vector for the |−i-state is
left invariant at the end of that mapping. Future research can look into the physicality
of this map such as the global evolution on some correlated state that would induce
such a transformation on one of the subsystems.

Figure 1. On top left, the length of the initial Bloch vector is r = 1/6 and it increases
in length by intervals of 1/6 from left to right. So the bottom right Bloch sphere has
a radius of 1. We fix κ = 1. We see that as the length of the initial Bloch vector
increases, there is more intersection between the Bloch sphere and its image. Thus,
we only need to consider when r = 1 to determine that the transformation is always
possible with increasing κ.

4.2. Asymmetric Depolarization Map Measures
From this point on, we let L = Πni=1 Li ⊗ I or the single qubit ADM. When we perform
ADM, we generally change the state's Bloch vector. Therefore, it is important to
measure how much the state is changed. There are multiple measures we can use.
First, we give our ADM measure M1
1
M1 := (|α| + |β| + |γ|),
(68)
3
which is basically just an averaging over the absolute values of the depolarizing
parameters. The range of M1 is 0 ≤ M1 ≤ 1. At the two extremes, we have total
loss of the Bloch vector and the magnitude of the Bloch vector unchanged for the values
of 0 and 1, respectively. For n qubits, this measure generalizes in the obvious way to
!
3n
1 X
M1 :=
|ci | ,
(69)
3n i=1
where the ci 's are the depolarization parameters. The M1 measure for the symmetric
depolarizing channel is simply given by a single depolarizing parameter that we can call
τ that is between 0 and 1.
For single qubits, we also have the closed form for measures using fidelity and the
diamond norm. We can calculate the fidelity between the initial state and the final state
for the asymmetric depolarizer when it is composed with some error map A. Define the
matrix


α 0 0


D =  0 β 0 .
(70)

Guaranteeing Completely Positive Quantum Evolution
We can define two fidelity measures. The first fidelity is

1 + ~r * D~r + (1 − ~r * ~r)(1 − ~r 0 * D2~r 0 ) ,
F (ρ, L ◦ Aρ) =

18

(71)

where ~r is the Bloch vector of the initial state ρ and ~r 0 is the Bloch vector of the
state Aρ. This fidelity is good for error correction since we would reduce the effect
of the composition while we ensuring complete positivity of the composition. For the
symmetric depolarizer, D = τ I. If we are interested in approximating the A-matrix
while ensuring a CP composition with the asymmetric depolarizer, then we want to use
the calculation

When comparing the gate fidelity of two Pauli channels, the general equation is
given by the diamond norm [60] and has the analytical form of

Ej (ρ) =

κi = 1 for j = 1, 2.

In the case where E1 (ρ) is the asymmetric depolarizing channel and E2 (ρ) is the
symmetric depolarizing channel, we have that the diamond norm ||E1 (ρ) − E2 (ρ)|| is
equal to

ff
1
|α + β + γ − 3τ | + |α − β − γ + τ | + |α − β + γ − τ | + |α + β − γ − τ | . (75)
4
The parameters α, β, and γ describe the asymmetric depolarizer and the parameter
τ describes the symmetric one. The distance between the asymmetric depolarizer and
symmetric depolarizer gives us a measure of the advantage of the asymmetric depolarizer
because the performance of the asymmetric depolarizer is generally lower bounded by
the symmetric depolarizer.
4.3. ADM Composition vs SPA: Information Loss
We would like to show that the composition with the asymmetric depolarizer is generally
better than the SPA at retaining information. As was shown in the introduction, the
SPA is equivalent to composition with a symmetric depolarizer. The natural way to
compare the two compositions would be to use mutual information and show that
I(L ◦ A(ρ); A(ρ)) ≥ I(Lsymm ◦ A(ρ); A(ρ)), where L is the asymmetric depolarizer,
Lsymm is the symmetric depolarizer, A is the input NCP A-matrix, and I(A; B) is the
mutual information for the systems A and B. However, since this calculates the mutual
information for product states, i.e., A and B are not correlated, these values are zero.
Instead, we bound the linear entropy SL (ρ) = 1 − tr(ρ2 ) [61].

Guaranteeing Completely Positive Quantum Evolution

19

Lemma 1. Let A be a trace preserving NCP map; τ be the depolarization parameter for
Lsymm ; ci 's be the depolarization parameters for L; and L ◦ A and Lsymm ◦ A be CP with
the minimum depolarization required (minimum depolarization is given by maximizing
M1 with ci ≥ τ ∀i). Then, the linear entropy is bounded by
SL (Lsymm ◦ A(ρ)) ≥ SL (L ◦ A(ρ)) ∀ρ.

(76)

Remark. If the depolarization parameters are not constrained by ci ≥ τ ∀i, the result
does not hold as shown by the counter examples in Subsection 5.2. Also, note that the
linear entropy is a good measure for qubits, but can be a misleading measure for higher
dimensional states due to the possible distribution of the eigenvalues.
Proof. The minimum depolarization for the ADM composition L◦A can be bounded by
going back to the positivity of the Choi matrix of the compositions. Notice that the Choi
matrix for the SPA is equivalent to the Choi matrix for the ADM composition when all
the depolarizing parameters are equal (this must be true because when the depolarizing
parameters are all equal we are symmetrically depolarizing). Then, the composition is
CP for some optimal symmetric depolarization value c. At this value, the purity of the
output of the two compositions are the same and the symmetric depolarization used for
the SPA is optimal. Since ci ≥ τ ∀i, the purity of the output of the ADM composition
must be greater than or equal to the purity of the output of the SPA and the bound
follows.
4.4. Composition with ADM as a Structural Physical Approximation
Can the composition L ◦ A be considered a structural physical approximation of the
NCP A-matrix? Structural physical approximations should preserve the structure of the
original A-matrix by preserving the direction of the Bloch vector of the output of the
original NCP A-matrix [25]. The ADM does not in general preserve the direction of the
Bloch vector. When the ADM depolarizes symmetrically, the composition is completely
equivalent to the SPA if local depolarizers are also used for the SPA.
5. Examples
We give some examples of NCP maps and their corresponding ADMs that convert them
to CP maps. The first two examples are detailed and for the last two examples we just
give the corresponding ADM. Note that we let L = L(α, β, γ) and T = T (x0 , y0 , z0 )
(the translation matrix defined in Eq. (65)).
5.1. Example 2

so that the Bloch sphere gets shifted up from its initial position along the z-axis by
1/2 as seen in Fig. (2). Intuitively, the asymmetric depolarizer that will work best (as
given by our measures in Section 4.2), for making this a valid CP map by composition,
is given by shrinking
p the z component of the Bloch vector by 2/3. Then, the α and β
we get a CP composition when we depolarize p
the z
components are 2/3. Note thatp
component by 2/3 and α, β ∈ [0, 2/3]. We obviously would choose α = β = 2/3
because we would like to depolarize by the least amount possible.
The symmetric depolarizer that will work best, for making this a valid CP map by
composition, is given by shrinking the z component of the Bloch vector by 2/3 which
also shrinks the x and y components by the same proportion. From our M1 measure
we can see that the ADM composition performs better than the SPA. M1 = 2/3 for the
√
symmetric depolarizer compared to M1 = (2 + 2 6)/9 ≈ 0.767 > 0.667 for the ADM.
In terms of the bloch sphere, the ADM shrinks the image space of the transpose into
an ellipsoid, while the symmetric depolarizer retains the image shape of a sphere. The
volume of the image space for the ADM composition is always greater than the volume
of the SPA image space. However, the symmetric depolarizer maintains the shape of
the image space of the orignal NCP map, but the ADM does not.

arbitrary qubit on the Bloch sphere. The lighter image represents the original Bloch
sphere and the darker sphere is the image of the translation map along the z-axis.
The second image demonstrates how the ellipsoid positivity domain of the final state

are {(3/2, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6)}.
Notice how both the composition map and also the L map must have non-negative
eigenvalues to have a valid implementable protocol. In general, the minimum degree
of depolarization can be obtained in a numerical optimization program that maximizes
the M1 measure in Eq. (68) while leaving both sets of eigenvalues non-negative. A
calculation of the fidelity in Eq. (71) between initial pure states and final states for the
ADM composition and the SPA are given by

which are only dependent on the polar angle θ. The difference of the ADM composition
√
and SPA fidelity measures is given by (1/6)( 6 − 2)sin(θ)2 which is always greater than
or equal to zero. Thus, the ADM is better at state preservation than the symmetric
depolarizer as illustrated in Figure (3). The gate fidelity in Eq. (75) between the two
√
depolarizers is (1/3)( 6 − 2) ≈ .15. Interesting enough, this value is double the maximum difference of the fidelity of the best ADM composition and SPA set-ups.

5.2. Example 3
If we allow the asymmetric depolarizer to depolarize more in some directions than the

Figure 3. The solid line gives the fidelity, with respect to the parameter θ, between
the output of the ADM composition with the initial state, when the initial states are
pure. The dashed line represents the fidelity for the SPA with the initial state. The
lowest achievable fidelity in each case is 2/3 which occurs at θ = π, but for any other
value of θ corresponding to non-unit fidelity, we see that the ADM composition has a
higher fidelity than the SPA.

which has an associated B-matrix with eigenvalues 2, − 2, 2, and 0. The optimal
symmetric depolarizer that makes the composition CP is given by the parameter
√
κ = 1/(1 + 2 2).
(86)
It turns out that for any α, β, γ ≥ κ for the asymmetric depolarizer, and not all equal to
κ, we cannot make the composition CP. An optimization shows that we can completely
depolarize in the x and z direction, while leaving the y direction unchanged; that is,
α = 0 = γ and β = 1.

(87)

The M1 measure is optimal and higher for the asymmetric depolarizer, even though we
depolarized more than the symmetric depolarizer in two of the directions. To maintain
complete positivity of the composition map while the magnitude of the depolarizing
is less than or equal to the symmetric depolarizer in each direction, we must include
negative values for one or two of the asymmetric depolarizing parameters. Depending
on what measure you choose to use, M1 measure or fidelity, you may want to depolarize
more in some directions and less in others over the symmetric depolarizer.
In this next example, our M1 measure can only be optimized when we depolarize
more than the symmetric depolarizer in two of the directions. Define the NCP map

on the domain and σ̂y ρT σ̂y on the image. If we symmetrically depolarize with parameter
κ = 1/3,

(90)

then the SPA becomes completely positive. The M1 measure is equal to 1/3 in this case,
but we can obtain a value of (1/3) ∗ 1.309 when we use an asymmetric depolarizer with
parameters
α = γ = 49/200 < κ and β = 819/1000 > κ.

(91)

It turns out that we can only achieve an M1 measure of up to 1/3 when |α|, |β|, |γ| ≥
1/3. You can see this by slightly bumping the absolute value of each parameter
consecutively by a small value above 1/3 and noticing that the composition map becomes
NCP. Therefore, it is necessary to depolarize more than the symmetric depolarizer in
two of the directions in order to achieve an advantage for the ADM. We also achieve a
higher fidelity of Eq. (71) in this case (151/400 = 0.3775) than we do in the symmetric
one (1/3).

Notice how the initial and final states are left invariant after this transformation due to
the fact that L ◦ A = I ⊗ I. This will always be true if A is invertible and its inversion
has a positive dynamical B-matrix. This leads to the open question of which full-rank
invertible A-matrices have non-negative dynamical B-matrices for the inverse? In the
case of asymmetric depolarization, the initial parameters α, β, γ must be greater than 1
or less than −1. The translation NCP map will always have a negative inversion. There
exists other A maps that cannot be expressed in terms of translations and asymmetric
depolarization. Generally, it is unknown for these maps which will have CP inversions.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we studied transforming a NCP map to a CP map through composition
with the asymmetric depolarizing map (ADM). The ADM acts as a super-superoperator
that maps the input NCP map to a CP map. This problem is similar to structural
physical approximation. However, in SPA, symmetric depolarization is required. We
found that a trace preserving NCP map on qubits can always be made CP by acting
on the individual qubits with local ADMs. The proof uses an isomorphism between a
maximally entangled 2 qudit state and n qubits. Furthermore, we prove that these local
ADMs never have to completely depolarize in any direction and are not required to be
symmetric.
Note that a global ADM can preserve the structure of the input NCP map better
than local ADMs on the individual qubits. This is due to the fact that the depolarization
factors from the multiple local depolarizers mutiply on the correlation matrix. Thus, the
correlation matrix shrinks more rapidly than the local Bloch, or polarization, vectors.
However, experimentally implementing a global ADM is very difficult for a large number
of qubits. Next, we defined measures of the ADM, which tells us how much the input
state into the ADM is disturbed. Under these measures, the ADM composition has some

advantage over SPA in preserving the structure of the original map. Finally, we gave
examples. One interesting example (in Eq. (64)), shows that there exist valid A-matrices
that are robust against asymmetric depolarization and completely depolarizing becomes
almost necessary. We also showed with another example (in Eq. (85)) that, under the
measure we called M1 and also the fidelity, sometimes completely depolarizing in one
direction (while not necessary) results in a better approximation. Finally, for qutrit
maps, the task of transforming a NCP map to a CP map via local ADMs is unproven.
We leave this for future work.
