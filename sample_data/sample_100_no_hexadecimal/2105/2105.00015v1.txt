Abstract
A finite-dimensional quantum system is in contact with a reservoir, which has
a stationary state but otherwise dissipative dynamics. We give an expansion of the
propagator of the system-reservoir interacting dynamics as a sum of a main part
plus a remainder. The main part consist of oscillatory and decaying terms with
explicit frequencies and decay rates. The remainder is small in the system-reservoir
coupling constant, uniformly for all times. Our approach is based on Mourre theory
for the spectral analysis of the generator of the full dynamics. This allows for weak
regularity of admissible interaction operators and has important consequences in
applications.

Setup and assumptions

We consider a bipartite Hilbert space
H = HS ⊗ H R ,

(1.1)

where dim HS < ∞, and a family of self-adjoint operators
Lλ = L0 + λI,

(1.2)

where both L0 and I are self-adjoint, λ ∈ R and L0 is of the form
L0 = LS ⊗ 1lR + 1lS ⊗ LR .
1

(1.3)

This is the setup describing the composition of a system (S) plus reservoir (R) arrangement, in which LS and LR generate the free (non interacting) dynamics of the individual
components, I is an interaction operator and λ is a coupling constant.
We suppose that L0 has finitely many eigenvalues e, of finite multiplicity me , possibly
embedded in continuous spectrum, which can cover parts or all of R. The set of eigenvalues
e of L0 is denoted by E0 and the associated orthogonal eigenprojection is Pe . We are going
to impose a regularity condition (c.f. (A1) below) which implies the following picture for
small λ: All eigenvalues of Lλ lie inside an O(λ) neighbourhood of E0 . Moreover, within
such a neighbourhood around any given e ∈ E0 , either Lλ does not have any eigenvalues for
λ 6= 0 (we say e is unstable), or Lλ does have some eigenvalues, with summed multiplicity
m0e not exceeding me (we say e is stable if m0e = me , and partially stable if 0 < m0e < me ).
In the analytic perturbation theory of isolated eigenvalues, the summed multiplicity m0e
would always equal me , but for embedded eigenvalues, it is generically strictly less than
me .

(s)

Fig. 1: An eigenvalue e of L0 splits into eigenvalues Ee (λ), s = 1, . . . , m0e , of Lλ .
Fig. 1 gives a graphical depiction of the situation. The main goal of this paper is to find
an expression of probability amplitudes (in the quantum mechanical sense), that is, of
overlaps
Fφ,ψ (t) = hφ, eitLλ ψi,
(1.4)
for suitable vectors φ, ψ ∈ H. In particular, we try to elucidate the effect of the instability
of eigenvalues on the dynamics. The key phenomenon we will uncover is this: the overlaps
split into
Fφ,ψ (t) = F qsta (t) + F diss (t) + R(t),
(1.5)
where F qsta (t) is a quasi-static contribution, F diss (t) is a dissipative contribution decaying
as |F diss (t)| ≤ C/(1 + t2 ), and the remainder satisfies |R(t)| ≤ C|λ|1/4 for all t ≥ 0. We
find the detailed structure of F qsta (t). It consists of oscillating terms and terms decaying
at rates ∝ 1/λ2 , see Theorem 2.1.
Let us now introduce the assumptions and discuss their meaning. We start with an
assumption to simplify the bookkeeping. It is not essential for our method to work and
could be removed at the cost of a more cumbersome presentation.
2

(A1) For λ 6= 0 small enough, all eigenvalues of Lλ are simple.
(s)

We call these eigenvalues Ee (λ), with s = 1, . . . , m0e ≤ me , and
s = 1, . . . , m0e .

lim Ee(s) (λ) = e,

λ→0

(1.6)

The next assumption is a key characteristic for the physical situation we want to
describe. We assume that the reservoir dynamics has a single stationary state and that
the coupled dynamics is dissipative on the orthogonal complement of this state.
(A2) The reservoir dynamics has a unique stationary state ΩR ∈ HR , that is, KerLR =
CΩR . We denote
PR = 1lS ⊗ |ΩR ihΩR |

and

PR⊥ = 1lH − PR .

(1.7)

On the orthogonal complement the full, coupled dynamics is dissipative in the sense
that there exists a λ∗ > 0 and a dense set D ⊂ H such that ∀λ with 0 ≤ |λ| < λ∗
and ∀φ, ψ ∈ D,
max sup ∂zj hφ, RzPR (λ)ψi

≤ C1 (φ, ψ) < ∞,

(1.8)

sup ∂λ hφ, RzPR (λ)ψi

≤ C1 (φ, ψ) < ∞.

(1.9)

0≤j≤2 z∈C−

z∈C−

Here C− = {z ∈ C : Imz < 0} is the open lower complex half plane and
RzPR (λ) = (PR⊥ Lλ PR⊥ − z)−1 RanPR⊥
is the reduced resolvent. In (1.8), (1.9), C1 is well defined (finite) on D × D.
Discussion of Assumption (A2).
(i) The estimate (1.9) is of technical nature, but the estimate (1.8) is key as it implies
that the dynamics generated by L̄λ ≡ PR⊥ Lλ PR⊥ RanPR⊥ is dissipative, meaning that
limt→∞ hφ, eitL̄λ ψi = 0. More precisely, it follows from (1.8), with 0 ≤ j ≤ 2 replaced
by 0 ≤ j ≤ k, that
C
hφ, eitL̄λ ψi ≤
,
(1.10)
(1 + t2 )k/2
provided (L̄λ + i)φ ∈ D and (L̄λ + i)ψ ∈ D. Specifically, (1.8) implies time decay
∝ t−2 (k = 2) of overlaps (1.10). We prove (1.10) at the end of this section.
(ii) We argue that (1.8) is a natural assumption. Namely, (1.8) for λ = 0 is implied by
max sup ∂zj hφ, (LR − z)−1 PR⊥ ψiHR ≤ C1 (φ, ψ) < ∞,

0≤j≤2 z∈C−

(1.11)

where we understand here (c.f. (1.7)) PR = |ΩR ihΩR |, PR⊥ = 1lR − PR . This is
readily seen by writing
X
PS,e ⊗ (LR − e − z)−1 PR⊥ ,
RzPR (0) = (L0 − z)−1 PR⊥ =
e∈E0

P
where PS,e is the spectral projection of LS associated to e, so that e∈E0 PS,e =
1lS . In turn, (1.11) is a natural assumption on the dynamics of a reservoir, since
that dynamics should be dissipative away from the stationary state. In concrete
applications, one starts with (1.8) for λ = 0 and then proves its validity for small
λ 6= 0 by perturbation theory [19].
(iii) In some recent works on the dynamics on open quantum systems [15, 18], the assumption (1.8) is replaced by the condition that z 7→ hφ, RzPR (λ)ψi have a meromorphic continuation from z in the lower complex plane across the real axis into the
upper plane. This is a much stronger condition than (1.8). In applications to open
quantum systems, this difference means that the reservoir correlation function has
to decay exponentially quickly in time for the meromorphic situation, while under
the present assumption, the decay only needs to be polynomial, c.f. [19].
(iv) Without loss of generality, we may assume that C1 (φ, ψ) = C1 (ψ, φ) and that
C1 (φ, ψ) = C1 (PR⊥ φ, PR⊥ ψ) in (1.8), (1.9).
As is well known (see e.g. Proposition 4.1 of [6]) if A is a self-adjoint operator and for
each vector φ in some dense set, there exists a constant C(φ) such that
lim inf sup |hφ, (A − x + i)−1 φi| ≤ C(φ),
→0+ x∈(a,b)

then the spectrum of A in the interval (a, b) is purely absolutely continuous. Thus the
estimate (1.8) with j = 0 implies that the spectrum of PR⊥ Lλ PR⊥ acting on RanPR⊥ is
purely absolutely continuous and for λ = 0, this implies that the spectrum of L0 reduced
to RanPR⊥ is purely absolutely continuous. On the finite dimensional part RanPR ∼
= HS ,
the operator L0 is (identified with) LS which has pure point spectrum E0 . Therefore L0
has absolutely continuous spectrum except for the eigenvalues E0 , the same as those of
LS and the eigenprojection Pe of L0 associated to e is given by
Pe = (PS,e ⊗ 1lR )PR ≡ PS,e ⊗ PR ,

(1.12)

where PS,e is the eigenprojection associated to e as an eigenvalue of LS .
Instability of embedded eigenvalues and how to track them. If e is an isolated
eigenvalue of L0 then by standard analytic perturbation theory [13] Lλ has eigenvalues
(s)
Ee (λ) close to e, for λ small. Those eigenvalues coincide with the eigenvalues of the
operator
ePe + λPe IPe − λ2 Pe I(L0 − e)−1 Pe⊥ IPe + O(λ3 ).
(1.13)
4

Each term in the expansion (1.13) is self-adjoint. If e is an embedded eigenvalue of L0
then the reduced resolvent (L0 − e)−1 Pe⊥ in (1.13) is not defined as a bounded operator.
However, its regularization (L0 −e+i)−1 Pe⊥ certainly is, for any  > 0. We may hope that
in a sense, the perturbation expansion (1.13) stays valid also for embedded eigenvalues,
upon regularizing the resolvent and taking  → 0+ . But due to the regularization, the
operator (L0 − e + i)−1 Pe⊥ is not self-adjoint any longer! So according to (1.13), the
second order corrections to the embedded eigenvalue would become complex numbers.
This is, however, not compatible with Lλ being self-adjoint. We may then intuit that for
small nonzero λ, the number m0e of eigenvalues of Lλ close to e might be strictly reduced,
m0e < me , and that this reduction is accounted for by the existence of complex eigenvalues
of the so-called level shift operator
Λe = −Pe IPe⊥ (L0 − e + i0+ )−1 IPe .

(1.14)

Here, (L0 − e + i0+ )−1 is the limit of (L0 − e + i)−1 as  → 0+ , taken in the sense of
the operator norm in the expression (1.14). This mechanism has the following precise
formulation.
Let Q be an orthogonal projection on H and set Q⊥ = 1l − Q. The Feshbach map
applied to an operator A on H is defined by

F(A; Q) = Q A − AQ⊥ (Q⊥ AQ⊥ RanQ⊥ )−1 A Q,
(1.15)
where it is assumed that Q⊥ AQ⊥ RanQ⊥ is invertible. The Feshbach map satisfies the
following isospectrality property: Let a ∈ C be in the resolvent set of the operator
Q⊥ AQ⊥ RanQ⊥ , so that F(A − a; Q) is well defined. Then the isospectrality property
says that a is an eigenvalue of A if and only if zero is an eigenvalue of F(A − a; Q). The
redeeming quality of this mapping is that F(A − a; Q) acts on RanQ, a space smaller than
H (reduction in dimension). Consider now, for z ∈ C− ,


(1.16)
F(Lλ − z; Pe ) = Pe e − z + λI − λ2 IRzPe (λ)Pe⊥ I Pe ,
where RzPe (λ) ≡ (Pe⊥ Lλ Pe⊥ − z)−1 RanPe⊥ is the reduced resolvent. The isospectrality is
not of any good use to analyze the spectrum of Lλ directly, since RzPe (λ) is not defined
for real z. However, one can show (see Theorem A1 of [14] and also Theorem 3.1 below)
that the condition (A2), together with the assumption that
(A3)

IPe is a bounded operator and RanIPe ⊂ D,

(1.17)

imply that the derivatives of order up to two of
z 7→ Pe IRzPe (λ)Pe⊥ IPe
are bounded uniformly in {z ∈ C− : |Rez − e| ≤ g/2}. Here,

g = min |e − e0 | : e, e0 ∈ E0 , e 6= e0 > 0
5

(1.18)

(1.19)

denotes the minimal gap of the eigenvalues of L0 (which is the same as that of LS ). The
Feshbach map (1.16) is then well defined (by continuity) for z ∈ R, |z − e| ≤ g/2. Now
the isospectrality property can be extended to real values of z. Namely, one can show
(see Theorem 5.1 below and also [7, 2, 14]) that any E ∈ R is an eigenvalue of Lλ if and
only if zero is an eigenvalue of F(Lλ − E; Pe ), and that

dimKer(Lλ − E) = dimKer F(Lλ − E; Pe ) .
(1.20)
Due to (1.16), eigenvalues of F(Lλ − E; Pe ) are located in an O(λ) neighbourhood of E0 ,
and hence by isospectrality, so are those of Lλ . The multiplicity of E as an eigenvalue of
Lλ is controlled by (1.20). We assume now
(A4)

Pe IPe = 0,

(1.21)

as this condition does not alter the emergence of complex eigenvalues (because Pe IPe is
self-adjoint). We could dispense with the condition (1.21) by a simple modification of our
arguments. According to (1.14), (1.16), (1.21),
F(Lλ − E; Pe ) = (e − E)Pe + λ2 Λe + O(λ3 ).

(1.22)

As it acts on the me -dimensional space RanPe , the operator Λe has me generally complex
eigenvalues. Since Λe it is a dissipative operator, meaning that
ImΛe = lim Pe I
→0+

Pe⊥
IPe ≥ 0,
(L0 − e)2 + 2

(1.23)

its eigenvalues have non-negative imaginary parts.1 The isospectrality of the Feshbach
(s)
map (1.20) and the expansion (1.22) show that for each eigenvalue Ee (λ) of Lλ , there is
(s)
an eigenvalue ae ∈ R of Λe such that
3
Ee(s) (λ) = e + λ2 a(s)
e + O(λ ).

(1.24)

However, Λe may have real eigenvalues without Lλ having any eigenvalues close to e (for
λ small, nonzero). This is so since the O(λ3 ) term in (1.22) may cause the spectrum of
(1.22) to be non-real. In this case, Lλ does not have any eigenvalues close to e, according
to (1.20). To simplify the analysis, we do not consider this higher order effect. Instead,
(s)
we assume that the real eigenvalues of Λe are in bijection with the eigenvalues Ee (λ) of
Lλ close to e. One way to ensure this is to impose the condition
(A5)

The eigenvalues of Λe are simple and Λe has exactly m0e real eigenvalues.

We recall that m0e , defined before (1.6), is the number of (distinct and simple) eigenvalues
of Lλ close to e, for small λ 6= 0. Assuming Λe to have purely simple spectrum is done for
1

It is sometimes useful to note that the real eigenvalues of Λe are automatically semi-simple as they
lie on the boundary of the numerical range of Λe , see e.g. Proposition 3.2 of [7].

6

convenience of the presentation. This restriction can be removed easily and our approach
still works, as long as Λe is diagonalizable. In some models, it can happen though that
Λe is not diagonalizable at so-called exceptional points of parameters; one then expects a
qualitatively different behaviour of the dynamics (Jordan blocks of Λe cause polynomial
corrections to exponential decay in time). We do not further explore this interesting
aspect here.
The condition (A5) without the simplicity assumption is also called the Fermi Golden
Rule Condition. It ensures that stability or instability of eigenvalues of Lλ is detected at
the lowest order (λ2 ) in the perturbation. In terms of dynamical properties, the condition
(A5) means that metastable states have life-times of O(λ−2 ), as shown in Theorem 2.1.
How to link stable and unstable eigenvalues to the dynamics. We have seen
above that the (partially) stable eigenvalues of Lλ are the real eigenvalues of the level shift
(s)
operators Λe and that the Λe may have eigenvalues ae with strictly positive imaginary
part. We introduced the level shift operators Λe as the second order (λ2 ) contributions in
the Feshbach map, (1.22). The isospectrality property of the Feshbach map then linked
Λe to the spectrum of Lλ . As it turns out, the Feshbach map is also an ingredient in
the block decomposition of an operator H acting on H = RanQ ⊕ RanQ⊥ , where Q is
an orthogonal projection. More precisely, one can readily verify that for any operator H
such that F(H; Q) exists, the following identity holds (see Section 5, in particular (5.5)),

The first component in the 2 × 2 decomposition of (1.25) is that of RanQ, the second
one that of RanQ⊥ . Choosing in (1.25) Q = Pe and H = Lλ − z for z ∈ C\R gives the
decomposition
(Lλ − z)−1 = [F(Lλ − z; Pe )]−1 + B(z) + RzPe (λ),
(1.26)
where B(z) is a term of O(λ), see (3.3). The first term on the right side is the inverse of
the Feshbach map, an operator acting on RanPe and the last term acts on RanPe⊥ . The
resolvent, (1.26), is linked to the propagator via the Fourier-Laplace transform, for w > 0,

Using (1.26) in (1.27) provides a link between the Feshbach map and the dynamics. We
then expand the (inverse) of the first term on the right side of (1.26), F(Lλ − z; Pe ) =
e − z − λ2 Λe + O(|λ|3 + λ2 |z − e|). For z close to e, this links [F(Lλ − z; Pe )]−1 to
(s)
(e − z − λ2 Λe )−1 , which has poles z = e − λ2 ae at the eigenvalues of e − λ2 Λe . Upon
"integration around" those poles, in accordance with (1.27), one can extract the dynamical
2 (s)
factors eit(e−λ ae ) . This procedure works locally, that is, for z close to a fixed e. So we
will subdivide the integration contour in (1.27) into regions close to e ∈ E0 , for each e,
and apply the Feshbach map with the appropriate Pe . On the complement, where z is
7

away from all eigenvalues of L0 , a similar analysis is done using the Feshbach map with
projection PR . This is the outline of the idea, and we refer to Section 3 for the detailed
analysis.

Since

application of our result to the reduced system dynamics, [19].

(s)

(i) The projection operators Qe in (2.3) satisfy Qe Pe = Pe Qe = Qe , where Pe =
(s)
PS,e ⊗ PR , see (1.12). The overlaps hφ, Qe ψi thus give the dynamics of the states
φ, ψ projected onto the finite-dimensional space RanPΩ . The dynamics on the
⊥

infinite-dimensional RanPR⊥ is simply given by eitPR Lλ PR .

(s)
λ2 Imae > 0, since |eit(e+λ ae ) | = e−λ tImae . On the infinite-dimensional part, the
dynamics is also decaying, but only at a polynomial rate 1/t2 , as per (1.10).
(s)

(iii) The asymptotic dynamics for times larger than all the life times (λ2 Imae )−1 and

large enough so that the dissipative term hφ, PR⊥ eitPR Lλ PR PR⊥ ψi ∼ t−2 has decayed
P

(s)
(c.f. (1.10)), is given by hφ, eitLλ ψi ≈ e,s eitEe hφ, Qe ψi + O(|λ|1/4 ), where the
(s)

(s)

sum is over all eigenvalues Ee (λ) of Lλ . If Ee (λ) = 0 is the only eigenvalue of Lλ ,
(s)
then the dynamics relaxes to the final state Qe modulo an error O(|λ|1/4 ).
(iv) The quasi-static and dissipative parts mentioned in (1.5) are the sums and the
⊥
⊥
term hφ, PR⊥ eitPR Lλ PR PR⊥ ψi of (2.3), respectively. The picture (1.5) is reminiscent of
properties of solutions to dispersive partial differential equations, which split into a
dispersive wave plus a part converging towards an invariant manifold [20, 23]. In
our case, after the decay of the dissipative term, the dynamics first approaches the
(s)
quasi-static manifold spanned by the Qe for all e, s. The orbits stay close to the
quasi-static manifold for times up to ∼ 1/λ2 , after which the dynamics moves to
(s)
the final, invariant manifold spanned by the Qe with e ∈ E0 and s ∈ Seosc .

(v) The approach we take to prove Theorem 2.1 is similar to [14]. In that paper, an
expansion of overlaps of the form (1.4) was given as a sum of a main part plus a
remainder, similar to (2.3). The remainder of [14] converges to zero in the limit of
large times, but it is not shown to be small in λ. In the current work, the remainder
is small in λ for all times (2.4), but it does not converge to zero for large times.
This means, incidentally, that the main term of the current work is simpler the one
of [14]. Indeed, the current main term is a second order approximation (λ2 ) of that
of [14]. The result of [14] is not suitable for proving the validity of the Markovian
approximation, but the current result here is.
Uncorrelated initial states. For vectors of the form ψ = ψS ⊗ ΩR , φ = φS ⊗ ΩR
⊥
⊥
we have K(φ, ψ) = kφS k kψS k (see (2.15) below). The term hφ, PR⊥ eitPR Lλ PR PR⊥ ψi in (2.3)
(s)
vanishes and the inner product in hφ, Qe ψi can be seen as that of the system Hilbert
(s)
space alone, because the Qe act on RanPR = HS ⊗ CΩR which is identified with HS . We
introduce the operators

where each Me acts on RanPS,e , the eigenspace of LS associated to the eigenvalue e. Again,
the operator M (λ) is viewed as an operator acting on the system Hilbert space HS alone.
By construction, the operators M (λ) and LS commute, and M (0) = LS . The functional

We then obtain the following result directly from (2.3).

t ≥ 0,
hφS ⊗ ΩR , eitLλ ψS ⊗ ΩR iHS ⊗HR − hφS , eitM (λ) ψS iHS ≤ C|λ|1/4 kφS k kψS k.

(2.7)

This corollary is the starting point for a proof that the Markovian approximation is valid
for all times, which we give in [19]. We show that M (λ) gives rise to a completely positive
trace-preserving semigroup acting on system density matrices, which coincides with the
well-known Gorini-Kossakovski-Sudarshan-Lindblad semigroup [1, 4, 18].
Parameter dependence. We take some care in estimating c0 , C and K appearing
in Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 in terms of various parameters, as we explain now. The
analysis is based on a perturbation theory (λ small) and the corrections of the spectrum

are governed by the level shift operators Λe , whose spectral decomposition is given in
(2.1). To quantify the perturbation theory, we introduce the quantities

Proposition 2.3 (Parameter dependence of c0 , C, K) The constants c0 , C of Theo4/3
rem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 can be written as c0 = c0 λ0 and C = C 0 κ0 , where c0 , C 0 do
not depend on λ, g, a, α, κ, δ and λ0 , κ0 are given in (2.14) and (2.13), respectively. The
constant K in (2.4), which is a function on D × D, is given by (2.15).
Remark. The parameter κ1 , (2.12), is defined in terms of the function C1 , (1.8). The
latter describes the dissipative nature of the interacting dynamics and, a priori, depends
on λ. However, the dissipation is due to the nature of the environment alone and so in
applications, one can bound κ1 uniformly in λ, for small enough λ (see [19]). See also the
point (ii) in the discussion of condition (A2) above. In this sense, κ1 and thus λ0 , are
independent of λ.
Connections with earlier work. It is intuitively plausible that eigenvectors of
L0 associated to an unstable eigenvalue e, describing bound states of a quantum system
for λ = 0, turn into 'almost-bound states' for small λ 6= 0. This mechanism is known
as metastability in the theory of Schrödinger operators, where the Hilbert space would
not have the structure (1.1), but rather, L0 would be the kinetic energy operator of N
particles and I would be an (interaction) potential. In that setup, initial states close to
the original eigenstate stay bound (e.g. spatially localized) for a long time, but eventually
decay for large times, see e.g. [22, 10, 11] and references therein.
More recently, a dynamical resonance theory for metastability has been developed for
open quantum systems [16, 14, 15, 18]. This is the setup described by (1.1)-(1.3) and
L0 is the generator of dynamics of an uncoupled system-reservoir complex, for instance a
few spins (qubits) for the system plus a field of oscillators for the reservoir. Eigenstates
of the uncoupled system become typically unstable when the spins start to interact with
the bosonic excitations. The coupling leads to irreversible effects, such as decoherence
and thermalization. The dynamics of open quantum systems is an important topic in
the study of quantum theory and the literature on phenomenological models used in
physics, chemistry and biology is huge and constantly growing [3, 21]. Often the analysis
of open systems is analyzed by perturbation theory in which the control of the remainder
is not mathematically controllable (say the Born, Markov, rotating wave approximations
for the Markovian approximation). The approach of [16, 14, 15, 18] is mathematically
rigorous. It is based on the algebraic and spectral framework of [12, 2, 9, 17] developed
for a proof of 'return to equilibrium'. The realization that this framework can be used
to give a detailed analysis of the evolution of the reduced densty matrix, beyond the
asymptotic property of convergence to equilibrium, came in [16]. Later in [14, 15, 18] is
was shown that one can extract the main term of the dynamics and show that it is a
completely positive trace preserving semigroup. Technique-wise, the paper [14] is closest
to the present work. However, as explained in discussion point (iv) after Theorem 2.1,
the results of [14] cannot be used to show the Markovian approximation. On the other
hand, the validity of the Markovian approximation was proven in [15, 18], but only under
an analyticity assumption as explained in discussion point (iii) after Assumption (A2)
above. In the present work, we make a substantial change to the methods of [14] to
12

develop a somewhat general time-dependent perturbation theory which allows us to show
(in [19]) the validity of the Markovian approximation under the weak regularity condition
(A2). This improvement was mentioned before in [18]. It is important as it allows for the
treatment of reservoirs with polynomially decaying correlations instead of exponentially
decaying ones, as was needed in [15, 18].

Proof of Theorem 2.1

We are presenting the core strategy in Section 3.1. It involves estimates which we derive in
Sections 3.3 and 3.4. We then collect the estimates and implement the outlined strategy
in Section 3.5. As we explained after Theorem 2.1, our approach is similar to that of
[14]. However, in order to be able to show that the remainder is small in λ for all times,
(2.4), we need to substantially modify the analysis of [14]. The main alteration is the
introduction of two new energy scales η and θ which allow for a more detailed estimation
of the resolvent. See also Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.
Notational convention. For X, Y ≥ 0, we write X ≺ Y to mean that there is a
constant C independent of the coupling constant λ as well as the parameters g, a, α, δ, κ,
such that X ≤ CY . (Recall the definitions (1.19), (2.8)-(2.11) of those parameters.)

3.1

Strategy

Given an orthogonal projection Q on H we set Q⊥ = 1l − Q and we denote the resolvent
and reduced resolvent operators by
Rz (λ) = (Lλ − z)−1

and

RzQ (λ) = (Q⊥ Lλ Q⊥ − z)−1 RanQ⊥ .

The resolvent representation of the propagator is

hφ, e ψi =

(3.1)

(3.2)

valid for any w > 0 if either of ψ or φ belong to Dom(L) (see [8]). Given an orthogonal
projection Q, the resolvent has a decomposition into a sum of three parts:2 a part acting
on RanQ, one acting on RanQ⊥ and one part mixing these subspaces. This decomposition
reads, for z ∈ C\R,
Rz (λ) = F(z)−1 + B(z) + RzQ (λ).
(3.3)
Here, F is the Feshbach map (1.15),
F(z) ≡ F(L − z; Q) = Q(L − z − LQ⊥ RzQ (λ)L)Q.
2

Reminiscent of "... est omnis divisa in partes tres ...", [5]

13

(3.4)

The operator B(z) in (3.3) is given by
B(z) = −F(z)−1 QLRzQ − RzQ LQF(z)−1 + RzQ LQF(z)−1 QLRzQ .

(3.5)

Here and in what follows, it is convenient to simply write RzQ for RzQ (λ). The existence of
F(z)−1 is automatic, this operator equals QRz (λ)Q, see (3.3). It is elementary to establish
the relation (3.3), see Section 5 for more detail.
Our strategy is to partition the integration contour in (3.2) into segments and apply
(3.3) with suitable projections Q on each segment. To describe the partition, fix an
η > 0. It will be chosen as a certain positive power of |λ| later on, so η is a small
parameter (relative to the eigenvalue gap g of L0 , (1.19)). For every eigenvalue e of L0
define the segment (see also Fig. 2)


Ge = x − iw : |x − e| ≤ η
and set G∞ = x − iw : dist(x, E0 ) > η ,
(3.6)
where w > 0 is the parameter in (3.2) and E0 is the set of all eigenvalues of L0 .

(3.7)

On Ge we will apply the Feshbach map with projection Q = Pe , (1.12), and on G∞ we
use the projection Q = PR , (1.7). Accordingly, it is important that we have dissipative
bounds on the reduced resolvents, i.e., the following local limiting absorption principles,
which follow from the global ones given in (1.8), (1.9).

Furthermore, imposing the constraints
|λ|κ1 ≺ kIPR k and λ2 κ1 ≺ min{1, g 3 }

(3.14)

gives from (3.13) the simple bound,
κ2 ≺ κ1 .

Cheat sheet

We keep track of several constants during the estimates to follow. The following cheat
sheet is presented for the convenience of the reader.

3.3

Analysis of Je (t)

Fix an eigenvalue e ∈ E0 of LS and choose Q = Pe in the Feshbach decompositon (3.3),
where Pe is the eigenprojection (1.12). The Feshbach operator (3.4) reads
F(z) = e − z + λ2 Ae (z, λ),

Ae (z, λ) = −Pe IRzPe (λ)IPe .

(3.16)

For z = e and λ = 0, Ae (z, λ) reduces to the level shift operator Λe . We show in Lemma
4.1 below that for z ∈ C− with |z −e| not too large and λ not too large, Ae (z, λ) has simple
eigenvalues (a property inherited from Λe ) and we denote the spectral representation by

The first two terms of the right side of (3.72), when used in (3.71), are estimated by
taking into account that the second factor on the right side of (3.71) is ≺ 1 due to (3.38).
However, the last term on the right side of (3.72) has a singularity in z which must be
removed by integrating over Ge . To do this, we write

Proof of Proposition 3.3. Consider two adjacent eigenvalues e < e0 of LS and set
e
G∞
= {x − iw : e + η ≤ x ≤ e0 − η}.

(3.86)

We introduce a new small parameter θ > 0 and set D1 = {x − iw : e + η ≤ x ≤ e + η + θ}
0
and D2 = {x − iw : e + η + θ ≤ x ≤ e + e 2−e }, as depicted in Fig. 4.

Estimating D10 of (3.87). The main bound we prove is given in (3.95). We have, in
the sense of operators acting on RanPR ,

We consider now z ∈ D1 ∪ D2 (the region closer to e than to e0 , see Fig. 4). By inserting

(LS − z)−1 k ≤ 2/g (see (1.19)
, using that Pe = PS,e ⊗ PR and that kPS,e
1lS = PS,e + PS,e

By (4.2) we have kPe IRzPR IPe − Pe I(RePR |λ=0 )IPe k ≺ κ1 (|z − e| + |λ|). Thus, taking into
account the definition (1.14) of the level shift operator Λe and using that PR⊥ IPe = Pe⊥ IPe ,
we have

kPe IRzPR IPe − Λe k ≺ κ1 |z − e| + |λ| .
(3.91)
The reason for introducing the new small parameter θ (see Fig. 4), is that for z ∈ D1 , the
right hand side of (3.91) is bounded above by κ1 (η + θ + |λ|). It then follows from (3.91)
and (3.90) that ∀z ∈ D1 ,

Next we find a bound for the integral on the left side of (3.92) with D1 replaced by

k(LS − z)−1 PR IRzPR IPR (LS − z)−1 k ≺ κ1 (η + θ)−2 . Consequently, since |D2 | < g/2, we

Estimating D20 of (3.87). Our main etimate is given in (3.102). According to (3.5),
the term B(z) gives three contributions. The ones involving only one resolvent RzPR are
all estimated in the same way as follows. We have for all z ∈ C− (use (1.8)),
hφ, F(z)−1 PR IRzPR ψi ≺ max hφ, F(z)−1 φj ⊗ ΩR i C1 (Iφj ⊗ ΩR , ψ).

According to (3.89), the main term of F(z)−1 is (LS − z)−1 the norm of which is bounded

The same upper bound is achieved for the term involving RzPR λIPR F(z)−1 in (3.5). To
deal with the term in (3.5) involving the resolvent twice, we use the bound

the ae (e, λ) by ae and the Qe (e, λ) by Qe and by doing this, we incur an error

(s)
of Lλ associated to the eigenvalue Ee (λ) by Πe,λ , we have (in the strong sense) Πe,λ =
(s)
limε→0+ iε(Lλ − Ee (λ) + iε)−1 and by (3.3)

According to (3.35) we have e − Ee (λ) = −λ2 ae (Ee (λ), λ) and it is readily seen that
the limit ε → 0+ vanishes for the terms s0 6= s in the sum, because the denominator stays
bounded. We conclude that

Along the way, in getting to (3.143), we have made several smallness conditions on λ. They
come from (3.19): |λ|κ4 ≺ a, |λ|3/4 (α + |λ|κ4 ) ≺ 1, from Proposition 3.3: |λ|3/4 κ1 ≺ 1,
from Theorem 3.1: λ2 κ1 ≺ g, from Lemma 4.1: |λ|κ1 κ2 ≺ δ and from estimate (3.14):
|λ|κ1 ≺ kIPR k, λ2 κ1 ≺ min{1, g 4 }. They are summarized as follows (see also (4.18))

Proposition 2.3.

Proof of Theorem 3.1 and properties of Ae(z, λ)

4.1

Regularity of the resolvent, proof of Theorem 3.1

In this section, we simply write RzQ for RzQ (λ). We also identify the range of PR with HS ,
c.f. (1.7), so that an operator PR APR is viewed as an operator on HS . For any φ, ψ ∈ HS ,
z ∈ C− , k = 0, . . . , 3 we have (recall that the φm are an orthonormal eigenbasis of LS , see
after (2.12))

Proof of Theorem 3.1.

The proof follows [14], where it is shown that the suprema in (3.8), (3.9) and (3.11) are
finite without giving a specific bound (3.10). The key idea is to relate RzPe and RzPR .
Introducing a new operator K = Pe⊥ LPe⊥ + iPe we have
RzPe = Pe⊥ (K − z)−1 Pe⊥ .
An application of the Feshbach map (5.4) with projection Q = PR yields

where P̄e = Pe⊥ PR = 1l[LS 6= e] ⊗ PR . The operator Fz and its inverse are given by (use
that Pe⊥ PR⊥ = PR⊥ and PR⊥ Pe = 0, so RzPR = (PR⊥ KPR⊥ − z)−1 RanPR⊥ ),
Fz = (i − z)Pe ⊕ P̄e (LS − z − λ2 PR IRzPR IPR )P̄e

(4.5)
(4.6)

Combining (4.3) with (4.4) yields four terms when estimating hφ, RzPe ψi. Those terms
arise when we multiply out the matrices in (4.4). One of the terms is hφ, F−1
z ψi. For
|z − e| ≤ g/2 and since kPR IRzPR IPR k ≺ κ1 by (4.2), we obtain from (4.5) that
kF−1
z k ≺ max{1, 1/g},

(4.7)

|hφ, F−1

(4.8)

provided λ2 κ1 /g ≺ 1. Thus

39

Another term we have to estimate is

(4.9)

A third term is of similar form and has the same upper bound (4.9). The fourth term to
estimate is

≺ C1 (φ, ψ) + λ2 max{1, 1/g} max C1 (φ, Iφm ⊗ ΩR )C1 (ψ, Iφm ⊗ ΩR ).

(4.10)

Collecting the estimates (4.8), (4.9), (4.10) shows the bound (3.8) for j = 0. To get a
bound for the derivatives |∂zj hφ, RzPe ψi| we again use the representation (4.3) and (4.4).

then readily follows.
To prove the bound (3.9) we proceed in the same manner, using (4.3) and (4.4).
The λ derivative of the resolvent RzPR is controlled by (1.9) and we use (c.f. (4.5))
k∂λ Fz k = kλP̄e IRzPR I P̄e − λ2 P̄e I(∂λ RzPR )I P̄e k ≺ (|λ| + λ2 )κ1 ≺ 1. The bound (3.9)
follows.
Finally, to show (3.11), we use the Feshbach representation (5.4) with Q = PR . We
proceed in the same way as above in this proof to get the result.


4.2

The operators Ae (z, λ)

For every e ∈ E0 and z ∈ C− we set (c.f. (3.16))
Ae (z, λ) = −Pe IRzPe (λ)IPe ≡ −Pe IRzPe IPe .

with |zn − e| ≤ g/2, converging to some x ∈ R (so |x − e| ≤ g/2). Then by (4.13),
40

Ae (zn , λ) is Cauchy and thus converges to a limit which we call Ae (x, λ). Using (4.13)
it is easy to see that the limit Ae (x, λ) is independent of the sequence zn . We note
that the level shift operator (1.14) equals Λe = Ae (e, 0). Similarly to (4.13) we derive
kAe (z, λ) − Ae (z, 0)k ≺ λ2 κ1 κ2 and hence

kAe (z, λ) − Λe k ≺ κ2 |z − e| + |λ| .
(4.14)
The bound (4.14) is the starting point for conventional perturbation theory. Recall the
definitions of the spectral gap of the level shift operators δ and the maximal operator
norm κ given in (2.10) and (2.11), respectively.
Lemma 4.1 Suppose that z ∈ C− and |z − e|, |λ| ≺

Corollary 4.2 The maps z 7→ Qe (z, λ) and z 7→ ae (z, λ) extend by continuity to
z = x ∈ R provided |x − e|, |λ| ≺ κδ2 κ min{1, 1/κ}. Moreover, the estimates (4.16) and
(4.17) are valid if either or both of z, z 0 are real.

Let zn be a sequence in C− with |zn − e| <

Next, again by (4.16), kQe (z, λ) − Qe (x, λ)k = limn kQe (z, λ) − Qe (zn , λ)k exists and
is ≺ κ3 |z − x|. If z = x0 ∈ R then approximate it by zn0 ∈ C− and the above argument
(s)
works the same. The argument is also the same for the ae (x, λ).

Let Ce be the circle centered at ae with radius δ/2, then d(ζ, spec(Λe )) = δ/2 for ζ ∈ Ce

Feshbach decomposition of the resolvent

Let Q be an orthogonal projection on a Hilbert space H. In the decomposition H =
RanQ ⊕ RanQ⊥ an operator O has the block decomposition


A B
O=

(5.1)

where A = QOQ RanQ , B = QAQ⊥ RanQ⊥ and so on. We want to find the block
decomposition of O−1 ,

assuming that D−1 exists. Multiplying blockwise the equation OO−1 = 1l yields the four
equations
AX + BZ = 1lQ ,

AY = −BW,

CX = −DZ,

CY + DW = 1lQ⊥ .

(5.3)

Thus Z = −D−1 CX and W = D−1 − D−1 CY . Then AX + BZ = AX − BD−1 CX = 1lQ ,
so X = (A − BD−1 C)−1 . Also, AY = −BW = −BD−1 + BD−1 CY so (A − BD−1 C)Y =
−BD−1 and hence Y = −XBD−1 . In conclusion,

In the case O = H − z, for a self-adjoint H (like H = Lλ ) and z 6∈ R, we have indeed that
D = Q⊥ (H − z)Q⊥ RanQ⊥ is invertible. Also, A − BD−1 C = F(H − z; Q) and hence the
sum of X, Y, Z and W give the right hand side of (3.3).
Theorem 5.1 (Weak isospectrality of the Feshbach map) Let H be a self-adjoint
operator and let E ∈ R and suppose that the function z 7→ QHQ⊥ RzQ Q⊥ HQ is continuously differentiable on z ∈ C− ∪ {E}. Denote the value of F(H − z; Q) at z = E by
F(H − E; Q). Then we have the following:
(1) E is an eigenvalue of H if and only if zero is an eigenvalue of F(H − E; Q).
(2) If HΦ = EΦ, then φ = QΦ satisfies F(H − E; Q)φ = 0.
(3) If F(H − E; Q)φ = 0 then the limit of RzQ Q⊥ HQφ as z ∈ C− , z → E, exists.

Denote it by RE
Q HQφ. Then Φ = φ − RE
Q HQφ satisfies HΦ = EΦ.
Note: It is easy to see that the correspondence Φ ↔ φ in Theorem 5.1 is a bijection
between the kernels of H − E and of F(H − E; Q).
Proof of Theorem 5.1. The implication ⇒ in (1) together with (2) is not hard to prove,
see Proposition B2 of [14]. We give now a proof of ⇐ in (1) and (3). One may write the
resolvent using the above components in matrix form as

(H − z) =

RzQ
where RzQ = (Q⊥ HQ⊥ − z)−1 RanQ⊥ . This relation can actually be verified simply by
multiplying out the matrices. As the two outside matrices in (5.4) are both invertible, we
obtain for z ∈ C such that RzQ exists:

To discuss domain questions, assume for simplicity that dim Q < ∞ and that Q⊥HQ

φ
is bounded. Then the relation (5.5) holds when applied to vectors of the form
χ
⊥
⊥
with χ ∈ Dom(Q HQ ). Moreover, each single product operation of the matrices in the
threefold matrix product in (5.5) makes sense individually (is well defined, when the right
side is applied to vectors of the indicated form).
Due to the assumption of the theorem, QHQ⊥ RzQ Q⊥ HQ has a limit when z = E − i
with  → 0+ . Call this limit QHQ⊥ (H̄ − E)−1 Q⊥ HQ (the overlined H̄ indicates that H
is restricted to the range of Q⊥ ). Then lim→0+ F(H − E − i; Q) = Q(H − E − HQ⊥ (H̄ −
E)−1 Q⊥ H)Q ≡ F(H − E; Q), where the last symbol is again a definition. Suppose that
Q
φ = Qφ is such that F(H − E; Q)φ = 0. For  > 0, define χ = −Q⊥ RE−i
Q⊥ HQφ. Then
applying equation (5.5) with z = E − i gives
(H − E + i)(φ + χ ) = F(H − E + i; Q)φ −→ 0 as  → 0+ .

(5.6)

We show below that χ has a limit χ as  → 0+ . It then follows from (5.6) that lim→0+ (H−
E)(φ + χ ) = 0. Since H is a closed operator, the vector φ + χ is in the domain of H and
(H − E)(φ + χ) = 0.
We now show that χ is Cauchy. This part of the analysis is inspired by [DJ], Theorem
3.8. Denote by p the spectral projection of F(H − E; Q) associated to the eigenvalue 0. In
particular, pφ = φ. Since F(H − E; Q) is a dissipative operator and 0 is on the boundary
of its numerical range, 0 is a semisimple eigenvalue and p is the orthogonal projection onto
the kernel of F(H − E; Q), in particular, p∗ = p. First we show that z 7→ pHRzQ Hp is a
continuously differentiable function of z ∈ C− ∪C+ ∪{E}. (Note: QHRzQ HQ, without the
restriction to the range of p, is not even continuous at E, because the limits coming from
C+ and C− do not coincide.) We point out that z 7→ QHQ⊥ RzQ Q⊥ HQ is continuously
differentiable on z ∈ C+ ∪ {E}, which follows by taking the adjoint in the assumption of
Q
the theorem. Next, we have pF(H − E; Q)p = 0 and hence p(H − E)p = pHRE−i0
Hp,

Q
and taking the adjoint gives p(H − E)p = pHRE+i0+ Hp. So we have

(5.7)

which shows that z 7→ pHRzQ Hp is continuous at z = E and its value at z = E is selfadjoint. Next, let γ(τ ), τ ∈ [−1, 1], be a smooth curve in C− ∪{E} which is tangent to the
Q
point E ∈ C, satisfying γ(0) = E and γ 0 (0) = 1. Then τ 7→ pHRγ(τ
) Hp is continuously
Q
Q
d

differentiable at τ = 0 and dτ |τ =0 Im pHRγ(τ ) Hp = Im pH(RE−i0+ ) Hp. On the other
hand, this last derivative has to be equal to zero for the following reason. For all τ we have
Q
Q

Im pHRγ(τ

was > 0 or < 0 this would contradict the fact that Im pHRγ(τ
) Hp ≤ 0. Since this

derivative vanishes, we get Im pH(RE−i0+ ) Hp = 0, so pH(RE−i0+ )2 Hp is self-adjoint,
Q

which means that pH(RE−i0

(5.10)

Since z 7→ pHRzQ Hp is a continuously differentiable function of z ∈ C− ∪ C+ ∪ {E}, the
right hand side of (5.10) converges to zero as , 0 → 0. Thus χ converges.
