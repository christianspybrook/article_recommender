A covariant nonlocal Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (nlNJL) model, used to describe the color superconducting quark matter phase in hybrid neutron stars, is parametrized with two free parameters, the
dimensionless vector and diquark coupling strengths ηV and ηD . Changing the values of these parameters results in different equations of state (EoS) with varying stiffness. On the other hand, the
constant-sound-speed (CSS) model is a frequently used, simple quark matter equation of state with
three parameters: the slope parameter A, the speed of sound cs and the bag pressure B. We show
that the CSS model EoS provides an excellent fit to that of the nlNJL model. This work provides a
simple functional form for the mapping between the parameter spaces of these two models, i.e. the
ηD − ηV and A − c2s − B parameter sets. These results allow for a simplified description of the quark
matter phase in neutron stars and for an interpretation of hybrid neutron star phenomenology in
terms of parameters of a Lagrangian quark matter model.

INTRODUCTION

Recent investigations of neutron star (NS) properties
support the idea that deconfined quark matter builds the
cores not only of the heaviest known NSs [1], but even of
all NSs in the presently observed mass range [2].
In order to draw such conclusions, the equation of state
(EoS) for the quark matter phase in NSs is needed. The
best candidates to provide a reliable quark matter EoS
under neutron star conditions are those effective models
that share key features with low-energy QCD, such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the resulting lowenergy theorems as the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner and
Goldberger–Treiman relations. The most popular chiral
effective model that reasonable fulfills these requirements
is the Nambu Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [3, 4], that was
developed in order to understand the generation of a mass
gap for fermions (nucleons) in analogy to the energy gap
in the BCS model of electronic superconductivity, based
on local four-fermion interactions. With the introduction
of quarks as the fundamental fermionic degrees of freedom of strongly interacting matter, the model has been

reformulated on that level of description, see [5–11] for
early reviews and [12] for the NJL model analysis of dense
quark matter.
The local NJL-type models have a major caveat: the
absence of confinement. A local four-fermion coupling is
incompatible with the strong coupling at large-distances
that is phenomenologically established by hadron spectroscopy and lattice QCD simulations of the free (potential) energy between static (heavy) color charges that
exhibits a funnel-shaped interquark potential. One way
to bring effective low-energy QCD models closer to capturing also the confining nature of the strong interaction
at large distances is the generalization of the local fourfermion coupling to a nonlocal four-point function. A
first step in this direction has been done with so-called
"bilocal QCD" models [13, 14] which could successfully
address low-energy QCD and hadron phenomenology on
the basis of a nonperturbative model gluon propagator
[15] or a relativistic generalization of confining potential
models [16].
The next step towards the modern formulation of the
nonlocal chiral quark model (in the following denoted as
"nlNJL") was to generalize the interaction model from
a two-point function to a four-point function, following
two schemes. The first one defines the nonlocal interac-

2
tion similar to the relativistic S-matrix with its dependence on the kinematic Mandelstam variables and assumes separability (a product ansatz) of pairwise relative momenta [17]. This scheme has later been denoted
as one-gluon exchange (OGE) model. For the model
formfactors the ansatz has been made of instantaneous
(energy-independent) functions that depend on the relative three-momenta only. In this way, the evaluation of
thermodynamic properties of the model within the imaginary time formalism became straightforward because the
Matsubara summations could still be performed analytically as in the original NJL model which was recovered
for a step function as the formfactor. Using smooth functions as formfactors of the nonlocality resulted in a lowering of the psudocritical temperature of the chiral restoration, closer to the results from lattice QCD [17]. The
second scheme, denoted as instanton-liquid model (ILM),
was built using a simple product ansatz for the formfactors that were attached to each of the four fermion "legs"
[18]. A comprehensive overview over the nonlocal chiral
quark models in this early era has been given by Georges
Ripka in his book [19], where formal details and more
references can be found.
With the extension to rank-2 separable gluon propagator models, and using formfactors depending on the
4-momentum, a close correspondence to the DysonSchwinger equation approach could be established [20].
The finite-temperature extension led to a dramatic reduction of the chiral restoration temperature [21] which recently has been found in lattice QCD simulations as Tc0 =
132+3
−6 MeV in the chiral limit [22]. When coupling the
nonlocal chiral quark dynamics to a gluon background
field within the Polyakov-loop extension of the model
(see [23] for the details in case of the local NJL model,
where besides adding gluonic degrees of freedom at finite temperatures confinement is mimicked), acceptable
values and systematics for the pseudocritical temperature of QCD could be obtained [24, 25] and thermodynamic instabilities associated with complex-conjugated
mass poles could be largely cured [26].
Another advantage of using covariant formfactors in
the nlNJL model is that the momentum dependence of
the quark mass as well as the wave function renormalization factor of the quark propagator can be described
in accordance with lattice QCD simulations [27]. Since
the nonperturbative low-energy interaction of the nlNJL
model can be calibrated using lattice QCD simulations,
one has a serious basis to extend studies of thermo-

dynamic properties from the temperature axis into the
whole phase diagram including high baryochemical potentials where no lattice QCD simulations are available
because of the severe sign problem. Using the nlnJL
model with realistic formfactors, the position of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram has been obtained for
temperatures below 130 MeV [28, 29], a prediction that
can be investigated in the upcoming heavy-ion collision
√
experiments with collision energies sN N ∼ 3 − 6 GeV,
e.g., at the NICA facility of JINR Dubna, or in the fixedtarget experiment at RHIC, see Fig. 14 of Ref. [30]. A
recent detailed review on nlNJL models and their applications to studies of matter under extreme conditions is
given in [31].
In the present work we want to study the EoS of quark
matter in NSs at vanishing temperature. A first application of the covariant nlNJL model has been given
in [32], where a simple Gaussian formfactor was used
and only the scalar-pseudoscalar meson interaction channel has been included. It could be shown that such a
model with two quark flavors is equivalent to a thermodynamic bag model with a bag pressure B = 81.3
MeV/fm3 . The strange quark flavor appeared sequentially at a higher density and rendered the corresponding neutron star unstable against gravitational collapse
for masses above 1.62 M⊙ . In order to describe stars
with masses above 2 M⊙ as required by recent neutron
star observations [33], one has to include a repulsive vector meson interaction channel1 . In hybrid star models
the transition to such a quark matter phase occurs only
at rather high densities, close to the maximum mass of
the sequence. As it is known from studies using the local NJL model, the simultaneous addition of a scalar diquark interaction channel leads to the effect of diquark
condensation (color superconductivity) which pushes the
onset of quark deconfinement to lower densities and results in quark matter cores for neutron stars with typical
masses of ∼ 1.4M⊙ [35, 36]. The situation is similar for
the covariant nlNJL model where increasing the diquark
coupling results in a lowering of the onset density for
the chiral restoration transition [37]. Correspondingly, a
phenomenologically satisfactory situation occurs for the
hybrid neutron star EoS when a repulsive vector and diquark interaction channel is included to the covariant nlNJL model [38] since it develops an early deconfinement

We note that in the local limit such a model has been introduced
as "vBag model" [34].

transition to a stiff color superconducting quark matter
phase.
Consequently, we will use in this study the covariant nlNJL model in the OGE scheme that is parameterized with the dimensionless vector and diquark coupling
strengths (ηV and ηD ), given as ratios of the vector and
diquark couplings, GV and GD , to the scalar coupling
constant GS , respectively. The values of these input parameters, however, are not known from first principles.
While the original version of the nlNJL model is formulated with constant, density-independent coefficients,
in Refs. [39, 40] density-dependent coefficients have been
introduced in such a way that the results of a recent relativistic density-functional approach to quark matter [41]
could be reproduced. The applicability of both versions
of nlNJL model in constructing the phase transition from
hypernuclear matter to deconfined quark matter has laso
been investigated [42, 43].
The microscopic approach of the nlNJL model has the
advantage that it allows to relate the spectrum of observable NS properties to the ranges of ηV and ηD parameters in the Lagrangian of an effective low-energy
QCD model (for details, see [44]). It involves, however,
time-consuming numerical routines for solving the selfconsistent nonlocal mean field equations together with
an extrapolation procedure at high densities. For this
reason, we explore the possibility to mimic the nlNJL
results with simpler approach, the constant-sound-speed
(CSS) model [45, 46].
The CSS approach is widely used in the literature,
in particular, for the classification [45] and systematics
[47, 48] of hybrid neutron stars. Among the applications
of the CSS model is also the investigation of the third and
fourth families of compact stars for which stable branches
have been verified as well [49–51]. The work of Ref. [46]
demonstrates the possibility for NJL model-based approaches to color-superconducting cold quark matter to
be well approximated by CSS parameterization. It was
shown that the EoS for quark matter developed for the
nonlocal separable NJL model with formfactors depending on the three-momentum in [52, 53] can be well fitted
with the CSS model.
It is also worth mentioning that the CSS extrapolation becomes necessary for nlNJL models of certain values of ηV and ηD parameters due to the limitation of its
covariant formfactor realization [37] to chemical potentials up to ∼ 1600 MeV. However, we would like to map
the nlNJL EoS to the CSS EoS for the whole range of

chemical potentials in the quark matter phase, and not
only for μB > 1600 MeV, as it was previously done [44].
This mapping would enable a replacement of the complicated quark matter EoS by a simple model which gives
the EoS of quark matter not only in the two-flavor colorsuperconducting (2SC) phase but also at higher densities
for the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase.
The main idea of this work is to provide a simple functional form that enables a mapping between the two parameter spaces, the nLNJL model parameters ηV and ηD
and the parameters of the CSS model: the slope parameter A, the squared speed of sound c2s and the bag pressure
B. With the simplified description of the quark phase in
hybrid NSs, its EoS would become easier to handle and
would at the same time have strong microphysical justification.
The structure of the present paper is as follows: in Sec.
II we introduce the formulations of both nlNJL and CSS
models and their parameters, along with an additional
phenomenological EoS of Alford [54] for comparison. In
Sec. III the functional dependence between the two parameter sets is found and parameter mapping between
the two models is discussed. Finally, the main conclusion are given in Sec. IV.

For the microphysical description of the quark matter phase we consider a chiral quark model that includes nonlocal separable interactions and can be considered as a nonlocal extension of the NJL model (nlNJL).
We employ the two-flavor SU (2)f model, developed in

The inclusion of the scalar diquark channel together
with the repulsive vector interaction channel, plays an
important role in the phenomenology of hybrid EoS of
compact stars.
The diquark condensate gives rise to color superconductivity (2SC) and is responsible for lowering the onset
of the phase transition from the phase with broken chiral
symmetry to the 2SC phase. The vector interaction induces a stiffening behaviour in the EoS, that is essential
to reach compact stars masses above 2M⊙ . Systematic
investigation of hybrid NS properties reveals [36, 44] that
phenomenological constraints from mass and radius measurements are optimally fulfilled when an increase in the
diquark coupling is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the vector coupling.
The model includes three input parameters: mc (current quark mass), p0 (effective momentum scale) and GS
(coupling constant). They are determined as to reproduce the pion mass and decay constant as well as the
chiral condensate in the vacuum, at vanishing temperature and densities. The two remaining coupling constants GS and GV are driving the terms that, after
bosonization, give rise to the color superconducting gap
and the vector meson mean field. The dimensionless ratios ηD = GD /GS and ηV = GV /GS are free parameters. From a Fierz rearrangement of the OGE interactions one obtains ηD = 3/4 and ηV = 1/2 that could
serve as an orientation for the values of these parameters in the vacuum. There is no precise derivation of
effective couplings from QCD, as we consider here the
strongly nonperturbative low-energy regime. Moreover,

one has to expect that these couplings could be subject
to a medium dependence. However, ηD values larger
∗
than ηD
= (3/2)m/(m − mc ) may lead to color symmetry breaking in the vacuum [55] (where m stands for
the dressed mass and mc for the current quark mass).
In the present work we consider a window of values
for ηD and ηV that was also explored in previous works
Ref. [36, 39, 56].

As we intend to describe the behaviour of quark matter
in the cores of NSs, we have to take into account the
presence of leptons (electrons and muons) which we include into the thermodynamic potential as free relativistic Fermi gases. In addition, we have to consider that
the stellar matter satisfies the following conditions: equilibrium under weak interactions (chemical equilibrium)
as well as color and electric charge neutrality. As a consequence, it can be seen that the six different chemical
potentials μf c (depending on the two quark flavors u and
d and quark colors r, g and b) in Eq. (7) are not independent from each other and can be written in terms of three
independent quantities: the baryonic chemical potential
μ, the electron chemical potential μe and a color chemical
potential μ8 . Basically, for each value of μ we solve selfconsistently the gap equations (8), complemented with
the conditions for β-equilibrium and electric charge and
color charge neutrality (details of the calculation can be
found in the Appendix of Ref. [38]).
In the present work, we consider a Gaussian form factor g(p) = exp(−p2 /p20 ) in Euclidean 4-momentum space.
The fixed input parameters of the quark model considered here are mc = 5.4869 MeV, p0 = 782.16 MeV and
GS p20 = 19.804.

where μx = 1 GeV defines the scale for chemical potential, A is a slope parameter in the units of the pressure,
B is the bag pressure and β = 1/c2s is a parameter related

to the squared speed of sound c2s = dP/dε. The pressure
as a function of the chemical potential is a thermodynamical potential from which other EoS can be obtained
by derivation. For instance, the baryon density reads

Using the definition of the pressure (9), the energy density (11) can be rewritten as
ε(P ) = βP + (1 + β)B ,

(12)

which directly reveals that the squared sound speed is
c2s = 1/β = const, since β = const.
The speed of sound determines the stiffness of the EoS,
which has to be large enough to allow for the maximum
neutron star mass to fulfil the observational lower bound
of 2.01 M⊙ from the Shapiro-delay based mass measurement on PSR J0740+6620 [33] (a recent upgrade of the
former mass measurement [57]) at the 1σ level. The prefactor A changes the slope of the P (μ) curve and has thus
also an effect on the stiffness of the EoS: lowering the
value of A increases the stiffness. The effective (negative)
bag pressure B realises quark confinement at low densities in quark matter EoS because it makes sure that any
small but positive pressure of a hadronic phase would be
preferable this region. The parameters A, B and c2s are
free parameters which define the behaviour of the quark
matter EoS.
It is worth mentioning that for a large class of quark
matter models, including the standard NJL model [58,
59] or its nonlocal generalization with instantaneous,
three-momentum dependent formfactors [60], it was observed that the sound speed appears largely densityindependent [46]. For the covariant nlNJL model such
an observation has not yet been made. Therefore, for the
first time in the present work the question is considered
how well the covariant nlNJL model in the 2SC phase can
be approximated by the quark matter EoS with constant
speed of sound, given by Eq. (9).

C.

Phenomenological EoS

Besides the CSS model EoS, there is a phenomenological formulation of the EoS of quark matter in use which

has been introduced and motivated in Ref. [54]. In that
work, the quark matter EoS consists of the first three
terms of a series in even powers of the quark chemical
potential
ΩQM = −3/4π 2 a4 μ4 + 3/4π 2 a2 μ2 + Beff ,

(13)

where a4 , a2 , and Beff are coefficients independent of μ.
The quartic coefficient a4 = 1 − c is well defined for
an ideal massless gas for which c=0. Perturbative QCD
corrections in lowest order, i.e. O(αs ) for massless quark
matter lead to a reduction of a4 , e.g., accounted for by
c = 0.3 so that a4 = 0.7. The quadratic μ2 term arises
from an expansion in the finite strange quark mass ms
and the diquark pairing gap ∆, so that a2 = m2s − 4∆2 .
In CFL quark matter, they are almost in the same order
of about 100 MeV so that the coefficient a2 is almost zero
and this corresponds to a constant speed of sound c2s =
1/3, the conformal limit [54]. In the phenomenological
parameterization (13), the coefficient a2 usually varies in
the limits ±(150 MeV)2 [61].
However, this EoS for quark matter is softer than some
nucleonic ones. It has been shown in [54] that even for
this simple parameterization which hereafter we call "Alford fit", the resulting hybrid stars can have mass-radius
relations very similar to those of pure nucleonic stars and
the maximum mass fulfills the constraint for its observational lower limit [33].
As another aim of the present work, we intend to compare the results of fitting the nlNJL EoS with both CSS
parameterization and Alford parameterization.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.

Fitting procedure

In order to obtain a functional relation between the
parameters of the two approaches, we considered 34 EoS
based on nlNJL model (for different values of ηD and ηV
parameters) to which we fit the CSS EoS (9) in order to
obtain the values of A, B and β. In these EoS fits, the
parameter B is expressed through the values of A and β
as
B=A

with the value of chemical potential for which the pressure is equal to zero, given by the nlNJL EoS.

One example of the CSS fit to the nlNJL EoS (with
ηD = 0.75 and ηV = 0.14) is given in Fig. 1. For comparison, fitting the parameters of the phenomenological EoS
(13) that was introduced by Alford et al. in [54] we obtain
a4 = 0.003, a2 = −(102.342 MeV)2 and Beff = 124.53
MeV fm−3 . This "Alford fit" is also shown in Fig. 1. It
is worth mentioning that the value of a4 ≈ 0, which is
obtained by the fit, entails that the correction relative to
the ideal gas limit is close to 100% and thus not compatible with its value of c = 2αs /π ≈ 30% in perturbation
theory to O(αs ) [62]. This can be seen as an hint to the
nonperturbative nature of the quark matter EoS in this
domain of low chemical potentials in the vicinity of the
hadronization transition.
In the inserted plot we further examine the low chemical potential region where the most significant difference
between the two fits is found. The CSS follows the nlNJL
behaviour more closely, which will be also manifested in
the mass-radius curves discussed toward the end of the
chapter. For the remaining chemical potentials, the two
fits present the same quality in reproducing the nlNJL
EoS. The quality of the fits is estimated with the χ2
value, defined as

From the CSS fit, the values of A and β parameters are
obtained, from which B parameter and squared speed of
sound c2s are calculated. These values are given in Table I
together with the χ2 values for the 34 different nlNJL
EoSs giving the total of 34 data points. From these values
the functional form, between nlNJL parameter space and
the CSS one, is to be found.
In order to find the functional dependence between
the two parameter spaces, we analyze the behaviour of
the CSS model parameters for different values of ηD and
ηV , as given in Figure 2. The parameter A shows the
strongest dependence on both nlNJL model parameters,
while c2s and B are almost independent on ηD and linearly
depending on ηV , respectively. From these dependencies, the simplest functional form between two parameter
spaces can be assumed: the variation of CSS parameters
is linear with the change of ηD , while it is quadratic with
the change of ηV . Thus, we write the following equations
A = a1 ηD + b1 ηV2 + c1

where the coefficients ai , bi and ci (with i = 1, 2, 3) are
obtained through a two-parameter (ηD , ηV ) fitting procedure of each of the CSS parameters (A, B, c2s ) and are
given in Table II.
To check the quality of our method, we choose one
original nlNJL EoS that was not included in the initial
fitting data set (e.g. ηD = 0.75 and ηV = 0.15) and
calculate CSS EoS using Eq. (9) with the parameter values obtained through Eqs. (16)-(18). The EoS comparison is given in Fig. 3. It is worth noticing that the
M − R curve for our example EoS with the parameter
set (ηD , ηV ) = (0.75, 0.15) from the middle of the parameter range crosses the revised mass value 2.08 M⊙
for PSR J0740+6620 [33] at the radius R = 12.5 km,
which accidentally is in the middle of the overlap region
12.2 km < R < 13.7 km of the 1σ NICER radius measurements from the two analysis teams (Riley et al. and
Miller et al.) that have recently been reported [63].

that the CSS parameterization works better for fitting
the nlNJL model. For comparison, the mass-radius (M −

DD2 parameterization [66] with excluded volume effects
[67]. The DD2 model with excluded volume is mainly
used in the context of an early deconfinement onset with
large latent heat.
The results for the M − R curves sufficiently demonstrate the applicability of the mapping that has been
performed. It is clear that the M − R curves for the
CSS fit and its functional version are sufficiently close

for these two parameterizations to be considered equivalent. Furthermore, their difference to the M − R curve
for the original nlNJL EoS amounts to maximally 200 m
in radius. This difference is well visible but still much
smaller than the design accuracy of observational radius
measurements from NICER, which even has not yet been
reached by the first NICER radius measurements. Therefore, our work provides a sufficiently precise tool for NS
phenomenology. Moreover, the comparison with Alford
fit shows that the radius of the NS is really sensitive
to the EoS. While both fits are very close according to
Fig. 1, the CSS parameterization performs better in the
M − R curve, in particular close to the onset of the phase
transition at low densities. From our results, we can see

that the Alford fit may be useful close to the maximum
mass.
We conclude that for the nlNJL EoS parameterizations
within the ranges 0.7 < ηD < 0.8 and 0.11 < ηV < 0.18,
the CSS approach can mimic the behaviour of the nlNJL
EoS to high accuracy. The range of ηD values between
0.7 and 0.8 is covering the value for the Fierz transformation of a one-gluon exchange interaction (ηD = 3/4) and
entails that the quark matter is in the color superconducting phase. The CSS parameters for the nlNJL EoSs

ηD = 0.75 and ηV = 0.15 (black solid line) with its CSS representation (magenta pluses) calculated from Eq. (9) where
the parameters A = 93.586, c2s = 0.487 and B = 84.454 are
determined using the functions (16)-(18) with the coefficients
from Tab. II. The χ2 value of the fit is 0.049.

with high values of ηV > 0.18 are showing deviations
from the general behaviour fitted by Eqs. (16)-(18). But
since for these ηV -values there is a causality violation at
large chemical potentials, the CSS form of the EoS fitted
at low densities can be used to extrapolate the EoS above
a certain density. A lower limit on the values of the ηV
parameter is not explored here.

CONCLUSION

We have considered the correspondence between the
covariant nlNJL model and the CSS model EoS. We have
performed a mapping between the parameters of these
two models in a decent range with a χ2 value that qualifies an excellent fit. The finding of this equivalence allows
to employ the simpler CSS approach instead of the covariant nlNJL model when a hybrid star EoS with color
superconducting quark matter shall be constructed. The

the Alford parameterization, but this resulted in a worse
quality of the fit when compared to the CSS one, at least
for masses well below the maximum mass. Therefore, we
could confirm for the first time that the covariant nlNJL
is fitted to the CSS parameterization with high accuracy.
While these microphysical parameters, the diquark coupling and the vector meson coupling considered here to
vary in the range of 0.7 < ηD < 0.8 and 0.11 < ηV <
0.18, respectively, it is possible to extend the range of
applicability of the CSS parameter fit also beyond these
ranges.
Our studies can be used not only in order to explore
the phase transition between hadronic and color superconducting quark matter in cold NS, but it can also be
extended to finite temperatures when it will be useful in
simulations of core collapse supernovae [68] and neutron
star mergers [69–71] involving quark matter deconfinement.
