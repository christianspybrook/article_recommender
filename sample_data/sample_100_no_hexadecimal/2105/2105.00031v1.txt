ABSTRACT
Normality is the most often mathematical supposition used in data modeling.
Nonetheless, even based on the law of large numbers (LLN), normality is a strong
presumption given that the presence of asymmetry and multi-modality in real-world
problems is expected. Thus, a flexible modification in the Normal distribution proposed by Elal-Olivero [12] adds a skewness parameter, called Alpha-skew Normal
(ASN) distribution, enabling bimodality and fat-tail, if needed, although sometimes
not trivial to estimate this third parameter (regardless of the location and scale).
This work analyzed seven different statistical inferential methods towards the ASN
distribution on synthetic data and historical data of water flux from 21 rivers (channels) in the Atacama region. Moreover, the contribution of this paper is related to
the probability estimation surrounding the rivers' flux level in Copiapó city neighborhood, the most important economic city of the third Chilean region, and known
to be located in one of the driest areas on Earth, besides the North and the South
Pole.

Introduction

We live in the Big Data Era, in which a high volume and variety of data characterization are often noticeable in a data lake, nonetheless despite its amount of observation,
symmetry, and smooth-tail are not always observed. These characteristics are natural
since we all live in a complex world, with nonlinear relations and outliers, describing
extreme values more recurrent than easy statistical tools take into account. This new
age requires flexible models and different reasoning based on data information.
An often question crossing some traditional departments worldwide, "Are Statistics
methods getting old fashion?". Sir David Cox [6] explains that the focus is on the
data relevance and quality, based on its coverage and representativeness, which gives
confidence for the results, despite the amount of information (large volume) in the set
which may hold some potentially biased estimates, with measurement errors. Efron
& Hastie [11] discuss the relation across computer-related and statistical inference

as a mathematical logic system for guidance and correction, complemented by the
large-scale prediction algorithms, suitable for this new century.
Therefore, complexity is intrinsic to massive data where high-dimension is often presented, and dynamic [18, 30]. Nonetheless, all the information contained in the acquired
data can be extracted through an estimation method, i.e., in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and in a parametric version, it will be supported by a supposed
distribution. Parametric approaches are easy to interpret patterns through parameters and enable association across variables, present a low computational cost, and be
easier to implement in decision-making systems.
In many cases, the standard MLE may not return desirable results. Other estimation
methods that return accurate estimates have been considered, such as estimators based
on the least square function [32], the product of spacing [4, 28] or goodness-of-fit
statistics [21]. There is no unique method that performs better for all models and it may
depend on the selected parametric form [20, 27]. Thus, using an efficient estimation
method jointly with a flexible parametric model that covers many data patterns is
demanded, which sometimes accommodates asymmetry and multi-modality that may
be contained in the data That is considered.
This is the case of meteorological data, which shows significant changes as well as
a complex dynamic [2, 9]. These field demands an extra attention, on data-driven
models, thus needed to incorporate spatial-time dependence [19], structural change
[23], extreme value [10], but moreover in the parametric world a model supported by a
probabilistic model (which deals with asymmetry and multi-modality [25, 29]). Thus,
this paper was motivated by the study case of the water flux of 21 rivers (channels)
from the surroundings of Copiapó city, placed in the Atacama Desert, as one of the
planet's driest areas. Moreover, we are persuaded to exemplify evidence towards the
probability density associated with these events' empirical distribution through seven
different statistical inference approaches.
This paper is divided into four parts. Section 2 presents the motivation and details
regarding the analyzed data. Section 3 provides a background about the adopted
methodology towards statistical inference elements. Then, Sections 4 and 5 show the
results related to the implemented methodology on synthetic data and the real-world
data analysis. Finally, Section 6 discusses the conclusions based on the obtained results.

The Data

The adopted data set is related to Fluviometric records (average monthly flows), from
the Atacama Desert region (third region of Chile), in the Copiapó city neighborhood.
The historical period of these data are from the past ten years from Jan, 2011 to
Dec, 2020 associated with 21 rivers (or stream channel), obtained from the Chilean
government web-site called Direccion General de Aguas (Información Oficial Hidrometeorológica y de Calidad de Aguas en Lı́nea).
Historical events reveal the high periodicity of the low water flux of the region.
However, cyclical events were also noticeable (such as two showers of rain, defrost of
glaciers/snow in summer, amongst others), creating an expected multi-modality and
large leptokurtosis.
Within the process information, a decision support system (DSS) sifts through and
analyzes massive amounts of data, compiling comprehensive information that can be
used to solve problems and in decision-making. Figure 1 summarizing chart flow of the
knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), from the information retrieval (IR), decision

support system (DSS), to monitoring & forecasting.
Thus, the Atacama Desert watershed problem is one of a multi-dimensional study
related to the circular economy to be analyzed. It is essential to mention that uncertainty is always presented globally (as a measurement error, sample bias, amongst
others). Nonetheless, probabilistic reasoning allows one to generalize results through
statistical inference procedures.

Statistical Inference Elements
Alpha-skew Normal (ASN) distribution

Let X be a random variable following a Alpha-skew Normal (ASN) distribution then
its probability density function (PDF) is given by
f (x|α) =

(1 − αx)2 + 1
φ(x)
2 + α2

where x ∈ R, α ∈ R and φ(*) is the PDF of the standard normal distribution.
The cumulative density function (CDF) is given by


F (x|α) = Φ(x) + α

2 − αx
2 + α2


φ(x)

Then, wrapping the ASN density f(x|α) with the parameters for location (μ) and
scale (σ), that is, the random variable T is defined by T = μ + σX, for μ ∈ R and
σ > 0, given by:

Given its flexibility, the ASN distribution has been used in data modeling and
adopted in different fields such as astronomy [34], modeling wind speed [39], and
benchmark data [1]. Figure 2 presents different forms of the PDF of the ASN distribution, for instance, assuming μ = 0 (location), σ = 1 (scale) and different values for
α, showing the presence of asymmetry and bimodality (incorporating different heights

Different estimation methods for ASN distribution

In this subsection, we will discuss seven different estimation methods (Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Ordinary and Weighted Least-Square Estimate, Method of Maximum Product of Spacings, Cramer-von Mises minimum distance estimators, AndersonDarling and Right-tail Anderson-Darling estimators) for the parameters (μ, σ, and α)
of the ASN distribution. Table 1 describe the methods used and the authors that proposed such inferential procedures. The comparison, which used the cited estimators,
has been presented for other models [8, 26, 35].

of the oldest estimation procedures, we have included the paper of Swain et al. [32]
The authors used such an approach for a class of non-normal models and became a
standard reference when applied in different probability distributions. The additional
details related to the estimation of the ASN distribution parameters are presented in
the following subsections.
3.2.1.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is widely used in data analysis, where
Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen at first for the analysis of variance, and later for estimate functions derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous
functions. Despite the fact that historical records of this technique have been widely
exposed and defended by Ronald A. Fisher (maybe gained visibility because of the
epic fights with Egon S. Pearson), its rationality dates back to the mid-1700s [31].
Let t1 , t2 , * * * , tn be the sample of the random sample of size n from F (t|μ, σ, α).
The maximum likelihood estimator μ̂M LE , σ̂M LE and α̂M LE can be obtained by maximizing, let's consider zi = (ti −μ)

Numerical methods such as Newton-Rapshon are required to find the solution of the
nonlinear system. Under mild conditions, the MLEs are asymptotically normally distributed with a joint multivariate normal distribution given by



(μ̂M LE , σ̂M LE , α̂M LE ) ∼ N3 (μ, σ, α), I −1 (μ, σ, α)) as n → ∞.
where I(μ, σ, α) is the Fisher information matrix given in Elal-Olivero [12].
5

This methodology is often adopted given the MLE sufficiency, combined with consistency (which leads to the statistical efficiency), and asymptotic normality is guaranteed. Often cases, MLE are adopted under regularity conditions and assumptions
like score functions linearly approximation. Nonetheless, some more constraints on the
class of estimates (whenever the increase of parameters' numbers, unbounded likelihood functions, and the possibility of local improvement) should be verified and needed
to be contours of the likelihood.
Next, we will present a series of Minimum Distance Estimations (easily applied
to estimate consistently unknown parameters) and designed to reflect the proposed
model reproducing the probabilistic structure of the real-world phenomenon under
study [38]. Minimum Distance Estimations provide consistent parameter estimates
and competitive, especially when other methods did not succeed.
3.2.2.

Ordinary and Weighted Least-Square Estimate

Let random sample of size n present a sequence t(1) , t(2) , * * * , t(n) then been a series
of order statistics in which F (t|μ, σ, α) is a monotonic function. The least square
(LSQ) estimators μ̂LSE , σ̂LSE and α̂LSE for the ASN distribution can be obtained by
minimizing the parameters μ, σ and α, as

Alternative solutions are obtained through numerical approximation, with high precision, for these ∆j for j = 1, 2, 3 partial derivatives.
Alternatively, the weighted least-squares (WLQ) estimates are proposed whenever
efficient method is required under sets of small data, μ̂W LSE , σ̂W LSE and α̂W LSE , can
be obtained by minimized adopting the following equation,

where ∆1 (* | μ, σ, α), ∆2 (* | μ, σ, α) and ∆3 (* | μ, σ, α) are given in (8). The WLQ
estimation technique is particularly useful whenever one aims to weigh the observations proportional to the equivalence of the error variance for that observation, then
overcoming the issue of non-constant variance.
3.2.3.

Method of Maximum Product of Spacings

The maximum product of spacings (MPS) method is a powerful alternative to MLE for
estimating unknown parameters of continuous univariate distributions, which aims to
maximize the geometric mean of spacings in the data (differences between the values
of the cumulative distribution function at neighborhood data points). Cheng & Amin
proposed this method [4, 5], and also obtained independently by Ranneby [28], as a
Kullback-Leibler information approximation measurement. Some desirable properties
of the MPS methods such as asymptotic efficiency, invariance, and more importantly,
consistency are held broadly (under general conditions) than for MLEs [5].
Let's represented the differences between the values of the cumulative distribution function
data points by the function Di (μ, σ, α) =
 on their neighborhood

F t(i) | μ, σ, α −F t(i−1) | μ, σ, α , for i = {1, 2, . . . , n+1, . . .} as an uniform spacings
of a random sample from the ASN distribution, defining by F (t(0) | μ, σ, α) = 0 and
P
F (t(n+1) | μ, σ, α) = 1. The constraint of the n+1
i=1 Di (μ, σ, α) = 1 is held. Thus, the
MPS estimates μ̂M P S , σ̂M P S and α̂M P S can be obtained by maximizing the geometric
mean of the spacings

where ∆1 (* | μ, σ, α), ∆2 (* | μ, σ, α) and ∆3 (* | μ, σ, α) are given respectively in (8).
It is important to mention that if t(i+k) = t(i+k−1) = . . . = t(i) then Di+k (μ, σ, α) =
Di+k−1 (μ, σ, α) = . . . = Di (μ, σ, α) = 0. Therefore, the MPS estimators are sensitive
to closely spaced observations, especially ties. When the ties are due to multiple observations, Di (μ, σ, α) should be replaced by the corresponding likelihood f (t(i) , μ, σ, α)
since t(i) = t(i−1) .
7

Under mild conditions for the ASN distribution, the MPS estimators are asymptotically normally distributed with a joint trivariate normal distribution given by



(μ̂M P S , σ̂M P S , α̂M P S ) ∼ N3 (μ, σ, α), I −1 (μ, σ, α)) as n → ∞.
3.2.4.

The Cramer-von Mises minimum distance estimators

Alternatively, an estimator that requires no assumption about the distributions' parametric form, the Cramer-von Mises estimator (CME), is based on the difference between the estimate of the cumulative distribution function and the empirical distribution function [7, 37]. These estimators operate based on the minimum distance across
the "true" distribution (observed) and the "modeled" distribution (adjusted) through
the maximum goodness-of-fit.
Macdonald [22] showed that the bias of the estimator, from the CME, presents
smaller distances alternatively to other minimum distance estimators. The Cramervon Mises estimates μ̂CM E , σ̂CM E and α̂CM E of the parameters μ, σ and α are obtained
by minimizing through

where ∆1 (* | μ, σ, α), ∆2 (* | μ, σ, α) and ∆3 (* | μ, σ, α) are given respectively in (8).
3.2.5.

The Anderson-Darling and Right-tail Anderson-Darling estimators

Another type of minimum distance estimator is based on Anderson-Darling statistics, often called Anderson-Darling estimator (ADE). This estimator is based on the
minimum distance estimator obtained from sampling a sort data in ascending order
of observed set (Y), then X = Sort(Y), and also combined with the permutation of
{1, 2, . . . , n} which makes the X series sorted. Thus, this process is associated with the
cumulative distribution function F(*) and the survival function S(*) = 1 − F (*) for any
PDF. In contrast, samples are drawn from a uniform distribution only if Y (and X)
are samples from the PDF distribution.
The Anderson-Darling estimates μ

Numerical Analysis

In this section, we investigated the behavior of the ASN distribution based on artificial (synthetic) data, and its parameters modification conditioning on the estimation
methodology. Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out, seven frequentist estimation methods were considered for the parameters, and comparing their efficiency.
The following approach was adopted. The procedure is:
(1) Generate N samples of size n given a set of parameters from the ASN(μ, σ, α)
distribution;
(2) For each generated set, based on the estimation methods (MLEs, LSQs, WLQs,
MPSs, CMEs, ADEs and RTADEs, estimates of the parameters (μ, σ and α)
were calculated;
(3) Then, considering θ̂ = (μ̂, σ̂, α̂) and θ = (μ, σ, α) it was computed the
Bias and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of θ̂, which are given, respectively, by

This simulated study's results shall return the most expected efficient estimation method conditioning on their estimations both Bias and MSE closer to zero.
For this simulation study, we adopted the R software (R Core Team 2014), and
for the maximization method used package maxLik and stats4 (Henningsen and
Toomet, 2011). The chosen values of the simulation parameters were: N = 10, 000
and n = {40, 60, 80, * * * , 300}. Due to lack of space, we will present the results only
for {μ = 0.5, σ = 0.5, α = 3} and {μ = 0, σ = 1, α = 5}. Nonetheless, the following
results are generalized by other choices of the vector of parameters θ. The estimation
methods are considered under the same conditions in terms of samples, limit iterations numbers, and initial values. Here, we considered the true values as initial values.
However, we provide a simple approach discussed in the next section to deal with real
cases where good initial values are not available.

Figure 3. Bias and MSE of the estimates of μ = 0.5, σ = 0.5 and α = 3, for N = 10, 000 simulated samples
of size n, using the following methods: 1-MLE, 2-MPS, 3-ADE, 4-RADE, 5-LSE, 6- WLSE, 7 - CME.

Figures 3 and 4 present the performance of the estimators in terms of Bias and
MSE for the parameters μ, σ, and α using the MLEs, LSQs, WLQs, MPSs, CMEs,
ADEs and RTADEs, with N = 10.000 simulated samples, and different values of n. It
can be observed that the MLEs do not return adequate estimates for some parameter
values and only converges for large samples of size. These results show a drawback
in the current approach used to obtain the parameter estimates of ASN distribution.
Although there is no uniform method that returns better estimates for all parameters
and different parameter values, we observed that the ADEs obtained the best results
in terms of minimum Bias and MSE. Additionally, obtaining an estimate for α is quite
challenging to estimate given the influence from the parameter of location and scale μ
and σ). In this approach, we faced fewer computational issues to obtain such estimates,
and therefore we recommend using the ADEs to achieve the estimates for all practical
purposes.

Results

As we presented in Section 2, the motivation of this paper is driven by the Atacama
Desert water flux. More precisely in the Copiapó neighborhood. Figure 5 shows the
empirical density of this phenomenon, whereas a high concentration of low-values is
presented (near to zero) although important events also captured in this 10-year time
window, such as a big rain retrieving a large leptokurtosis.
Table 2 presents the statistical summaries (minimum, 1st Quartile, Median, Mean,
3rd Quartile, maximum) of the water flux per month. Since the weather is very constant
in the region, the seasonality across years is to be ignored since low flux is common
(close values through the minimum of the months). Nonetheless, the cycle per month
is essential given events like defrost at the end of spring/beginning of summer (higher
values in the 3rd quartile in NOV and DEC), it is expected to receive more water in
the system.
The use of the logarithm transformation has been used for a long time [13], though
often obtained a normal distribution, some other situations, not the case, for instance,
the dynamic of the water flux through the observed period in Figure 7, showing the
presence of bimodality in this data transformation, and its monthly representation by

while α̃ is obtained from a grid search considering the range (−10, −9.5, . . . , 9, 10). The
initial values of μ̃ and σ̃ are clearly biased as they are the standar MLE for the normal
distribution assuming that α = 1, on the other hand, the obtained values are not so
far from the true value of the ASN, therefore, they can be used as good initial values
only. Additionally, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the MLE showed an statistic test
D = 0.094, presenting a p-value of 0.5, whereas the ADE had a D = 0.12, with the
associated p-value of 0.2 (suggesting the adequacy of the methods).
After confirming the ASN distribution's good-of-fitness, event occurrence can be
associated with its density (or cumulative) probability function. For instance, extreme
values are to be seen as Table 3 shows some exemplifications taking into account the
1%, 10%, 50%, 99%, and 99.99%.

Conclusion

Uncertainty reveals a wide variety of processes and experiences, which may follow
different rules, although different attributions of uncertainty such as external (disposition) versus internal (ignorance) are assessed by statistical inference, given philosophical interpretations of probability [17]. The utilities of each possible outcome lead to
choosing rational actions regardless of the observed results' uncertainty.
The example brought by this paper is the water flux modeling related to an essential
element stressed by the significant population growth and the increase in the demand

The black dashed line represents the adjusted ASN distribution based on the MLE (μ = −1.949, σ = 0.85, α =
4147.07), and the red dot-dashed line based on the ADE (μ = −1.879, σ = 1.05, α = −8.36).

for water supply (for agriculture, industrial process, mineral extraction, human consumption) [33]. Therefore, planning the logistic of these excessive water decisions, upon
the probabilistic distribution, helps in unraveling this complex task [16, 36], initiated
by the analysis of the water flux, especially when environmental factors present limit
sources towards the water level.
Thus, this work proposed the investigation towards comparing different inference
methods towards the ASN probabilistic distribution, which shows a promising and flexible distribution. Bimodality was noticeable and skewed information observed in the
historical series, nevertheless accommodated by the adopted probabilistic approach.
Big-data solution may now be implemented, using real-time analysis, once the process's probabilistic function was estimated and evidence towards the good-of-fitness
was shown. Monitoring charts and other statistical process control (SPC) tools can also
explore since parametric distribution is often adopted, and here shown elements onto
the ASN distribution. Future works should expand into the reasoning towards quantile estimations associated with this problem with explainable features (in a regression
structure), and forecasting may also be a further research motivation later.
