ABSTRACT
Context. Galaxy clusters are an important tool for cosmology, and their detection and characterization are key goals for current and future surveys.

Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) located 2,839
significant galaxy overdensities at redshifts 0.7 . z . 1.5, which included extensive follow-up imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope to
determine cluster richnesses. Concurrently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has produced large area mm-wave maps in three frequency
bands along with a large catalog of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) selected clusters, as part of its Data Release 5 (DR5).
Aims. We aim to verify and characterize MaDCoWS clusters using measurements of, or limits on, their thermal SZ (tSZ) effect signatures. We
also use these detections to establish the scaling relation between SZ mass and the MaDCoWS-defined richness.
Methods. Using the maps and cluster catalog from DR5, we explore the scaling between SZ mass and cluster richness. We do this by comparing
cataloged detections and extracting individual and stacked SZ signals from the MaDCoWS cluster locations. We use complementary radio survey
data from the Very Large Array, submillimeter data from Herschel, and ACT 224 GHz data to assess the impact of contaminating sources on the
SZ signals from both ACT and MaDCoWS clusters. We use a hierarchical Bayesian model to fit the mass-richness scaling relation, allowing for
clusters to be drawn from two populations: one, a Gaussian centered on the mass-richness relation, and the other, a Gaussian centered on zero SZ
signal.
Results. We find that MaDCoWS clusters have submillimeter contamination which is consistent with a gray-body spectrum, while the ACT
clusters are consistent with no submillimeter emission on average. Additionally, the intrinsic radio intensities of ACT clusters are lower than those
of MaDCoWS clusters, even when the ACT clusters are restricted to the same redshift range as the MaDCoWS clusters. We find the best fit ACT
+0.15
SZ mass vs. MaDCoWS richness scaling relation has a slope of κ = 1.84−0.14
, where the slope is defined as M ∝ λκ15 where λ15 is the richness. We
also find that the ACT SZ signals for a significant fraction ( 57%)of the MaDCoWS sample can statistically be described as being drawn from a
noise-like distribution, indicating that the candidates are possibly dominated by low-mass and unvirialized systems that are below the mass limit
of the ACT sample. Further, we note that a large portion of the optically-confirmed ACT clusters located in the same volume of the sky as the
MaDCoWS survey are not selected by MaDCoWS, indicating the MaDCoWS sample is not complete with respect to SZ selection. Finally, we
find that the radio loud fraction (RLF) of MaDCoWS clusters increases with richness, while we find no evidence that the submillimeter emission
of the MaDCoWS clusters evolves with richness.
Conclusions. We conclude that the original MaDCoWS survey's selection function is not well defined, and, as such, reiterate the MaDCoWS
collaboration's recommendation that the sample is suited for probing cluster and galaxy evolution, but not cosmological analyses. We find a best
fit mass-richness relation slope that agrees with the published MaDCoWS preliminary results. Additionally, we find that while the approximate
level of in-fill of the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster SZ signals (1 − 2%) is subdominant to other sources of uncertainty for current generation
experiments, characterizing and removing this bias will be critical for next generation experiments hoping to constrain cluster masses at the
sub-percent level. Finally, we also find evidence that the MaDCoWS and ACT clusters are drawn from different underlying populations.

1. Introduction
Astronomers have long sought an efficient and effective way to
identify galaxy clusters as well as a convenient observational
proxy for their mass (Abell 1958; Rykoff et al. 2012; Andreon
2015; Saro et al. 2015; Geach & Peacock 2017; Simet et al.
2017; Rettura et al. 2018; Gonzalez et al. 2019a; Chiu et al.
2020), particularly at high redshift where their formation and
distribution are sensitive probes of cosmology.

Recently, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ effect; see Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1970, 1972 as well as Birkinshaw 1999; Carlstrom et al. 2002; Mroczkowski et al. 2019 for reviews) has been
used to uncover large populations of distant clusters. In particular, the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect allows redshift independent detection of clusters due to inverse-Compton scattering of CMB
photons as they pass through hot gas in the clusters.1 Cluster

Throughout the paper we use SZ effect to refer exclusively to the tSZ
effect, as opposed to the kinetic SZ effect.

masses can be then estimated from the amplitude of the SZ signals under the assumption of a universal pressure profile (e.g.
Arnaud et al. 2010); we refer to such estimates as "SZ masses."
The Planck satellite, which provides the only all-sky SZ survey
to date, was limited by both sensitivity and angular resolution
(100 at 100 GHz) and has identified clusters with z < 1 (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2016a). Ground-based surveys, such as the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, Fowler et al. 2007; Swetz
et al. 2011; Thornton et al. 2016) and the South Pole Telescope
(SPT, Carlstrom et al. 2011; Benson et al. 2014), have achieved
1 − 20 resolution and are sensitive to high-redshift clusters, but
until recently only surveyed a small fraction of the sky. These
surveys are also now more sensitive than Planck over large portions of the sky (see e.g. Naess et al. 2020).
Meanwhile, optical/infra-red (IR) surveys and analysis methods have progressed, offering new data, selection techniques
(e.g., weak lensing shear), and more advanced richness selection criteria. One such survey, the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS; Gonzalez et al. 2019a), relies
on data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).
MaDCoWS provides an infrared-selected sample of candidate
clusters at redshifts 0.7 < z < 1.5. The MaDCoWS sample aims
to extend richness selection to a higher average redshift than previous surveys.
ACT has observed roughly 40% of the sky in the fifth data release (hereafter referred to as DR5)2 , which includes cluster data
taken through the 2018 observing season (Hilton et al. 2021).
This data release enables large, statistical comparisons between
cluster richness, as measured by optical or IR surveys and their
SZ mass. DR5 provides SZ measurements for a large fraction of
the MaDCoWS candidates, well beyond the handful of systems
targeted for individual SZ follow-up in Gonzalez et al. (2019a),
Dicker et al. (2020), Di Mascolo et al. (2020), and Ruppin et al.
(2020) for example.
In this work, we use data from ACT DR5 to establish how
SZ mass scales with the MaDCoWS definition of richness for a
large sample of MaDCoWS cluster candidates. The work presented here complements the recent work by Madhavacheril
et al. (2020), who report the mean mass, determined through
stacked CMB lensing, of the MaDCoWS candidates located
within the ACT survey region and above a richness of 20 (Section 2.1). Additionally, this work probes the mass-richness scaling relation, and hence cluster abundance, at a higher redshift
than previous studies (e.g., Sehgal et al. 2013).
The paper is structured as follows. An overview of the ACT
DR5 and MaDCoWS samples, as well as the ancillary data we
use to test for radio and submillimeter source in-fill, is provided
in Section 2. In Section 3 we detail the process used to identify
clusters detected in both ACT and MaDCoWS samples and
from this estimate the completeness of the MaDCoWS sample.
In Section 4 we describe the forced photometry process used
to obtain masses for the MaDCoWS clusters from the ACT
maps. In Section 5 we review the corrections performed on the
forced photometry mass estimates, including contamination by
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and dusty submillimeter galaxies
via ancillary radio and submillimeter data. In Section 6 we
describe the process used to infer the mass-richness scaling
relation. In Section 7, we discuss the inferred scaling relations
and completeness of the MaDCoWS catalog, as well as the
impact of contamination by IR and sub-mm sources on the SZ
mass. In Section 8 we provide conclusions and give an outlook

The MaDCoWS galaxy cluster catalog comprises 2839 cluster
candidates spanning redshifts 0.7 . z . 1.5, selected using
WISE (Wright et al. 2010) all-sky survey data (Gonzalez et al.
2019a).3 To reduce contamination by lower redshift galaxies,
MaDCoWS uses optical data from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS; Chambers &
Pan-STARRS Team 2018) at declination δ > −30◦ , and SuperCOSMOS (Hambly et al. 2001a,b,c) at δ < −30◦ to reject low
redshift interlopers. MaDCoWS also uses data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000, SDSS) for the same purpose over sections of the SDSS footprint. In total, 2433 cluster
candidates were identified by the WISE–Pan-STARRS search,
and 250 by the WISE–SuperCOSMOS search. The MaDCoWS
catalog includes photometric redshifts for 1869 of its candidates,
derived from Spitzer imaging. Spectroscopic measurements of a
limited subsample of the MaDCoWS cluster candidates indicate
that the photometric uncertainty is σz /(1 + z) ≈ 0.036. In addition to photometric redshifts, the Spitzer follow-up also enabled
an estimate of cluster richness (λ15 , see section 6.3 of Gonzalez
et al. 2019a). Briefly, the MaDCoWS richness parameter λ15 is
the number of galaxies within a comoving 1 Mpc radius aperture for the candidate's redshift having a flux density > 15 μJy
after applying the color selection criteria described in Wylezalek
et al. (2013) and subtracting the expected number of field galaxies. The color selection was designed to select only high redshift
clusters. Within the MaDCoWS catalog, 1869 of the 2839 cluster
candidates have both richness and redshift estimates. For the purposes of determining a mass-richness scaling relationship, this
subset was further restricted to those MaDCoWS cluster candidates lying in the ACT footprint, which totaled 1035. Additionally, 70 clusters lie in regions that are masked due to point
source contamination: this leaves 965 MaDCoWS cluster candidates that were used in the analysis. To determine the radio and
sub-mm properties of both the ACT and MaDCoWS clusters,
we consider the full ACT and MaDCoWS cluster catalogs, necessarily restricted to those clusters for which we have radio/submm data. Finally, in Section 4, we stacked on the MaDCoWS
cluster locations to verify that the MaDCoWS cluster candidates
did, on average, produce an SZ signal. In order to ensure that
known ACT clusters did not dominate this stacked signal, we excluded MaDCoWS clusters that were also detected in ACT from
the stacking analysis. We did however include clusters without

for further extensions to this work.
Throughout this work, we assume a flat ΛCDM cosmology
with ΩM = 0.307, ΩΛ = 0.693, and H0 = 67.7 km s−1 Mpc−1
from Planck Collaboration et al. (2016b).

2. Data
In this work we primarily use the MaDCoWS cluster catalog
(Gonzalez et al. 2019b) and the catalog and maps from ACT
(Hilton et al. 2021). Additionally, we use data from the Herschel
Space Observatory (Valiante et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2017) and
the Very Large Array (VLA) (Condon et al. 1998; Lacy et al.
2020) to constrain dust and radio in-fill of the SZ signal, respectively. We also use the ACT 224 GHz maps to assess and
constrain the impact of dust in-fill.

a redshift measurement, resulting in the stacking analysis using a slightly different number of clusters (948) from the massrichness fit.
2.2. ACT

ACT is a 6-meter, off-axis Gregorian telescope located in the
Atacama Desert in Chile that has been operating since 2007
(Fowler et al. 2007). The Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) receiver,
which was deployed in 2016, is its latest camera (Henderson
et al. 2016; Thornton et al. 2016). It performs polarization sensitive observations centered at 98, 150, and 224 GHz, corresponding to a diffraction-limited resolution of 2.20 , 1.40 , and 1.00 , respectively. Throughout, we use f090, f150, and f220 to refer to
the maps made at those frequencies and 98, 150, and 224 GHz
when refering specifically to the frequencies. ACT has undertaken a number of large area, unbiased cluster surveys using the
SZ effect (Menanteau et al. 2010; Marriage et al. 2011; Sehgal
et al. 2011; Hasselfield et al. 2013; Menanteau et al. 2013; Hilton
et al. 2018, 2021). In this work, we use the DR5 cluster catalog
(Hilton et al. 2021), which we refer to as the ACT cluster catalog, and whose members we call ACT clusters, as well as maps
of the central Comptonization parameter (2̃0 , often referred to as
'SZ maps' in this work; see Section 2.3 of Hilton et al. 2021). To
construct these SZ maps, we use the ACT maps filtered at the reference 2.40 scale to perform forced photometry at the locations
of clusters reported in the MaDCoWS catalog. This matched filtering essentially reduces the SZ detection of given cluster candidate to a single quantity, 2̃0 . The SZ map is constructed such
that each pixel records the 2̃0 value that a cluster would have if it
were detected at a given location in the map. Therefore we simply extract 2̃0 and SNR2.4 (the signal-to-noise measured in this
2.40 scale map) values at the coordinates of each MaDCoWS
cluster to produce a forced photometry catalog. Sub-pixel interpolation is performed using a bivariate 3rd-order spline method.
We warn that following Section 4.2 of Hilton et al. (2021), the
SZ masses estimated here from these maps may be underestimated by ∼ 5 − 10%, and as such caution should be exercised
when comparing the reported masses here to other cluster catalogs. The DR5 catalog contains 4195 SZ-selected, optically confirmed clusters with signal-to-noise > 4 and with redshifts in the
range 0.04 < z < 1.91 over 13,211 deg2 of the sky. The catalog
has a 90% completeness mass limit of 3.8 × 1014 M at z = 0.5.
While the ACT cluster search was conducted using matched
filters with a number of different scales, a fixed reference scale
with θ500c = R500c /DA = 2.40 was used for characterizing the SZ
signal and its relation to mass. This scale is equivalent to a cluster with M500c = 2 × 1014 M at z = 0.4, assuming the Arnaud
et al. (2010) pressure profile and associated scaling relation. In
this work, we use the map of the central Comptonization parameter 2̃0 at this reference scale and the associated signal-to-noise
map to estimate the masses of MaDCoWS clusters using forced
photometry (see Section 4).
In addition to the 2̃0 maps, we also used the individual frequency maps, f090 and f150, as well as 2̃0 maps made with each
frequency (98 and 150 GHz) individually. We also used the f220
maps constructed from observations at 224 GHz. While the f220
maps are noisier (50 − 60 μK-arcmin) than the f090 and f150
data ( . 30 μK-arcmin typical: see Naess et al. 2020), the band
is centered near the null in the SZ effect, providing a clean band
for quantifying the dust emission in the ACT and MaDCoWS
clusters, as is discussed in Section 5.2. For all these maps, the
pixel size is 0.50 .

2.3. Herschel

We used the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) DR1 (Valiante et al. 2016) and DR2 (Smith
et al. 2017) to measure the thermal emission from dust in the
ACT and MaDCoWS clusters within the H-ATLAS footprint.
H-ATLAS covers 660 deg2 at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm
using the PACS and SPIRE cameras. We used only the 250, 350,
and 500 μm bands, all from the SPIRE camera. The SPIRE resolution is 18.200 , 25.200 , and 36.300 at 250, 350, and 500 μm, respectively, with pixel size equal to the resolution. Due to the relatively small size of the H-ATLAS field, only 34 ACT and 66
MaDCoWS clusters have Herschel coverage.
2.4. Very Large Array

In order to determine if radio source in-fill impacts the SZ signals from MaDCoWS candidates, we examine data from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS; Condon et al. 1998) and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS; Lacy et al. 2020).
NVSS is a 1.4 GHz survey with 4500 FWHM angular resolution (1500 pixels) that covers approximately 82% of the sky at
declinations δ ≥ −40◦ . The NVSS catalog includes a set of 2326
continuum images made with a large restoring beam to provide
the sensitivity needed for completeness.
VLASS is an on-going 3 GHz radio survey producing Stokes
I, Q, and U maps with an angular resolution ≈ 2.500 (100 pixel
size). Like NVSS before it, the survey covers the entire sky
visible to the VLA, a ∼34,000 deg2 (δ > −40◦ ) area. The survey's first observations began in September 2017. VLASS is expected to detect, by the project's completion in 2024, ∼5,000,000
sources and record data with a continuum image RMS of 70
μJy/beam combined and 120 μJy/beam per-epoch. The first
epoch survey of the entire VLASS footprint has been completed,
and data products are available.4 "Quicklook" 2D Stokes I images covering the entire survey were used to conduct our investigations into MaDCoWS radio source in-fill.

3. Co-detections in the MaDCoWS and ACT
Catalogs
In order to understand the completeness of the MaDCoWS survey, we identify ACT-selected clusters that we consider to be
matches with MaDCoWS candidates, which we refer to as codetections. We consider a MaDCoWS candidate and an ACT
cluster to be a co-detection (i.e., the same cluster) if the positional difference between the ACT entry and MaDCoWS entry
was less than or equal to 2.50 . The criterion of a 2.50 matching
scale was chosen as it is approximately the resolution limit given
the ACT catalog filter reference scale (2.40 ). Note that Hilton
et al. (2021) find that 99.7% of the ACT cluster centers are within
1.90 of the optical centers. Using this criterion, we identified 96
co-detections. We report these 96 cluster co-detections in Appendix C.1. Restricting our search to only include matches to
MaDCoWS clusters in the Pan-STARRS footprint, that number
is reduced to 80.
We explored co-detections with larger positional difference
values as well, increasing the accepted positional difference from
2.50 to 50 . However, doing so only resulted in an additional 7

co-detection candidates, which we deemed to be only chance
superpositions. In Figure 1, we show the typical offsets between
the co-detections, indicating the match is generally within 0.70 .
Given the ACT cluster catalog, the number of co-detections
sets an upper limit on the completeness with respect to the ACT
catalog of the MaDCoWS cluster catalog and informs our understanding as to what extent these two surveys probe the same
population of clusters. We first consider whether MaDCoWS detected all ACT clusters. Restricting the ACT catalog to match
the MaDCoWS catalog in redshift (0.7 < z < 1.5) and footprint
(δ > −30◦ , corresponding to the Pan-STARRS follow-up region)
yields 712 ACT clusters compared to 80 co-detections restricted
to the Pan-STARRS region. Relaxing the footprint constraint to
include areas of SuperCOSMOS follow-up yields 1,102 ACT
clusters, compared to 96 co-detections. While this does not put
a hard constraint on the completeness of the MaDCoWS survey, it does suggest that it is . 10%. A primary reason for this
low completeness is expected to be the large non-Gaussian scatter between the mass and detection significance in the MaDCoWS search. MaDCoWS clusters were detected as galaxy excesses traced by the bright tip of the luminosity function, with
the strength of the signal significantly affected by both Poisson
statistics and blending of galaxies at the resolution of WISE.
As discussed in Section 2.1, after restricting the MaDCoWS
cluster catalog to the ACT footprint, masking point sources, and
removing clusters without measured richnesses or redshifts, a
total of 965 MaDCoWS clusters remain which are used for the
mass richness scaling relation. We note that discrepancies in the
redshift determinations existed for several of the co-detections.
Wherever these occurred, we used the redshift reported in Hilton
et al. (2021) since these generally included newer and more complete data, and correspondingly smaller uncertainties.
We highlight in Figure 2 a few prominent co-detections. Additionally, we compare the SZ masses for a number of ACT
clusters to those from the literature in Appendix B. Overall, the
masses inferred from these targeted observations agree within
1σ with the ACT-inferred mass estimates. One noteworthy exception is that of MOO J1142+1527, where the mass estimates

using Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) (Gonzalez et al. 2019a), New IRAM Kids Arrays (NIKA2)+CARMA (Ruppin et al. 2020), ACT, and MUSTANG2 (Dicker et al. 2020) differ at approximately the 2σ level.
We note that Moravec et al. (2020) report this cluster as an ongoing merger, and that it may require multiple SZ components to
describe. In Figure 3, we show the data used to infer scaling relations using CARMA and MUSTANG2 (Gonzalez et al. 2019a;
Dicker et al. 2020, respectively). A notable feature evident in
this figure is that, for the ACT co-detections as well as the clusters from the previous SZ follow-up campaigns, there appears
to be a bimodal split in the SZ mass of the high λ15 systems.
The effect may be in part due to merging and pre-merger systems, which can have low SZ signals for their richness (Dicker
et al. 2020). The suggestion of bimodal behavior in Figure 3 becomes more evident in Figure 4, in which the SZ signals of the
entire MaDCoWS catalog as measured with ACT are plotted.
The masses of the high richness (λ15 & 55) systems cluster into
two branches, one higher 2̃0 and higher slope, and one lower 2̃0
and lower slope. High resolution follow-up observations of these
clusters could provide insight into whether the bimodality is in
fact due to merger history.

4. Forced Photometry at MaDCoWS Cluster
Candidate Locations
As discussed in Section 2.2, to form the forced photometry catalog we simply record the 2̃0 value in the SZ map at a MaDCoWS candidate location. The resulting distribution of 2̃0 versus λ15 , for the 965 candidates that have reported richness values, is shown in Figure 4. The forced photometry catalog has no
SNR limit, i.e., it includes all 965 MaDCoWS cluster candidates
that fall within the ACT survey footprint, excluding those that
fall within masked regions (e.g., due to the dust mask or point
sources, see Hilton et al. 2021). This means that the catalog is
free from SZ-selection bias, and by fitting the 2̃0 values at the
MaDCoWS cluster locations through a Bayesian approach, we
are able to infer the mass-richness relation (see Section 6) while
addressing sample impurity and sources of contamination. Due
to noise in the map, as well as radio or dusty sources in or near
clusters, the MaDCoWS clusters may have negative 2̃0 values;
we account for this in Sections 5.2, 5.3, and 6.1.
Conversion from 2̃0 to mass was done following Hilton et al.
(2021). We note that there is a small calibration difference between our masses and those of Gonzalez et al. (2019a); they used
the Andersson et al. (2011) scaling relation, while our work uses
the Arnaud et al. (2010) scaling relation. The difference between
these two should be . 5% (Andersson et al. 2011), which is
subdominant to other sources of uncertainty in our main results
(Section 6.3).
We verified the presence of SZ signal, on average, by stacking the ACT SZ maps on the MaDCoWS candidate locations.
For this, we used the Pixell software suite.5 We removed candidates outside the ACT footprint or lacking a richness estimate,
as well as co-detections to ensure that the signal would not be
dominated by known ACT clusters, after which 984 clusters remained for stacking. We divided these clusters into richness bins
as shown in Figure 5, starting at a richness of λ15 > 10. There
are only 28 clusters in the remaining 984 with λ15 ≤ 10, and the
signal in this stack is consistent with 0 to within 1σ. In each bin,
we then stacked 200 × 200 cutout maps, centered on the MaDCoWS cluster positions. The results are shown in Figure 5. We

(10 < λ ≤ 20) contains 191 cluster candidates; the stack on
this bin is consistent with zero signal. In each of the remaining
bins there is a clear detection at ≥ 3σ. See Table 1 for the exact
2̃0 signals.

5. Mass Estimate Biases and Corrections
The targeted SZ follow-up in e.g., Gonzalez et al. (2019a), Di
Mascolo et al. (2020) and Dicker et al. (2020) mainly probes
the high-richness tail in the distribution, and hence may present
both Malmquist and Eddington biases (see e.g., Malmquist 1922;
Kelly 2007) in the richness selection. Moreover, the CARMA
sample exhibits a Malmquist bias in its SZ flux measurements;
as noted in Gonzalez et al. (2019a), the CARMA sample was

the redshift of each candidate. The black points indicate the average 2̃0 in bins of richness. Note that these are not quite the same

they were not included. The binned 2̃0 uncertainties were computed via bootstrapping, while the λ15 error bars simply show

constructed by performing shallower observations of the higher
richness objects, based on the expectation that the integration
times should be shorter, and only reported the results for robust
detections. Correcting for these biases was one of the prime motivations of this paper. Since the MaDCoWS clusters were not
SZ selected, it is unnecessary to de-boost our 2̃0 or mass estimates. However, three primary effects still need to be corrected
in the forced photometry mass estimates:
Article number, page 6 of 25

Firstly, the cluster locations that MaDCoWS reports are the
peaks of a smoothed galaxy density map; the identified cluster
location can be offset from the center of the cluster mass, and
hence the center of the SZ signal (George et al. 2012; Sehgal
et al. 2013; Viola et al. 2015), which leads to a suppression of
the SZ signal. This scatter can be due to measurement uncertainty of the cluster's MaDCoWS centroid (∼ 1500 in each of RA
and DEC, Gonzalez et al. 2019a, section 5.3) or SZ peak (1.50
total Hilton et al. 2021) or it can be due to astrophysical reasons,
i.e., the hot, virialized gas which is responsible for the SZ signal
may not have the same spatial distribution as the galaxy number
density used to determine the MaDCoWS centroid (George et al.
2012; Sehgal et al. 2013; Viola et al. 2015). Either way, the result
is that for a set of clusters, stacking on the optical centroids produces a signal which is suppressed as compared to stacking on
their SZ peak locations, which Ge et al. (2019) have found to be
around the ≈ 10% level. This agrees with the typical suppression
that we find in Section 5.1.
Secondly, the matched filter used in the forced photometry
method as described in Section 4 cannot account for compact
sources at cluster locations. If emission from compact sources,
such as radio sources or dust, reduces the 98 and/or the 150 GHz
emission, the effect will be to bias the 2̃0 estimate low; the emission 'in-fills' the SZ decrement causing the mass estimate from
forced photometry to be biased low. The significantly negative
2̃0 clusters (see Figure 4) suggest that this might be occurring.
Further, stacking the f220 maps on the MaDCoWS candidate locations produces a significant positive signal which is not present
when stacking on the ACT cluster locations. We ascribe this
excess to dusty sub-mm emission spatially correlated with the
MaDCoWS cluster locations. Stacks on ACT and MaDCoWS
cluster locations at radio frequencies show that the ACT clusters have higher observed radio flux density on average (Section 5.3). As such, the source of the excess MaDCoWS 224 GHz
emission is likely not radio. From the f220 stacks and similar
stacks on the H-ATLAS maps, we find that the MaDCoWS candidates have more significant in-fill at sub-mm wavelengths than
the general population of ACT clusters. Further, we find that the
spectral form of the sub-mm emission in the MaDCoWS cluster
stacks is well described by a gray-body (Equation 5). Such infill is typically due to dusty submillimeter galaxies (e.g., Casey
et al. 2014). We combined the stacks on the f220 and H-ATLAS
data set to estimate this contamination and remove it from the
mass-richness scaling relation (see Section 5.2).
Thirdly and finally, in Section 5.3 we consider the effect of
contamination at radio wavelengths on the MaDCoWS cluster
candidates. Bright radio contamination, while declining at mm
wavelengths, could potentially remain relatively significant at 98

Fig. 5: Stacks on MaDCoWS cluster positions in bins of richness on the ACT 2̃0 maps. The color bar scale is in units of 2̃0 . Due
to the order of magnitude difference in scale maximum between bins, the scaling is not consistent between plots. While there is no
detection in the 10 < λ15 ≤ 20 bin, there is a clear signal in all the other bins. The red circle indicates the central 2.40 in diameter.

To correct for suppression of the SZ signals due to positional offsets in MaDCoWS-determined cluster centroids as compared to
the ACT determined centroids, we stacked the 2̃0 maps on the 96
ACT/MaDCoWS co-detections twice, once on the ACT identified cluster locations and once on the MaDCoWS identified location. At each cluster location, we created a 200 square submap of
the 2̃0 map centered on the cluster location. We normalized each
submap to have unity amplitude, so that the suppression was not
dominated by the particular scatter of the brightest clusters. We
performed this stacking analysis on clusters with measured richness greater than 20, divided into 5 bins of even richness range.
This left only about 15 clusters in each bin, leading to relatively
large uncertainties as shown in Figure 6.
To compute the suppression, for each of the stacks above we
computed the aperture δT cmb within a 1.20 radius of the stack
center. For a given richness bin, the ratio of this statistic for the
MaDCoWS centered stacks to the ACT centered ones sets the
suppression. We computed the variance via bootstrapping. We
then fit the richness/suppression relation to a sigmoid model of

Fig. 7: Average 224 GHz emission for MaDCoWS (blue) and
ACT (orange) clusters. MaDCoWS clusters were binned in richness, while the ACT clusters were binned in mass. Richness is
plotted on the lower x-axis while mass is plotted on the upper;
the two scales are not equivalent, and are simply coplotted for
convenience. Error bars were estimated via bootstrapping. The
MaDCoWS clusters show a statistically significant excess emission at 224 GHz on the whole, while the ACT clusters show a
small decrement. In neither the ACT nor the MaDCoWS clusters
is there a trend with mass or richness. The dashed lines indicate
the average 224 GHz emission across all MaDCoWS (blue) and
ACT (orange) clusters. We attribute the signal from the MaDCoWS cluster candidates at 224 GHz to IR emission, and follow
up with Herschel data (Section 5.2).
a richness dependent prior on that suppression parameter (Section 6.2).
5.2. sub-mm Emission

Since the SZ effect at the frequencies of interest (98 and
150 GHz) manifests as a decrement of the CMB temperature,
there is the potential that dusty, sub-mm sources could fill in
or partially suppress the SZ signal. It is also known that dusty
sub-mm galaxies (e.g., Erler et al. 2018), as well as radio AGN
(considered in the next section), frequently reside within the centers of clusters, where feedback processes are strongest (see e.g.
Coble et al. 2007; Sayers et al. 2013; Gralla et al. 2014; Zakamska et al. 2019; Gralla et al. 2020).
To determine if the SZ signals of the MaDCoWS candidates
are suppressed by a dusty contribution, we stacked the f220 maps
on the MaDCoWS centers. The f220 map was matched filtered in
the same way as the 2̃0 map to remove point sources, maintaining
consistency. We then stacked the f220 maps on both the ACT (all
4195) and MaDCoWS (all 1572 in the ACT footprint) cluster
positions and computed the aperture flux density in units of δT cmb
within the 1.20 radius of the stack center, corresponding to the
ACT cluster finder reference filter scale of 2.40 .
We used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainty in this
measure. We found that for the MaDCoWS clusters, the signal
was 8.9 ± 1.2 μK, while for the stack on ACT clusters, the signal was −2.3 ± 0.6 μK, where the units are δT cmb . Additionally,
we binned both the MaDCoWS and ACT data into 6 bins. For
the MaDCoWS clusters, we binned them in richness, while for
the ACT, we binned them in cluster mass. We then repeated the
analysis using these bins. The results are shown in Figure 7. For

both the MaDCoWS and ACT clusters, there is no obvious trend
in 224 GHz flux density with richness or mass, respectively. The
excess emission in the MaDCoWS clusters we attribute to dust
emission. The decrement in 224 GHz emission from the ACT
clusters may be due to a small bias in the cluster finder algorithm; since the CMB serves as a source of noise when searching
for the SZ signal, the algorithm preferentially finds clusters in
regions of lower primary CMB signal (i.e., 'cold spots'). Therefore, when stacking on the f220 maps, the result is a preferential
stack on regions of low 224 GHz emission, leading to a decrement.
To quantify the dust emission, we stacked on the MaDCoWS
cluster locations in the H-ATLAS maps (Valiante et al. 2016;
Smith et al. 2017). For comparison, we also stacked the maps
on ACT cluster locations and a sample of random locations generated by offsetting each MaDCoWS cluster location by 50 in a
random direction. Due to the small size of the H-ATLAS survey,
we were only able to perform this analysis for 34 ACT clusters and 66 MaDCoWS cluster candidates, limiting our ability
to determine if the in-fill has a richness or mass dependence. In
order to compare with the emission at 224 GHz, we first converted each of the 250, 350, and 500 μm maps to MJy/pixel and
then smoothed to 1.00 (i.e. the ACT 220 GHz resolution) using
a Gaussian kernel with the integral normalized to unity. We then
stacked these maps on the MaDCoWS and ACT cluster locations using inverse-noise weighting and calculated the aperture
flux density within 1.20 of the stack center, i.e., in the central
2.40 diameter corresponding to the reference filter scale used in
Hilton et al. (2021). We computed the uncertainty in each stack
via bootstrapping. For the ACT and randoms stack, the signal
was consistent with zero; for the MaDCoWS there was a statistically significant excess (see Figure 8). We converted the average fluctuation of δT cmb in the 224 GHz stack described above
to emission (in MJy sr−1 ) using the derivative of the blackbody
function (see e.g. Mroczkowski et al. 2019):

where T cmb = 2.7255 K is the monopole temperature of

monopole, and x = (hν)/(kB T cmb ) ≈ ν/(56.8 GHz) is the dimensionless frequency. The normalization factor of the primary

ACT, and MaDCoWS samples, respectively. At 350 μm, those surface brightnesses are respectively 0.05 ± 0.05, 0.08 ± 0.08,

0.09±0.06 MJy/sr for the randoms, ACT, and MaDCoWS. The statistically higher MaDCoWS emission at each Herschel frequency,

blackbody function. To account for the effect of redshift, we fit
using the rest frame frequencies, which we converted from the
observed frequencies by multiplying by (1 + hzi) = 2.08, with
hzi the average z for the subsample of MaDCoWS clusters in the
H-ATLAS region for which there are photometric redshifts. We
assumed a Gaussian function for the likelihood and estimated the
uncertainties in our fit parameters using a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method, implemented in the emcee (ForemanMackey et al. 2013) package. We placed flat, uninformative priors on T , A, and β, enforcing 0 K ≤ T < 200 K, −1 < A < 1,
and −5 < β < 10. Results of the fit are presented in Figure 9.
Subfigure 9a shows the data with error bars in black, the best fit
in blue, and the 68 and 95% confidence limits. In Subfigure 9b
we show constraints on the fit parameters T rest , β, and A.
We find that for the MaDCoWS clusters in the H-ATLAS
footprint, the best fit temperature is T = 28+4
−3 K. This is in
good agreement with other measurements of the dust properties
of IR/optical selected clusters (see e.g. Smith et al. 2013; Erler
et al. 2018; Amodeo et al. 2021; Fuzia et al. 2021; Vavagiakis
et al. 2021). Our constraint on the dust emission spectral index,
+0.3
β = 1.9−0.2
is somewhat higher than other measurements, but
does agree within uncertainties (see e.g. Magnelli et al. 2012;
Smith et al. 2013; Sayers et al. 2019).
When performing the mass-richness scaling relation fit, we
repeated the analysis above by including the dust model in the
full joint probability distribution. This allowed for accounting
of degeneracies between the dust model parameters and other
parameters; see Section 6.1.
To get an estimate of the level of bias due to dusty emission in-filling the SZ signal in MaDCoWS cluster candidates,
we converted the modeled emission at 98 GHz (77 ± 3 μJy) and
150 GHz (370 ± 50 μJy) to Compton y via

We then weighted the computed 2̃0 at 98 and 150 GHz by their
average relative contributions to 2̃0 (≈ 66 and 33%, respectively)
and compared that weighted average to the 2̃0 signal for a 2 ×
1014 M cluster at redshift of 1, following Hilton et al. (2021).
We find that the in-fill is 1.5 ± 0.5% for the average MaDCoWS

cluster candidate. The above computation ignores the effects of
the matched filter, which will in general suppress the in-fill for a
source not centered on the cluster, and should be considered an
approximation only.
5.3. Radio Emission

In order to assess and quantify low frequency radio source infill strong enough to impact our 98 and 150 GHz measurements
of the SZ signal, we require constraints on the radio flux density and spectral indices of the source population. Using both
NVSS (1.4 GHz) and VLASS (nominally 3 GHz) allows us to
estimate both. From these surveys (Section 2.4), we evaluate the
distribution of radio in-fill associated with members of the ACT
and MaDCoWS samples. For each cluster there are two statistics with which we are concerned: 1) the intrinsic luminosity of
sources within the cluster in its frame of reference, and 2) the observed flux density in our frame of reference. We are concerned
with the intrinsic radio luminosities as they tell us whether the
ACT and MaDCoWS clusters were drawn from populations with
the same intrinsic radio properties. We must also consider the observed fluxes, as they set the level of radio in-fill in the cluster.
For clarity, whenever we refer to fluxes or surface brightness or
use units of flux density or surface brightness ([Jy] or [Jy/sr]), we
are referring to the observed flux density or surface brightness in
our frame of reference. Whenever we refer to radio luminosities or use units of luminosity ([W/Hz)]), we are referring to the
intrinsic radio luminosity. Our process is to first compute the observed flux density for each cluster, and then convert that into
intrinsic radio luminosity.
To compute the radio flux, for each cluster we produced a
cutout image (postage stamp) of the NVSS map centered at the
cluster position and smoothed it to 10 to match the ACT 224 GHz
beam scale, in order to account for the effect of smoothing by the
ACT beam on the f220 maps. We then calculate the aperture flux
density in the central 1.20 radius of the smoothed stamps. Additionally, for each stamp we estimate the local background flux
density by computing the 1.20 radius aperture flux density at 20
random locations in the stamp lying outside the central aperture
and taking the median. We then subtracted the background flux
density from the central flux density to form an estimate of the

of the ACT and MaDCoWS radio fluxes in NVSS. For ACT, we

(c) 1.4 GHz Cumulative Histogram

Fig. 10: Histograms of the 1.4 GHz aperture flux density of the
ACT (Figure 10a) and MaDCoWS (Figure 10b) cluster catalogs.
Figure 10c shows the normalized cumulative histogram of the
same data, cut at the aperture noise of 0.3 mJy, to better illustrate the difference in in-fill between the two samples. The fluxes
shown are all for a 1.20 radius aperture, while the percentage infill is the approximate in-fill of the SZ signal as described in Section 7.1.2. Note that due to differences in average redshift and
spectral index of the ACT and MaDCoWS clusters, the same
measured flux density at 1.4 GHz does not correspond to the
same percentage in-fill. The ACT clusters show on average significantly more radio in-fill at 1.4 GHz than their MaDCoWS
analogues.

confusion limit of 2.5 mJy in both data sets, we proceed to compute a spectral index α. However, in order to compute α, one
requires more precise knowledge of the flux-weighted band center νvlass for the wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz) VLASS data. For
example, if the measured flux density in VLASS is lower than
the flux density one would find by assuming a fiducial spectral
index, the resulting α is steeper, and νvlass will shift lower than
that initially assumed; if the flux density is higher, α is flatter, and
νvlass shifts higher. This leads us to rely on a recursive or iterative
approach when estimating νvlass and the resulting α. Assuming a
flat instrument passband from 2-4 GHz and emission of the form
S ν = C0 να for C0 the amplitude and α the spectral index, we
compute the flux-weighted band average as:

Note that we assume the passband to be flat for simplicity.
For a given cluster with a measured radio flux density in both
the NVSS and VLASS surveys, we first computed the spectral
index using the nominal VLASS band center of 3 GHz.6 Using
that spectral index and Equation 7, we computed a new VLASS
band center. We then calculated a new spectral index using this
band center, and repeated the process until the difference between consecutive spectral indices was > 0.1%. The uncertainty
on the spectral index was computed from the fluxes (S ) and uncertainties (σ) following, for example, Zajaček et al. (2019), as
σα =

1
| log (νnvss /νvlass )|

p

(σnvss /S nvss )2 + (σvlass /S vlass )2 .

(8)

The population of spectral indices and fluxes that was generated
in this manner was then used to correct the mass-richness
scaling relation as described in Section 6.2. For both the ACT
and MaDCoWS clusters, we find a fairly broad distribution
of spectral indices computed between 1.4 and 3 GHz, with
mean for the MaDCoWS candidates of hαMaDCoWS i = −0.9 and
standard deviation σα = 0.7, and mean for the ACT clusters of
hαACT i = −1.2 and standard deviation σα = 0.8. These mean
spectral indices are broadly consistent with values typically
found for radio AGN (Coble et al. 2007; Sayers et al. 2013),
though we note our spectral index is also consistent with that
found for star-forming regions (typically α < −0.6; see Calistro
Rivera et al. 2017), so we cannot conclude whether AGN or star
formation dominates the observed radio spectra.
Similarly to Section 5.2, we computed the bias in the measured SZ signal due to radio in-fill of the ACT and MaDCoWS
clusters. We computed the in-fill percentage twice, once assuming our measured average spectral index of αmeas = −0.91 and the
other assuming a typical radio spectra of αtyp = −0.7. We refer to
the in-fill percentages assuming their respective spectral indices
as smeas and styp , respectively. The high uncertainty on this number and strong dependence of the 98 and 150 GHz flux density
on α mean that the bias for a specific cluster can vary quite a bit
depending on its spectral index. For example, a 100 mJy source
at 1.4 GHz with a spectral index of −0.91 produces a decrement
of about 10%, while one with a spectral index of −1.2 produces
only about 3%, and one with a spectral index of −0.7 produces

Here we define spectral index such that negative values for α show
the typical behavior of declining at higher frequencies (i.e., the flux density S ν ∝ (ν/ν0 )α ).

a 26% in-fill, assuming M = 2 × 1014 M , z = 1. For the MaDCoWS clusters, we continue to use the reference cluster with
M = 2 × 1014 M , z = 1 to compute the in-fill. For the ACT
clusters, we use their individual measured masses and redshifts.
Extrapolating flux density using spectral indices derived at 1.4
and 3.0 GHz out to 98 and 150 GHz can be risky not only due
to the uncertainty in the spectral index but also because it is not
assured that the index is consistent between those two frequency
ranges. Sayers et al. (2013) found that spectral indices for radio
galaxies in large clusters were generally consistent when computed between 1.4 and 30 GHz and 30 and 140 GHz, so that as
an estimate it is justified to use the measured spectral indices to
extrapolate our flux densities from 1.4 to 98 and 150 GHz. For
precise determination of the radio in-fill, multi-frequency observations near 98 and 150 GHz will be required to determine the
effective spectral index of sources near the SZ frequencies.
The average in-fill for an ACT cluster is smeas = 0.8 ± 0.03%
and styp = 2.0 ± 0.1%, while for the MaDCoWS cluster candidates the average in-fill is smeas = 0.45 ± 0.05% and styp =
0.83 ± 0.05%. However, while the average bias is quite low, for
an appreciable number of the clusters the bias is non-negligible.
For the 95th percentile of ACT clusters, smeas = 7.0 ± 0.5% and
styp = 18±1%. We note that of the nine MaDCoWS clusters with
2̃0 < −0.5, 5 had significant radio in-fill (flux density & 20 mJy
at 1.4 GHz), including five of the top six with most negative 2̃0 ,
suggesting that the significantly negative 2̃0 measurements could
be due to radio in-fill. For example, one such cluster with very
negative 2̃0 , MOO J2247+0507, has a flux density at 1.4 GHz of
160 ± 1 mJy and α = −0.61 ± 0.8 (its measured α) and z = 1.02;
assuming it has a mass of 2 × 1014 M , the bias at 98 GHz is
sJ2247 = 70 ± 17%, where the uncertainties have been propagated
from the flux density uncertainty only.
We emphasize that we have not included the effect of the
matched filter, so the numbers presented above represent only an
approximation of the effect of the in-fill. Further, since our radio
fluxes were computed using aperture photometry, the measured
fluxes and spectral indices are averages for all compact sources
in the cluster. High resolution, multi-frequency follow-up of
cluster candidates would be required to precisely remove this
in-fill.
Consistent with the above, we computed the intrinsic radio
luminosities. To do so, we assumed a simple power law of the
form S ν = C0 να . This then leads to the usual K-correction;
K(z) = (1 + z)−(1+α) for redshift z. The intrinsic luminosity at
frequency ν1 can then be computed from the observed flux density S ν2 at frequency ν2 using the luminosity distance DL (z):
!α
4πDL (z)
ν1
Lν1 =
S ν2
(9)
(1 + z)−(1+α) ν2
For convenience we select ν1 to be 1.4 GHz. For each cluster then we calculated its intrinsic luminosity using the NVSS
measured flux, its measured redshift, and the spectral index for
that cluster as computed above. All the ACT clusters have measured redshifts; for the MaDCoWS candidates which do not have
redshifts, we used the mean of the sample, hzi = 1.01. For
clusters which did not have measured spectral indices, we used
the average spectral index of that cluster's catalog, either ACT
(hαACT i = −1.21) or MaDCoWS (hαMaDCoWS i = −0.91). The results are shown in Figure 11. The average luminosity for ACT
clusters is 5.4 ± 0.3 × 1024 W Hz−1 , while for the MaDCoWS
clusters it is 9.1 ± 1.0 × 1024 W Hz−1 , where the statistical uncertainties have been computed via bootstrapping. Restricting

Fig. 11: Intrinsic radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz for ACT (blue,
3341 clusters) and MaDCoWS (orange, 1780 clusters). The red
line shows a 0.3 mJy flux density at 1.4 GHz in the observed
frame of reference converted to 1.4 GHz in the emitted frame of
reference for the given z according to Equation 9, and assuming
a spectral index of −0.91. The choice of 0.3 mJy corresponds to
the variance of the background aperture flux density in the NVSS
maps for a 1.20 radius aperture, and thus roughly corresponds to
the noise floor for our background subtracted fluxes. Therefore,
the red line should guide the eye as to which radio luminosities
are above the noise. Note that many clusters are not shown as
they have very low or negative values for their radio fluxes due
to subtraction of the background.
the ACT clusters to the same redshift range as the MaDCoWS
(0.7 ≤ z ≤ 1.5) raises the average luminosity of ACT clusters
to 6.5 ± 0.7 × 1024 W Hz−1 , suggesting that, even accounting for
redshift, the MaDCoWS clusters are on average more radio loud
than their ACT counterparts, although the average redshift of the
ACT clusters after this restriction (hzi = 0.89) is still lower than
that of the MaDCoWS sample (hzi = 1.01).

6. The SZ Mass-Richness Scaling
Given the results above, we attempt to investigate the MaDCoWS mass-richness scaling relation. In doing so, we hope to
understand if richness provides a good proxy for mass in the
MaDCoWS cluster catalog. Additionally, we address whether
the preliminary mass-richness scaling relation found in Gonzalez et al. (2019a) is consistent with the scaling relation of the
entire MaDCoWS catalog, and whether the full scaling relation
follows self-similarity.
6.1. Regression Technique

We adopt a hierarchical Bayesian approach that builds upon the
work of Kelly (2007) and Sereno (2016), to which we refer for a
thorough discussion of the fitting technique. Here we provide a
summary of key details central to our analysis.
At each step of the modeling process and for each of the clusters within the considered sample, we consider an independent
variable ξ drawn from a mixture of Gaussian probability distributions (Kelly 2007). This corresponds to the true value of the
logarithm of the cluster richness, ln λ. We therefore fit richness
Article number, page 12 of 25

as ln λ, which is related to the observed richness λobs through a
Poisson probability distribution, P(λobs |ξ) = P(eξ ).
In a similar manner to richness, we fit the mass as ln M. We
define the dependent quantity η as the true value of the logarithm
of the cluster mass, ln M, which we assume to be connected to
the independent variable ξ through a normal probability distribution P(η|ξ) with mean
hη|ξi = p0 + p1 ξ,

(10)

and variance corresponding to the intrinsic scatter of the true
quantities about the mean scaling relation. Given the definition
of the variables ξ and η, our choice of probability distribution
is equivalent to using a log-normal model for describing the relation between the true mass and richness for a given cluster.
Following e.g., Evrard et al. (2014) and Simet et al. (2017), it is
hence possible to express the variance due to intrinsic scatter as
Var(ln M|λ) = σ2int =

p21
+ σ2ln M|λ .
λ

(11)

Here, the first term on the right-hand side accounts for the contribution to the total scatter due to Poisson noise on richness,
while the second term describes the scatter inherent to the independent variable η = ln M. This is introduced to account for any
additional deviation from the reconstructed scaling that is not
accounted for in the observational uncertainties or intrinsic variable properties (e.g., due to unknown biases in the considered
observables).
In principle, it should be possible to define a relation between the measured masses and the scattered dependent variable
η through a normal distribution centered on eη and with variance
equal to the observational uncertainties on the measured mass
Mobs ,
P(Mobs |η) = N(eη , σ2M ).

(12)

However, Figure 12 shows that multiple data points from the
compiled forced photometry catalog manifest negative values for
the central Compton 2̃0 , corresponding to an unphysical negative
cluster mass. In the case of low-mass clusters, with SZ signal
below the sensitivity threshold of the ACT maps, noise fluctuations can cause this negative 2̃0 . However, as discussed in previous sections, radio sources as well as dust are found to contaminate the SZ signal of the clusters, leading to clusters with
significantly negative 2̃0 . Further, in Section 5.1 we show that
miscentering effects may provide a significant suppression of the
measured central Compton 2̃0 with respect to the true value. In
order to properly account for such contributions, we compare the
true scattered quantities η to the central Compton parameter 2̃0
computed separately from the f090 and f150 maps. In particular,
we assume the joint probability distribution to be described by a
bivariate normal distribution,
P(2f090 , 2f150 |ξ, η, θradio , θdust ) = N 2D ({ ff090 , ff150 }, Σ).

where 2f090 and 2f150 are 2̃0 derived exclusively from the f090
and f150 maps, respectively. Here, the covariance matrix Σ is
expressed as

2̃0 converted to mass versus richness, while the right panel is a linear plot of unconverted 2̃0 versus richness. On left and center,
the best-fit scaling relation is shown as computed when including (blue) and excluding (yellow-orange) the weight parameter of
Equation 16 corresponding to noise-like data points. For each band, the solid line corresponds to the best-fit scaling, while the bands
correspond to the 68% credible interval. The lighter blue band denotes the confidence interval σln M|λ due to the intrinsic scatter
around the mean scaling relation obtained when considering the mixed model of Equation 16. The dot-dashed line denotes the
scaling reported by Gonzalez et al. (2019a), with the solid section marking the range of richness employed to derive the relation.
The green points correspond to the masses or 2̃0 values without any correction for the steepness of the halo mass function (Hilton
et al. 2021). These are color-coded according to their weight w (color bar in the bottom right corner of the right panel). In red are

computed by Madhavacheril et al. (2020) from CMB lensing, shown at the mean value of λ15 used in that work. Note that the left
and center plots do not show the negative 2̃0 points, but those points are included in all fits shown.
frequency maps after filtering. The mean term is given by
fν = fν (ξ, η, θradio , θdust )
= c(ξ) * mν (η) + gν [dν (θdust ) + rν (θradio )] .

(15)

The first term on the right hand side is the product of the miscentering suppression factor c(ξ) (Section 5.1) and the massto-Compton 2 conversion mν (η) in Equation 5 of Hilton et al.
(2021). All the factors entering Equation 15 (i.e. the relativistic
SZ correction and the filter mismatch factor) are computed from
the specific sets of cluster masses at each step of the modeling
process. The terms in parentheses, dν (θdust = {A, β, T rest }) and
rν (θradio = {C0 , α}), provide the estimates of the level of dust and
radio in-fill at the considered frequency, based on the respective
spectral properties discussed in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3. The
function gν is the non-relativistic spectral dependence of the SZ
effect (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1970; Mroczkowski et al. 2019),
which we adopt to convert the radio and dust surface brightness
values to units of Compton 2. We note that, in order to compute
the in-fill components as in Equation (15) shown above, we are
assuming the radio and dust sources to be described by point-like
signals centered on the cluster centroids.
Finally, we account for possible elements of the MaDCoWS
cluster sample which are not well described by a mass-richness
scaling relation (i.e., for which richness is not a good proxy
for mass) by integrating the probability term described in Equation (13) into a mixture model aimed at evaluating how likely
well each point is to be drawn from a Gaussian centered on
the mass-richness scaling relation versus a Gaussian centered on
zero. For each given point, the total posterior probability distribution can then be written as
Pν,obs = w * Ptrue + (1 − w) * Pnoise ,

(16)

where the weight, w, is the probability that a data point is drawn
by the mass-richness scaling relation versus the noise-like population, and Ptrue = P(2f090 , 2f150 |ξ, η, θradio , θdust ) is the joint probability distribution introduced in Equation 14 for a data point that
follows the mass-richness scaling relation. We instead assume
the noise-like measurements to be drawn from Pnoise , for which
we assume a normal distribution centered around zero and with
standard deviation equal to the observational uncertainty associated with the ỹc value of the considered measurement.
6.2. Parameter Priors

Overall, our model comprises 965+12+3+3 free parameters,
specifically corresponding to:
– the weight for each of the 965 data points entering the mixed
probability distribution of Equation (16);
– twelve parameters associated with three Gaussian kernels
used for building the probability mixture discussed at the beginning of Section 6.1 (see Kelly 2007 and Sereno 2016 for
details);
– slope, intercept, and intrinsic scatter of the mass-richness
scaling relation;
– parameters of the graybody spectrum discussed in Section 5.2.
In addition, for every data point we marginalize over a set of four
additional parameters, governing the effects due to mis-centering
(see Section 5.1) and radio and dust contamination. The regression is performed by means of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm provided in the NumPyro (Bingham et al. 2018; Phan
et al. 2019) Python package. The implementation of the Gaussian mixture model follows the same prescriptions adopted in
Kelly (2007). We use uninformative uniform priors on all the
Article number, page 13 of 25

A&A proofs: manuscript no. MaDCoWS

parameters of the scaling relation except for the slope p1 , for
which we consider a Student-t distribution with one degree of
freedom following Andreon & Hurn (2010) and Sereno (2016),
as the Student-t does not bias the slope to high values. We then
assume the probability weight w to be distributed uniformly in
the range [0, 1].
The suppression factor due to miscentering for each of the
considered clusters is modeled as a truncated normal distribution, bound between
p 0 and 1, with mode equal to 1 and standard
deviation σ = π2 (c0 + c1 eξ ). The parameters c0 and c1 correspond to thepbest-fit parameters derived in Section 5.1, while the
pre-factor π2 is introduced so that the mean of the prior distribution equals the average suppression c0 + c1 eξ for a given true
richness eξ = λ.
For the clusters with a clear identification of radio sources
in the NVSS and VLASS fields, we employ normal priors on
the estimated normalization C0 and spectral index α parameters,
with mean and standard deviation set to the values derived for the
specific cluster. Otherwise, we draw for each cluster a realization
of C0 from an exponential distribution with mean equal to the
average flux density measured from all the sources in the NVSS
catalog. An analogous approach is considered for α, but used a
normal prior with mean and standard deviations measured from
the distribution of spectral indices estimated in Section 5.3.
Instead of introducing priors on the single parameters of the
dust spectrum (Section 5.2), which would have neglected information on their degeneracy, we re-analyze the ACT 224 GHz
and Herschel stacked measurements jointly with the mass and
richness data. For full consistency, we consider exactly the same
priors employed in Section 5.2.

6.4. Cluster Weights

From the results of the mass-richness fit including the probability term, it is clear that an appreciable fraction of the MaDCoWS candidates are not well described by the mass-richness
scaling relation (Figure 13); in other words, for a large subset of
the MaDCoWS catalog, richness is not a good proxy for mass.
Of the 965 candidates used in the fitting, only 419 had a weight
greater than 50%; only 131 have a weight greater than 65%. The
mean weight is 50.2%. Since we do not have an estimate of the
uncertainties on individual weights, we do not place an uncertainty on these statistics. Moreover, while the mean does not
fully encapsulate the bimodal distribution of the cluster probabilities, it does indicate that the MaDCoWS sample is likely
comprised largely of cluster candidates which are well below
the SZ detection limit of the ACT survey. Examining the distribution of the probabilities, we see a clearly bimodal distribution (Figure 13). One population, containing the majority of the
clusters, is roughly normally distributed, centered on a probability of ≈ 50%. The other is centered at a higher probability of
≈ 70% with a much narrower distribution. In general, clusters
with high significance 2̃0 [] and richness are given higher probabilities, while those with lower 2̃0 , and specifically high richness
and low 2̃0 , are given lower probabilities. Further examining Figure 13, it is evident that the MaDCoWS sample is well described
by a mass-richness scaling relation above λ15 & 55, with 50%
of such clusters having a weight w > 0.7, and an average weight
for clusters above that richness of 0.63%. Additionally, all the
high weight (w > 70%) clusters have λ15 > 27. Interestingly, examining the probabilities of individual cluster candidates reveals
that the fitter identifies a number of the very negative 2̃0 clusters,
seen in the right hand panel of Figure 12, as having high weight:
these clusters have significant (' 25 mJy) flux density at 1.4 or
3.0 GHz.

6.3. Scaling Relation Results

In Figure 12 we show the mass-richness scaling relation reconstructed from the ACT+MaDCoWS sample. As the selection of
the clusters is unbiased with respect to the Eddington bias, we
consider here the cluster masses without any correction for the
steepness of the halo mass function. We note that, in this case,
the reported masses represent an upper limit for the actual distribution, as the correction would de-boost the high-mass end of
the sample.
For the model including the weight parameter from Equation 16, we find that the best fit slope to be κ = 1.84+0.15
−0.14 , where
M ∝ λκ15 . This slope is consistent with Gonzalez et al. (2019a),
although with an overall offset towards lower masses. Setting
all the weights to unity (that is, assuming all clusters are drawn
from the mass-richness scaling relation) leads to a slightly higher
slope estimate (1.95+0.17
−0.16 ), as well as a greater overall offset as
compared to Gonzalez et al. (2019a).
Regarding the intrinsic scatter of the forced photometry data
points (see Equation (11) and related description), we estimate
σln M|λ = 0.21+0.08
−0.11 when including the weight parameter of Equation 16 to account for sample contamination. Although already
evident from the distribution of the ACT data points in the massrichness distribution in relation to the scaling relation by Gonzalez et al. (2019a), such a large scatter provides a quantitative
view of the limited capabilities of the MaDCoWS richness to
provide a robust proxy for cluster masses. A similar scatter of
0.31+0.03
−0.03 is found even when removing the negative Compton 2̃0
measurements from the fit.

7. Discussion
7.1. Population Differences

The MaDCoWS sample comprises 2839 candidate high-z clusters, while the ACT DR5 sample comprises a nearly masslimited, optically-confirmed sample of 4195 clusters from across
all redshifts. As noted in Section 3, our cross-matching criteria
leads to a catalog of 96 co-detected clusters at the intersection of
the ACT and MaDCoWS samples, reported in Table C.1.
We compared both richness and M500 measurements at different redshift ranges between the ACT and MaDCoWS populations. In Figure 14, we plot the distribution of co-detections and
MaDCoWS across four redshift ranges. We can see that there
is no preferred redshift for the co-detected clusters with high
richness. Figure 15 shows that ACT clusters are mostly found
at z < 0.9, regardless of mass. We also see that MaDCoWS clusters as a whole tend to be lower in richness (and hence mass)
than co-detected clusters, but are found more frequently at higher
redshifts than ACT clusters. This is not unexpected, as the lower
average mass of clusters at higher redshifts means that they are
detected relatively less frequently. The MaDCoWS masses are
from forced photometry, and we have cut off clusters with 2̃0
< 0.
The low rate by ACT of co-detections of MaDCoWS cluster
candidates is due to the low SZ signal of many of those candidates, which is reflected in their correspondingly low weight. We
discuss possible sources of this low weight in Section 7.3.1. As
for the low rate by MaDCoWS of co-detections of ACT clus-

weight is the probability that a MaDCoWS cluster data point
is well described by a mass-richness scaling relation, as opposed
to being drawn from the noise. Higher probabilities mean more
likely to be real. The bimodal distribution is clear, with a large
population of low probability clusters centered around 50% and
a population of high probability clusters at ≈ 70%.

MaDCoWS and the remaining MaDCoWS in four redshift bins.
At higher richness (λ15 > 60), there is no preferred redshift for
the co-detections. This indicates that the disparity between the
number of MaDCoWS in the ACT region and the number of codetections is not a product of survey biases.
ters, it is likely that the MaDCoWS catalog is missing them simply due to the MaDCoWS selection function. By construction,
the MaDCoWS selection function does not precisely trace the
Spitzer measured richness; the MaDCoWS cluster candidates are
first selected from smoothed galaxy density maps created using
WISE data, and then their MaDCoWS richnesses are measured
using Spitzer follow-up. As such, the catalog is not richness lim-

skewed towards lower redshifts, while the MaDCoWS distribution is even across higher redshifts. In addition, MaDCoWS clusters tend to be less massive than ACT clusters, at a given redshift.
ited, meaning that even under the assumption of some relation
between mass and richness, the MaDCoWS cluster catalog cannot strictly be mass-limited. In any case, the MaDCoWS cluster
catalog, while astrophysically interesting, should be approached
with caution for computing cosmological parameters.
7.1.1. IR and Dusty Emission

The Herschel data, in combination with the ACT 224 GHz data,
suggest that the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster catalogs comprise
clusters with different properties and are potentially drawn from
different populations; one, dustier population is preferentially
sampled by the MaDCoWS survey, and the other, more virialized, is preferentially sampled by ACT as described below. As
was discussed in Section 5.2, the stacked H-ATLAS data on
MaDCoWS clusters show a clear signal in each frequency band,
whereas there is no obvious signal when stacking on the ACT
clusters (see Figure 16). In addition to the stacked emission, we
also considered the emission for individual clusters. For each
cluster in the H-ATLAS footprint in each of the ACT (34 clusters in the H-ATLAS footprint), MaDCoWS (66 clusters), and
randoms (66 clusters) catalog (see Section 5.2), we calculated
emission within 1.20 radius of the cluster location at each of 250,
350, and 500 μm. A histogram of those values is shown in Figure 8.
A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test was applied
to determine whether the central emission of ACT and MaDCoWS data sets was consistent with the central emission at random points and with each other. At all Herschel frequencies the
distribution of MaDCoWS cluster central emissions is statistically inconsistent with that of the randomly offset central emissions and with that of the ACT clusters. The distribution of ACT
cluster central emissions is statistically consistent with the randomly offset central emissions at 500 μm, while it is inconsistent
at a p-value of 0.018 and 0.016 at 250 and 350 μm, respectively.
The average central emission of the MaDCoWS cluster samples
is more than one standard deviation higher than the average central emission of the randomly offset clusters at all frequencies.
For the ACT clusters, at all wavelengths the central emission is
statistically consistent with the randomly offset clusters. As evidenced by the goodness-of-fit of the gray-body model as shown

Fig. 16: Stacks at 250, 350, and 500 μm (from left to right) on MaDCoWS (a, b, c) and ACT cluster locations (d, e, f), as well as a
set of random locations (g, h, i), in the H-ATLAS data set. See Section 5.2 for details. The x axis of each plot is aligned with RA,
while the y axis is aligned with declination; both are in units of arcmin. The color bars are in units of MJy sr−1 . The red circles are
1.20 in radius, the scale inside which we assigned excess flux density as being due to the cluster stack.
in Section 5.2, we attribute this emission to the MaDCoWS clusters being dustier on average than the ACT clusters, and identify
two causes for this effect. Firstly, in general clusters at high redshift have a greater proportion of blue galaxies in their cores than
those at low redshift (Butcher & Oemler 1978; Dressler 1980;
Brodwin et al. 2013). As blue galaxies tend to be dustier (Casey
et al. 2014), and the mean redshift of the ACT clusters is lower
than that of the MaDCoWS (∼ 0.5 vs. ∼ 1.01), the MaDCoWS
clusters should be dustier on average. Secondly, at a given redshift, ACT preferentially finds clusters that contain more virialized gas, as virialized gas contributes most strongly to the integrated SZ effect signal (Motl et al. 2005; Poole et al. 2006, 2007;
Wik et al. 2008; Krause et al. 2012).
7.1.2. Radio Emission

The radio data provides additional evidence that the ACT and
MaDCoWS cluster catalogs preferentially sample from two difArticle number, page 16 of 25

ferent populations. As discussed in Section 5.3, the MaDCoWS
clusters have higher intrinsic radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz as
compared to the ACT clusters, even when the ACT clusters are
restricted to the same redshift range as the MaDCoWS candidates. Moreover, performing a two-sample KS test on the ACT
and MaDCoWS radio fluxes at 1.4 GHz confirms that they are
drawn from different populations. To compare the populations,
we first cut the ACT catalog to the same redshift range as the
MaDCoWS catalog: 0.7 < z < 1.5. We then restricted both cluster catalogs to an intrinsic luminosity corresponding to the standard deviation of the background aperture fluxes, 0.3 mJy using Equation 9, which roughly represents the noise floor for our
background subtracted fluxes. Since the fluxes for both catalogs
are taken from the same survey, they should have on average
the same noise properties, so that if the non detections are not
removed, they will bias the KS test towards high p-values i.e.,
towards determining that the two samples were drawn from the
same underlying population. When we perform the two-sample

which is not significantly different from the percentage found for
ACT.
Finally, we briefly consider the richness evolution of radio
luminosity fraction. Following Mo et al. (2020), we define a
cluster to be radio loud if the intrinsic luminosity associated with
the cluster is L1.4 GHz ≥ 1025 W Hz−1 , and the radio loud fraction
(RLF) as the fraction of total clusters that are radio loud. For
simplicity we continue to use our 1.20 radial aperture, which corresponds to about 530 to 625 kpc, compared to 500kpc used in
Mo et al. (2020). The effect of this will generally be to raise the
RLF as field radio sources are associated to clusters when they
lie along the line-of-sight of that cluster, which will in turn flatten the richness-RLF relation. We binned the cluster radio luminosities into 8 bins of richness, and calculated the RLF in those
bins, with the uncertainties calculated via bootstrapping. We fit
the resulting data to a linear model using a maximum likelihood
method, with the uncertainties in the parameters estimated via an
MCMC method implemented in emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013). The results of that fit are shown in Figure 17. We find the
−3
best fit slope to be m = 4.1+0.7
and the best fit intercept
−0.7 × 10

−3
to be b = 26−19 × 10 , and the reduced chi-squared of the fit
χr = 0.45. The best fit slope is somewhat higher than Mo et al.
(2020), although only inconsistent at 1.2σ. We are inconsistent
with the null hypothesis of no slope at 5.9σ.

KS test on the ACT and MaDCoWS catalogs with the flux density cut, we obtain p-value of 0.025, which suggests that the
MaDCoWS and ACT clusters with radio sources represent different underlying populations. The above analysis ignores what
proportion of clusters host radio sources. We also consider the
intrinsic luminosities of the ACT and MaDCoWS clusters: we
simply consider the percentage of clusters (still restricted to
0.7 < z < 1.5) which have intrinsic luminosities greater than the
reference aperture flux density 0.3 mJy converted to luminosity
as described above. We used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainties on this number, which is 67.2 ± 1.7% for the ACT
catalog and 58.6 ± 1.0% for the MaDCoWS catalog.
In summary, this analysis suggests that, restricting the ACT
catalog optical photo-redshifts to match those of the MaDCoWS
clusters, the ACT clusters host radio sources slightly more frequently than the MaDCoWS clusters, while the radio sources
hosted by the MaDCoWS clusters are stronger by a factor of
≈ 2. We again note that the mean redshift of the ACT clusters
is still somewhat lower than that of the MaDCoWS (z = 0.89 vs
z = 1.01). Further, any contamination of the MaDCoWS catalog (Section 6.4) would in principle bias both the number density of radio sources and, accordingly, also the average inferred
intrinsic luminosity, to lower values as radio sources are preferentially found in clusters as opposed to the field (Coble et al.
2007). Assuming an unrealistically high contamination of 10%,
to set an upper bound on the percentage of clusters with contamination, and that contaminating candidates have radio sources at
the rate of the field, which we take to be 10% the rate of the true
candidates, we calculate the corrected percentage of MaDCoWS
clusters with aperture flux density > 0.3 mJy as

Fig. 17: Best fit of a linear model to the radio loud fraction (RLF)
of the MaDCoWS clusters determined using NVSS 1.4 GHz
fluxes (Section 5.3) vs richness. The best fit is inconsistent with
the null hypothesis of no evolution of the RLF with richness
at 5.9σ. In comparison to Mo et al. (2020), we favor a higher
slope for the relation at 1.2σ, although see the discussion in Section 7.1.2
is at a low level, in both cases the samples include high in-fill
tails. For example, 94 ACT clusters show radio emission consistent with a greater than 5% bias. Interestingly, that number of
clusters (∼2.8% of the 3, 335 ACT clusters with NVSS fluxes) is
consistent with the best fit differential source counts near clusters found in Coble et al. (2007) (∼2.5%). Of course, the level
of in-fill of the ACT identified clusters is a biased measure of
the true in-fill, as clusters with less in-fill are more likely to meet
the ACT detection threshold for a given intrinsic mass (2̃0 ). For
example, Gupta et al. (2017) estimated that 0.5% and 1.4% of
clusters with mass 3 × 1014 M at redshift of 0.25 had their SZ
signal completely suppressed by in-fill at 150 and 98 GHz, respectively. Moreover, accurately computing the in-fill correction
is difficult; propagating the flux density from lower frequencies
means accepting the uncertainty of extrapolating the spectral index across wide frequency ranges, while CMB measurements at
90 and 150 GHz frequently lack the spacial resolution to distinguish point sources in clusters from the SZ signal of that cluster.
High resolution measurements of the point source flux densities
at or near 90 and 150 GHz offer the best path forward. Dicker
et al. (in prep.) undertook such a measurement using the MUSTANG2 instrument (Dicker et al. 2014) on the 100-meter Green
Bank Telescope to perform 900 resolution imaging of the SZ effect for a sample of galaxy clusters. This high resolution also
allowed them to identify compact sources in the clusters, which
would not be resolved by ACT, and to measure their flux density contributions at 90 GHz in order to assess the impact on SZ
measurements. They found a similar distribution of in-fill, with
85% of clusters showing a change in the integrated SZ flux less
than 5%, but 10% of the sample had very high (> 10%) in-fill.
Further, the level of dust in-fill of the MaDCoWS cluster candidates may be biasing their measured SZ signal. From the model
we developed in Section 5.2, we predict that the average dust infill of the SZ signal is 1.5 ± 0.5%. This result is limited by the
limited IR follow-up available for the MaDCoWS cluster candidates, with Herschel data for only 66 candidates. While the
distribution of the 66 candidates appears normal, we do not have
enough data to rule out deviations from that distribution, e.g., a

high flux density tail. While the effect is subdominant to other
sources of uncertainty in this work, future large optical and IR
surveys (e.g., the Vera C. Rubin observatory (Ivezić et al. 2019)
and the Euclid telescope (Euclid Collaboration et al. 2020)), as
well as next generation CMB experiments, which aim to place
sub-percent constraints on cosmology from cluster abundance
counts, will need to use methods that either address or are insensitive to this in-fill. In the near term, higher resolution measurements, both of the point source flux densities and of their
spectral indices in the frequency ranges of interest, using e.g.,
MUSTANG-2, NIKA2, TolTEC, and Atacama Large Millimeter
Array (ALMA), would enable improved constraints on the in-fill
of the SZ signal by sub-mm and radio sources.
7.3. Mass-Richness Scaling

As noted in Section 6.3, our mass-richness scaling relation differs significantly from self-similarity, although it is consistent
with the previous measurement from Gonzalez et al. (2019a). We
identify several issues which may bias the mass-richness scaling relation to higher slopes. Firstly, at low richness a portion of
the MaDCoWS sample is not well described by a mass-richness
scaling relation. If some number of low richness candidates are
either unvirilialized systems with low SZ signal or line-of-sight
chance superpositions with no intrinsic SZ signal, then the effect
would be to bias the mass-richness relation to higher slopes, as
these candidates would tilt the lower end of the relation downward (see Section 6.3). In a similar vein, if the richness measure is systematically biased to higher values due to line-of-sight
interlopers, then the effect would also be to steepen the massrichness relation. This effect would be especially apparent as a
constant bias in richness is a larger relative effect at lower values for the richness, again having the effect of tilting the scaling
relation slope to steeper values.
We also assessed the impact of in-fill from sub-mm and radio sources on the mass-richness scaling relation. As discussed
in Section 5.2, we did not have enough Herschel sub-mm data to
infer if in-fill scales with richness or mass. Therefore, it is possible that the proportionate in-fill of the SZ signal is higher at low
richness than at high richness. We do, however, have 224 GHz
data of many MaDCoWS clusters, which was used to quantify
the sub-mm/mm source in-fill. We binned the MaDCoWS clusters in richness and stacked the f220 maps in these bins. There
was no trend with richness in the 224 GHz emission, which suggests that the level of sub-mm/mm source in-fill is not strongly
correlated with richness.
Finally, the higher IR emission of the MaDCoWS cluster
candidates is consistent with a gray-body, dusty emission profile,
and in general correlates with higher star formation rates (SFR)
(see e.g., Devlin et al. 2009).These high SFR clusters may deviate from self-similarity, and as such we would not a priori expect
the slope of the mass-richness scaling relation to be unity.
7.3.1. Weights

As discussed in Section 6.4, the weights for the MaDCoWS candidates are split into two populations with a few high weight
clusters (73 with weight > 0.7) and a large number (544) of candidates with low weights (< 0.5). The high weight clusters are
well characterized by a mass-richness scaling relation; the low
weight clusters are not. At very low richness (λ15 < 20) some of
these candidates may be structures smaller than clusters, such as
groups or line-of-sight superpositions.
Article number, page 18 of 25

Additionally, at higher richness, low weight candidates may
be mergers or pre-mergers, or otherwise unvirialized but massive systems. Unvirialized gas in these mergers has been shown
to suppress the SZ signal from these clusters both in simulations
( e.g., Wik et al. 2008; Battaglia et al. 2012; Nelson et al. 2014)
and observations (e.g., Hilton et al. 2018). While the merger can
briefly enhance the SZ signal, the period during which it suppresses it is in general longer than that in which it enhances
it. During the merger process, the SZ signal in a merging system can be suppressed ≈ 40% (Dicker et al. 2020) compared
to a virialized cluster of the same total mass. This has the effect of making the observed SZ mass of the candidate less consistent with the mass-richness scaling relation and more consistent with noise, i.e. the effect is to reduce the weight of the
cluster. In Dicker et al. (2020), which reports on SZ follow-up
of high richness MaDCoWS candidates, ≈ 25% of the MaDCoWS clusters observed were determined to be mergers. This ratio is significantly affected by Malmquist bias, however, as nonmergers have higher SZ brightness than merging systems. Further, Dicker et al. (2020) clusters are generally higher richness
systems (λ15 ≈ 50) and it is not clear how the fraction of systems
that are undergoing a merger or are pre-merger changes with
richness. Targeted follow up is warranted to investigate further.
Additionally, stacked measurements of the weak lensing of the
CMB, in the vein of Madhavacheril et al. (2020), are indifferent
to clusters that are undergoing mergers. As such, comparing the
lensing inferred masses of low and high weight clusters would
allow one to put constraints on the fraction of low weight clusters
that are undergoing mergers. Similarly, the agreement between
the average mass of the MaDCoWS cluster sample above richness of 20 as determined using the mass-richness scaling relation
derived in this paper and in Madhavacheril et al. (2020) suggests
that mergers and pre-mergers do not dominate the MaDCoWS
cluster sample.
It is also possible that some fraction of the MaDCoWS clusters have very low fractional gas mass, and as such are undetectable via the SZ effect. Such clusters have occasionally been
reported in the literature (see Castellano et al. 2011; Andreon &
Moretti 2011; Trejo-Alonso et al. 2014), with X-ray luminosities about 10-20 times lower than would be expected for their
masses (Castellano et al. 2011). However, low gas-fraction is
not the only explanation for their low X-ray luminosity. Instead,
these clusters may be embedded in filaments aligned with our
line-of-sight, and galaxies situated along that line-of-sight could
be contaminating the measurements, which was the case for the
'under-luminous' cluster in Castellano et al. (2011). Such a scenario was proposed in Bower et al. (1997), and favored by more
recent evidence (Giles et al. 2015). Even if such low gas mass
fraction clusters do exist, the relative fraction of these clusters is
likely low; Andreon & Moretti (2011) reports only about 11% of
their sample were X-ray under-luminous. The redshift range of
Andreon & Moretti (2011) (0.1 < z < 0.3) is far from that of this
work, and moreover the fraction of under-luminous clusters is of
course sensitive to the selection function of the larger sample,
so Andreon & Moretti (2011) may not be directly comparable
to our work. However, Andreon & Moretti (2011) does suggest
that the issue of SZ non-detections of MaDCoWS clusters can
not be entirely resolved by a large population of gas-poor (or
low gas mass) clusters. Ge et al. (2019) also found evidence that
the number of X-ray under-luminous clusters is not significant at
high richness, although again their redshift range (0.1 < z < 0.3)
is significantly lower than that of the MaDCoWS sample.
Finally, at low richnesses chance superpositions of galaxies
may be causing spurious detections. Such spurious objects are

Orlowski-Scherer: SZ effect confirmation of MaDCoWS candidates using ACT

hard to differentiate from low mass groups in this analysis. In any
case, caution must be exercised when using the low weight clusters for cosmology. Inaccurate cluster masses from both spurious
clusters and clusters with low SZ signal for their mass (either due
to merger history, low-gas fraction, or unvirialized components
along the line-of-sight) will bias cosmological parameters.

8. Conclusions
In this work we identified co-detections of the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster catalogs. We note the very low rate of codetections both with respect to the size of the ACT and the MaDCoWS cluster catalogs. We used forced photometry to evaluate the mass-richness scaling relation of the MaDCoWS cluster
catalog. We quantified in-fill of the sample by radio and submm emission. We find that the best fit scaling relation has slope
1.84+0.15
−0.14 , higher than the unitary value one would expect for selfsimilar clusters (Andreon & Hurn 2010), but comparable to the
preliminary work of Gonzalez et al. (2019a). We offer some possible reasons for this deviation in Section 7.3. These include,
potentially, a bias in the richness measure, and some amount
of sample impurity with respect to mass. Instead of mass, the
MaDCoWS selection function may preferentially include starforming systems, leading to deviations from self-similarity. As
part of the mass-richness scaling relation, we fit a weight to
each cluster, which describes the relative probability that the
SZ measurement associated with that cluster was drawn from
a normal distribution centered on the mass-richness scaling relation vs. a normal distribution centered on zero. We found that a
large fraction of the MaDCoWS cluster candidates had weights
lower than 50%. We ascribe the low weight of these clusters, and
correspondingly their non-detection in the ACT cluster catalog,
to a variety of factors, including suppression of the SZ signal
by merger history and other unvirialized components along the
line-of-sight, as well as to the MaDCoWS catalog containing
very small clusters with SZ signals too low to detect. As for the
MaDCoWS non-detections of ACT clusters, we conclude that
the MaDCoWS selection function is not mass limited, and thus
the overlap of the MaDCoWS catalog with a catalog like ACT
can be very incomplete.
Additionally, by investigating their sub-mm and radio properties, we find evidence that the MaDCoWS candidates have
higher average sub-mm flux density and higher average intrinsic radio luminosity than their ACT counterparts even when the
ACT clusters are restricted to the same redshift range as the
MaDCoWS cluster candidates, although the MaDCoWS clusters
do have lower average radio flux density in the observed frame
of reference, so that the ACT clusters have high radio in-fill on
average. We interpret this as the systems selected by MaDCoWS
being on average dustier, while ACT clusters are less dusty and
radio loud. We find no evidence that the sub-mm flux density of
MaDCoWS clusters evolves with richness, although due to the
paucity of Herschel data this is only based on 220 GHz stacks.
We find that the RLF of the MaDCoWS clusters does increase
with increasing richness, and we find that the relation agrees with
prior studies (Mo et al. 2020).
Looking to the future, the next generation of MaDCoWS
(MaDCoWS2) will use the deeper CatWISE2020 (Eisenhardt
et al. 2020) WISE photometry in combination with deeper optical imaging. MaDCoWS2 is designed to extend from z ∼ 0.5 − 2
with an improved selection function at all redshifts. More indepth studies of the radio and sub-mm properties of the MaDCoWS clusters in the short term will allow us to better understand the population differences between IR and SZ selected

clusters, and will allow us to better correct the mass-richness
scaling relations. Continuing ACT operations and further data
releases will increase the depth of SZ observations, allowing the
survey to probe to lower masses and over larger regions.
Looking further, in the first half of the decade data from Simons Observatory (SO; Zhu et al. 2021; The Simons Observatory Collaboration et al. 2019; Ade et al. 2019) and the CMB-S4
experiment (Abitbol et al. 2017; Abazajian et al. 2016, 2019) and
the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope-prime (CCAT-prime;
Vavagiakis et al. 2018; Aravena et al. 2019; Choi et al. 2020)
will provide deeper and higher resolution SZ and sub-mm maps
over a larger portion of the sky. Additionally, the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory (Ivezić et al. 2019), Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer
(SPHEREx) (Bock & SPHEREx Science Team 2018; Cooray
& SPHEREx Science Team 2018; Crill et al. 2020), and Euclid
telescopes (Euclid Collaboration et al. 2019) will provide larger
and more accurate IR and optically selected cluster catalogs.
In the 2030s, the next generation CMB-S4 experiment
(Abazajian et al. 2016; Abitbol et al. 2017), CMB-HD experiment (Sehgal et al. 2019, 2020), and the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST; Klaassen et al. 2020)
will potentially provide orders of magnitude increases in SZ map
depth over significant fractions of the extragalactic sky, with the
latter two providing a transformative leap in subarcminute resolution SZ and sub-mm studies at a significantly lower confusion
limit.

Appendix A: Bootstrapping
Throughout the paper, we are presented with a situation in which
we have a data set, d, which we are interested in computing some
statistic on, and for which we would like to estimate the uncertainty in that statistic. We use the boostrapping method to do
so: given d, we resample from that data set with replacement k
times, resulting in a superset of data sets, {d1 , ...di , ...dk } where
the di are the resampled data sets. For each di , we compute a
statistic on di , which we will call μi , generally the mean, or in
the case where the data are maps, the central emission. We then
have a set of statistics, μ = {μ1 , ...μi , ...μk }. We then take the average and standard deviation of μ as the average and standard
deviation of that statistic on d.

Notes. (a) Di Mascolo et al. 2020 (b) Gonzalez et al. 2019a (c) Dicker et al. 2020. A full treatment of the uncertainty is available in the publication.
(d)
The NIKA2 measurement, as reported in Ruppin et al. 2020, relied on a strong, informative prior on the integrated SZ signal from CARMA
(Gonzalez et al. 2019a), and hence should likely not be regarded as an independent constraint. We include it for completeness, and note they
include a large, 56% systematic uncertainty. All three surveys assumed the Arnaud et al. (2010) scaling relation.

Table C.1: MaDCoWS clusters found in the ACT DR5 sample Hilton et al. (2021) at an SZ detection significance S /N ≥ 4. These
cluster co-detections were made following the analysis described in Section 3. Richness (λ15 ) values are those reported by Gonzalez
et al. (2019a). Note that some clusters do not have a λ15 value associated with them, as Gonzalez et al. (2019a) did not report
richness values for clusters with for clusters with low partial IRAC data.
