Abstract-Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has
emerged as a promising technology for achieving high spectrum
and energy efficiency in future wireless communication networks.
In this paper, we investigate an RIS-aided single-cell multi-user
mobile edge computing (MEC) system where an RIS is deployed
to support the communication between a base station (BS)
equipped with MEC servers and multiple single-antenna users.
To utilize the scarce frequency resource efficiently, we assume
that users communicate with BS based on a non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) protocol. Each user has a computation
task which can be computed locally or partially/fully offloaded
to the BS. We aim to minimize the sum energy consumption
of all users by jointly optimizing the passive phase shifters,
the size of transmission data, transmission rate, power control,
transmission time and the decoding order. Since the resulting
problem is non-convex, we use the block coordinate descent
method to alternately optimize two separated subproblems.
More specifically, we use the dual method to tackle a subproblem
with given phase shift and obtain the closed-form solution; and
then we utilize penalty method to solve another subproblem
for given power control. Moreover, in order to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we propose
three benchmark schemes: the time-division multiple access
(TDMA)-MEC scheme, the full local computing scheme and
the full offloading scheme. We use an alternating 1-D search
method and the dual method that can solve the TDMA-based
transmission problem well. Numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed scheme can increase the energy efficiency and
achieve significant performance gains over the three benchmark
schemes.

N the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, mobile
data will experience a phenomenal growth, most of which
are generated by edge devices in real-time, such as mobile
phones, computers and sensors. Since most of the users
are sensors with limited computing capabilities, mobile edge
computing (MEC) as a promising technology can efficiently
guarantee the computing resource, reduce the capital cost and
provide flexibility. In the MEC framework, wireless devices
offload their computation intensive or delay-sensitive tasks to
nearby base stations (BSs) or servers at the edge of radio
access networks to save the battery power and computation
resources [1]–[3]. Driven by the benefits of MEC networks,
there were a large number of contributions studying MECbased systems and numerous efficient algorithms were proposed to solve joint communication and computation resource
allocation problems [4], [5].
Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can be
used as a passive reflector which does not need radio frequency
(RF) module to forward signals [6]–[8]. The RIS could change
the channel condition for the MEC service and significantly
increase spectrum spatial efficiency. The RIS consists of many
low-cost and re-configurable printed dipoles, and the smart
controller can change the specific angles of these passive
elements according to the requirements of systems [9], [10].
By optimizing the phase shifts of RIS, one can both suppress
the interference and boost the desired signal, which enhances
transmission security and efficiency [11]–[13]. [14] introduced
the structure of RIS that it is a massive low-cost reflecting elements mounted surface, and how the RIS achieved 3-D passive
beamforming via the amplitude and phase shift optimization.
The authors in [15] introduced the fundamental capacity limit
characterization of RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) communication networks by jointly optimizing the
transmit covariance matrix and RIS reflection coefficients. In
[16], the RIS was shown to extend the operational range of the
wireless powered sensors in simultaneous wireless information
and power transfer (SWIPT) networks. The RIS was shown to

significantly enhance the data rate of the cell-edge users in [17]
for the multicell networks. By utilizing the benefits of RIS,
including improving channel conditions, enhancing reflectionaided beamforming gain and energy transmission, the potential
of MEC systems can be significantly improved. For example,
[18] investigated RIS-based MEC systems, where users could
choose to offload partial of their tasks to the MEC with the
help of RIS. Numerical results showed that the overall system
latency decreases significantly compared with the system without RIS. In [19], the authors considered a wireless powered
MEC network and an RIS was used to aid wireless energy
transfer and computation offloading. However, in [18] and
[19], the authors only studied the performance improvement
when integrating RIS into MEC networks, without studying
the performance under various multiple access schemes.
On the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
is recognized as an essential radio access technology in the
fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G [20]. For traditional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, such as time
division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA), each resource block is
occupied by only one user. With NOMA, users can reuse
the same frequency resource to save the energy and spectrum
resources. Since NOMA technique can significantly enhance
the system spectrum efficiency, it has been extensively studied
in MEC-based systems. In [21], the authors considered a
NOMA-assisted MEC system and obtained closed-form expressions, where the energy consumption and the time interval
were jointly optimized. [22] studied a multiuser MEC system
where users offload their computation tasks through NOMA
technique and the BS decoded all offloaded tasks by successive
interference cancellation (SIC), in which the NOMA decoding order was optimized. [23] proposed a hybrid offloading
scheme where the users were divided into two groups and
their locations followed a homogeneous Poisson Point Process.
They also investigated distance-dependent NOMA grouping
schemes in MEC networks and used numerical results to
show the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme. The
advantages of NOMA technology and its wide applications
inspire the idea of using NOMA as a means of transmission
in our model.
When the channel gain differences of users are large or the
frequency resource is limited, the advantages of NOMA are
more obvious, and RIS can be deployed to help achieve this
goal by carefully designing its phase shifts. A design of the
RIS-assisted NOMA downlink transmission with the impact
of hardware impairments was proposed in [24]. Moreover, in
[25], the authors considered an RIS assisted NOMA network
where a robust beamforming scheme was proposed in an
eavesdropping scenario with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper. Furthermore, multi-cluster
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) NOMA communication
networks were discussed in [26], and RISs were utilized to
assist the communication. However, the above works [24]–
[26] did not consider RIS-aided NOMA communication for
the MEC networks.

B. Motivations and Contributions
The above-mentioned works [14]-[22] mainly studied the
NOMA-MEC networks or the RIS assisted MEC networks.
Since RIS can significantly enhance the system performance
by reconfiguring the channel conditions and NOMA can be
used to serve multiple users simultaneously at the same
resource block [24]–[26], we consider to utilize RIS in the
NOMA-MEC networks to further improve the energy efficiency. In this paper, we focus on an RIS-aided NOMA-MEC
network where the direct links between users and the BS
are in poor conditions and the RIS is used to guarantee the
quality of service (QoS) requirements of MEC services. Our
contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We propose an RIS-aided multi-user MEC MISO system,
where a multi-antenna BS (also acts as an MEC server)
serves multiple single-antenna users using NOMA. To
minimize the sum energy consumption of all users, we
jointly optimize the passive reflecting beamforming (i.e.,
phase shifts of RIS), the number of transmission data,
transmission rate, power control, transmission time as
well as the decoding order.
• To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm by solving two subproblems iteratively. In particular, for the first subproblem
with given phase shifts, we apply the dual decomposition
method to obtain the optimal closed-form solution as
well as the optimal decoding order. Then for the second
subproblem with given power control, we utilize the
penalty method to transform this subproblem into a series
of convex problems and obtain a suboptimal solution.
• To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme,
we provide a TDMA-based transmission model as a
benchmark. To solve the energy efficient resource allocation for TDMA case, we propose the dual decomposition
method with 1-D search.
• Simulation results show that our proposed RIS-MEC with
NOMA scheme can dramatically decrease the sum energy
consumption at users compared with three conventional
benchmark schemes. In addition, we discuss the impact
of distances on the performance of our proposed system.

A. System Model
As shown in Fig.1, we consider an RIS-enhanced uplink
system with one BS, K users and one RIS, which helps the
communication between the BS and users. The number of
transmit antennas at the BS and that of reflecting elements
at the RIS are respectively denoted by M and N . Let K =
{1, 2, * * * , K} denote the set of all users. The BS schedules the
users to completely or partially offload tasks. The users with
partial or complete offloading respectively offload a fraction
of or all input data to the BS, while the users with partial or no
offloading respectively compute a fraction of or all input data
using local central processing unit (CPU). Due to the small
latency of cloud computing and small sizes of computation
results, the time of cloud computing and downloading from
the BS is negligible compared to the time of mobile offloading
and local computing.
B. Task Computing Model
The local computing model is described as follows. Since
only dk bits are offloaded to the BS, the remaining Rk − dk
bits are needed to be computed locally at user k. The total
CPU cycles for local computation at user k is given by
∀k ∈ K,

(1)

where Ck is the number of CPU cycles required for computing
1-bit input data at user k.
Let Fk denote the maximum computation capacity of user k,
which is measured by the number of CPU cycles per second.
Denoting T as the maximal latency of all users, we can obtain
the following local computation latency constraints
(Rk − dk )Ck ≤ Fk T,

∀k ∈ K,

dk Ck ≤ F.

By allowing the BS to properly design the decoding order of

Obviously, Problem (13) is nonconvex due to the nonconvex
constraints (13c) and (13d). In order to solve Problem (13), we
propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the alternating
method. In particular, for given phase shift vector θ , we use the
dual method to tackle this subproblem and obtain the optimal
offloading bits d ∗ , transmission time t∗ , power allocation
p ∗ and use a time sharing technique to obtain the optimal
decoding order and transmission rate r ∗ . Then for given p , we
use the penalty method to optimize d , t, r and θ . The suboptimal solution to Problem (13) is obtained via iteratively
solving the aforementioned two subproblems.
In the following, we show how to solve one subproblem
of Problem (13) with given θ and use the penalty method to
solve another subproblem with given p .

ability at the BS, while each user can successfully transmit
the task bits as shown in (13c). The rate region of NOMA
is expressed in constraint (13d). Constraint (13e) ensures that
the offloading can be completed in time requirement of T for
all users. Constraint (13f) shows the minimum and maximum
requirements of the offloaded bits of each user. The maximum

which means when 0 < t < T , we can always
construct

a new set of solution t′ = T and p′k = s′ T k that makes
the objective function of Problem (15) smaller than when the
solutions are t∗ and p∗k . Therefore, when t > 0, the optimal
solution of t is t = T .
It is found that all constraints in Problem (14) are convex
except (14c). Constraint (14c) is neither convex nor concave
because its Hessian is indefinite which has a positive and a
negative eigenvalue. However, function (14c) is quasiconcave
for all t ≥ 0, dk ≥ 0, since the suplevel sets {t, rk ∈ R + |trk ≥
dk } are convex sets for all dk [34].
Therefore, Problem (14) is convex and satisfies the Slater's
condition, based on which the strong duality between Problem
(14) and its dual problem holds. The partial Lagrangian

To tackle Problem (14), we solve Problem (20) to obtain

For the convenience of notation, we set μπ(K+1) = 0. Note
that Problem (34) is convex with respect to p , and it can be
easily solved by the standard toolbox, such as CVX [36]. Let
p ∗ denote the optimal solution to Problem (34) and the optimal
r ∗ can be obtained by substituting p∗ into equation (33).
2) Using time sharing method to obtain primal optimal r ∗
and decoding order for Problem (14): It is worth mentioning
that the decoding order in Problem (14) is determined by
μ . However, if there exists k and k ′ such that μk = μ′k ,
the decoding order as well as the transmission rate r ∗ is
not unique. In this case, the primal optimal solution can be
obtained by time-sharing method.
More specifically, define χ 1 , * * * , χ L as L disjoint subsets
χl | as the
in which μk = μ′k (∀k, k ′ ∈ χ l ) are equal. Define |χ
χl | ≥ 2, ∀l = 1, . . . , L.
cardinality of the set χ l , and there are |χ
To find the optimal decoding order by time-sharing, we can
divide the transmission time t into |Ψ| time slots, where Ψ
can be expressed as

Problem (36) is a linear problem and can be easily solved by

Since g(λ
λ, μ ) is convex with respect to λ, μ ,
Problem (21). Although g(λ
yet may not be differentiable in general. Therefore, λ∗ , μ ∗ can

Since Problem (47) is a convex problem, we can utilize the
interior point method or CVX [36] to obtain the optimal
solution of Problem (47). Moreover, the solution of θ can be
updated based on u .
C. Iterative Algorithm for solving Problem (13)
The alternating procedure for solving Problem (13) is given
in Algorithm 1. We utilize a block coordinate descent method
to alternately solve Problem (14) and Problem (39), and
finally obtain the suboptimal solution. Since the objective
value decreases with the iteration number and has a finite lower
bound, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge.
The procedure for solving Problem (14) is shown as Algorithm 2. The dual method is introduced to find the optimal
closed-form solutions of Problem (14) as well as the optimal
decoding order. To solve Problem (39), the penalty method is
utilized to approximately transform this problem to Problem
(47) and the procedure of solving Problem (47) is shown in
Algorithm 3.

IV. TDMA S CHEME

In this section, we consider an RIS-based TDMA-MEC
model to serve as a benchmark for the aforementioned RISbased NOMA-MEC transmission model. In the TDMA protocol, the time sharing factor of each user is 1/K, and the rate

We use (49d) to replace (48) because if (49d) holds with
inequality, we can always find a smaller pk until the optimal
solution is obtained. Thus (49d) is equivalent to (48) in Problem (49). It is noted that Problem (49) is a simplified version
of Problem (13). It is because without NOMA technique,
the number and complexity of TDMA rate constraints are
dramatically reduced. For solving Problem (49), we firstly
solve this problem for given θ and then use alternating 1D search method to obtain the sub-optimal θ . Then alternate
the two processes until the suboptimal solution is obtained.

algorithms converge within 7 iterations. The two transmission
schemes both converge rapidly, which indicates the efficiency
of proposed algorithms. For each curve, the initial solution is
high, which is because at the initial of optimization process,
the phases of RIS are randomly initialized and the channels
between users and BS can be in a bad condition. After the
iterations, RIS phases are optimized and the channel conditions
are suitable for efficient transmission.

Fig. 3. Sum energy consumption versus the number of input bits.

Fig. 3 shows the sum energy consumption at users based
on the NOMA-MEC scheme versus the number of input
computation tasks Rk , when the numbers of RIS reflecting
units are N = 10, 15, 20, respectively and we set the maximum
user latency as T = 0.6 s. From Fig. 3, we can see that the
sum energy consumption decreases with the number of RIS
units. It is because more RIS elements can improve the channel
conditions between the BS and users. It is also found that the
sum energy increases as the number of input bits. This is due
to the fact that with the maximum latency, local users need to

use more power to calculate and transmit the increasing input
tasks.
Fig. 4 compares the performance of our proposed scheme
1 with three benchmark schemes: TDMA-MEC transmission
scheme (scheme 2), full offloading scheme and full local
computing scheme. We set the number of RIS reflecting units
as N = 15 and the maximum latency as T = 1 s, respectively.
Numerical results illustrate that with the growing number of
computation tasks, these four schemes experience different
degrees of growth. Since using the full offloading scheme
needs a large transmission rate to offload all the tasks to the
BS, its energy consumption increases significantly. It is also
found that the energy consumption of scheme 1 achieves the
best performance, especially for large input data.
In Fig. 5, we show the sum network energy consumption
versus the maximum user latency T , where Rk = 1 Mbits and
N = 10. For all schemes, the energy consumption decreases
with the maximum latency. The reason is that as the latency
becomes longer, more computation bits can be offloaded to
the MEC server, which leads to less local computation energy.

BS and between RIS and user k, respectively. The RIS is
located close to the X-axis of coordinate system. For the
convenience of explanation, we use the differences of Xaxis as the approximate distances between RIS and BS or
users, i.e., dRB ≈ xRIS − xBS and dR,k ≈ xk − xRIS
(when xBS ≤ xRIS ≤ xk ), where xRIS , xBS and xk are
the horizontal ordinates (i.e., X-axis) of the RIS, BS and user
k, respectively. Thus Eq. (68) can be approximated by

When the latency is long, the four curves grow closer, which
means if the users do not care about latency, the performance
of the four schemes is close. However, in a low delay system,
the proposed scheme can gain a much better performance
compared with other three schemes.
Fig. 6 shows the offloading energy, the local computing
energy and the sum energy consumptions of NOMA-MEC
and TDMA-MEC schemes versus the number of input bits,
respectively. We set T = 0.2 s and N = 10. It can be found
that both offloading and local computing energy consumptions
increase with the number of input bits and the offloading
energy consumptions of the two schemes are very close. On
the other hand, the NOMA-MEC scheme consumes much
lower local computing energy than the TDMA-MEC scheme,
since the NOMA-MEC scheme can transmit more data bits to
the BS and alleviate the local computing pressure.
In order to show the influence of distances on the RISaided network, Fig. 7 illustrates the sum energy consumption
at all users versus the horizontal ordinate of the RIS. Besides,
to investigate the influence, we rearrange the location of four
users in a square area and the coordinates of users are (1425 m,
25 m) , (1375 m, 25 m) , (1425 m, −25 m) , (1375 m, −25 m),
respectively. The BS is located at (0 m, 0 m) and the number
of RIS reflecting units is N = 10. The input computation task
is Rk = 0.5 Mbits and the maximum latency is T = 0.2
s. We assume that the RIS moves from (−100 m, 50 m) to
(1500 m, 50 m) with the step size of 100 m while keeping
the y-coordinate fixed. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that when
the RIS moves close to the BS or the users, the sum energy
consumption at all users becomes low and when the RIS moves
close to the approximate midpoint between the BS and users,
the energy consumption reaches the highest value. The reason
for having this trend is that by ignoring the small-scale fading,
the large scale channel gain of the IRS aided link for user k
can be approximated by

Since xBS + xk is the fixed distance between the BS and user
k, P Lk in Eq. (69) obtains the maximum value when xRIS −
xBS = xk − xRIS , i.e., xRIS = (xBS + xk )/2, which means
when the RIS arrives at the approximate midpoint between the
BS and user k, the channel condition becomes the worst and
the sum energy consumption reaches the peak value.

s. We assume that the RIS moves from (100 m, 100 m) to
(100 m, 800 m) with the step size of 100 m while keeping
the x-coordinate fixed. It is obvious that the sum energy
consumption at users increases with longitudinal ordinate of
the RIS and the increasing speed becomes slower for large
longitudinal ordinate of the RIS.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we considered an RIS-assisted NOMA-MEC
network. We aimed at minimizing the energy consumption of
all users by jointly optimizing the RIS phase shift, the number
of transmission data, transmission rate, power control and
transmission time. Since the decoding order is not determined
before the transmission process and the problem is non-convex
due to the RIS phase variables, we decomposed the problem
into two subproblems. For the first subproblem, we utilized
the dual method to resolve this problem with given RIS phase
vector θ and obtained the closed-form solution. For the other
subproblem, with given power control p , the penalty method
is used to obtain a suboptimal solution. The block coordinate
descent process continued to alternately solve these two subproblems until the objective value converged. Furthermore, in
order to show the benefits of the proposed RIS-based NOMAMEC scheme, we proposed three benchmark schemes, including the TDMA-MEC partial offloading scheme, full local
computing scheme and full offloading scheme. For the TDMAMEC partial offloading scheme, we proposed an alternating
1-D search method which could easily obtain the suboptimal
solution of RIS phase shifts. Numerical results showed that our
proposed NOMA-MEC scheme could significantly decrease
the sum energy consumptions of all users and illustrated the
impact of distance on the performance of our proposed system.
In practice, the CSI might have estimation errors, and thus
robust tranmission design will be studied in the future work
