INTRODUCTION

Exotic mesons containing four quarks of different flavors are interesting members in the family of XY Z
mesons. Analyses of such structures were triggered by
information of the D0 collaboration about evidence for
the state X(5568) composed presumably of four different
quarks [1]. Later, other collaborations could not confirm
existence of this state [2, 3], but knowledge gained due
to theoretical studies of X(5568), methods and schemes
elaborated during this process, played an important role
in our understanding of exotic mesons.
New stage in this field began recently by discovery of the LHCb collaboration, which reported about
new resonance-like structures X0(1) (2900) in the process B + → D+ D− K + [4, 5]. They were seen in the
mass distribution of mesons D− K + , and may be considered as first strong evidence for exotic mesons composed
of four quarks of different flavors. Indeed, from decay
modes of these states, it is clear that they contain valence quarks udcs, which makes them objects of intensive
studies. But one should bear in mind that X0(1) (2900)
may have alternative origin, and appear due to rescat0
tering diagrams χc1 D∗− K ∗+ and DsJ D1 K 0 in the decay
B + → D+ D− K + [6].
Masses and spin-parities of these structures were determined by LHCb and used in various models to explain internal organizations of X0(1) (2900). As usual, they were
interpreted as hadronic molecules, diquark-antidiquark
states, and rescattering effects (see, Refs. [7, 8] and references therein). In our articles [7, 8], we treated X0 (2900)
∗0
and X1 (2900) as a scalar hadronic molecule D K ∗0 and
diquark-antidiquark vector states [ud][cs], respectively.
Predictions for their masses and widths extracted from
sum rule analyses seem confirm assumptions made on
their structures.

It is clear that resonances X0(1) (2900) are neutral
states, and emerge in intermediate phase of the decay
chain B + → D+ X → D+ D− K + . In accordance with
Ref. [9], these processes occur due to color-favored and
color-suppressed transformations. But weak decays of
B + meson with the same topologies may trigger also processes B + → D− Z ++ → D− D+ K + . In this chain an
intermediate particle Z ++ is an exotic meson with quark
content [uc][sd] carrying two units of electric charge. In
our view, B meson weak decays which are already under detailed analysis, and collected experimental data
may be used to uncover doubly charged tetraquarks
Z ++ = [uc][sd] with different spin-parities. These new
scalar and vector particles may appear as resonances in
the D+ K + mass distribution: this fact is a main motivation for present studies.
Doubly charged diquark-antidiquarks already attracted interests of researches, and some of these states
was studied in a rather detailed form. Thus, spectroscopic parameters and strong decays of pseudoscalar
tetraquarks ccss and ccds were calculated in Ref. [10].
Doubly charged scalar, pseudoscalar and axial-vector
states Zcs = [sd][uc] were considered in our article [11].
Results obtained for their masses and widths read
mZS = 2628+166
−153 MeV, ΓZS = (66.89 ± 15.11) MeV,

mZPS = 2719+144
−156 MeV, ΓZPS = (38.1 ± 7.1) MeV,

mZAV = 2826+134
−157 MeV, ΓZAV = (47.3 ± 11.1) MeV,
(1)
where subscripts ZS , ZPS and ZAV refer to the scalar,
pseudoscalar and axial-vector tetraquarks Zcs , respectively.
The positively charged counterparts of Zcs are
tetraquarks Z ++ with the same characteristics and spinparities. Therefore, one can safely use parameters of particles Zcs to study exotic mesons Z ++ . It is not difficult

2
++
to see that scalar and vector states ZS++ and ZV
decay
+ +
+ +
to ordinary mesons Ds π and D K . For ZS++ these
++
modes are S-wave decays, whereas for ZV
they are P wave processes. In the present work, we are going to find
++
parameters of the vector tetraquark ZV
. The mass of
++
ZV should be around or larger than mZAV . Therefore,
even without detailed analysis one sees that decays to final mesons Ds+ π + and D+ K + are among kinematically
++
allowed modes of ZV
. In other words, the states ZS++
++
and ZV may be seen in D+ K + mass distribution in the
decay B + → D− D+ K + .
We compute spectroscopic parameters and full width
++
of the vector tetraquark ZV
using various versions of
the QCD sum rule method. Thus, the mass and current
++
coupling of ZV
are found by employing the QCD twopoint sum rule approach [12, 13]. In our analysis, we
take into account contributions of various vacuum condensates up to dimension 10. Prediction for the mass
++
of ZV
, as well as its quantum numbers J P = 1− permit us to classify kinematically allowed decay modes of
++
this tetraquark. The mass and coupling of ZV
are also
input parameters necessary to calculate partial widths
++

(2317)+ρ+ ,
of the decays ZV
→ Ds1 (2460)+ π + , Ds0
+ +
+ +
D K , and Ds π . To this end, we explore vertices of
++
++ + +
ZV
with ordinary mesons (for example, ZV
D K ),
and find corresponding strong couplings. Relevant investigations are carried out using the QCD light-cone sum
rule (LCSR) method, which is one of effective nonperturbative tools to study conventional hadrons [14]. In the
case of tetraquark-ordinary meson vertices the standard
methods of LCSR have to be applied in conjunction with
a soft-meson approximation [15, 16]. For analysis of the
exotic mesons the light-cone sum rule method and soft
approximation was suggested in Ref. [17], and used to
investigate decays of various tetraquarks [18].
This paper is structured in the following manner: Section II is devoted to calculations of the mass and cou++
pling of the vector tetraquark ZV
= [uc][sd]. In Section
III, we compute strong couplings in relevant tetraquark++
meson vertices, and evaluate partial widths of ZV
de++
cays. The full width of ZV is found in this section as
well. Section IV is reserved for our conclusions and final
notes.

II.

THE SPECTROSCOPIC PARAMETERS OF
ZV

The mass m and current coupling f are important pa++
rameters of the vector tetraquark ZV
= [uc][sd] (in
what follows, we omit superscripts denoting charges of
the tetraquark and various mesons). We use the QCD
two-point sum rule method to evaluate values of these
parameters.
We begin calculations from analysis of the two-point
correlation function
Z
Πμν (p) = i d4 xeipx h0|T {Jμ (x)Jν† (0)}|0i,
(2)

where Jμ (x) is the interpolating current for ZV , and
T denotes the time-ordered product of two currents.
The vector tetraquark ZV can be modeled using a scalar
diquark uCγ5 c and vector antidiquark sγμ γ5 Cd. It is
known that color-antitriplet diquarks and color-triplet
antidiquarks are most stable two-quark structures [19].
Therefore, we chose as building blokes of ZV strucT
tures εabc ub Cγ5 cc and εamn sm γμ γ5 Cdn , which belongs
to [3c ] and [3c ] representations of the color group SUc (3),
respectively. Then, the colorless interpolating current
Jμ (x) takes the form
T

Jμ (x) = εe
ε[uTb (x)Cγ5 cc (x)][sm (x)γμ γ5 Cdn (x)],

(3)

where εe
ε = εabc εamn , and a, b, c, m and n denote quark
colors. In Eq. (3) u(x), c(x), s(x) and d(x) are the quark
fields, and C stands for the charge-conjugation operator.
The sum rules for m and f can be derived by calculating Πμν (p) in terms of the physical parameters of ZV ,
as well as in the operator product expansion (OPE) with
certain accuracy. Having equated these two expressions,
applied the Borel transformation to suppress contributions of higher resonances and continuum states, and
subtracted these contributions using the quark-hadron
duality assumption [12, 13], it is possible to get required
sum rules for the mass and coupling of the tetraquark
ZV .
Expression of Πμν (p) in terms of parameters of ZV is
obtained by saturating the correlation function Πμν (p)
with a complete set of J P = 1− states and performing in
Eq. (2) integration over x
ΠPhys
μν (p) =

h0|Jμ |ZV ihZV |Jν† |0i
+ *** ,
m2 − p 2

(4)

where the dots stand for contributions of higher resonances and continuum states.
To proceed, it is convenient to introduce the matrix
element
h0|Jμ |ZV i = f mǫμ ,

(5)

where ǫμ is the polarization vector of the tetraquark ZV .
Then ΠPhys
μν (p) can be rewritten in the following form
ΠPhys
μν (p) =

m2 f 2 
pμ pν

The two-component Lorentz structure in the parentheses
in Eq. (6) corresponds to a vector particle. The first component of this structure is proportional to gμν and does
not contain effects of scalar particles: It is formed due
to only vector states. Therefore, in our studies we utilize
the structure ∼ gμν , and label corresponding invariant
amplitude by ΠPhys (p2 ).
Expression in Eq. (4) is obtained in the zero-width
single-pole approximation. In general, the correlation
function Πμν (p) receives contributions also from twomeson reducible terms, because the current Jμ couples

3
not only to four-quark structures, but also to two mesons
with relevant quantum numbers. Two-meson effects generate a finite width of the tetraquark ZV , and modify the
quark propagator in Eq. (4). It was demonstrated that
these effects do not change prediction for the mass of ZV .
They rescale only the current coupling f , which is small
and can be neglected [10, 20, 21].
The QCD side of the sum rules ΠOPE
μν (p) is found by

were estimated from analysis of numerous hadronic processes [12, 13, 22, 23], and are known and universal parameters. Higher dimensional condensates are factorized and expressed in terms of basic ones: we assume
that factorization does not lead to large uncertainties.
The masses of s and c quarks are also among input
parameters, for which we use ms = 93+11
−5 MeV, and
mc = 1.27 ± 0.2 GeV, respectively.
The Borel and continuum threshold parameters M 2
and s0 are auxiliary parameters of computations and
their choice should meet usual requirements imposed on
Π(M 2 , s0 ) by the pole contribution (PC) and convergence
of the operator product expansion. Technical side of such
analysis was explained numerously in the literature (see,
for instance, Refs. [8, 17]), for this reason we skip here
further details. Computations of Π(M 2 , s0 ) demonstrate
that working regions for the parameters M 2 and s0
M 2 ∈ [4, 6] GeV2 , s0 ∈ [13, 14] GeV2 .

The sum rules depend on vacuum condensates up to
dimension 10. The basic condensates

which are sum rules for m and f , respectively. Here,
Π(M 2 , s0 ) is the Borel transformed and subtracted amplitude ΠOPE (p2 ), which depends on the Borel M 2
and continuum threshold s0 parameters. In Eq. (9)
Π′ (M 2 , s0 ) is the derivative of the amplitude over
d/d(−1/M 2 ).
It is clear that the amplitude Π(M 2 , s0 ) is a key ingredient of the obtained sum rules. Calculations of this
function give the following result

where M = mc + ms . Computations are carried out by
taking into account vacuum condensates up to dimension
10. The amplitude Π(M 2 , s0 ) has two components: First
of them is expressed using the spectral density ρOPE (s),
which is computed as an imaginary part of ΠOPE
μν (p). The
Borel transformation of another terms are found directly
2
from ΠOPE
μν (p) and included into Π(M ). The first component in Eq. (11) contains a main part of the amplitude,
whereas Π(M 2 ) is formed from higher dimensional terms.
Analytical expressions of ρOPE (s) and Π(M 2 ), are rather
lengthy, therefore we do not write down them here.

satisfy these constraints. In fact, in these regions PC
changes within limits
0.78 ≤ PC ≤ 0.26.

(14)

At the minimum M 2 = 4 GeV2 , a contribution to
Π(M 2 , s0 ) arising from a sum of last three terms in OPE
does not exceed 1% of the full result, which proves convergence of the sum rules. Central values of the mass
m and coupling f are evaluated at the middle point of
regions (13), i.e., at M 2 = 5 GeV2 and s0 = 13.5 GeV2 .
At this point the pole contribution is PC ≈ 0.53, which
ensures the ground-state nature of ZV .
Results for m and f read
m = (3340 ± 120) MeV,
f = (3.7 ± 0.5) × 10−3 GeV4 .

(15)

The mass and coupling of the tetraquark ZV are depicted
in Figs. 1 and 2 as functions of M 2 and s0 . Because M 2 is
the auxiliary parameter, prediction for m and f should
be stable under its variations. But in a real situation
there is residual dependence of m and f on the Borel
parameter. In our case, we observe a mild variation of
the tetraquark's mass on M 2 , whereas the coupling f is
almost stable in the explored range of the Borel parameter.

FIG. 2: The same as in Fig. 1, but for the coupling f of the tetraquark ZV .

The second source of theoretical errors is connected
with a choice of the continuum threshold parameter s0 .
Despite M 2 , it bears physical information about first excitation of the tetraquark ZV . The self-consistent anal√
ysis implies that s0 has to be smaller than mass of
such state. There are only a few samples when two observed resonances were assumed to be ground and radially excited states of the same tetraquark. The resonances Zc (3900) and Zc (4430) may form one of such
pairs [24]. The difference between masses of Zc (3900)
and Zc (4430) is equal to ≈ 530 MeV, therefore a mass
√
gap s0 − m ≈ (400 − 600) MeV can be considered
as a reasonable estimate for tetraquarks. Here, we get
√
s0 − m ≈ 400 MeV which is in accord with this general
analysis.
Effects connected with a choice of parameters M 2 and
s0 are two main sources of theoretical uncertainties in

sum rule computations. In the case of the mass m these
ambiguities equal to ±3.6%, whereas for the coupling f
they are ±14% of the full result. Theoretical uncertainties for f are larger than for the mass, nevertheless, they
do not overshoot accepted limits.
It is interesting to analyze a gap between masses of
axial-vector and vector tetraquarks with the same content. Our present calculations demonstrate that for
tetraquarks [uc][sd] the difference between masses of
the axial-vector and vector particles ZAV and ZV is
m − mZAV ≈ 500 MeV. This result can be compared
with similar prediction for other tetraquarks. Thus, resonances Y (4660) and X(4140) with quantum numbers
J PC = 1−− and 1++ , quark content [cs][cs] and color
structure [3c ] ⊗ [3c ] were investigated in Refs. [25, 26],
respectively. An estimate for mY − mX1 extracted from
these studies is approximately equal to 500 MeV as well.

5
In other words, radially excited axial-vector and groundstate vector tetraquarks, in this special case, are very
close in mass. This fact maybe useful to explain numerous charged and neutral resonances from XY Z family in
the mass range of 4 − 5 GeV.
Another issue to be addressed here, is a mass gap
between vector tetraquarks ZV and X1 (2900), which
amounts to ≈ 450 MeV and is quite large. It has been
noted in section I, that X1 can be modeled as a vector
tetraquark [ud][cs], and hence both ZV and X1 are composed of same quarks. But there are two reasons, which
may lead to aforementioned mass effect. First of them is
internal organizations of these states: The tetraquark ZV
is composed of a heavy diquark [uc] and relatively heavy
antidiquark [sd], whereas X1 is strongly heavy-light compound. The latter is more tightly connected structure
and should be lighter than ZV . Besides, diquarks in ZV
have fractional positive electric charges which generate
repulsive forces between them. In the case of X1 , between
[ud] and [cs] exists attractive electromagnetic interaction.
Whether these features of ZV and X1 are enough to explain a mass gap between them or there are other sources
of this effect, requires additional studies.

III.

STRONG DECAYS OF THE TETRAQUARK
ZV

The sum of partial widths of ZV tetraquark's different
decay channels constitutes its full width. The result for
m obtained in the previous section is necessary to fix
kinematically allowed strong decay modes of ZV . Decays
∗
to final states Ds1 (2460)π and Ds0
(2317)ρ (below, simply
∗
Ds1 π and Ds0 ρ) are among allowed S-wave process for
the tetraquark ZV . The P -wave processes, which will be
explored, are decays ZV → DK and ZV → Ds π.
A.

Processes ZV → Ds1 π and ZV →

∗
Ds0
ρ

Here, we study the decays ZV → Ds1 π and ZV →
∗
Ds0
ρ, and compute their partial widths. We provide
details of calculations for the first process and write
down only essential formulas and final results for the
second decay. It should be noted that the mass m =
(3340 ± 120) MeV makes possible S-wave decays of ZV
to final states DK1 (1270), Ds b1 (1235) and Ds a1 (1260)
as well. But widths of these processes, as it will be explained below, are suppressed relative to aforementioned
two decays due to kinematical factors. Therefore, we restrict ourselves by investigation of two dominant S-wave
decays.
The width of the process ZV → Ds1 π can be found
using the coupling g1 that describes strong interactions
of particles ZV , Ds1 , and π at the vertex ZV Ds1 π. In
order to evaluate g1 , we use the QCD light-cone sum rule
method [14] and a soft-meson approximation [15, 16].

Starting point in LCSR method is the correlation function
Z
Πμν (p, q) = i d4 xeipx hπ(q)|T {JμD1 (x)Jν† (0)}|0i, (16)
where by D1 in the current JμD1 we denote the meson Ds1 .
The current Jν (0) in the correlation function Πμν (p, q) is
introduced in Eq. (3). As interpolating current JμD1 (x)
for the axial-vector meson Ds1 , we use the expression
JμD1 (x) = sl (x)iγ5 γμ cl (x),

(17)

with l being the color index.
The function Πμν (p, q) has to be rewritten in terms
of the physical parameters of the initial and final particles involved into the decay. By taking into account the
ground states in the Ds1 and ZV channels, we get
ΠPhys
μν (p, q) =

hDs1 (p) π(q)|ZV (p′ )i
p2 − m21

hZV (p′ )|Jν† |0i

(18)

where p, q and p′ = p + q are the momenta of Ds1 , π ,
and ZV , respectively. In Eq. (18) m1 is the mass of the
meson Ds1 , and the ellipses stand for contributions of
higher resonances and continuum states in the Ds1 and
ZV channels.
To get more detailed expression for ΠPhys
μν (p, q), we utilize the matrix elements
h0|JμD1 |Ds1 i = f1 m1 ǫμ , hZV (p′ )|Jν† |0i = f mǫ′∗
ν,

(19)

and model the vertex hDs1 (p) K(q)|ZV (p′ )i in the following form
hDs1 (p) π(q)|ZV (p′ )i = g1 [(p * p′ ) (ǫ∗ * ǫ′ )
− (p * ǫ′ ) (p′ * ǫ∗ )] .

(20)

In Eqs. (19) and (20) f1 and ǫμ are the decay constant
and polarization vector of the meson Ds1 , respectively:
Polarization vector of the tetraquark ZV in this section is
denoted by ǫ′ν . Using these matrix elements in Eq. (18),
it is not difficult to find

The function ΠPhys
μν (p, q) contains two structures proportional to gμν and pμ p′ν , respectively. These structures
and relevant invariant amplitudes can be employed to extract the sum rule for the strong coupling g1 . We choose
to work with the term ∼ gμν and corresponding invariant
amplitude.
The QCD side of the sum rule can be obtained using
explicit expressions of the correlation function Πμν (p, q)

and interpolating currents. Having contracted quark and

where α and β are the spinor indexes.
The function ΠOPE (p, q) contains local matrix elements of the quark operator ud sandwiched between the
vacuum and pion. Simple transformations allow one
to express hπ(q)|ubα (0)dnβ (0)|0i in terms of the pion's
known local matrix elements. To this end, we expand
u(0)d(0) by employing √
full set of Dirac matrices ΓJ =
1, γ5 , γμ , iγ5 γμ , σμν / 2, and project obtained operators onto the color-singlet states. These manipulations
lead to replacement
ubα (0)dnβ (0) →

(23)

which should be fulfilled in ΠOPE
μν (p, q). The operators
u(0)ΓJ d(0) placed between the vacuum and pion are matrix elements of the π meson.
The QCD expression of the correlation function (22)
contains hard-scattering and soft parts. The hardscattering part of ΠOPE
μν (p, q) is expressed in terms of
quark propagators, whereas matrix elements of the pion
form its soft component. For vertices built of conventional mesons correlation functions depend on non-local
matrix elements of a final meson which are expressible
in terms of its distribution amplitudes (DAs). In the
case under analysis, due to four-quark nature of ZV ,
ΠOPE
μν (p, q) contains only local matrix elements of the
pion. As a result, integrals over DAs which are typical
for LCSR method, reduce to overall normalization factors. In this case, the correlation function has to be found
by means of the soft-meson approximation which implies
computation of the hard-scattering part of ΠOPE
μν (p, q) in
the limit q → 0 [17]. It is worth to emphasize that softmeson approximation is necessary to analyze tetraquarkmeson-meson vertices: Strong couplings at vertices composed of two tetraquarks and a meson can be calculated
by employing full version of the LCSR method [27].
It is evident, that soft approximation should by applied
also to the phenomenological side of the sum rule. In the
limit q → 0 for the amplitude ΠPhys (p2 ), we get

Besides ground-state contribution, the amplitude
ΠPhys (M 2 ) in the soft limit contains unsuppressed terms
which survive even after Borel transformation. These
contaminations should be removed from ΠPhys (M 2 ) by
applying the operator [15, 16]

(26)

After this operation, remaining undesired terms in
ΠPhys (M 2 ) can be subtracted by usual manner in the
context of quark-hadron duality assumption. It is clear,
that we have to apply the operator P(M 2 , m
e 2 ) to QCD
side of the sum rule as well. Then, the sum rule for the
strong coupling g1 reads
g1 =

P(M 2 , m

(27)

where ΠOPE (M 2 , s0 ) is Borel transformed and subtracted invariant amplitude ΠOPE (p2 ) corresponding to
the structure gμν in ΠOPE
μν (p, q).
Prescriptions to calculate the correlation function
ΠOPE
μν (p, q) in the soft approximation were presented in
Ref. [17], and in many other publications, for this reason
we do not concentrate here on details. Computations of
ΠOPE (M 2 , s0 ) performed in accordance with this scheme
lead to the expression

The last equality in Eq. (31) is the relation between the

quarks, and quark condensate hqqi, which stems from the
partial conservation of the axial-vector current.
In numerical computations of ΠOPE (M 2 , s0 ), we
choose M 2 and s0 within limits given by Eq. (13). Besides M 2 and s0 , Eq. (27) contains various vacuum condensates and spectroscopic parameters of the final-state
mesons Ds1 and π. The masses and decay constants of
the mesons Ds1 and π, as well as other parameters used
in numerical analyses are borrowed from Ref. [28] and
presented in Table I: For decay constants of the mesons

Returning to other S-wave decays listed above,
we assume that couplings corresponding to vertices
ZV DK1 (1270) etc., are the same order of g1 and g2 . Then
widths of these decays
 are suppressed, because the factor m2∗ λ 3 + 2λ2 /m2∗ (m∗ is a mass of a final meson) is
smaller for two final-state mesons of approximately equal
mass than in the case of light and heavy mesons. We
also take into account that the full width Γfull of the
tetraquark ZV is formed mainly due to P -wave processes
ZV → DK and ZV → Ds π, and for this reason consider
only two dominant S-wave decays.
B.

Decays ZV → DK and ZV → Ds π

In this subsection, we consider the P -wave decays
ZV → DK and ZV → Ds π of the tetraquark ZV .
Treatments of these processes do not differ from analysis carried out above, differences being mainly in mesontetraquark vertices and matrix elements of final-state
mesons employed in calculations.
Let us concentrate on the decay ZV → DK. The correlation function to find a sum rule for the strong coupling
G1 of vertex ZV DK is given by the formula
Z
Πν (p, q) = i d4 xeipx hK(q)|T {J D (x)Jν† (0)}|0i, (44)
where J D (x) is the interpolating current

In expressions above, mD and fD are the mass and decay

Operations necessary to derive the sum rule for the coupling G1 have just been explained above, that is why we
do not consider these questions. Let us note that the
sum rule for G1 has been obtained using the structures
proportional pν . The local matrix element of K meson
which contributes to ΠOPE
(M 2 , s0 ) is

(50)

where mK and fK are the mass and decay constant of
the K meson.
The width of the process ZV → DK can be found by
means of the formula
Γ3 [ZV → DK] =

G21 λ3 (m, mD, mK )
.
24πm2

(51)

In sum rule computations of the coupling G1 the Borel
and continuum threshold parameters are chosed as in Eq.
(13). The spectroscopic parameters of the mesons D and
K are collected in Table I. Our predictions read
G1 = 4.5+0.7
−0.5 ,
Γ3 [ZV → DK] = 30.4+10.3
−6.8 MeV.

(52)

For the second P -wave decay ZV → Ds π, we find
G2 = 7.1+1.1

J D (x) = dl (x)iγ5 cl (x),

for the pseudoscalar meson D.
Then, the physical side of the sum rule has the form

It is clear that ZV can be classified as an exotic meson of wide width. Its main decay modes are processes ZV → Ds π and ZV → DK with branching ratios
BR(ZV → Ds π) ≈ 0.54 and BR(ZV → DK) ≈ 0.22,
respectively. Contribution of the decay ZV → Ds1 π is
also considerable with estimate BR(ZV → Ds π) ≈ 0.18.

CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL NOTES

In this article, we have studied the doubly charged vec++
tor tetraquark ZV
= [uc][sd] and calculated its mass
++
m and width Γfull . The parameters of ZV
have been

9
evaluated using the QCD two-point and light-cone sum
rules. It is worth noting that doubly charged tetraquarks
Zcs = [sd][uc] with quantum numbers J P = 0+ , 0− and
1+ were investigated in our paper [11].
Interest to these yet hypothetical particles is twofold:
They are built of four quarks of different flavors, and
moreover bear two units of electric charge. Recently
the LHCb collaboration observed structures X0(1) (2900)
which may be interpreted as exotic mesons containing
four different quarks [4, 5]. The structures X0(1) were
seen as resonance-like peaks in the mass distribution of
D− K + mesons. The master process to discover X0(1)
was the weak decay of the B meson B + → D+ D− K + .
It is remarkable that the process B + → D+ D− K +
and data collected during its exploration can be employed to observe another tetraquarks, namely states
with quark content [uc][sd]. In fact, analysis of the invariant mass distribution of mesons D+ K + may lead
to information about doubly charged scalar and vector
tetraquarks [uc][sd]. Decays to final mesons D+ K + are
among favored channels of the scalar ZS++ and vector

spectively. The decay of the B meson B + → D− Ds+ π +
++
is also useful to see states ZS++ and ZV
, because processes ZS → Ds π and ZV → Ds π have considerable
branching ratios BR(ZS → Ds π) ≈ 0.12 and BR(ZV →
Ds π) ≈ 0.54. Results obtained for spectroscopic param++
eters and decay channels of ZV
, as well as information
on the tetraquarks Zcs may be useful for such experimental investigations. Existence of tetraquarks with content
[ud][cd] may be confirmed in decay B + → D− Ds+ π + as
well: These neutral states may be fixed in the invariant
mass distribution of D− π + mesons.
It is evident, that three-meson weak decays of B meson are sources of valuable information on four-quark exotic states. Data collected by various collaborations in
running experiments may be utilized for these purposes.
New decays of B meson can open wide prospects to study
numerous four-quark states. Indeed, final-state mesons
in such processes can be combined to form different pairs
and their invariant mass distributions can be explored
to find resonance-type enhancements. In any case, additional experimental and theoretical studies are necessary
to take advantage of the emerging opportunities.
