ABSTRACT

We measure the evolution of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) and the
stellar mass function (SMF) of Lyman-α (Lyα) emitters (LAEs) from z ∼ 2 to
z ∼ 6 by exploring ∼ 4000 LAEs from the SC4K sample. We find a correlation
between Lyα luminosity (LLyα ) and rest-frame UV (MUV ), with best-fit MUV =
+0.2
−1.6−0.3
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) + 47+12
−11 and a shallower relation between LLyα and stel−1
lar mass (M? ), with best-fit log10 (M? /M ) = 0.9+0.1
) − 28+4.0
−0.1 log10 (LLyα /erg s
−3.8 .
An increasing LLyα cut predominantly lowers the number density of faint MUV and
low M? LAEs. We estimate a proxy for the full UV LFs and SMFs of LAEs with
simple assumptions of the faint end slope. For the UV LF, we find a brightening of
the characteristic UV luminosity (M∗UV ) with increasing redshift and a decrease of the
characteristic number density (Φ∗ ). For the SMF, we measure a characteristic stellar
mass (M∗? /M ) increase with increasing redshift, and a Φ∗ decline. However, if we
apply a uniform luminosity cut of log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0, we find much milder to
no evolution in the UV and SMF of LAEs. The UV luminosity density (ρUV ) of the full
sample of LAEs shows moderate evolution and the stellar mass density (ρM ) decreases,
with both being always lower than the total ρUV and ρM of more typical galaxies but
slowly approaching them with increasing redshift. Overall, our results indicate that
both ρUV and ρM of LAEs slowly approach the measurements of continuum-selected
galaxies at z > 6, which suggests a key role of LAEs in the epoch of reionisation.
Key words: galaxies: high-redshift – galaxies: luminosity function, mass function –

INTRODUCTION

Multiple studies have used the Lyman-α (Lyα, λ0,vacuum =
1215.67 Å) emission line to successfully select large samples
of galaxies at z > 2 (e.g. Cowie & Hu 1998; Malhotra &
Rhoads 2004; van Breukelen et al. 2005; Ouchi et al. 2008;
Rauch et al. 2008; Matthee et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2016;

Drake et al. 2017; Sobral et al. 2018a; Konno et al. 2018;
Taylor et al. 2020). Lyα emission is typically associated with
young star-forming galaxies (SFGs, e.g. Partridge & Peebles 1967) but can also be emitted from active galaxy nuclei
(AGN; e.g. Miley & De Breuck 2008; Sobral et al. 2018b;
Calhau et al. 2020).
LAEs are typically young/primeval, low mass, low dust
extinction sources (e.g. Gawiser et al. 2006, 2007; Pentericci et al. 2007; Lai et al. 2008; Matthee et al. 2021), but
a significant diversity of properties within the Lyα population has been reported in the literature (e.g. Lai et al.

Santos et al.

2008; Finkelstein et al. 2009; Acquaviva et al. 2012; Hagen
et al. 2016; Matthee et al. 2016; Oyarzún et al. 2017; Santos
et al. 2020). Sources with high Lyα equivalent width (EW)
typically have young stellar ages, low metallicities and topheavy initial mass functions (e.g. Schaerer 2003; Raiter et al.
2010; Hashimoto et al. 2017). LAEs have been shown to be
very compact in the UV (e.g. Malhotra et al. 2012; PaulinoAfonso et al. 2018), with the compact morphology possibly
being favourable to the escape of Lyα photons. Additionally,
studies have shown that high-redshift LAEs may be progenitors of a wide range of galaxies, from present-day galaxies
(e.g. Gawiser et al. 2007; Guaita et al. 2010; Yajima et al.
2012) to bright cluster galaxies (BCGs; e.g. Khostovan et al.
2019), highlighting the significance of LAEs in galaxy evolution studies.
Studies of UV-continuum selected galaxies have found
that the Lyα fraction (χLyα , percentage of galaxies with Lyα
emission) increases with redshift up to z ∼ 6 (e.g. Stark
et al. 2010; Pentericci et al. 2011; Cassata et al. 2015; De
Barros et al. 2017; Caruana et al. 2018; Kusakabe et al.
2020). This might be explained by an average lower dust
content in higher redshift galaxies (e.g. Stanway et al. 2005;
Bouwens et al. 2006), increasing the Lyα escape fraction
(fesc,Lyα , ratio between observed and intrinsic Lyα photons
in a galaxy; e.g. Hayes et al. 2011) and/or increasing the ionising efficiency (ξion , number of produced ionising photons
per unit UV luminosity; e.g. Matthee et al. 2017a). χLyα is
typically computed with large spectroscopic samples, with
χLyα being the ratio between the number of galaxies with
Lyα emission detected above some Lyα EW threshold and
the total number of probed galaxies (see e.g. Stark et al.
2010). χLyα is found to be higher for galaxies fainter in the
rest-frame UV (MUV , e.g. Pentericci et al. 2011), implying
such galaxies have higher escape fraction of Lyα photons
and/or have a higher ξion (e.g Maseda et al. 2020). This
can also be linked with faint MUV galaxies having higher
Lyα EW (see e.g. Shimizu et al. 2011; Kusakabe et al. 2018)
and thus being more susceptible to being picked as LAEs,
although such trend could also be a consequence of selection effects or survey limits (see e.g. Nilsson et al. 2009;
Ando et al. 2006; Zheng et al. 2014; Hashimoto et al. 2017).
Some studies report no strong correlation between χLyα and
MUV (Kusakabe et al. 2020) and attribute the typical high
χLyα of faint MUV galaxies to selection biases in Lyman
break galaxy (LBG) samples, which are biased towards selecting sources with high Lyα EW, as strong Lyα emission
will boost the photometry and enhance the Lyman break,
making such sources easier to detect.
Alternatively, χLyα could in principle be inferred from
the ratio between luminosity functions (LF, number density per luminosity bin vs luminosity) of Lyα-selected and
UV continuum-selected samples. The UV LF of continuumselected galaxies has been extensively constrained in multiple studies up to z ∼ 10 (e.g. Steidel et al. 1999; Arnouts
et al. 2005; Sawicki & Thompson 2006; Bouwens et al.
2015; Finkelstein et al. 2015; Alavi et al. 2016; Mehta et al.
2017; Ono et al. 2018). The characteristic number density
(Φ∗ ) is found to decrease with an increasing redshift, from
log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) ∼ −2.5 at z ∼ 2 (Reddy & Steidel 2009)
to ∼ −3.5 at z ∼ 6 (Bouwens et al. 2015). The UV LF
of LAEs has also been probed by multiple studies (see e.g.
Hu et al. 2004; Shimasaku et al. 2006; Ouchi et al. 2008),

targeting volumes of up to ∼ 106 Mpc3 . Ouchi et al. (2008)
found no evolution of the UV LF of LAEs at z ∼ 3 − 4, but
an increase of UV bright LAEs at z = 5.7. It is important
to establish whether such evolutionary trends hold for much
larger volumes (∼ 108 Mpc3 ) and larger samples of LAEs.
Furthermore, it is important to establish how LAEs
contribute to the total mass budget of galaxies. LAEs are
typically low stellar mass galaxies, but can span a wide
range of stellar masses, with some LAEs being very massive (> 1010 M , e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2009). The stellar mass function (SMF) of continuum-selected galaxies has
been well studied up to z ∼ 4 (see e.g. Pozzetti et al. 2010;
Mortlock et al. 2011; Santini et al. 2012; Ilbert et al. 2013;
Muzzin et al. 2013). The SMF of continuum-selected galaxies is found to shift to lower number densities (Φ∗ decrease)
with increasing redshift, from log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) ∼ −3.3 at
z = 2 − 2.5 to ∼ −5.0 at z = 3 − 4 (Muzzin et al. 2013).
For LAEs, our understanding of the SMF is very limited
as most studies are only able to determine stellar masses
of stacks of the population (e.g. Kusakabe et al. 2018). Estimating stellar masses of high-redshift LAEs is challenging
due to near-infrared (NIR) coverage typically not being deep
enough. Recent programs such as UltraVISTA (McCracken
et al. 2012) DR4 provide ultra-deep NIR imaging which can
be used to better constrain the spectral energy distribution
of high-redshift galaxies. Measurements of the stellar mass of
individual galaxies in large samples spanning wide redshift
ranges can significantly improve our view on the evolution
of LAEs and how they compare with more typical galaxy
samples.
In this work, we use a uniformly selected sample of
∼ 4000 LAEs (SC4K, Sobral et al. 2018a) to compute UV
LFs and SMFs in the wide redshift range z ∼ 2 − 6. We use
the publicly available catalogues from Calhau et al. (2020)
which identify AGN candidates in the SC4K sample using
X-ray and radio measurements and the publicly available
catalogues from Santos et al. (2020) which has measured the
UV luminosity and stellar mass of LAEs in the SC4K sample. By comparing the luminosity and stellar mass density
of LAEs with measurements of continuum-selected galaxies, we can infer how representative LAEs are of the overall
population of galaxies at different redshifts.
This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we
present the SC4K sample of LAEs, together with some
galaxy properties derived in previous works. We present our
methodology to derive UV LFs and SMFs in Section 3. We
present and discuss our results in Section 4, probing the
evolution of the UV LF and SMF parameters across time,
as well as estimating the evolution of ΦLAE /ΦLBG (proxy
of χLyα ) and the luminosity and stellar mass densities. We
present our conclusions in Section 5. Throughout this work,
we use a ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 ,
ΩM = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7. All magnitudes in this paper are
presented in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983) and we use
a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF).

differences between narrow and medium bands. For reference, we show the 3σ LLyα limits for the IA427 (MB, z = 2.5), IA574 (MB,

(see Table 1 for an overview) over the 2 deg2 of the COSMOS field (Capak et al. 2007; Scoville et al. 2007; Taniguchi
et al. 2015). For full details on the selection criteria applied,
we refer the reader to Sobral et al. (2018a). Briefly, LAEs are
selected based on 1) Lyα EW0 > 50 Å (25 Å for NBs and 5 Å
for NB392); 2) significant excess emission (Σ > 3; see Bunker
et al. 1995); 3) colour break blueward of the Lyα emission; 4)
exclusion of sources with strong red colours (prevents lower
redshift interlopers with strong Balmer breaks); 5) full visual
inspection to remove spurious detections.

Multiple studies have used the SC4K sample to derive properties of LAEs. Paulino-Afonso et al. (2018) and
Shibuya et al. (2019) find small UV sizes with little evolution
from z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 6. Clustering analysis reveals dark matter
halo masses strongly depend on the Lyα luminosity (LLyα ,
Khostovan et al. 2019). Calhau et al. (2020) analysed X-ray
and radio data on the COSMOS field and measured a low
(< 10%) overall AGN fraction, dependent on LLyα , significantly increasing with increasing luminosity and approaching 100% at LLyα > 1044 erg s−1 . SED fitting from Santos
et al. (2020) shows that SC4K LAEs are typically very blue
(β = −2.1), low mass (M? = 109.3 M ), and above the starforming Main Sequence at z < 4 and M? < 109.5 M . SC4K
sources are also the prime focus of follow-up spectroscopic
observations focusing on studying primeval galaxies (Amorı́n
et al. 2017).

2.1.1

X-ray and radio AGN in SC4K

The SC4K sample includes 254 LAEs detected in X-ray and
120 detected in radio (56 in both), resulting in 318 AGN candidates (Calhau et al. 2020) out of 3705 SC4K LAEs with
X-ray or radio coverage. Following the same methodology
as Santos et al. (2020), we classify these sources as AGNs
since pure star-forming processes would require extremely
high SFRs (& 1000 M yr−1 ) to be detectable at such wavelengths and redshifts. Throughout this work, SC4K AGNs
are removed from any fitting/binning and median values in
tables, except in Figures 3 and 5 (left panel), where we show
the number densities of AGN LAEs.

2.1.2

Redshift binning

In addition to analysing the properties of LAEs from specific selection filters, we group filters with similar central
wavelengths to analyse specific redshift bins in a more statistically robust way. We use a grouping scheme similar to
Sobral et al. (2018a) and Santos et al. (2020):

Spectral energy distribution and properties of SC4K
LAEs

Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the full SC4K
sample is presented in Santos et al. (2020). Briefly, SEDfitting is done using the publicly available SED-fitting code
magphys1 (da Cunha et al. 2008, 2012) with the highredshift extension (see da Cunha et al. 2015), which models
stellar and dust emission from galaxies. We obtain photometric measurements from publicly available imaging, taken
with 34 rest-frame UV-FIR filters in the COSMOS field (Capak et al. 2007; McCracken et al. 2012; Steinhardt et al.
2014; Sanders et al. 2007; Lutz et al. 2011; Oliver et al.
2012). As the SED-fitting code does not include nebular
emission, we exclude the NB or MB with observed Lyα
emission from the SED-fitting. Derived parameters are the
median-likelihood parameters obtained by comparing modelled SEDs with libraries of galaxies at similar redshift.
magphys uses dust attenuation models from Charlot &
Fall (2000) and the stellar population synthesis model from
Bruzual & Charlot (2003) with a Chabrier (2003) IMF
1

http://www.iap.fr/magphys/

(range 0.1-100 M ). The prescription of Madau (1995) is
used to model the intergalactic medium (IGM).
In this work, we will focus on two SED-derived properties: rest-frame UV luminosity (MUV ) and stellar mass
(M? ). We use the public catalogues provided by Santos et al.
(2020), which contain coordinates, photometry and derived
galaxy properties for the full SC4K sample of LAEs.

2.2.1

Rest-frame UV luminosity (MUV )

The UV luminosity of a galaxy (MUV ) can be used as a
tracer of recent star-formation on ∼ 100 Myr timescales (e.g.
Boselli et al. 2001; Salim et al. 2009). MUV is computed
in Santos et al. (2020) by integrating the best-fit SEDs at
rest-frame λ0 = 1400 − 1600 Å. The median of the SC4K
sample is MUV = −20.2+0.7
−0.8 (Table 1), which corresponds to
0.09×L∗z=3 (Steidel et al. 1999).
Similarly but for shorter timescales, Lyα emission also
traces recent star-formation, due to being a tracer of LymanContinuum (e.g. Sobral & Matthee 2019) like Hα (Kennicutt 1998). As the massive young stars responsible for
producing the UV continuum also produce the ionising
photons that lead to Lyα emission, we can expect these
two properties to be related. For our sample of LAEs, we
observe that these two properties are typically correlated
(see Fig. 1, left panel), with the median MUV significantly
brightening from -19.8 to -21.4 in the luminosity range
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) = 42.5 − 43.5. We compute a best-fit
−1
of MUV = −1.6+0.2
) + 47+12
−0.3 log10 (LLyα /erg s
−11 from the
median distribution. However, Lyα luminosity (LLyα ) does
not necessarily translate MUV and vice-versa (see the scatter around MUV = −20 and see discussion in Matthee et al.
2017b and Sobral et al. 2018b). This is also made evident
from LBG samples, where there are bright MUV sources with
no significant Lyα detection, as shown by the Lyα fraction
(e.g. Stark et al. 2010; Pentericci et al. 2011; Arrabal Haro
et al. 2018; Kusakabe et al. 2020).

2.2.2

Stellar Mass (M? )

The shape and normalisation of an SED is a reflection of
the content of stars in a galaxy, thus its total mass of
stars (stellar mass, M? ) can be derived by fitting and modelling the SED. LAEs typically have low M? but there is
an important diversity within the population. The median
of the SC4K sample of LAEs is computed in Santos et al.
(2020) using magphys: log10 (M? /M ) = 9.3+0.6
−0.5 (Table
1), which corresponds to 0.006× M∗?,z=3−4 (Muzzin et al.
2013). We find the median M? and LLyα to be correlated
(see Fig. 1, right panel), with best-fit log10 (M? /M ) =
−1
0.9+0.1
) − 28+4.0
−0.1 log10 (LLyα /erg s
−3.8 , but with a significant
scatter of individual detections. This relation is shallower
than the one measured between MUV and LLyα , with a
more modest increase: the median log10 (M? /M ) only increases by 0.2 in the luminosity range log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) =
42.5 − 43.0. We note that the SED-fitting used to derive
M? does not include nebular emission, so the two properties
are independently derived. Additionally, there is an anticorrelation between M? and Lyα EW0 , and thus Lyα escape
fraction of LAEs (Santos et al. 2020).

MUV and LLyα typically correlate (see Fig. 1, left panel), the completeness corrections are larger for the faintest MUV bins. Right: Same
but for the SMF. As the correlation between LLyα and M? is shallower (see Fig. 1, right panel), completeness corrections are not a strong
function of stellar mass for a specific Lyα cut.

LUMINOSITY AND STELLAR MASS FUNCTIONS

In this section, we present our methodology and computations to derive UV LFs and SMFs for our sample of ∼ 4000
LAEs at well-defined redshift intervals between z ∼ 2 and
z ∼ 6.
3.1

Determining the luminosity/mass functions

We measure the number densities of well-defined MUV and
M? bins which we use to construct the UV LF and SMF.
We choose bin widths depending on MUV and M? , as the
most (and least) luminous and massive bins have fewer
sources. We define bins with width 0.5 dex in the range
−22 < MUV < −20 (MUV > −22.5 for the deeper NB816)
and 7 < log10 (M? /M ) < 10.5 and 1 dex outside these
ranges, where the number densities are the lowest. We use
Poissonian errors for any individual LF realisation.
The number density of a luminosity bin is given by:

log10 (φj ) = log10

1
Nj
d log10 L V


,

(1)

where φj is the number density of a bin j, Nj is the number
of sources within dlog10 L of j, and V is the volume probed by
the NBs or MBs for that specific bin (see Table 1), which is
computed from the redshift range that each filter is sensitive
to Lyα emission.

3.2

Completeness correction

Faint sources and those with low Lyα EW may be missed by
our selection criteria, leading to an underestimation of number densities. We estimate completeness corrections based
on Lyα line flux (same corrections used for the Lyα LFs in
Sobral et al. 2018a; full details therein) and apply them to
the UV LFs and the SMFs of our sample of LAEs. Briefly,
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

for each NB or MB, we obtain a sample of high-redshift nonline-emitters by applying the same colour break we used to
target the Lyman break in our LAEs and by selecting sources
with photometric redshifts (obtained from Laigle et al. 2016)
±0.2 the redshift range given in Table 1. The distribution of
MB/NB magnitudes in this non-line-emitter sample is similar to the distribution of LAEs, with a tail of 2−5% brighter
sources. The non-line-emitter sample is thus slightly brighter
than the sample of LAEs and provides a sightly conservative
estimation of the completeness corrections. For each nonline-emitter sample, flux is incrementally added to the NB
or MB and BB (see Sobral et al. 2018a, Table 3 therein).
By reapplying our selection criteria after each step, we determine the fraction of galaxies which are picked as emitters
per Lyα luminosity value. We only consider sources with
> 30% completeness.
We apply completeness corrections to each LAE individually, based on their observed Lyα flux, and not their MUV
or M? . In Fig. 2, we show MUV and M? number densities for
z = 2.5 (IA427) LAEs, before and after completeness corrections. We note that the completeness correction is based on
Lyα flux and thus larger for fainter LAEs but not necessarily
correlated with other properties. Since MUV and LLyα typically correlate (see Fig. 1, left panel), the corrections will
typically be smaller for LAEs which are brighter in MUV
(see Fig. 2, left panel). Since the correlation between M?
and LLyα is weak (see Fig. 1, right panel), the corrections
will be similar for the entire mass range (see Fig. 2, right
panel).
Including the completeness correction, applied to each
source, Equation 1 becomes:

Figure 3. The rest-frame UV LF (blue circles) for each of the 16 individual selection filters in this study, without any Lyα flux cut and
excluding AGNs (see §2.1.1). Luminosity bins brighter than the peak of number densities are marked with a purple edge colour. The blue
contours are the 16th and 84th percentile of multiple iterations of fits to the luminosity bins, obtained by perturbing the luminosity bins
within their error bars (see §3.5) for the full UV luminosity range. The purple contours represent the same but only fitting the points
above the number density peak. We compare our results with those of Ouchi et al. (2008) at z ∼ 3, 4, 5.7, finding a good agreement, with
the offset at z = 5.8 being easily explained by differences in Lyα flux limits. We show the number densities of AGNs (pink stars), which
predominantly dominate the bright MUV regime (< −22) at z < 4, often having higher number densities than non-AGN LAEs. At z > 4
there is significantly less AGN LAEs, composing only a small fraction of LAEs at all MUV ranges.

we compute the upper limit as one source at the volume
probed by the NB or MB, with the completeness correction
equal to the total completeness correction applied to the
previous luminosity or stellar mass bin.

3.3

Fitting the UV luminosity function

In order to compare our results with previous studies, we
adopt the common parameterisation of Schechter (1976)
function, which consists of a power-law with a slope α for
faint luminosities and a declining exponential for brighter luminosities. The transition between the two regimes is given
by a characteristic luminosity (L∗ ) and a characteristic number density (Φ∗ ). The Schechter equation has the following
form:

Φ(L) =

Φ∗
L∗



L
L∗

α



L
exp − ∗ ,
L

(3)

Equation 3.3 can be rewritten for absolute magnitudes
by using the substitution Φ(L)dL = Φ(MUV )dMUV :
Φ(MUV ) =



ln 10 ∗ −0.4(α+1)∆MUV
Φ 10
exp −10−0.4∆MUV , (4)
2.5

where ∆MUV = MUV − M∗UV .
The observed UV luminosity distribution of LAEs
shows the same behaviour at all redshifts: there is a peak
number density at an intermediate UV luminosity, with a
subsequent decline in number density for both brighter and
fainter UV luminosities (see Fig. 3). While such a distribution does not resemble the Schechter function with a steep
faint end which is typically measured in LBG samples (e.g.
Bouwens et al. 2015; Finkelstein et al. 2015), we argue that
such observed distribution of UV luminosities can be expected for a sample which is selected by Lyα line flux above
some threshold (corresponding to a vertical cut in Fig. 1),
causing an incomplete sampling of MUV . This incomplete
sampling is most significant at the faint UV luminosities,
which is shown in Fig. 5 (right panel) where an increasMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

Figure 4. The SMF for each of the 16 individual selection filters. Stellar mass bins are shown as blue circles. Stellar mass bins more
massive than the peak of number densities are marked with a purple edge colour. The blue contours are the 16th and 84th percentile of
multiple iterations of fits to the stellar mass bins, obtained by perturbing the stellar mass bins within their error bars (see §3.5) for the
full stellar mass range. The purple contours represent the same but only fitting the points above the number density peak. Candidate
AGN are removed from the analysis here (see §2.1.1)

ing LLyα limit will cause a preferential decline of number
densities at faint UV luminosities and hence the observed
turn-over. Thus, in order to conduct a detailed analysis of
the UV luminosity distribution of LAEs, we explore two separate scenarios:
• fit to the full UV luminosity range (blue in Fig. 3): the
entire observable UV luminosity range is considered, including the turn-over at faint UV luminosities. While the low
number densities at faint UV luminosities may be driven by
our LLyα limits, this approach provides the best-fit to the
directly observed number densities.
• fit to the UV luminosity range brighter than the number density peak (purple in Fig. 3): the bins fainter than
the number density peak (dominated by an incomplete sampling) are thus not included in the fitting, and the faint UV
luminosity regime becomes unconstrained. The peak in number density is different for different filters (see Fig. 3) and
different LLyα limits (see Fig. 5, right panel). With the simple assumptions of a steep faint end slope (as measured in
UV luminosity-selected samples) and by not including the
bins below of the turn-over (which are heavily dominated by
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

our LLyα limits), we obtain a proxy of the full distribution
of LAEs.
We provide the Schechter parameters of the best-fits to
both cases in Table 2. For the fit to the full UV luminosity
range, we find the set of parameters (α, M∗UV , Φ∗ ) which
minimises the reduced χ2 (χ2red ) in log-space. Alternatively,
fitting can also be performed in linear-space, where χ2 is
less sensitive to bins with low number densities. A fit in logspace thus tends to favour slightly brighter characteristic
luminosities which provide a better fit to the very bright
luminosities. We find that the observed distribution is best
fit by shallow faint end slopes (α > −1), which are able to
represent the turn-over at the faintest luminosities, with α
even being positive at some redshift ranges.
When constraining only the UV luminosities brighter
than the number density peak, we are not able to directly
constrain the α slope of the power-law, and thus fix α to -1.5
(similar to the UV LF of LAEs from e.g. Ouchi et al. 2008),
but we still perturb this parameter to quantify uncertainties
(see §3.5). Here, we make the assumption that α does not
evolve with redshift, which is a necessary caveat due to not
being able to directly constrain it. We measure the UV LF

Table 2. Best-fit Schechter parameters for the UV LF of LAEs from z = 2 to z = 6, for each of the individual selection filters and for
different redshift bins (see §2.1.2). The number of sources provided here is the number of sources included in the luminosity functions,
i.e. non-AGN LAEs with available SEDs and with completeness corrections > 30%. We provide best fits for the two cases considered in
this study: fit to the full UV luminosity range (blue in Fig. 3) and fit to the bins brighter than the number density peak (purple in Fig.
3). We provide the best set of parameters (α, M∗UV and Φ∗ ) which minimise χ2red , with α being fixed for the latter case as it cannot be
directly constrained. When χ2red is very large, the errors should be interpreted with caution as the best parameters found still do not
provide a good model. Additionally, M∗UV is also fixed for the individual filters with less than three luminosity bins (although we perturb
these parameters when exploring the uncertainties of the bins/fits, see §3.5). For the redshift bins we also show the Schechter parameters
when applying a log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut.

(M∗UV , Φ∗ ) which minimises χ2red in log-space of the MUV
luminosity bins with associated Poissonian error bars. In
Fig. 3, we show the luminosity bins and luminosity functions
of LAEs from the 16 selection filters. For the filters with
only two luminosity bins brighter than the number density
peak, we can only fit one free parameter, so we fix M∗UV
to a similar nearby filter (NB501 uses M∗UV,IA505 = −20.37
and IA738+IA767 use M∗UV,IA709 = −21.22). We provide the
Schechter parameters of the best fits in Table 2.

different redshift bins (see §2.1.2). The number of sources provided here is the number of sources included in the stellar mass functions,
i.e. non-AGN LAEs with available SEDs and with completeness corrections > 30%. We provide best fits for the two cases considered in
this study: fit to the full stellar mass range (blue in Fig. 4) and fit to the bins more massive than the number density peak (purple in
Fig. 4). We provide the best set of parameters (α, M∗? and Φ∗ ) which minimise χ2red , with α being fixed for the latter case as it cannot
be directly constrained. When χ2red is very large, the errors should be interpreted with caution as the best parameters found still do not
provide a good model. Additionally, M∗? is also fixed for the individual filters with less than three luminosity bins (although we perturb
these parameters when exploring the uncertainties of the bins/fits, see §3.5). For the redshift bins we also show the Schechter parameters
when applying a log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut.

with a steep slope could be expected for a mass-selected sample, as our LAEs are selected by being above some Lyα line
flux (corresponding to a vertical cut in Fig. 1) determined by
observational constraints, there is a turn-over at low stellar
masses. The preferential decline of low stellar masses with
increasing Lyα line flux is shown in Fig. 8 (right panel), and
we further discuss how to interpret the shape of the SMF in
§4.1.

Following the same reasons listed for the UV LF, we
conduct our fitting procedure in two stellar mass ranges:
full stellar mass range (blue in Fig. 4) and stellar mass range
above the turn-over, with an assumption of the α slope (blue
in Fig. 4). The former provides a fit to the directly observed
number densities and the later provides a proxy SMF of
the full distribution of LAEs. We provide the best Schechter

fits to both cases in Table 3. For the fit of the full stellar
mass range, we find the set of parameters (α, M∗? , Φ∗ ) which
minimises χ2red in log-space. The observed distribution with
a turn-over for the faintest luminosities, results in shallow
faint end slopes (α > −1).

When constraining only the stellar masses bigger than
the number density peak, we are not able to directly constrain the α slope of the power-law. We fix α to -1.3, but we
vary all parameters, including α in §3.5. Similarly to the UV
LF, we introduce the caveat the α does not evolve with redshift, which is a necessary assumption due to us not being
able to directly constrain it. In Fig. 4, we show the stellar
mass bins and SMFs of LAEs from the 16 selection filters.
For the filters with only two stellar mass bins, we can only
fit one free parameter, so we fix M∗? to a similar nearby filter

Santos et al.

(NB711+IA767 use M∗?,IA738 = 1010.68 M ). We provide the
Schechter parameters of in best fits in Table 3.

3.5

Perturbing the luminosity and mass functions

We explore the uncertainties in our UV LFs and SMFs by
perturbing the luminosity or mass bins within their Poissonian error bars. For each iteration, we perturb each bin
within their error bars (assuming a normal probability distribution function centred at each bin and with FWHM equal
to the error) and determine the value for the current realisation. We compute the best Schechter fit to the bins of the
current realisation and iterate the process 1000 times. We
obtain the 16th and 84th percentile of all fits, which we plot
as contours in all figures. For each iteration, we also perturb
the fixed Schechter parameters (α for all redshifts and M∗? or
M∗UV for the filters with only two bins) by picking a random
value in a ±0.2 dex range centred in the fixed values (same
method as Sobral et al. 2018a).

3.6

Obtaining UV and stellar mass densities

We integrate UV LFs and SMFs to obtain the luminosity
density (ρUV ) and the stellar mass density (ρM ), respectively. In order to fully take into account the uncertainties
in our luminosities/stellar masses, we perturb our measurements within their errors and fit and integrate each of the
1000 realisations (see §3.5). The computed ρUV and ρM are
the median of all integrals, with the errors being the 16th
and 84th percentile of the distribution of all realisations. To
obtain ρUV , we compute the integral of the UV LFs in the
range −23 < MUV < −17 (similar to e.g. Finkelstein et al.
2015; Bouwens et al. 2015). To obtain ρM , we compute the
integral of the SMFs in the range 108−13 M (similar to e.g.
Davidzon et al. 2017). All ρM measurements in this study
assume a Chabrier IMF, and values from the literature are
converted to a Chabrier IMF if another IMF was used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Interpreting the observed UV LF and SMF

As detailed in the previous sections, the observed distribution of both the UV LF and SMF of LAEs has a turn-over at
the faintest UV luminosities and smallest stellar masses, respectively (see Fig. 3 and 4). While such a turn-over has not
been observed in UV-selected or mass-selected samples, it
is an expected distribution of a Lyα-selected sample, where
Lyα correlates with both MUV and M? but with significant
scatter (see Fig. 1), as there will be incomplete sampling of
MUV and M? , particularly at the faint UV luminosity and
low stellar mass regimes. As shown in Fig. 5 (right panel),
an increasing LLyα cut will preferentially decrease the number densities of the faintest UV luminosities, creating the
turn-over which is a consequence of selection and not an
intrinsic property of the UV LF of LAEs. A similar dependence is measured for the SMF in Fig. 8 (right panel), albeit
the dependence is not as strong. We make the assumption
that the incomplete sampling will introduce only small contributions above the turn-over, which is supported by our

measurements (Fig. 5, right panel): when extending the luminosity cut from log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) = 42.5 to 42.7 (and
even further into 42.9 and 43.1), the number densities always have a very significant drop below the turn-over but
remain roughly constant above it. By only fitting the regime
above the turn-over and by fixing α as a steep slope, we are
able to measure a distribution which is not dominated by
incomplete sampling, and compute a proxy for the full UV
LFs and SMFs.
We provide in Table 2 and 3 the best Schechter parameters of the distribution of 1) the full UV luminosity (or
stellar mass) ranges (see the blue contours in Fig. 3 and 4)
and 2) the UV luminosity (or stellar mass) range above the
turn-over, with a fixed steep α slope (see the purple contours
in Fig. 3 and 4). As we aim to understand the full LAE population, in the analysis conducted in the following sections
we use the second fitting procedure, which gives a proxy of
the full distribution of LAEs. We note nonetheless that the
LLyα limits can have some influence on the number densities
even above the turn-over, so when probing redshift evolution
we extend the analysis to always use the same LLyα cut and
ensure the samples are comparable (see discussion in §4.3).

4.2

The global UV LF of LAEs at z ∼ 2 − 6

We start by measuring the UV LF of the full sample of
SC4K LAEs, exploring a large volume of ∼ 108 Mpc3 at
z ∼ 2 − 6. With our large sample of ∼ 4000 LAEs, we are
capable of probing extremely bright UV luminosities, down
to MUV = −24, which even in UV-continuum searches has
typically only been reached in very wide area ground-based
surveys (e.g. Bowler et al. 2017; Ono et al. 2018). Additionally, we have a statistically robust sample up to MUV = −20,
providing a robust probe in a range of 4 dex in MUV , with
individual LAEs as faint as MUV = −17.
We show in Fig. 5 (left panel) the UV LF for three subsets of SC4K LAEs: 1) All LAEs; 2) All LAEs after removing
AGN (this is the subset we use throughout this paper; see
§2.1.1); 3) AGN LAEs only. We show the best Schechter fits
to each case as 1σ contours, which we obtain by perturbing
the luminosity bins within their Poissonian errors and fitting
1000 realisations of the perturbed bins (see §3.5). We find
that the UV LF of all LAEs resembles a Schechter distribution, although there is an excess at MUV < −23, where the
UV LF starts deviating from a Schechter function. A single
power-law with best-fit log10 (Φ/Mpc−3 ) = 0.71+0.01

excluding AGNs, the number density significantly drops by

−0.01 MUV + 14.49−0.11 , becoming

less preferable (χreduced = 60.63). We observe that AGN
LAEs clearly dominate the bright end (−24 < MUV < −23)
of the UV LF, with only minor contributions to the faint
end (−22 < MUV < −20). This trend is qualitatively similar
to the one found by Sobral et al. (2018a) for the Lyα LF
of LAEs. Such a similar behaviour between the UV LF and
Lyα LF is a consequence of LLyα and MUV being typically
correlated (see Fig. 1, left panel), although the complicated
radiative transfer physics behind Lyα emission should be
noted.

Figure 5. Left: UV LF of the full SC4K sample of LAEs: including AGN (green), no AGN (blue; what we use throughout this work) and
AGN only (pink). AGN LAEs dominate the bright end (−24 < MUV < −23) of the UV LF of LAEs. The contours are the 16th and 84th
percentiles, which we obtain by perturbing the bins within their Poissonian error bars and iterating the fitting 1000 times (see §3.5). For
reference, we show UV LFs of LBGs at z ∼ 4, from Bouwens et al. (2015) (orange diamonds) and Ono et al. (2018) (purple squares). The
number density of MUV = −20 LAEs is ∼ 1.5 dex lower than LBGs, but they converge to the same number densities at MUV < −23.
Right: UV LF of the full SC4K sample at different LLyα cuts. We show the best Schechter fits to the full UV luminosity range as dashed
lines, and to the number densities above the turn-over as filled lines (see §3.3). The increasing LLyα cuts reduce the number densities,
predominantly for fainter MUV , which can be linked with LLyα and MUV being typically correlated (see Fig. 1, left panel). However,
note that the UV LF of more luminous LAEs yields a declining Φ∗ but a brightening in M∗UV .

UV LF with varying LLyα cuts

Due to an increasing luminosity distance with redshift, we
are only capable of reaching the faintest Lyα luminosities
(down to 1042.5 erg s−1 ) at z ∼ 2.5, or at higher redshifts
with NBs. We aim to ensure that when comparing UV LFs
at different redshifts, results are not driven by differences
in depth. As such, we need to estimate how different Lyα
luminosity limits affect the UV LF of LAEs. We show in
Fig. 5 (right panel) the UV LF of the full SC4K sample with
varying LLyα cuts, from 1042.5 to 1043.5 erg s−1 . As expected
from the dependence of MUV and LLyα , an increasing LLyα
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

cut predominantly decreases the number densities of fainter
MUV LAEs. For the full SC4K sample, between 1042.5 and
1043.3 erg s−1 , log10 Φ decreases by 2.0 dex at MUV = −20.25
but only decreases by 0.3 dex at MUV = −22.5. This trend
is qualitatively the same at all redshifts.
It is thus clear that a varying Lyα flux limit will significantly affect the UV LF as a whole, both in shape and
characteristic parameters, with number densities being significantly more affected for fainter MUV . To compare UV
LFs at different redshifts and interpret any evolution, it
is therefore necessary to ensure we use the same luminosity ranges, otherwise a potential evolution in the UV LF

of LAEs may not be intrinsic but instead could be a consequence of the different Lyα luminosity limits. As such, when
comparing LFs, we not only compare the full samples, but
also compare a homogeneous subset, defined by a single Lyα
luminosity cut of log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0, which we will
apply to all redshifts. We choose this value as it excludes
the lower LLyα regime which can only be reached at lower
redshift or by the deep NBs, and covers a luminosity regime
which is probed at all redshifts, ensuring we are comparing
similar samples of LAEs. While this cut will only remove a
small fraction of LAEs from MBs at z > 3.5, it will significantly reduce the number of sources at the lower redshifts,
with only 10% of non-AGN LAEs at z = 2.5 being above
this Lyα cut.

4.3.1

The log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 population of LAEs
and limitations

In order to probe evolution in the same luminosity ranges,
we have defined a subsample of the SC4K sample of
LAEs, with log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 at all redshifts.
In comparison, the characteristic LLyα is measured to be
log10 (L∗Lyα /erg s−1 ) = 42.93+0.15
−0.11 (Sobral et al. 2018a), so
these sources are extremely bright LAEs, rare dust-free starbursts. Amorı́n et al. (2017) has shown that such sources
(some galaxies in that study are also selected as LAEs in
the SC4K sample) are analogues of high-z primeval galaxies.
Nonetheless, imposing an artificial LLyα limit in our
samples requires some caveats. As it can be seen in Fig. 5
(right panel), even for the bright MUV (<-21) regime, the LF
only truly converges for log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) < 42.7, with a
further ∼ 0.1−0.2 dex drop-off in Φ as we move to a ∼ 1043.0
LLyα cut. Introducing a LLyα limit (corresponding to a vertical cut in Fig. 1) introduces uncertainties in the estimation
of the LFs, as with a log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut one
can only derive the LF down to MUV ∼ −21, which is comparable to M∗UV . Extremely deep surveys with e.g. MUSE
can address this issue by reaching faint LLyα even at the

highest redshifts, at the cost of probing lower volumes and
thus not being able to fully constrain the brightest regimes.
A combined effort from IFU and NB/MB surveys (see synergy/combined Lyα LF, Sobral et al. 2018a) can be the path
to fully exploring the UV LFs of LAEs. In this work, while we
show and discuss the best estimates computed for the samples with the log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut, as they provide a relative comparison of the same luminosity regimes,
we focus our baseline interpretation of evolution on the full
sample with no luminosity cuts.

4.4

Redshift evolution of the UV LF from z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 6

We will now use our sample of LAEs, selected with 16 unique
NBs and MBs in 16 well defined redshift slices, to probe the
evolution of the UV LF of LAEs from z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 6. We
have shown in Fig. 3 the UV LF for LAEs selected from each
of the 16 individual NB and MB filters, together with best-fit
Schechters and 1σ countours. We provide all the Schechter
parameter estimates in Table 2. All samples are well represented by Schechter distributions. Our measurements agree
well with Ouchi et al. (2008) at z ∼ 3, z ∼ 4 and z ∼ 5.7,
but we report lower number densities at z = 5.8, particularly for fainter MUV . This discrepancy can be explained by
differences in Lyα flux limits, as the MB that we use is only
sensitive to log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0. We also note that
our MUV measurements are estimated from SED fitting with
30+ bands, including the recent ultra-deep NIR data from
UltraVISTA DR4, instead of directly from adjacent photometric bands.
For a statistically robust study of the evolution of UV
LFs of LAEs with redshift, we group LAEs from multiple
filters that probe similar redshifts to explore five different
bins of redshift (z = 2.5, z = 3.1, z = 3.9, z = 4.7 and
z = 5.4; see §2.1.2), as well as the full SC4K sample. The
completeness corrections are applied to LAEs individually,
based on their Lyα luminosity (see 3.2) and the volume per
redshift bin is the sum of the volume of individual redshift
slices included in the redshift bin (see Table 1).

mass range compared to the UV LF (Fig. 5, right panel), which can be explained by LLyα and M? having a shallower correlation with
significant scatter (see Fig. 1, right panel).

We show in Fig. 6 (left panel) the UV LF at different

5.4), without any LLyα cut. We also show in Fig. 6 (right
panel) the 1σ, 2σ and 3σ contours of Φ∗ −M∗UV . We observe
a brightening (M∗UV becomes more negative) of the UV LF
with increasing redshift, from ∼ −20.5 at z = 2.5 to ∼ −22
at z = 5.4, and a log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) decrease from ∼ −3.5
to ∼ −4.5 for the same redshifts. While in UV-continuum
studies (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2015; Finkelstein et al. 2015) Φ∗
of the UV LF is also measured to decrease with increasing
redshift, M∗UV is found to become fainter (increase), which

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

is the opposite of what we measure in our sample of LAEs
(before applying any luminosity cut).
However, as previously discussed (§4.3), different Lyα
luminosity limits play a very significant role on the shape
and characteristic parameters of the UV LF. We thus
conduct the same analysis for a subset of our sample
of LAEs, obtained by applying the luminosity cut of
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0. By using a uniform cut at all
redshifts (see Fig. 7), we are able to probe evolution in comparable Lyα luminosity regimes, and reduce the effects of
the Lyα flux limit bias, but also introducing some caveats
(see discussion in §4.3.1). We now observe an increase of Φ∗

observed in UV-continuum selected samples. We do not observe trends in M∗UV evolution, which also contrasts the increase in M∗UV observed in UV-continuum selected samples.
There is no evolution of log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) between z ∼ 3
and z ∼ 6, but we observe a brightening between z ∼ 3 and
z ∼ 5 − 6, which is the same trend reported by Ouchi et al.
(2008).

4.5

The global SMF of LAEs at z ∼ 2 − 6

Following the same methodology that we use for the UV
LF, we now analyse the global SMF of ∼ 4000 LAEs at
z ∼ 2 − 6. The study of the SMF of such a large sample of LAEs over such a wide volume is unprecedented at
these redshift ranges. We have a robust sample of LAEs
at 109.0 − 1012.5 M , with individual measurements down
to ∼ 107.5 M . Studies that have estimated stellar masses
of z > 2 galaxies, typically only probe > 1010 M galaxies (e.g. Schreiber et al. 2015) but with our population of
LAEs, we are capable of reaching galaxies with very low
stellar masses, while still having detections of very massive
systems (> 1011 M ).
We show in Fig. 8 (left panel) the SMF of the full SC4K
sample of z ∼ 2 − 6 LAEs after removing AGN (which is
what we use throughout this paper, see §2.1.1). Unlike the
UV LF, we do not explore how AGNs influence the SMF
since we are not able to accurately estimate the stellar mass
of AGNs with our stellar+dust SED-fitting code which does
not use AGN models. We show the Schechter fit to the SMF
and the 1σ contour which we estimate by perturbing the
stellar mass bins within their Poissonian errors and fitting
1000 realisations of the perturbed bins (see §3.5). The SMF
resembles a Schechter distribution, but with an excess in
number densities at 1012 M .

4.6

SMF with varying LLyα cuts

Here, we explore how different Lyα luminosity limits affect
the SMF. For the UV LF of LAEs, we have observed that
an increasing LLyα cut significantly affects the shape and
characteristic parameters of the distribution, with a more
significant effect on the number density of fainter UV luminosities, which are typically linked with lower Lyα luminosities. Such a trend is not necessarily expected for the SMF,
as the relation between M? and LLyα is very shallow, if even
present (see Fig. 1, right panel).
We show in Fig. 8 (right panel) the SMF of the
full SC4K sample with varying LLyα cuts, from 1042.5 to
1043.5 erg s−1 . As the stellar mass and LLyα have a shallow
relation, an increasing LLyα produces a much more uniform
decay of the number densities over the entire stellar mass
range. Between 1042.5 and 1043.3 erg s−1 , log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 )
decreases by 1.6 dex at log10 (M? /M ) = 9.25 and by 1.0
dex at log10 (M? /M ) = 11.0, which is much more modest
than the large difference observed for the UV LF.
As such, when comparing SMFs at different redshifts,
we will not only look at the full samples, but we will also
make use of a luminosity cut log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0,
for the same reasons that we do for the UV LF (see the
discussion in §4.3, including the limitations associated with
fitting a LF to our sample after applying a luminosity cut).
This produces a luminosity range which all filters can target
and is consistent with our approach to compare UV LFs.
4.7

Redshift evolution of the SMF of LAEs from z ∼ 2 to
z∼6

We probe the evolution of the SMF with redshift, using ∼
4000 LAEs selected in 16 well defined redshift slices from
z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 6. We showed the SMF of LAEs selected
from individual filters in Fig. 4, together with 1σ Schechter
contours. All redshift slices resemble a Schechter distribution
and we provide the best-fit parameters in Table 3.
In order to obtain statistically robust comparisons of the
evolution of the SMF of LAEs with redshift, we follow the

(Ono et al. 2018). We show simple extrapolations to log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 42.0 (orange stars) and log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 41.0 (red

when it surpasses that value.

same grouping scheme that we use for the UV LFs. We define
five redshift intervals (z = 2.5, z = 3.1, z = 3.9, z = 4.7 and
z = 5.4; see §2.1.2) and also use the global SMF of the full
z ∼ 2 − 6 sample. The completeness corrections are applied
to LAEs individually, based on their Lyα luminosity (see
3.2) and the volume per redshift bin is the sum of the volume
of individual redshift slices included in the redshift bin (see
Table 1). We show in Fig. 9 (left panel) the SMF at different
redshifts (z = 2.5, z = 3.1, z = 3.9, z = 4.7 and z = 5.4),
without any LLyα cut. We also show in Fig. 9 (right panel)
the 1σ, 2σ and 3σ contours of Φ∗ −M∗? . We observe a clear
evolution of the SMF with redshift (before applying any Lyα
luminosity restriction), with the low mass end shifting down
by 1 dex from z = 2.5 to z = 5.4. This is reflected as a
gradual log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) decrease with redshift from −4.6
at z = 2.5 to −5.8 at z = 5.4. We measure an M∗? increase
from log10 (M∗? /M ) = 10.6 to 11.5 at the same redshift
ranges. The shift down to lower Φ∗ with increasing redshift
is also observed in the SMF of more typical galaxies (e.g.
Muzzin et al. 2013), which suggests the observed trends are
qualitatively the same, however, an analysis using the same
luminosity regime is still required.
As previously discussed in §4.6, different Lyα luminosity
limits play a very significant role on the shape and characteristic parameters of the SMF. We thus conduct the same
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

analysis for a subset of our sample of LAEs, obtained by applying the luminosity cut of log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0. By
using a uniform cut at all redshifts (see Fig. 10), we are able
to probe evolution in comparable Lyα luminosity regimes,
and reduce the effects of the Lyα flux limit bias, but also introducing some caveats (see discussion in §4.3.1 for the UV
LF, as the limitations raised also apply to the SMF). While
there is a clear evolution in the observed Schechter fits of
the full samples, we find no evidence of such evolution when
comparing samples of LAEs within the same Lyα regime. We
find little M∗? and Φ∗ evolution with redshift, remaining constant at log10 (M∗? /M ) ∼ 11 and log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) ∼ −5.8.
The evolution that we find when looking at the same luminosity regimes is thus not qualitatively the same that is observed in more typical galaxies. Analysis of the evolution of
the stellar mass density, will provide more insight into this.

Evolution of the Lyα fraction

We attempt to infer the Lyα fraction (χLyα ) dependence
on redshift and MUV . We compute the ratio between the
observed UV number densities in our sample of LAEs and
the UV number densities of LBGs from the literature:
ΦLAE /ΦLBG , which can be interpreted as the fraction of
LBGs that are LAEs (above some Lyα detection limit), or

Figure 12. Evolution of the UV luminosity (ρUV ) with redshift. We show the ρUV measurements for our sample of LAEs (black circles),
but also with a consistent log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut (blue circles, see discussion on limitations of fitting the LF of this subsample
in §4.3.1). ρUV of the full SC4K sample is shown as stars, using the same colour scheme. The shaded contours are the 16th and 84th
percentiles of the fits, obtained by perturbing the MUV bins at each redshift (see §3.5). We find no evidence for ρM evolution with redshift
when applying a consistent LLyα cut. We compare our results with measurements from the literature, from continuum-selected LBG
populations: z = 2.3, z = 3.05 (Reddy & Steidel 2009), z = 3.8 , z = 4.9, z = 5.9, z = 6.8, z = 7.9 (Bouwens et al. 2015), z = 4, z = 5,
z = 6, z = 7, z = 8 (Finkelstein et al. 2015).

χLyα . To compute this fraction, we use a UV LF compilation consisting of: z = 2.3, z = 3.05 (Reddy & Steidel 2009),
z = 4, z = 5 and z = 6 (Ono et al. 2018) (which we use for
the redshifts z = 2.5, z = 3.1, z = 3.9, z = 4.7 and z = 5.4,
respectively). For the full SC4K sample (median z = 4.1)
we use the z = 4 literature measurements from (Ono et al.
2018), which being a very wide area LBG survey, provides a
fair comparison with our wide area LAE survey. To prevent
any biases from fitting, the ratio is computed directly from
the luminosity bins in this study and the literature, with
the latter being interpolated to the MUV values used in this
study.
As clearly seen for the full sample in Fig. 5 (left panel),
the number density of faint MUV LBGs is multiple times
higher than the number density of faint MUV LAEs. The
number densities of MUV = −20 LAEs is ∼ 1.5 dex lower
than LBGs, but they converge to the same number densities
for MUV brighter than -23. We show the ratio of the two
number densities in Fig. 11 for five redshift intervals (and
the full SC4K sample), before and after applying a LLyα
cut. The z = 2.5 panel shows that as we probe fainter Lyα
luminosities, we get closer to unity in the ΦLAE /ΦLBG fraction, and that the effect of the Lyα cut depends on MUV , as
shown in §4.3. For very bright MUV (< −23), we are always
able to retrieve most galaxies, as MUV bright are typically

also Lyα bright (see Fig. 1, left panel) and the ΦLAE /ΦLBG
will always be close to unity. This holds true for all redshifts,
with the ratio always tending to unity at the brightest UV
luminosities. When comparing ΦLAE /ΦLBG at different redshifts, for the comparable log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 subsample, we observe that ΦLAE /ΦLBG is typically higher at
z > 4 than for the lower redshift samples. This may imply
that LAEs become a bigger subset of LBGs with increasing
redshift (same trend found in e.g. Arrabal Haro et al. 2020),
but we explore this further by measuring the UV luminosity
density.
We make a direct extrapolation of the measurements
of log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 and ≥ 42.5 z = 2.5 LAEs
to lower LLyα cuts by scaling the increment in ΦLAE . The
extrapolated values for log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 42.0 and ≥
41.0 are shown in Fig. 11. We find that for MUV = −20
at z = 2.5, we would approach unit if we could reach
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) = 41.0. We make the simple assumption that the extrapolation we predict for z = 2.5 is valid
for all redshifts, as the higher flux limits of the other redshifts are not capable of reaching log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 42.5
and thus do not allow a direct extrapolation. We find that
for z & 3 the ratio approaches unit even for MUV = −21
to −22. We note that for z > 4 and for the full SC4K sample, the extrapolation at MUV = −22.5 can be below the

Redshift evolution of the UV luminosity density of
z ∼ 2 − 6 LAEs

We measure the UV luminosity density (ρUV ) at the aforementioned redshift intervals in our sample of LAEs and explore its evolution. We detail how the integration is conducted in §3.6, with α being fixed to -1.5 but perturbed
within ±0.2 dex. We provide our ρUV measurements in Table 4.
When applying no luminosity restriction, we measure
that log10 (ρUV /erg s−1 Hz−1 Mpc−3 ) is anti-correlated with
redshift, with a moderate decline from 25.2 at z = 2.5 to
25.0 at z ∼ 5 − 6. When applying the luminosity cut of
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0, log10 (ρUV /erg s−1 Hz−1 Mpc−3 )
of LAEs changes from 24.3 to 25.0. In comparison,
log10 (ρUV /erg s−1 Hz−1 Mpc−3 ) of LBGs is always higher
and decreases with redshift, from 26.5 at z = 2.5 to 26.0
at z = 6. We extrapolate the ratio between the luminosity

determine it tends to unity at z = 9. Overall, our measurements of ρUV suggest that at z ∼ 2 LAEs constitute a much
smaller subset of LBGs and that with increasing redshift,
both populations slowly approach the same values of ρUV .

This is qualitatively similar to the trends found by Sobral
et al. (2018a) by integrating Lyα LFs.

Redshift evolution of the stellar mass density of
z ∼ 2 − 6 LAEs

Using our best-derived fits (Table 3), we estimate the stellar mass density (ρM ) of our LAEs at different redshifts,
by integrating the SMFs in the range. We obtain ρM using
the procedure described in §3.6. We provide our ρM measurements in Table 4. In Fig. 13, we show our ρM measurements and compare them with measurements from the
literature. The observed ρM (without applying any luminosity cuts) changes from log10 (ρM /M Mpc−3 ) ∼ 6.1 at
z ∼ 2.5 to ∼ 5.5 at z ∼ 5 − 6. By applying the consistent log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 cut, the estimated ρM of
our LAE sample remains roughly constant with redshift at
log10 (ρM /M Mpc−3 ) ∼ 5.5.
We compare our results with measurements from the
literature, from continuum-selected populations: Davidzon
et al. (2017), Caputi et al. (2011), Caputi et al. (2015),
Duncan et al. 2014, González et al. (2011), Grazian et al.
(2015), Ilbert et al. (2013), Mortlock et al. (2011), Mortlock et al. (2015), Muzzin et al. (2013), Reddy et al.
(2012), Santini et al. (2012), Song et al. (2016), and Tomczak et al. (2014). The ρM measurements of typical populations of galaxies from the literature indicate a decrease
from log10 (ρM /M Mpc−3 ) ∼ 7.5 at z ∼ 2.5 to ∼ 6.5 at
z ∼ 5 − 6. This implies that galaxies selected as LAEs always have low stellar mass densities, and as we move to
higher redshifts, their properties become similar to the ones
derived from more typical populations of galaxies, suggesting that with an increasing redshift more galaxies become
LAE-like. The ratio between the stellar mass densities for
the log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 population and the values
from the literature decreases from ∼ 0.005 at z ∼ 2.5 to
∼ 0.05 at z ∼ 5 − 6. We extrapolate the ratio between the
stellar mass densities of log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 LAEs
and LBGs and determine it tends to unity at z = 10. This
implies that these bright LAEs, contribute very significantly
to the total stellar mass density during the epoch of reionisation, highlighting the importance of LAEs to the evolution
of primeval galaxies in the early Universe.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we determine the UV luminosity functions
(LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of ∼ 4000 LAEs
from the SC4K sample at z ∼ 2 − 6. Our main results are:
• MUV and LLyα are typically correlated (MUV =

−1.6+0.2
) + 47+12
−0.3 log10 (LLyα /erg s

• Different LLyα limits significantly affect the shape and
normalisation of the UV LF and SMF of LAEs. An increasing LLyα cut predominantly reduces the number density of
lower stellar masses and faint UV luminosities, more significantly for the UV LF. We estimate a proxy for the full UV
LF and SMF of LAEs, making simple assumptions of fitting
range and faint end slope.

• For the UV LF of LAEs, we find a characteristic number density (Φ∗ ) decrease from log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) ∼ −3.5 at
z ∼ 2 − 4 to ∼ −4.5 at z ∼ 5 − 6, and a brightening of
characteristic UV luminosity (M∗UV ) from -20.6 to -21.8 at
the same redshift ranges.
• For the SMF of LAEs, we measure a decline of Φ∗
with increasing redshift, from log10 (Φ∗ /Mpc−3 ) = −4.6 at
z = 2.5 to -5.8 at z = 5.4, and a characteristic stellar mass
(M∗? /M ) increase from log10 (M∗? /M ) = 10.6 to 11.5 at the
same redshift ranges.
• We
apply
a
uniform
luminosity
cut
of
log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) ≥ 43.0 to our entire sample, producing a subsample of rare bright primeval galaxies. We
find a more moderate to no evolution of the UV LF and
SMF of this subsample, indicating that the trends computed
for the full samples may be driven by differences in the
luminosity cuts. This highlights the importance of obtaining
deep high-z studies with e.g. MUSE.
• We compute ΦLAE /ΦLBG (proxy of χLyα ) which tends
to unity with increasing MUV at all redshifts, as bright LAEs
are typically also bright in MUV . For fainter LAEs, the ratio
tends to one as we reach fainter Lyα fluxes, with a simple extrapolation implying that by reaching log10 (LLyα /erg s−1 ) =
41.0 we would approach unit for MUV = −20 galaxies at
z = 2.5.
• The luminosity density (ρUV ) shows moderate evolution
from 1025.2 erg s−1 Hz−1 Mpc−3 at z = 2.5 to 1025.0 erg s−1
Hz−1 Mpc−3 at z ∼ 5 − 6, and the stellar mass density (ρM )
decreases from ∼ 106.1 to ∼ 105.5 M Mpc3 at the same
redshifts. Both ρUV and ρM are found to always be lower
than the total luminosity and stellar densities of continuumselected galaxies but slowly approaching it with increasing
redshift. Overall, we find our measurements reveal a ρUV
and ρM of LAEs that slowly approach the measurements of
continuum-selected galaxies at z > 6, pointing to the very
significant role of LAEs in the epoch of reionisation.
