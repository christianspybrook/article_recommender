Abstract
Homeostasis represents the idea that a feature may remain invariant despite changes in some
external parameters. We establish a connection between homeostasis and injectivity for reaction
network models. In particular, we show that a reaction network cannot exhibit homeostasis if a
modified version of the network (which we call homeostasis-associated network ) is injective. We
provide examples of reaction networks which can or cannot exhibit homeostasis by analyzing
the injectivity of their homeostasis-associated networks.

Introduction

Coined by Cannon [3] in 1926, the idea of homeostasis has its roots in the work of Claude Bernard [2],
and refers to a regulatory mechanism by which a feature maintains a steady state that is not perturbed by changes in the environment. Often, homeostasis involves the use of negative feedback
loops that help restore a feature to its steady state. At the scale of a whole organism, homeostasis manifests itself in many forms; some prominent examples include the maintenance of body
temperature, blood sugar level, concentration of ions in body fluids with changes in the external environment. Homeostasis is also exhibited in intracellular metabolism, where certain concentration
remain almost unperturbed with change in concentrations of amino acids [22].
As noted in [22], homeostasis does not imply that the whole system remains invariant with
change in external variables. In fact, changes in external variables can cause changes in certain
internal variables, while other internal variables remain almost unchanged. In recent years there
has been a lot of interest in identifying and analyzing homeostasis in mathematical models of
biological interaction systems [13, 18, 22, 20, 11, 25]. Some of this renewed interest started with the
mathematical analysis of homeostasis in the context of the folate and methionine metabolism [19,
22].
While there is no universally accepted mathematical definition of homeostasis, here we focus
mostly on the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis for input-output systems, as introduced by Golubitsky and Stewart in [13] and further refined in [28, 12]. Our main interest is to analyze homeostasis
from the point of view of reaction network theory [7, 8, 29].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define reaction networks and related
notions, including the notion of injective reaction network. In Section 3, we introduce homeostasis
as the capacity of a feature to be robust to change in the parameters of the system. We present
a procedure for checking whether a reaction network may admit homeostasis by constructing a
1

modified network and checking if it is injective (see Theorem 3.4). We also describe a sufficient
condition for perfect homeostasis (see Theorem 3.5). In Section 4 we present several examples
of reaction networks for which their capacity to exhibit homeostasis can be analyzed using the
procedure described in Section 3.

Euclidean embedded graphs and reaction networks

An Euclidean embedded graph is a directed graph G = (V, E), where V ⊂ Rn and E are the sets of
vertices and edges respectively. Associated with every edge (y, y ′ ) ∈ E is a source vertex y ∈ V
and a target vertex y ′ ∈ V . An edge (y, y ′ ) ∈ E will also be denoted by y → y ′ ∈ E.
A reaction network is a Euclidean embedded graph G = (V, E), where V ⊂ Rn≥0 and E is the
set of edges that correspond to reactions in the network [4, 5]. An alternative way of describing a
reaction network is by specifying a set of species and a set of reactions. For example, consider the
set of species {X1 , X2 } and the set of reactions {2X1 → 3X2 , X1 + X2 → 3X1 }. The corresponding
Euclidean embedded graph lies in R2≥0 and has two edges: one edge from (2, 0) to (0, 3) and one
edge from (1, 1) to (3, 0), where the vertex vectors are formed by the coefficients of the species X1
and X2 on the reactant side and product side, respectively.
The stoichiometric subspace of a reaction network is the linear subspace given by span{y ′ −
y | y → y ′ ∈ E}. Given a point x0 ∈ Rn>0 , the positive stoichiometric compatibility class of x0 is
the affine subspace (x0 + S) ∩ Rn>0 .
There exist many choices for modelling the kinetics of reaction networks. The most common
one is based on the law of mass-action [27, 14, 29, 15, 7] where, associated with each reaction
y → y ′ there is a rate constant ky→y′ > 0, and the dynamics of the network is given by

where x ∈ Rn>0 and xy = xy11 xy22 * * * xynn . Let k = (ky→y′ )y→y′ ∈E denote the vector of rate constants and f (x, k) denote the right-hand side of Equation (1). The Jacobian corresponding to the
dynamical system (1) is given by the matrix

An equilibrium x0 ∈ Rn>0 is said to be a linearly stable equilibrium of (1) if the eigenvalues of the
Jacobian of (1) evaluated at the point x0 have negative real parts. It is known from [24, Theorem
5.2] and [8, 15.2.2] that complex balanced equilibria are linearly stable.
Recall the f (x, k) denotes the right hand side of Equation (1). Now consider the function
x → f (x, k). A reaction network G is said to be injective if the function x → f (x, k) corresponding
to the dynamics given by (1) is injective for all k. A point x0 ∈ Rn>0 is said to be an equilibrium
of (1) if f (x0 , k) = 0. It follows that an injective reaction network cannot have multiple equilibria.
In general, it is extremely difficult to determine whether the function x → f (x, k) is injective or
not. A necessary and sufficient condition for a reaction network to be injective is given by Theorem
3.1 in [6], which we state here:
Theorem 2.1. Consider a reaction network G with species given by X1 , X2 , ..., Xn . Let J(x, k)
denote the Jacobian corresponding to the dynamics generated by G. Then G is injective if and only
if det(J(x, k)) is non-zero for every x ∈ Rn>0 and for all choice of rate constants k. Further, by
Theorem 3.2 in [6], there is a one-to-one correspondence between the coefficients in the expansion
of det(J(x, k)) and products of the form det(y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n )det(y 1 − y ′1 , y 2 − y ′2 , ..., y n − y ′n ) for all
choices of n reactions in G.
Corollary 2.2. Consider a reaction network G with species X1 , X2 , ..., Xn . Then G is injective if
and only if products of the form det(y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n )det(y 1 − y ′1 , y 2 − y ′2 , ..., y n − y ′n ) for any choice
of n reactions are all of the same sign, and at least one such product is non-zero.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 2.1.
A good tool for analyzing injectivity is the directed species reaction graph (abbreviated as DSR
graph) first introduced by Banaji and Craciun in [1]. In what follows, we describe some terminology
in the context of DSR graphs. We will denote a negative edge in the DSR graph with a dashed
line, and a positive edge with a bold line. Let |C| denote the length of a cycle in the DSR graph. A
cycle is an e-cycle if the number of positive edges has the same parity as the |C|
2 . Otherwise, it is an

the edge e. We will say that two cycles have an odd intersection if their orientation is compatible
and every component of their intersection contains an odd number of edges. Figure 1 shows the
DSR graph for a modified enzyme-substrate network.
Theorem 2.3. A DSR criterion [1]: Consider a reaction network G. Suppose the following
conditions are satisfied:
1. Every e-cycle is a s-cycle in the DSR graph of G.
2. No two e-cycles contain an odd intersection in the DSR graph of G.
3. there exists a choice of n reactions {y 1 → y ′1 , y 2 → y ′2 , y 3 → y ′3 , ..., y n → y ′n } in G such that
det(y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , ..., y n )det(y ′1 − y 1 , y ′2 − y 2 , y ′3 − y 3 , ..., y ′n − y n ) 6= 0.
Then G is injective.
Consider the DSR graph in Figure 1. This has two cycles given by (ES → E+P )−(E)−(E+S ⇋
ES)−ES−(ES → E+P ) and (E+S ⇋ ES)−ES−(ES → E+P )−(P )−(P → S)−(S)−(E+S ⇋
ES). Both these cycles are e-cycles and s-cycles since the number of positive edges has the same

parity as half the length of the respective cycle. The intersection of these two e-cycles is the path
(E + S ⇋ ES) − ES − (ES → E + P ) and this is not an odd intersection since it contains two
edges (which is an even number). Further, if we choose four reactions from the network given by
the following: {E + S → ES, ES → E + P,
→ ∅}, 
then we have det(y

Therefore, by Theorem 2.3 this reaction network is injective.

Homeostasis

The ability of a feature to remain invariant when certain parameters of the system are changed
is the essential idea behind homeostasis. A common example of homeostasis is exhibited when an
organism maintains its body temperature despite fluctuations in the temperature of the environment. The temperature of the body varies linearly with temperature for low and high values of
the environment temperature; however for moderate values of the environment temperature, the
body temperature remains approximately constant. This variation of body temperature with the
environment resembles the shape of a "chair" [19, 18]. In [13], this "chair" form provides inspiration for a definition of homeostasis in the context of singularity theory. In particular, the idea of
homeostasis corresponds to the derivative of an output (homeostasis) variable with respect to an
external input being zero at a certain point. As outlined in [13], we consider the following setup:
Let x = (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) and consider
dx
= F(x, ζ)
dt

4

(3)

given by
dx1
= f1 (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) + ζ
dt
dx2
= f2 (x1 , x2 , ..., xn )
dt
.. ..
.=.

(4)

dxn
= fn (x1 , x2 , ..., xn )
dt
As in [13], throughout this paper we assume that the variable x1 is the input variable, and the
output variable (which may or may not exhibit homeostatis) is xn . We will also assume that there
exists a linearly stable equilibrium of (4) given by (x0 , ζ0 ). By the implicit function theorem, there
exists solutions x̃(ζ) in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium (x0 , ζ0 ) satisfying F(x̃(ζ), ζ) = 0. In
particular, this implies that x̃ depends continuously on ζ in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium
(x0 , ζ0 ). Recall the definition of homeostasis from [13]:
Definition 3.1. Consider a dynamical system of the form (4) and let J(x) denote its Jacobian.
Assume that (x̃1 , x̃2 , ..., x̃n ) be a linearly stable equilibrium of (4) at ζ = ζ̃. We say that we have
infinitesimal homeostasis at (x̃1 , x̃2 , ..., x̃n , ζ̃) if det(B)

= 0 where B is the (n−1)×(n−1)
(x̃1 ,x̃2 ,...,x̃n )

minor of J obtained by deleting its first row and last column.

Remark 3.2. As remarked in [28], there exists several forms of homeostasis. Specifically, definition 3.1 refers to infinitesimal homeostasis, which requires the derivative of the input-output
function to be zero at a point. The idea of perfect homeostasis refers to the situation when the
derivative of the input-output function vanishes on an entire interval. The notion of near perfect
homeostasis refers to the situation when the input-output function is approximately constant in a
neighbourhood of a point.
Definition 3.3. Consider a reaction network G. The homeostasis-associated reaction network of
G, denoted by G̃, is obtained from G as follows
Step 1: For each reaction in G involving the species X1 , modify the reaction such that
stoichiometric coefficient of X1 in the reactant is the same as the stoichiometric coefficient of
X1 in the product.
Step 2: Add the reaction Xn → X1 .
Theorem 3.4. Consider a reaction network G with species X1 , X2 , ..., Xn . Let G̃ be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of G. If the graph G̃ satisfies the conditions 1, 2 and 3 in Theorem 2.3,
then the mass-action dynamical system generated by G cannot exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis
(with input X1 and output Xn ) for any choices of rate constants.
Proof. Let J and J ̃ denote the Jacobians coresponding to the dynamical systems generated by G
and G̃ respectively. Step 1 of the procedure in Definition 3.3 makes the first row of J ̃ zero. Step
2 of Definition 3.3 generates a non-zero element in the top right corner of the J ̃. Therefore, the
Jacobian J ̃ has the first row consisting entirely of zeros except the last element. In addition, J ̃
has the same (n − 1) × (n − 1) minor B as obtained by deleting the first row and last column of
5

 ̃ we get that det(J ̃) = kn,1 det(B), where kn,1 is the rate
J. Expanding along the first row of J,
constant corresponding to the reaction Xn → X1 . By Theorem 2.3, G̃ is injective. Therefore by
Theorem 2.1, we have det(J ̃(x)) 6= 0 for every x ∈ Rn>0 . This implies that det(B(x)) 6= 0 for every
x ∈ Rn>0 and hence G cannot exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis for any choices of rate constants.
On the other hand, if the graph G̃ fails to satisfy condition 3 in Theorem 2.3, then we have
det(J ̃(x)) = 0 for every x ∈ Rn>0 , which implies that det(B(x)) = 0 for every x ∈ Rn>0 . Therefore,
we obtain:
Theorem 3.5. Consider a reaction network G with species X1 , X2 , ..., Xn . Let G̃ be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of G. If the graph G̃ does not satisfy condition 3 in Theorem 2.3, then
any mass-action dynamical system generated by G must exhibit perfect homeostasis (with input X1
and output Xn ) at any linearly stable equilibrium.
In particular, note that if a network satisfies condition 3 in Theorem 2.3, then the dimension of
its stoichiometric subspace is n, which implies the following:
Corollary 3.6. Consider a reaction network G with species X1 , X2 , ..., Xn . Let G̃ be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of G. If the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace of G̃ is less than
n, then any mass-action dynamical system generated by G must exhibit perfect homeostasis (with
input X1 and output Xn ) at any linearly stable equilibrium.

Remark 3.7. Recall that the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis (as described by Definition 3.1)
assumes the existence of a linearly stable equilibrium (x̃1 , x̃2 , ..., x̃n ). For a mass-action system
generated by a reaction network G this implicitly says that the dimension of the stoichiometric
subspace of G must be n. In other words, the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis (as described by
Definition 3.1) cannot ever apply to a mass-action system that has one or more linear conservation
laws (i.e., for which the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace of G is less than n).

Examples

The goal of this section is to demonstrate examples of reaction networks that can or cannot exhibit
infinitesimal homeostasis using the procedure outlined in Definition 3.3.

4.1

A reaction network that does not exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis for any
choice of network parameters

The biological motivation for the following example comes from "sequestration networks" as defined
in [16, 10]. In particular, they find instances of such networks in the transcription mechanism of
E.coli. The trp operon contains genes that encode for the amino acid tryptophan. The operon is
turned "off" or "on" depending upon the levels of tryptophan. When the tryptophan levels are low,
it is turned "off" and when the levels of tryptophan are high, it is turned "on". In the presence
of tryptophan, the trp repressor can bind to the operon sites and prevent the expression of the
operon. This can be seen as a sequestration reaction X1 + X2 → ∅, where X1 is the tryptophan
and X2 is the trp operon. Taking our cue from this, we consider the following sequestration network.

The homeostasis-associated reaction network corresponding to G1 will be denoted by G̃1 and is

X2 + X3 → ∅
X3 + X4 → ∅

X4 → X1

(6)

∅ ⇋ X2
∅ ⇋ X3
∅ ⇋ X4

Note that when we apply Step 1 of the procedure listed in Definition 3.1 to the reaction X4 → X1 ,
we get the reaction X4 → ∅. Step 2 of the procedure then adds the reaction X4 → X1 . As a
consequence, we get the homeostasis-associated network G̃1 , where the reaction X4 → X1 has a
larger rate constant as compared to the rate constant of the same reaction in G1 . The DSR graph
corresponding to the network G̃1 is given in Figure 2 This DSR graph possesses exactly one oriented
cycle given by (X3 ) − (X3 + X4 → ∅) − (X4 ) − (X4 → X1 ) − (X1 ) − (X1 + X2 → X1 ) − (X2 ) −
(X2 + X3 → ∅) − (X3 ) which is an o-cycle. As a consequence, conditions 1 and 2 in Theorem 2.3
are satisfied. In addition, if we choose four reactions from G̃1 given by {X1 + X2 → X1 , X2 + X3 →

Let us analyze the DSR graph corresponding to the network G ̃2 as shown in Figure 3. Since
condition is not satisfied for the DSR graph of G ̃2 , there is a possibility that the network G2 can
exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis. In particular, G2 generates a dynamical system given by the

This set of differential equations has the steady state given by (x∗1 = ζ, x∗2 = ζ 2 , x∗3 = 1 − ζ + ζ 2 ).

homeostasis at (x∗1 = 12 , x∗2 = 41 , x∗3 = 34 , ζ = 21 ).

Every term of the form det(y1 , y2 , y3 )det(y1′ − y1 , y2′ − y2 , y3′ − y3 ) from this network is zero and
hence the deteminant of the Jacobian is zero. This implies that the determinant of B (which is
the (n − 1) × (n − 1) minor of the Jacobian obtained by deleting its first row and last column) is
zero. By Theorem 3.5, we get that the network G3 has perfect homeostasis at this linearly stable
equilibrium.

Discussion

In this paper we have analyzed the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis (as introduced in [13]),
from the point of view of reaction network models. In particular, we have described a relationship
between infinitesimal homeostasis and network injectivity, as well as a relationship between perfect
homeostasis and the structure of the set of reaction vectors. Moreover, since injectivity of a network
can be studied by looking at its directed species reaction graph (DSR graph) [1], we have discussed
how the DSR graph can be used to analyze homeostasis.
An interesting direction for future work would be the analysis of possible relationships between
homeostasis (and especially perfect homeostasis) and absolute concentration robustness (ACR).
10

The notion of ACR was first introduced in [23], and refers to systems where the value of one of
the variables (e.g., species concentration) is the same for all positive steady states of the system.
At first, these two notions seem almost identical, but the ACR framework does not allow for any
changes in parameter values. A deeper exploration of the mathematical relationships between
homeostasis and absolute concentration robustness may uncover other network-level conditions for
homeostasis.
Another promising direction for future work is the use of various forms of steady state parametrizations [21, 9] to analyze infinitesimal homeostasis. Given a certain steady state parametrization, the
fact that the derivative of the output variable with respect to an input variable is zero at an equilibrium manifests itself as a property of a system of algebraic equations, whose analysis could provide
useful insights into the behaviour of the system. Possible candidates for this work include toric [17]
and rational [26] steady state parametrizations.
