INTRODUCTION

From a classical perspective, all dynamical variables commute but in quantum mechanics the uncertainty relations are fundamental. The seminal work of EPR [1] reports
that if two systems are correlated and the physical quantities pertaining to one system
are determined then uncertainty in their prediction for the second system is zero. The
compatibility between any two observables Â and B̂ is usually understood in terms of the
Robertson relation [2]

where the dispersion in the measurement reduces for small lower bounds. On the other
hand, observables over a bipartite quantum state were analysed for uncertainty in their
measurement by evaluating the upper bound in terms of entropies[3], and it was observed
that uncertainty in the predictions is reduced if both parties are maximally entangled and
they strongly agree on the measurement. Thus a measure of uncertainty in the prediction can be obtained by a measure of the entanglement between the systems. Quantum
entanglement and uncertainty relations are therefore strongly related and have wide applications in quantum information and computing [4, 5] and so on. An effort to study
the effect of quantum correlation on the uncertainty was made in ref.[6] which presented
a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) for bipartite and tripartite entangled states.
It was observed that the lower bound in GUP deviates from the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle (HUP) and leads to a reduced uncertainty for quantum correlated particles. It
is interesting to explore these issues in the framework of constrained quantum theory.
The Hamiltonian formulation of systems in the presence of first and second class constraints has been reported in literature extensively since the inception of the idea [7].
Ref.[8] presents a similar study for the dynamics of a single particle constrained on a circle. The Hamiltonian formulation is obtained from Lagrangian mechanics as pi = ∂L/∂ ẋi .
Expressing the velocities this way makes the Hamiltonian to be independent of ẋi and the
Hessian of Lagrangian is given by
∂2L
∂ ẋi ∂ ẋj

6= 0

(2)

The equality holds for the case of degenerate Lagrangian where the constrained dynamics
of the system can not be obtained in usual way by evaluating the Poisson brackets but
by Hamilton's equations that contain Dirac brackets [7][8].
2

Refs. [9]-[11] deal with the problem of assigning geometric meanings to the Hamiltonian
dynamics or designing of a proper quantum framework for the dynamics of particle on
curved spaces. Dirac's approach for handling these problems is presented in [11], where the
dynamics in the presence of second class constraints is described by defining a symplectic
structure. A similar study in this direction was made in [12] for the Dirac quantization of
particle constrained on a helicoid and in [13] for quantizing the dynamics of a free particle
on a D-dimensional sphere. A different approach to dualize quantum with geometry in
the pilot-wave limit is presented in [14–16], and with topological properties in [17]. Dirac
quantization on curved spaces adds some additional terms in the Schrödinger equation
that can be linked with the curvature of the space or distortion in the energy spectrum. It
will be interesting to discuss such energy terms for two maximally entangled subsystems,
in connection with the particles constrained on curved spaces [18].
The purpose of this paper is to study a bipartite quantum system in which the degrees
of freedom of the system are reduced by constraining them on S 1 . For this, we consider
an inseparable spatial wavefunction like the one considered in ref.[16].

Taking such a two particle composite state we will analyse the compatibility between
position and momentum operators. We will establish Hermitian expression for momentum
operators and finally we will comment on the energy terms arising in Schrödinger equation
in connection with the quantization on curved manifolds [18]
The paper is organized as: Section-II deals with studying the classical dynamics of
two particles constrained on S 1 . In section-III, we present Dirac quantization of the
classical dynamics assuming the two particles as two maximally entangled subsystems and
comment on the uncertainty between observables. In section-IV, we establish Hermitian
expression for momentum operators and find the energy equation for two constrained
entangled particles. Section-V summarizes the results.

CONSTRAINED CLASSICAL DYNAMICS OF TWO PARTICLES ON S 1

We consider a two particle Lagrangian in scalar and vector potential given by

index and ṙk2 = ṙ12 + ṙ22 = ẋ21 + ẏ12 + ẋ22 + ẏ22 . We assume these particles to be under the effect

them and as a result, these particles retain their motion on S 1 i.e., g(x, y) = x2k + yk2 − rk2 .
Applying the constraint g(x, y) = 0 on the system, the resulting Lagrangian is

The Hamiltonian in Eq.(7) is not independent of velocities and therefore it is not
possible to implement the standard approach to obtain equations of motion. Therefore,
we need to use Dirac's method for singular Lagrangians [7]. According to this one must
generalize the Hamiltonian to incorporate the constraints. This generalized Hamiltonian
is obtained by multiplying the primary constraint with an arbitrary function of time, say
u1 , and adding the resulting term in Hamiltonian Eq.(7)

where λ̇ is absorbed in u1 . One can see that Pλ =

∂L
∂ λ̇

(8)

= 0, which is a primary constraint

as it is derived directly from the Lagrangian. We will denote it by σ1 (= Pλ ).
If a constraint is initially zero, it must be zero for all times. This consistency condition
σ̇ = [σ, H] ≈ 0 yields a set of equations[7]. If the resulting equation contains only x or P ,
it is treated as another constraint. The consistency condition on σ1 yields an equation of
the following form

σ2 = x2k + yk2 − 2a2 = 0
4

(9)

This equation will serve as the secondary constraint, where rk2 = r12 + r22 = 2a2 . The
particles are moving on the same circle so r1 = r2 = a, and since σ2 = 0, it must be zero
during its evolution in time, which leads to

~r = 0
σ3 = rk * Prk − erk * A
k

(10)

This equation is of the form ω(r, p) = 0 and it will lead to another such consistency
condition. So we continue to evaluate these equations until another type of equation (like
the one for function u1 ) is obtained.

~ r )2 − erk ∇r V − 2λr 2 = 0

In obtaining the expression for σ4 , we have used the Coulomb gauge ∇

All the constraints obtained are of second class and can be set equal to zero to switch
from Poisson brackets to Dirac brackets. The total Hamiltonian (8) with the constraint
σ1 = σ2 = 0 is thus

For any two functions of canonical variables, say X and Y , the Dirac brackets for this

and has at least one non vanishing bracket for any two constraints σm and σn [8]. The

Using Dirac's approach, we arrive at following brackets describing the classical dynam-

ics of two constrained particles.

where k = 1, 2. The results of these classical brackets are different from those of
standard canonical brackets in that the information on the constrained dynamics of the
particles is apparent. One can see instead of the usual translation along x-axis by P in
Eq.(15), the motion of particle 1 is shifted by an amount

x21
rk2

towards y-axis. Then Eq.(16)

shifts the motion slightly towards x-axis. This series of shifts renders a circular trajectory.
The same is true for particle 2. The Dirac brackets for the coordinates of one particle and
momenta of the other particle are given by

[xj , Pxk ]D =

−xj xk

[yj , Pyk ]D =

[yj , Pxk ]D =

(19)

where j = k = 1, 2 and j 6= k. Also note that all the brackets in Eqs.(17)-(19)
vanish in classical mechanics since momentum is not a generator of translations along a
direction perpendicular to the particle position. But in Dirac's formalism, the brackets
[x, Py ] = [y, Px ] 6= 0, which is due to the constraint which forces the particle to remain on
S 1 . The Dirac brackets detailing translations in P space are the following,
6

[xj , xk ]D = [yj , yk ]D = [xk , yk ]D = [xj , yk ]D = 0

(20)

Since x and y generate translations in momentum space, the brackets in Eq.(20) are
equivalent to the corresponding Poisson brackets. This is because there is no such σm
whose time evolution results in an equation containing only P , there is thus no constraint
imposed on the particle's momentum. This is why these results are just analogous to
those obtained for a classical Hamiltonian with no constraint on the particle dynamics.
The Dirac brackets for momenta of both the particles are

where j = k = 1, 2 and j 6= k. Eqs. (21)-(24) clearly reflect the rotational dynamics
of particle due to explicit presence of Lz or by writing momentum in terms of angular
momentum as discussed in the next section. One can see when dealing with degenerate
Lagrangian, the Poisson brackets are generalized to Dirac brackets [7].

DIRAC QUANTIZATION FOR TWO ENTANGLED SUBSYSTEMS

To quantize the classical dynamics discussed above, the system with k = 2 (two particles) is partitioned into two subsystems 1 and 2 containing i and j particles respectively,
such that k = i+j with i=j=1, i.e., each particle is treated as a subsystem. The basis for
subsystem 1 are chosen to be {ψ1 , ψ2 } corresponding to the Hilbert space H1 and {φ1 , φ2 }
for the subsystem 2 corresponding to the Hilbert space H2 . The composite space for the
bipartite quantum state is a tensor product

H = H1 ⊗ H2
7

(25)

A pure state with respect to this partitioning can be defined as

ψ(x1 , x2 ) = εψ1 (x1 )φ1 (x2 ) + γψ1 (x1 )φ2 (x2 ) + ηψ2 (x2 )φ1 (x1 ) + δψ2 (x1 )φ2 (x2 )

(26)

One can consider the concurrence as a measure of the entanglement of a pure bipartite
quantum state[21], which should be equal to unity for a maximally entangled state and
is defined as C = 2 | εδ − γη |.
We choose γ = η = 0 and the pure bipartite state is maximally entangled with equal
probability of collapse upon measurement, to one of the product state ψ1 (x1 )φ1 (x2 ) or
ψ2 (x1 )φ2 (x2 ), i.e., |ε|2 + |δ|2 = 1 [19][20]. The quantum state of two entangled particles
on a circle of radius a is chosen to be

Ψ(χ1 , χ2 ) = eiχ1 χ2 (φei(χ1 +χ2 ) )
where φ =

√

(27)

2a2 and χk gives the angular position of the particles. The classical

to quantum transition of the system of two entangled particles is achieved by using the
Dirac quantization rule: { , } →

tions for the position and momentum operators are obtained as a result of this canonical

where j = k = 1, 2 and j 6= k. The quantum commutation relations in Eqs.(28)-(33)
are obtained for the quantum state in Eq.(27). From ref.[6], we note that for a system
of entangled particles, the uncertainty relation between the operators x̂ and P̂ diverges
from the standard HUP in a way that the precision of simultaneous measurement of x̂ and
P̂ is increased. Further note that Eqs.(28)-(32) illustrate a reduced uncertainty between
position and momentum, in comparison to the results of [8], as expected for maximally
entangled subsystems described in [3][6].
As an example, one can see that the lower bound evaluated for Eq.(28) using Robertson
relation for the parameters values a2 = 10, with a2 = x21 +y12 and the choice x1 = 1, y1 = 3,
gives

(∆x̂1 )2 (∆P̂x1 )2 ≥ 0.05

(34)

The product of dispersion reduces in comparison to [8] where (∆x̂)2 (∆P̂x )2 ≥ 0.2025
(calculated for the same a). Similarly, one can see the lower bounds in the set Eqs.(28)(32) reduces in comparison to [8].
This uncertainty is inversely related to k (the number of particles) such that in a system
with several particles (k → ∞), the standard deviation in the measurement of observables
is significantly reduced. In this case, the uncertainty in the prediction of observables in
the set Eqs.(28)-(32) can approach zero and in this limit these commutators tend to the
Poisson brackets of classical mechanics.
The commutation relation between momentum of each particles is obtained via Dirac
quantizing the classical bracket in Eq.(21), which yields

~
[P̂xk , P̂yk ] = 2 −L̂z + e(r̂k × Ark ).ê3

(35)

To comment on Eq.(35), we check the Robertson uncertainty relation for momentum of
two entangled particles as follows,

(36)

We arrive at the numerical result on the r.h.s of Eq.(36) with the parameter values:
a2 = 10 so that 2a2 = x21 + x22 + y12 + y22 = 20 with x1 = 2, x2 = 3.1, y1 = 2.45, y2 = 0.65,
charge of the particle e = 1 and the vector potential A = 0.50. Similarly, for particle 2,
we get
9

(∆P̂x2 )2 (∆P̂y2 )2 ≥ 6.5 × 10−3

(37)

The numerical bounds in Eqs.(36)-(37) are computed in view of the single particle case
((∆P̂x )2 (∆P̂y )2 ≥ 0.0225) evaluated for the same a. Clearly, one can see that the lower
bound between the momenta of each particle is reduced if: (1). The position of the second
particle is known, and: (2). The external field is properly tuned in order to keep the state
maximally entangled between particle 1 and particle 2. We arrive at these results using

~ cutoff = 11.26 Tesla. This is because the interaction between the particles and the

in the loss of entanglement and the usual uncertainty relation for momentum is restored

where x2 = 3.1, y2 = 0.65, and n = ±0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... The vector potential that gives
~ upper can be obtained as
B
Aupper = A0 + p(1.22)

(39)

with A0 = 1.63, p = k − 2 where k is the number of particles, one can see that
inserting any value of k in Eq.(39) yields the value of Aupper . Also, from Eqs.(38)-(39),
Aupper can be obtained for any k and any x2 + n, y2 + n with n = ±0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ... and
x2 = 3.1 and y2 = 0.65. We have used the coordinates of subsystem 2, this is because at
~ upper , entanglement reduces due to the interaction between particles and the field and
B
no reduction in the dispersion of observables is possible for subsystem 2 (however, for
subsystem 1 the lower bound of Robertson relation still reduces). Similarly, for equations

where x1 = 2 and y1 = 2.45. The vector potential that leads to B

where Ã0 = 17.8 and we have used the coordinates of subsystem 1 because at the cut-off
value, the entanglement dies and no reduction in the dispersion is possible for subsystem
1. Eq.(41) gives the cut-off value of the external magnetic field such that for A > Acutoff ,
the two subsystems are unentangled and the lower bound of Robertson relation increases
~ above the cut-off. We arrive at Eq.(39) and Eq.(41) by inspection i.e.,
with increasing B
by varying the value of vector potential A and computing the lower bounds in Eqs.(36)(37). Proceeding this way we can obtain the value of Acutof f and Aupper at which no
reduction in the lower bound is obtained for Eq.(36) and Eq.(37) (in view of the single
particle case) respectively. However, the choice of subsystem 1 and 2 is arbitrary and one
only needs to consider the initial values, x1 , y1, x2 , y2 , to obtain upper bound and cut-off

(∆P̂y1 )2 (∆P̂y2 )2 ≥ 2.91 × 10−3

(48)

To comment on the lower bounds in Eqs.(45)-(48), one needs to consider the same set
of equations for the case of three entangled particles constrained on S 1 . We assume
these three particles live in three subsystems with basis {ψ1 , ψ2 }, {φ1 , φ2 } and {ξ1 , ξ2}
corresponding to the Hilbert space H1 , H2 and H3 respectively, such that the composite
state is a member of H, where

H = H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H3

(49)

We consider a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type state for which the 3-tangle is
maximal [21][22] as

where ζ =

ψ(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = √ (ψ1 (x1 )φ1 (x2 )ξ1 (x3 ) + ψ2 (x1 )φ2 (x2 )ξ2 (x3 ))

(50)

ψ(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = ζei(χ1 χ2 χ3 ) ei(χ1 +χ2 +χ3 )

(51)

2a3 . The lower bounds corresponding to the Eqs.(42)-(44) are evaluated for

a tripartite entangled state as
(∆P̂x1 )2 (∆P̂y2 )2 ≥


|Π + ea2 A(x̂1 − ŷ1 )|2

(52)

where k = 3 and Π = (−2 + α)(ŷ1 ŷ2 + x̂1 x̂2 ) + ŷ1 ŷ2 e−χ2 χ3 + x̂1 x̂2 e−χ1 χ3 . Similarly,
(∆P̂x2 )2 (∆P̂y1 )2 ≥ 9.86 × 10−4

(53)

(∆P̂x1 )2 (∆P̂x2 )2 ≥ 1.4 × 10−4

(54)

(∆P̂y1 )2 (∆P̂y2 )2 ≥ 1.29 × 10−3

(55)

These result are evaluated using a2 = 10 so that 3a2 = x21 + x22 + x23 + y12 + y22 + y32 = 30
with x1 = 2, x2 = 3.1,x3 = 2.6 y1 = 2.45, y2 = 0.65, y3 = 1.8, charge e = 1 and A = 0.50.
The upper bound and cutoff value of the external field for k = 3 can be obtained from
Eq.(35). The lower bound of subsystem 1 is computed via the following equation
(∆P̂x1 )2 (∆P̂y1 )2 ≥

|2 + e−χ2 χ3 + eA(x1 − y1 )|2
(2k)2 a4

(56)

and for subsystem 2 by the following equation
(∆P̂x2 )2 (∆P̂y2 )2 ≥

|2 + e−χ1 χ3 + eA(x2 − y2 )|2
(2k)2 a4
12

(57)

We observe that the lower bound for Eq.(56) and Eq.(57) is the same as obtained for the
single particle case at Acutof f = 24.5 and Aupper = 2.85 respectively. Continuing this way
one can see that the computed values of Aupper and Acutof f for a bipartite system with
k ≥ 2 can be inserted into a relation of the form given in Eq.(39) and Eq.(41). It is easy
to see that the lower bound is reduced by increasing the number of maximally entangled
particles if the external field is appropriately tuned, as discussed above. Also, it is observed
~ is increased i.e., B
~ upper = 1.80 Tesla, and thus the
that for k = 3, the upper bound on B
system is more robust against changes in the external field. The generalization to k > 3
for Eq.(35) and Eqs.(42)-(44) is nontrivial in contrast to the Eqs.(28)-(32), because for k
particles one needs to split the global system into two blocks and the subsystems within
these blocks may also be entangled with each other. One therefore needs to consider all
possible bipartitions to quantify entanglement of k-partite system[23].

HERMITICITY OF MOMENTUM OPERATORS

Even though the classical brackets are generalized to quantum commutation relations
using Dirac quantization, one must note that the operator ordering problem arises in
Eq.(35) and in Eqs.(42)-(44). Also, the operators appearing in these commutators must
be Hermitian. So following [8], we try to fix the operator ordering problem by requiring
the operators to be Hermitian. The z-component of angular momentum is

L̂(k)
z = (x̂k P̂yk − ŷk P̂xk )

their expressions in the following form:

Eqs.(28), (29) and (35) yield information on μ(χk ), ν(χk ) and β(χk ), γ(χk ) respectively.

where prime denotes differentiation with respect to χk . We also need the following equations of motion to be satisfied

i(P̂xk − eA)

~ = [ŷk , Ĥ]

The solution to these equations are given by

Note that the energy expression can't be split into E1 + E2 because Hamiltonian is an
observable of the quantum state (Eq. (27)) in the Hilbert space H1 ⊗ H2 and it is not
possible to split the two particles. The equation involves the position of both entangled
particles. If χ1 changes, χ2 also changes due to the correlation between them, such that

the total momentum and total energy of the system remains conserved. Also one can see,

the energy equation (78) involves an additional term E ′ . This additional term E ′ arises
due to the Dirac quantization and Hermiticity of the momentum operator. However,
in comparison with [8], the additional energy term is not a constant and both energies
are connected, since the particle positions are also involved in the additional energy term,
implying that any change in particle positions simultaneously effect both the energy terms.
Since E ′ is not a constant, the term represents a shift in energy levels due to the applied
magnetic field in view of similar terms arising in quantization on curved manifolds [18].
Also note that the term

~
eA
(χk

− α′ )(x̂k − ŷk ) appearing in the energy equation is slightly

different from the one obtained for the Hamiltonian in (80). This is due to the requirement
that P̂ must be Hermitian and the expression for momenta involves orbit-orbit interaction
between the two particles and their projection along z-axis is given by
L(1)
z = χ2 − ᾱ ,

L(2)
z = χ1 − ᾱ

(82)

The interaction between the momenta of two particles results in a total orbital angular
momentum vector about z-axis at an angle with the direction of the external field for
which the projection along z-axis is the scalar sum as given in the following equation.
L(k)
z = χ1 + χ2 − 2ᾱ

(83)

Hence, the total energy of the system experiences a shift due to Dirac quantization and
orbit-orbit coupling between both particles.

SUMMARY

In this paper, we present a measure of uncertainty for a maximally entangled constrained bipartite system by calculating the lower bounds using Robertson relation and
16

discussed the presence of additional energy terms for this system in connection to terms
arising during quantization on curved spaces [18]. In view of the work reported in [6], we
emphasize that the quantum correlations also effect the lower bound when particles are
~
constrained on S 1 under the influence of an external field B.
We started with a classical system of two particles constrained on S 1 under the in~ We used Dirac's method for handling degenerate
fluence of a uniform external field B.
Lagrangians and a set of Dirac brackets between canonical variables was obtained for
this system. Later, we quantized this constrained classical system via Dirac's canonical
quantization rule. For this constrained quantum system, we presented a measure of uncertainty between observables by calculating the lower bounds using Robertson relation.
For this, we partitioned the system into two subsystems (with k = 2) and chose an inseparable (entangled) state over a composite space H1 ⊗ H2 with concurrence C = 1, i.e., a
maximally entangled state. On account of [8], we showed that when observables P̂ and
x̂ act on a maximally entangled pure bipartite state, the uncertainty between the two
is reduced. The reduction in uncertainty is also observed between different P̂ and the
commutation relations in Eq.(42)-(44) are analysed for a GHZ state.
We show that the uncertainty is not only effected by the number of particles k, but

also by the strength of the external field B,

B
Increasing k also reduces uncertainty between the observables by 1/k times in Eqs.(28)(32) as in [6], but its generalization for k > 3 to the brackets containing different P̂
(Eqs.(42)-(44)) is nontrivial due to the partition of k-partite system into two blocks for
which the number of bipartition measures increases with k [23].
We also addressed the operator ordering problem arising due to the canonical quantization via Weyl ordering prescription and by requiring the Hermitian expressions for
operators. Finally, we comment that the Schrödinger equation for a pure bipartite entangled state contains additional energy terms arising due to the Hermiticity of P̂ that
contains orbit-orbit interaction between the particles. This additional term E ′ is con-

17

nected with E due to Eq.(27), and in view of [18], it represents a shift in the energy
levels. Any changes made in particle position is reflected in the simultaneous change in
both E and E ′ .
