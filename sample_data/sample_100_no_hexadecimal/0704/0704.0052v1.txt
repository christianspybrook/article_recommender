QUANTUM FIELD THEORY ON CURVED
BACKGROUNDS. II.
SPACETIME SYMMETRIES
ARTHUR JAFFE AND GORDON RITTER
Abstract. We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field
theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first
consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter
subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We
analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry
group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated
for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is
Anti-de Sitter space.

1. Introduction
The extension of quantum field theory to curved space-times has led to
the discovery of many qualitatively new phenomena which do not occur
in the simpler theory on Minkowski space, such as Hawking radiation; for
background and historical references, see [2, 6, 18].
The reconstruction of quantum field theory on a Lorentz-signature spacetime from the corresponding Euclidean quantum field theory makes use of
Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) positivity [15, 16] and analytic continuation. On
a curved background, there may be no proper definition of time-translation
and no Hamiltonian; thus, the mathematical framework of Euclidean quantum field theory may break down. However, on static space-times there is a
Hamiltonian and it makes sense to define Euclidean QFT. This approach was
recently taken by the authors [11], in which the fundamental properties of
Osterwalder-Schrader quantization and some of the fundamental estimates
of constructive quantum field theory1 were generalized to static space-times.
The previous work [11], however, did not address the analytic continuation
which leads from a Euclidean theory to a real-time theory. In the present
article, we initiate a treatment of the analytic continuation by constructing
unitary operators which form a representation of the isometry group of the
Lorentz-signature space-time associated to a static Riemannian space-time.
Our approach is similar in spirit to that of Fröhlich [4] and of Klein and

Landau [13], who showed how to go from the Euclidean group to the Poincaré
group without using the field operators on flat space-time.
This work also has applications to representation theory, as it provides
a natural (functorial) quantization procedure which constructs nontrivial
unitary representations of those Lie groups which arise as isometry groups
of static, Lorentz-signature space-times. These groups are typically noncompact. For example, when applied to AdSd+1 , our procedure gives a
unitary representation of the identity component of SO(d, 2). Moreover,
our procedure makes use of the Cartan decomposition, a standard tool in
representation theory.
2. Classical Space-Time
2.1. Structure of Static Space-Times.
Definition 2.1. A quantizable static space-time is a complete, connected orientable Riemannian manifold (M, gab ) with a globally-defined (smooth)
Killing field ξ which is orthogonal to a codimension-one hypersurface Σ ⊂ M ,
such that the orbits of ξ are complete and each orbit intersects Σ exactly
once.
Throughout this paper, we assume that M is a quantizable static spacetime. Definition 2.1 implies that there is a global time function t defined
up to a constant by the requirement that ξ = ∂/∂t. Thus M is foliated by
time-slices Mt , and
M = Ω− ∪ Σ ∪ Ω+
where the unions are disjoint, Σ = M0 , and Ω± are open sets corresponding
to t > 0 and t < 0 respectively. We infer existence of an isometry θ which
reverses the sign of t,
θ : Ω± → Ω∓ such that θ 2 = 1, θ|Σ = id.
Fix a self-adjoint extension of the Laplacian, and let C = (−∆ + m2 )−1
be the resolvent of the Laplacian (also called the free covariance), where
m2 > 0. Then C is a bounded self-adjoint operator on L2 (M ). For each s ∈
R, the Sobolev space Hs (M ) is a real Hilbert space, defined as completion
of Cc∞ (M ) in the norm
kf k2s = hf, C −s f i.

(2.1)

The
HS
s+k for k > 0 is Hilbert-Schmidt. Define S :=
T inclusion Hs ֒→
′ :=
H
(M
)
and
S
s<0 s
s>0 Hs (M ). Then
S

⊂ H−1 (M ) ⊂ S ′

form a Gelfand triple, and S is a nuclear space.
Recall that S ′ has a natural σ-algebra of measurable sets (see for instance
[7, 8, 17]). There is a unique Gaussian probability measure μ with mean
zero and covariance C defined on the cylinder sets in S ′ (see [7]).

More generally, one may consider a non-Gaussian, countably-additive
measure μ on S ′ and the space
E := L2 (S ′ , μ).
We are interested in the case that the monomials of the form A(Φ) =
Φ(f1 ) . . . Φ(fn ) for fi ∈ S are all elements of E , and for which their span
is dense in E . This is of course true if μ is the Gaussian measure with
covariance C.
For an open set ΩQ⊂ M , let EΩ denote the closure in E of the set of
monomials A(Φ) = i Φ(fi ) where supp(fi ) ⊂ Ω for all i. Of particular
importance for Euclidean quantum field theory is the positive-time subspace
E+ := EΩ+ .
2.2. The Operator Induced by an Isometry. Isometries of the underlying space-time manifold act on a Hilbert space of classical fields arising in
the study of a classical field theory. For f ∈ C ∞ (M ) and ψ : M → M an
isometry, define
f ψ ≡ (ψ −1 )∗ f = f ◦ ψ −1 .
Since det(dψ) = 1, the operation f → f ψ extends to a bounded operator
on H±1 (M ) or on L2 (M ). A treatment of isometries for static space-times
appears in [11].
Definition 2.2. Let ψ be an isometry, and A(Φ) = Φ(f1 ) . . . Φ(fn ) ∈ E a
monomial. Define the induced operator
(2.2)

Γ(ψ)A ≡ Φ(f1 ψ ) . . . Φ(fn ψ ) ,

and extend Γ(ψ) by linearity to the domain of polynomials in the fields,
which is dense in E .
3. Osterwalder-Schrader Quantization
3.1. Quantization of Vectors (The Hilbert Space H of Quantum
Theory). In this section we define the quantization map E+ → H , where
H is the Hilbert space of quantum theory. The existence of the quantization
map relies on a condition known as Osterwalder-Schrader (or reflection)
positivity. A probability measure μ on S ′ is said to be reflection positive if
Z
Γ(θ)F F dμ ≥ 0
(3.1)
for all F in the positive-time subspace E+ ⊂ E . Let Θ = Γ(θ) be the
reflection on E induced by θ. Define the sesquilinear form (A, B) on E+ × E+
as (A, B) = hΘA, BiE , so (3.1) states that (F, F ) ≥ 0.
Assumption 1 (O-S Positivity). Any measure dμ that we consider is reflection positive with respect to the time-reflection Θ.

ARTHUR JAFFE AND GORDON RITTER

Definition 3.1 (OS-Quantization). Given a reflection-positive measure dμ,
the Hilbert space H of quantum theory is the completion of E+ /N with
respect to the inner product given by the sesquilinear form (A, B). Denote
the quantization map Π for vectors E+ → H by Π(A) = Â, and write
(3.2)

hÂ, B̂iH = (A, B) = hΘA, BiE

for

A, B ∈ E+ .

3.2. Quantization of Operators. The basic quantization theorem gives a
sufficient condition to map a (possibly unbounded) linear operator T on E
to its quantization, a linear operator T̂ on H . Consider a densely-defined
operator T on E , the unitary time-reflection Θ, and the adjoint T + = ΘT ∗ Θ.
A preliminary version of the following was also given in [10].
Definition 3.2 (Quantization Condition I). The operator T satisfies QC-I
if:
i. The operator T has a domain D(T ) dense in E .
ii. There is a subdomain D0 ⊂ E+ ∩ D(T ) ∩ D(T + ), for which Db0 ⊂ H
is dense.
iii. The transformations T and T + both map D0 into E+ .
Theorem 3.3 (Quantization I). If T satisfies QC-I, then
i. The operators T ↾D0 and T + ↾D0 have quantizations T̂ and Tc+ with
domain D̂0 .

∗
∗
ii. The operators T̂ = T̂ ↾D̂0 and Tc+ agree on D̂0 .

iii. The operator T̂ ↾D0 has a closure, namely T̂ ∗∗ .

Proof. We wish to define the quantization T̂ with the putative domain D̂0
by
d
(3.3)
T̂ Â = T
A.

For any vector A ∈ D0 and for any B ∈ (D0 ∩ N ), it is the case that
\

\
Â = A
+ B. The transformation T̂ is defined by (3.3) iff T
A = T (A
+ B) =
d
d
T
A+T
B. Hence one needs to verify that T : D0 ∩ N → N , which we now
do.
The assumption D0 ⊂ D(T + ), along with the fact that Θ is unitary,
ensures that ΘD0 ⊂ D(T ∗ ). Therefore for any F ∈ D0 ,
(3.4)
+ F , B̂i
hΘF, T BiE = hT ∗ ΘF, BiE = hΘ (ΘT ∗ ΘF ) , BiE = hΘT + F, BiE = hT[
H .
In the last step we use the fact assumed in part (iii) of QC-I that T + :
D0 → E+ , yielding the inner product of two vectors in H . We infer from
the Schwarz inequality in H that
+F k
|hΘF, T BiE | ≤ kT[
H kB̂kH = 0 .

As hΘF, T BiE = hF̂ , T
BiH , this means that T
B ⊥ D̂0 . As D̂0 is dense in
d
H by QC-I.ii, we infer T B = 0. In other words, T B ∈ N as required to
define T̂ .

In order show that D̂0 ⊂ D(T̂ ∗ ), perform a similar calculation to (3.4)
with arbitrary A ∈ D0 replacing B, namely
(3.5)
+ F , Âi
hF̂ , T̂ ÂiH = hΘF, T AiE = hΘ (ΘT ∗ ΘF ) , AiE = hΘT + F , AiE = hT[

The right side is continuous in Â ∈ H , and therefore F̂ ∈ D(T ∗ ). Further+ F . This identity shows that if F ∈ N , then T
+ F = 0.

more T ∗ F̂ = T[
Hence T + ↾D0 has a quantization Tc+ , and we may write (3.5) as
(3.6)

In particular
proof.

T̂ ∗

is densely defined so T̂ has a closure. This completes the


Definition 3.4 (Quantization Condition II). The operator T satisfies QC-II
if
i. Both the operator T and its adjoint T ∗ have dense domains D(T ), D(T ∗ ) ⊂
E.
ii. There is a domain D0 ⊂ E+ in the common domain of T , T + , T + T ,
and T T + .
iii. Each operator T , T + , T + T , and T T + maps D0 into E+ .
Theorem 3.5 (Quantization II). If T satisfies QC-II, then
i. The operators T ↾D0 and T + ↾D0 have quantizations T̂ and Tc+ with
domain D̂0 .
ii. If A, B ∈ D0 , one has hB̂, T̂ ÂiH = hTc+ B̂, ÂiH .

Remarks.
i. In Theorem 3.5 we drop the assumption that the domain D̂0 is dense,
obtaining quantizations T̂ and Tc+ whose domains are not necessarily
dense. In order to compensate for this, we assume more properties
concerning the domain and the range of T + on E .
ii. As D̂0 need not be dense in H , the adjoint of T̂ need not be defined.
Nevertheless, one calls the operator T̂ symmetric in case one has
(3.7)

hB̂, T̂ ÂiH = hT̂ B̂, ÂiH ,

for all A, B ∈ D0 .

iii. If Ŝ ⊃ T̂ is a densely-defined extension of T̂ , then Ŝ ∗ = Tc+ on the
domain D̂0 .

Proof. We define the quantization T̂ with the putative domain D̂0 . As in
the proof of Theorem 3.3, this quantization T̂ is well-defined iff it is the case
that T : D0 ∩ N → N . For any F ∈ D0 ∩ N , by definition kF̂ kH = 0.
Also
hT F, T F iH = (T F, T F ) = hΘT F, T F iE = hF, T ∗ ΘT F iE ,
where one uses the fact that D0 ⊂ D(T + T ). Thus
hT F, T F iH = ΘF, T + T F

E

= hF, T + T F iH .

ARTHUR JAFFE AND GORDON RITTER

Here we use the fact that T + T maps D0 to E+ . Thus one can use the
Schwarz inequality on H to obtain
+T F k
hT F, T F iH ≤ kF̂ kH kT\
H =0.

Hence T : D0 ∩ N → N , and T has a quantization T̂ with domain D̂0 .
In order verify that T + ↾D0 has a quantization, one needs to show that
+
T : D0 ∩ N ⊂ N . Repeat the argument above with T + replacing T . The
assumption T T + : D0 → E+ yields for F ∈ D0 ∩ N ,
hT + F, T + F iH = hT ∗ ΘF, T + F iE = hΘF, T T + F iE = hF̂ , T\
T + F iH .
Use the Schwarz inequality in H to obtain the desired result that
hT + F, T + F iH ≤ kF̂ kH kT\
T + F kH = 0 .
Hence T + has a quantization Tc+ with domain D̂0 , and for B ∈ D0 one has
c+ B̂. In order to establish (ii), assume that A, B ∈ D0 . Then
+B = T

H = hT B̂, ÂiH .



This completes the proof.
4. Structure and Representation of the Lie Algebra of
Killing Fields
For the remainder of this paper we assume the following, which is clearly
true in the Gaussian case as the Laplacian commutes with the isometry
group G. (A further explanation was given in [11].)
Assumption 2. The isometry groups G that we consider leave the measure
dμ invariant, in the sense that Γ, defined above, is a unitary representation
of G on E .
4.1. The Representation of g on E .
Lemma 4.1. Let Gi be an analytic group with Lie algebra gi (i = 1, 2),
and let λ : g1 → g2 be a homomorphism. There cannot exist more than one
analytic homomorphism π : G1 → G2 for which dπ = λ. If G1 is simply
connected then there is always one such π.
Let D = d/dt denote the canonical unit vector field on R. Let G be a
real Lie group with algebra g, and let X ∈ g. The map tD → tX(t ∈ R)
is a homomorphism of Lie(R) → g, so by the Lemma there is a unique
analytic homomorphism ξX : R → G such that dξX (D) = X. Conversely,
if η is an analytic homomorphism of R → G, and if we let X = dη(D),
it is obvious that η = ξX . Thus X 7→ ξX is a bijection of g onto the set
of analytic homomorphisms R → G. The exponential map is defined by

exp(X) := ξX (1). For complex Lie groups, the same argument applies,
replacing R with C throughout.
Since g is connected, so is exp(g). Hence exp(g) ⊆ G0 , where G0 denotes
the connected component of the identity in G. It need not be the case for
a general Lie group that exp(g) = G0 , but for a large class of examples
(the so-called exponential groups) this does hold. For any Lie group, exp(g)
contains an open neighborhood of the identity, so the subgroup generated
by exp(g) always coincides with G0 .
We will apply the above results with G = Iso(M ), the isometry group of
M , and g = Lie(G) the algebra of global Killing fields. Thus we have a bijective correspondence between Killing fields and 1-parameter groups of isometries. This correspondence has a geometric realization: the 1-parameter
group of isometries
φs = ξX (s) = exp(sX)
corresponding to X ∈ g is the flow generated by X.
Consider the two different 1-parameter groups of unitary operators:
(1) the unitary group φ∗s on L2 (M ), and
(2) the unitary group Γ(φs ) on E .
Stone's theorem applies to both of these unitary groups to yield denselydefined self-adjoint operators on the respective Hilbert spaces.
In the first case, the relevant self-adjoint operator is simply an extension
of −iX, viewed as a differential operator on Cc∞ (M ). This is because for
f ∈ Cc∞ (M ) and p ∈ M , we have:
Xp f = (LX f )(p) =

d
f (φs (p))|s=0 .
ds

Thus −iX is a densely-defined symmetric operator on L2 (M ), and Stone's
theorem implies that −iX has self-adjoint extensions.
In the second case, the unitary group Γ(φs ) on E also has a self-adjoint
generator Γ(X), which can be calculated explicitly. By definition,
e−isΓ(X)

One may check that Γ is a Lie algebra representation of g, i.e. Γ([X, Y ]) =
[Γ(X), Γ(Y )].
4.2. The Cartan Decomposition of g. For each ξ ∈ g, there exists some
dense domain in E on which Γ(ξ) is self-adjoint, as discussed previously.

b
However, the quantizations Γ(ξ)
acting on H may be hermitian, antihermitian, or neither depending on whether there holds a relation of the
form
Γ(ξ)Θ = ±ΘΓ(ξ),

(4.1)

with one of the two possible signs, or whether no such relation holds.
Even if (4.1) holds, to complete the construction of a unitary representab
tion one must prove that there exists a dense domain in H on which Γ(ξ)
is
self-adjoint or skew-adjoint. This nontrivial problem will be dealt with in a
later section using Theorems 3.3 and 3.5 and the theory of symmetric local
semigroups [12, 4]. Presently we determine which elements within g satisfy
relations of the form (4.1).
Let θ := θ ∗ as an operator on C ∞ (M ), and consider a Killing field X ∈ g
also as an operator on C ∞ (M ). Define T : g → g by
(4.2)

T (X) := θXθ.

From (4.2) it is not obvious that the range of T is contained in g. To prove
this, we recall some geometric constructions.
Let M, N be manifolds, let ψ : M → N be a diffeomorphism, and X ∈
Vect(M ). Then
(4.3)

ψ −1∗ Xψ ∗ = X(* ◦ ψ) ◦ ψ −1 .

defines an operator on C ∞ (N ). One may check that this operator is a
derivation, thus (4.3) defines a vector field on N . The vector field (4.3) is
usually denoted
ψ∗ X = dψ(Xψ−1 (p) )
and referred to as the push-forward of X.
We now wish to show that g = g+ ⊕ g− , where g± are the ±1-eigenspaces
of T . This is proven by introducing an inner product (X, Y )g on g with
respect to which T is self-adjoint.
Theorem 4.2. Consider g as a Hilbert space with inner product (X, Y )g.
The operator T : g → g is self-adjoint with T 2 = I; hence
g = g+ ⊕ g−

(4.4)

as an orthogonal direct sum of Hilbert spaces, where g± are the ±1-eigenspaces
of T . Further, ∂t ∈ g− hence dim(g− ) ≥ 1. Elements of g− have hermitian
quantizations, while elements of g+ have anti-hermitian quantizations.2
Proof. Write (4.2) as
(4.5)

T (X) = θ −1∗ Xθ ∗ = θ∗ X .

Thus T is the operator of push-forward by θ. The push-forward of a Killing
field by an isometry is another Killing field, hence the range of T is contained
2It is not the case that g consists only of ∂ . In particular, dim(g ) = 2 for M = H .

It can occur that dim g+ = 0.

in g. Also, T must have a trivial kernel since T 2 = I, and this implies that
T is surjective. It follows from (4.5) that T is a Hermitian operator on
g. Hence T is diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues which are square
roots of 1. This establishes the decomposition (4.4). That elements of
g− have hermitian quantizations, while elements of g+ have anti-hermitian
quantizations follows from Theorem 3.3.

A Cartan involution is a Lie algebra homomorphism g → g which squares
to the identity. It follows from (4.2) that T is a Lie algebra homomorphism;
thus, Theorem 4.2 implies that T is a Cartan involution of g. This implies
that the eigenspaces (g+ , g− ) form a Cartan pair, meaning that
(4.6)

[g+ , g+ ] ⊂ g+ ,

[g+ , g− ] ⊂ g− ,

and [g− , g− ] ⊂ g+ .

Clearly g+ is a subalgebra while g− is not, and any subalgebra contained in
g− is abelian.
5. Reflection-Invariant and Reflected Isometries
Let G = Iso(M ) denote the isometry group of M , as above. Then G
has a Z2 subgroup containing {1, θ}. This subgroup acts on G by conjugation, which is just the action ψ → ψ θ := θψθ. Conjugation is an (inner)
automorphism of the group, so
(ψφ)θ = ψ θ φθ ,

(ψ θ )−1 = (ψ −1 )θ .

Definition 5.1. We say that ψ ∈ G is reflection-invariant if
ψ θ = ψ,
and that ψ is reflected if
ψ θ = ψ −1 .
Let GRI denote the subgroup of G consisting of reflection-invariant elements,
and let GR denote the subset of reflected elements.
Note that GRI is the stabilizer of the Z2 action, hence a subgroup. An
alternate proof of this proceeds using GRI = exp(g+ ). Although GR is closed
under the taking of inverses and does contain the identity, the product of two
reflected isometries is no longer reflected unless they commute. Generally,
the product of an element of GR with an element of GRI is neither an element
of GR nor of GRI . The only isometry that is both reflection-invariant and
reflected is θ itself. Thus we have:
GR ∩ GRI = {1, θ} ⊂ GR ∪ GRI ( G.
Theorem 5.2. Let G0 denote the connected component of the identity in
G. Then G0 is generated by GR ∪ GRI . (This is a form of the Cartan
decomposition for G.)

10

ARTHUR JAFFE AND GORDON RITTER

Proof. Since g = g+ ⊕ g− as a direct sum of vector spaces (though not of
Lie algebras), we have
G0 = exp(g) = exp(g+ ) ∪ exp(g− ) .
Choose bases {ξ±,i }i=1,...,n± for g± respectively. Then we have:
G0 = {exp(sξ+,i ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n+ , s ∈ R} ∪ {exp(sξ−,j ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ n− , s ∈ R} .
Furthermore, exp(sξ−,i ) is reflected, while exp(sξ+,i ) is reflection-invariant,
completing the proof.

Corollary 5.3. The Lie algebra of the subgroup GRI is g+ .
To summarize, the isometry group of a static space-time can always be
generated by a collection of n (= dim g) one-parameter subgroups, each of
which consists either of reflected isometries, or reflection-invariant isometries.
6. Construction of Unitary Representations
6.1. Self-adjointness of Semigroups. In this section, we recall several
known results on self-adjointness of semigroups. Roughly speaking, these
results imply that if a one-parameter family Sα of unbounded symmetric
operators satisfies a semigroup condition of the form Sα Sβ = Sα+β , then
under suitable conditions one may conclude essential self-adjointness.
A theorem of this type appeared in a 1970 paper of Nussbaum [14], who
assumed that the semigroup operators have a common dense domain. The
result was rediscovered independently by Fröhlich, who applied it to quantum field theory in several important papers [5, 3]. For our intended application to quantum field theory, it turns out to be very convenient to drop
the assumption that ∃ a such that the Sα all have aScommon dense domain
for |α| < a, in favor of the weaker assumption that α>0 D(Sα ) is dense.
A generalization of Nussbaum's theorem which allows the domains of the
semigroup operators to vary with the parameter, and which only requires the
union of the domains to be dense, was later formulated and two independent
proofs were given: one by Fröhlich [4], and another by Klein and Landau [12].
The latter also used this theorem in their construction of representations of
the Euclidean group and the corresponding analytic continuation to the
Lorentz group [13].
In order to keep the present article self-contained, we first define symmetric local semigroups and then recall the refined self-adjointness theorem of
Fröhlich, and Klein and Landau.
Definition 6.1. Let H be a Hilbert space, let T > 0 and for each α ∈ [0, T ],
let Sα be a symmetric linear operator on the domain Dα ⊂ H , such that:
S
(i) Dα ⊃ Dβ if α ≤ β and D := 0<α≤T Dα is dense in H ,
(ii) α → Sα is weakly continuous,
(iii) S0 = I, Sβ (Dα ) ⊂ Dα−β for 0 ≤ β ≤ α ≤ T , and

QUANTUM FIELD THEORY ON CURVED BACKGROUNDS. II.SPACETIME SYMMETRIES
11

(iv) Sα Sβ = Sα+β on Dα+β for α, β, α + β ∈ [0, T ].
In this situation, we say that (Sα , Dα , T ) is a symmetric local semigroup.
It is important that Dα is not required to be dense in H for each α; the
only density requirement is (i).
Theorem 6.2 ([12, 4]). For each symmetric local semigroup (Sα , Dα , T ),
there exists a unique self-adjoint operator A such that3
Dα ⊂ D(e−αA ) and Sα = e−αA |Dα for all α ∈ [0, T ].
Also, A ≥ −c if and only if kSα f k ≤ ecα kf k for all f ∈ Dα and 0 < α < T .
6.2. Reflection-Invariant Isometries.
Lemma 6.3. Let ψ be a reflection-invariant isometry and assume ∃ p ∈ Ω+
such that ψ(p) ∈ Ω+ . Then ψ preserves the positive-time subspace, i.e.
ψ(Ω+ ) ⊆ Ω+ .
Proof. We first prove that ψ(Σ) ⊆ Σ. Suppose not; then ∃ p ∈ Σ with ψ(p) 6∈
Σ. Assume ψ(p) ∈ Ω+ (without loss of generality: we could repeat the same
argument with ψ(p) ∈ Ω− ). Then Ω+ contains (θψθ)(p) = θψ(p) ∈ Ω− , a
contradiction since Ω− ∩Ω+ = ∅. We used the fact that θ|Σ = id so θ(p) = p.
Hence ψ restricts to an isometry of Σ. It follows that the restriction of ψ to
M ′ = M \ Σ is also an isometry. However, M ′ = Ω− ⊔ Ω+ , where ⊔ denotes
the disjoint union. Therefore ψ(Ω+ ) is wholly contained in either Ω+ or Ω− ,
since ψ is a homeomorphism and so ψ(Ω+ ) is connected. The possibility
that ψ(Ω+ ) ⊆ Ω− is ruled out by our assumption, so ψ(Ω+ ) ⊆ Ω+ .

Lemma 6.3 has the immediate consequence that if ξ ∈ g+ then the oneparameter group associated to ξ is positive-time-invariant. This result plays
a key role in the proof of Theorem 6.4.
6.3. Construction of Unitary Representations. The rest of this section
is devoted to proving that the theory of symmetric local semigroups can be
applied to the quantized operators on H corresponding to each of a set of

Proof. First suppose that ξ ∈ g− , which implies that the isometries φα are
reflected, and so Γ(φα )+ = Γ(φα ). Define
Ωξ,α := φ−1
α (Ω+ ).
For all α in some neighborhood of zero, Ωξ,α is a nonempty open subset of
Ω+ , and moreover, as α → 0+ , Ωξ,α increases to fill Ω+ with Ωξ,0 = Ω+ .
These statements follow immediately from the fact that, for each p ∈ Ω+ ,
φα (p) is continuous with respect to α, and φ0 is the identity map.
Since φα (Ωξ,α ) ⊆ Ω+ , we infer that Γ(φα )EΩξ,α ⊆ E+ . By Theorem 3.5,
Γ(φα ) has a quantization which is a symmetric operator on the domain
Dξ,α := Π(EΩξ,α ).
Note that Dξ,α is not necessarily dense in H . 4 We now show that Theorem
6.2 can be applied.
Fix some positive constant a with Ωξ,a nonempty. Note that

It follows that

other conditions are routine verifications. Theorem 6.2 implies existence of
a densely-defined self-adjoint operator Aξ on H , such that
b α ) = exp(−αAξ ) for all α ∈ [0, a] .
Γ(φ

This proves the theorem in case ξ ∈ g− .
Now suppose that ξ ∈ g+ , implying that the isometries φα are reflectioninvariant, and
Γ(φα )+ = Γ(φα )−1 = Γ(φ−α ) on E .
Lemma 6.3 implies that Γ(φα )E+ ⊆ E+ . By Theorem 3.3, Γ(φα ) has a

7. Analytic Continuation
Each Riemannian static space-time (M, gab ) has a Lorentzian continuation
Mlor , which we construct as follows. In adapted coordinates, the metric gab
on M takes the form
ds2 = F (x)dt2 + Gμν (x)dxμ dxν .

(7.1)

The analytic continuation t → −it of (7.1) is standard and gives a metric
of Lorentz signature, ds2 lor = −F dt2 + G dx2 , by which we define the
Lorentzian space-time Mlor . Einstein's equation Ricg = k g is preserved
by the analytic continuation, but we do not use this fact anywhere in the
present paper.

We claim that the group generated by the n = n+ + n− one-parameter

determined by its Lie algebra, it suffices to check that the generators satisfy
the defining relations of glor := Lie(Glor ).

the proof of (7.4).

Corollary 7.2. Let (M, gab ) be a quantizable static space-time. The unitary
groups (7.2) determine a unitary representation of G0 lor on H .

7.1. Conclusions. We have obtained the following conclusions. There is a
unitary representation of the group G0 lor on the physical Hilbert space H
of quantum field theory on the static space-time M . This representation
maps the time-translation subgroup into the unitary group exp(itH), where
the energy H ≥ 0 is a positive, densely-defined self-adjoint operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the theory. The Hilbert space H contains a
ground state Ψ0 = 1̂ which is such that HΨ0 = 0 and Ψ0 is invariant under
the action of all spacetime symmetries. We obtain these results via analytic
continuation from the Euclidean path integral, under mild assumptions on
the measure which should include all physically interesting examples. This is
done without introducing the field operators; nonetheless, Theorems 3.3 and
3.5 do suffice to construct field operators. In the special case M = Rd with
G = SO(4), we obtain a unitary representation of the proper orthochronous
Lorentz group, G0 lor = L↑+ = SO0 (3, 1).

The d − 1 coordinate vector fields {∂/∂xi : i 6= d} are all static Killing fields,
and any one of the coordinates xi (i 6= d) is a satisfactory representation of
time in this space-time. It is convenient to define t = x1 as before, and to
identify t with time.
The time-zero slice is M0 = H d−1 . From
H d = {v ∈ Rd,1 | hv, vi = −1, v0 > 0}
it follows that Isom(H d ) = O+ (d, 1) and the orientation-preserving isometry
group is SO+ (d, 1).

Figure 1. Flow lines of the Killing field ζ = (t2 − r 2 )∂t +
2tr ∂r on H d .
For constant curvature spaces, one may solve Killing's equation LK g = 0
explicitly. Let us illustrate the solutions and their quantizations for d = 2.
The three Killing fields
(8.2)

ξ = ∂t ,

η = t∂t + r∂r ,

ζ = (t2 − r 2 )∂t + 2tr ∂r

are a convenient basis for g. Any d-dimensional manifold satisfies dim g ≤
d(d + 1)/2, manifolds saturating the bound are said to be maximally symmetric, and H d is maximally symmetric.
Now, ∂t f (−t) = −f ′ (−t) so ∂t Θ = −Θ∂t , hence ∂t ∈ g− . Similar calculations show [Θ, η] = 0 and Θζ = −ζΘ. Thus η spans g+ , while ∂t , ζ span g− .
The commutation relations5 for g are:
[η, ζ] = ζ,

[η, ∂t ] = −∂t ,

[ζ, ∂t ] = −2η.

These calculations verify that (g+ , g− ) forms a Cartan pair, as defined in
(4.6).
The flows associated to (8.2) are easily visualized: ξ is a right-translation,
and η flow-lines are radially outward from the Euclidean origin. The flows
of ζ are Euclidean circles, indicated by the darker lines in Figure 1. Hence
the flows of η are defined on all of E+ , while the flows of ζ are analogous to
space-time rotations in R2 , and hence, must be defined on a wedge of the
form
Wα = {(t, r) : t, r > 0, tan−1 (r/t) < α}.
The simple geometric idea of Section 6.2 is nicely confirmed in this case: the
flows of η (the generator of g+ ) preserve the t = 0 plane, and are separately
isometries of Ω+ and Ω− .
Corollary 7.2 implies that the procedure outlined above defines a unitary representation of the identity component of Iso(AdS2 ) on the physical
Hilbert space H for quantum field theory on this background, including
theories with interactions that preserve the symmetry. Since Iso(AdSd+1 ) =

SO(d, 2), we have a unitary representation of SO0 (1, 2). The latter is a noncompact, semisimple real Lie group, and thus it has no finite-dimensional
unitary representations, but a host of interesting infinite-dimensional ones.
Appendix A. Euclidean Reeh-Schlieder Theorem
We prove the Euclidean Reeh-Schlieder property for free theories on curved
backgrounds. It is reasonable to expect this property to extend to interacting theories on curved backgrounds, but it would have to be established for
each such model since it depends explicitly on the two-point function.
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem guarantees the existence of a dense quantization domain based on any open subset of Ω+ . For this reason, one could
use the Reeh-Schlieder (RS) theorem with Nussbaum's theorem [14] to construct a second proof of Theorem 6.4 under the additional assumption that
M is real-analytic.
Fortunately, our proof of Theorem 6.4 is completely independent of the
Reeh-Schlieder property. This has two advantages: we do not have to assume
M is a real-analytic manifold and, more importantly, our proof of Theorem
6.4 generalizes immediately and transparently to interacting theories as long
as the Hilbert space H is not modified by the interaction.
We state and prove this using the one-particle space; however, the result
clearly extends to the quantum-field Hilbert space.
Theorem A.1. Let M be a quantizable static space-time endowed with a
real-analytic structure, and assume that gab is real-analytic. Let O ⊂ Ω+
and D = C ∞ (O) ⊂ L2 (Ω+ ). Then Db ⊥ = {0}.

Proof. Let f ∈ L2 (Ω+ ) with fˆ ⊥ D. For x ∈ Ω+ , define
η(x) := hfˆ, δ̂x iH = hΘf, Cδx iL2 .

Real-analyticity of η(x) follows from the real-analyticity of (the integral
kernel of) C, which in turn follows from the elliptic regularity theorem in the
real-analytic category (see for instance [1, Sec. II.1.3]). Now by assumption,
for any g ∈ Cc∞ (O), we have
0 = hĝ, fˆiH = hΘf, CgiL2 (M ) .
Let g → δx for x ∈ O. Then 0 = hΘf, Cδx iL2 ≡ η(x). Since η|O = 0, by
real-analyticity we infer the vanishing of η on Ω+ , completing the proof.
