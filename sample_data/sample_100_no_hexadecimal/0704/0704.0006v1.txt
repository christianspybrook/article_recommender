We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction
strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its
bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated
with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a threedimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which
is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair
projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms
described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at
(kF a)−1 ≥ 1, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the
corresponding molecular condensates.

INTRODUCTION

Recent advancement in the control of Feshbach
molecules has given rise to many new experimental observations in the world of ultracold atomic gas [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
At sufficiently low temperatures, fermionic atoms are
known to form pairs under an attractive interaction. The
interaction strength can be manipulated by tuning magnetic fields near Feshbach resonance, which is characterized by a detuning energy between the close channel
bound state energy and the open channel collision threshold. A positive detuning leads to a negative scattering
length, in this regime paired atoms are loosely bound.
Upon negative detuning, the scattering length becomes
positive and atoms can form bound molecules, which
could further condense into a BEC state. Unlike bosonic
molecules, the statistics of interacting fermionic atoms is
dictated by Pauli exclusion principle, the ground state is
thus made up of a large number of modes, even at zero
temperature. One usually uses a BCS state to approximate the ground state at which fermions are paired up
according to their natural orbits [6]. This is very different
from BEC formed by pure bosons at zero temperature,
which is well described by a single mode wave function.
We may however expect, upon a strong enough interaction, paired fermionic atoms become so tightly bound
that they look just like bosons [7]. In that case, one natural question to ask is, how alike are a fermionic pair and
a boson? In this paper, we address this question by constructing a Cooper pair creation operator and examine
its bosonic properties across resonance.
One fundamental feature that distinguishes fermions
from bosons is the commutation relation between their
creation and annihilation
operators. For bosons, the

†
commutator
C,
C
is
one,
while the anticommuta
†
is one for fermions. For composite twotor C, C
particles, the corresponding commutator is not exactly
one [8, 9, 10]. A useful indicator measuring the deviation
from the bosonic commutation relation is the M -pairs

normalization factor χM defined by: h0| C M C †M |0i =
M !χM , where |0i is the vacuum state. The value of χM
reflects the correction of Bose enhancement factor, and
was used to study ground state excitons statistics [8, 9]
and the connection to quantum entanglement [10]. The
key quantity was shown to be the ratio χM+1 /χM which
goes to one for a perfect boson. This ratio will be one
of our primary indicators of the bosonic characters of
Cooper pairs.
However, there has been an ambiguity in defining the
explicit form of a Cooper pair wave function. Ortiz et al.
[11] have given a discussion at length on this matter. In
[12], Yang showed that off-diagonal long range order exists in a superconducting state, and is characterized by a
dominant eigenvector of the two-particle density matrix.
The eigenvector is sometimes recognized as a Cooper pair
wave function. On the other hand, the pair projection
wave function of a BCS state [13] is also a candidate.
Both Cooper pair wave functions will be examined in
this paper. Their bosonic characters are compared and
we shall discuss their suitability as a bosonic mode in a
Fermi gas.
In this paper, we employ the one-channel approach to
discuss the crossover phenomena at zero temperature [11,
15, 16, 17]. Specifically, a BCS state will be used as our
ground state wave function

Here αn and βn are the annihilation operators of two spin
components of fermonic atoms, n denotes the quantum
number of pairing orbit, and ũn and ṽn are amplitudes
subjected to normalization constraint |ũn |2 + |ṽn |2 = 1.
The number
P of atoms in each spin component is given
by N = n |ṽn |2 . In this paper, we will use the solution
of ũn , ṽn in homogeneous systems. For trapped systems,
the amplitudes can be determined by methods described
in Refs. [18, 19].

BOSONIC TESTS

We begin by reviewing some tests on the bosonic characters of a particle operator. Consider the annihilation
operator of a composite particle defined by

C=
λn αn βn ,

where n |λn |2 = 1. The operator C, when sandwiched
by the BCS state given in (1), has the following properties,

Eq. (3) gives the number of composite particles existing
in the gas. To quantify how 'bosonic'
 the C molecule is,
we study the commutator C, C † . Note however only
expectation value of the commutator is given in Eq. (4),
not the commutator itself. How close the expectation
value to unity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for C to be bosonic. To actually compare C with a
pure boson operator, we adopt the views pointed out in
Refs.[8, 9, 10]. It was suggested that the bosonic characters should be quantified by the normalization factor
χM , where
h0| C M C †M |0i = M !χM .

(5)

χM is obviously 1 if C is a perfect boson. It is often more
convenient to look at the ratio χM+1 /χM , since
r
χM √
C |M i =
M |M − 1i + |ǫM i ,
(6)
χM−1
where |ǫM i is a correction term orthogonal to |M − 1i,
and it has the norm given by
χM
χM+1
hǫM |ǫM i = 1 − M
+ (M − 1)
.
(7)
χM−1
χM
So we see that the ratio χM+1 /χM plays the role of a
correction of Bose enhancement factor with respect to a
many body state. It tells us how the gas differs from
being bosonic, when one more pair of atoms is added
to or removed from a M -pairs gas. The closer it is to
one, the less a correction it is. The criterion of a perfect
boson is χM+1 /χM = 1, only then is hǫM |ǫM i zero. In
this paper we will examine the case with M = N , which
is the number of atoms of one of the spin components in
the gas.
In the case of fermions and if N ≫ 1, Combescot et al.
[9] have shown that

where z0 can be solved from the equation [9]

(9)

From this last equation the ratio can be solved numerically. In Refs. [8, 9], the correction factor in (6) has been
studied in exciton systems. Here we will apply Eq. (9) to
atomic Cooper pairs with λn defined in the next section.
One of the general features is that the χN +1 /χN would
deviate more from unity when the density of atoms increases. This is because when the pair density is large,
atoms within each pair would see the Pauli effect from
atoms in nearby pairs.
It is useful to indicate the meaning of Eqs. (8) and
(9)
a simple model. Let us consider |λk |2 =
P through
−1
( k′ <kC ) for |k| < kC and zero otherwise, where kC is
the extension of the wave function in momentum space,
such that the two particle wave function has a spatial
radius ∼ 1/kC . It can then be shown that Eq. (9) reads
χN +1
N
N 6π 2

(10)

Noting that 1/kC
is the spatial volume of our pair wave
function, N is the maximum number of pairs in a total
volume V , the second term in Eq. (10) is thus the volume
occupied by all Cooper pairs over the total volume. In
the BCS limit where a Cooper size is large (kC ∼ Fermi
3
2
momentum kF , N
V ≈ kF /6π ), paired atoms are Pauli
blocked by atoms in between, preventing a bosonization,
and hence N/z0 is nearly zero. While in the BEC limit
where kC → ∞, each Cooper pair is essentially isolated
from each other, and this gives N/z0 → 1 [9].

III.

COOPER PAIR WAVE FUNCTIONS

We now discuss two choices of λn in defining the
Cooper pair wave functions. First, it was shown in
[12] that the long range correlation (|r1 − r′1 | → ∞,
|r2 − r′2 | → ∞ ) in a paired state is reflected in the eigenvalue decomposition of the two particle density matrix

where ψα (r) = n fn (r) αn and ψβ (r) = n fn∗ (r) βn
are the field operators of the respective species, and {fn }
is an orthonormal set of natural orbits. The mode function φ̃ can be written as

We shall thus construct C with respect to this wave function. φ̃(r1 , r2 ) is obviously associated with C through

C ′† would then be a Cooper pair creation operator. It
can be shown that C ′ takes the form [7, 11, 13, 14]:

(15)

The second term in C † C is smaller than unity, while
the first term is of order N . So as long as the number
of particles is large, the second term can be dropped. In
the large N limit, C † C is just the eigenvalue given in
(11). We remark that Eq. (13) was also recognized by
Leggett [20] as a form of Cooper pair wave function, and
recently Salasnich et al. have made use of the definition
to calculate the condensate fraction [15].
There is however another way of defining a Cooper
pair based on the single pair projection from a BCS state
[7, 11, 13, 14]. By expressing the BCS state as

where the integration can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals [16]. The Fermi momentum is defined
1/3
as kF = 6π 2 ρ
, which is the reciprocal of the interatomic distance. An important dimensionless parameter
is (kF a)−1 . The BCS limit is indicated by (kF a)−1 ≪
−1
−1, the BEC limit corresponds to (kF a) ≫ 1, and the
−1
crossover occurs at (kF a) = 0 [15, 16]. Some integrals
used are listed in the Appendix for reference.
Using Eq. (21) for ũk and ṽk , we evaluate Eq. (14,
15) and Eq. (19, 20). In Fig. 1 we plot the fraction
of condensation in the gas, as a function of the dimensionless parameter (kF a)−1 . With either choice of λk ,
the fraction goes to one in the BEC limit (kF a)−1 ≫ 1.
Notice that C † C /N is an appreciably higher fraction
than C ′† C ′ /N , showing a dominant condensation of
atoms into the pair wave function defined in (12).


The expectation value of the commutator h C, C † i as
a function of (kF a)−1 is shown in Fig. 2. Again both
definitions of λk give unity in the BEC limit, but Eq.
(15) is always closer to one than Eq. (20).
Next we calculate the factor χN +1 /χN . By solving
Eq. (9) numerically for λk and λ′k , we obtain the ratios
χN +1 /χN and χ′N +1 /χ′N from Eq. (8). These ratios are
shown in Fig. 3 as a function of (kF a)−1 . We see that
χN +1 /χN is closer to one throughout the transition region. Together with the tests based on expectation values
above, λk defined Eq. (13) seems to be a more suitable
choice for the bosonic description of paired atoms.
Our calculations indicate an interesting region roughly
at −2 . (kF a)−1 . 2 where Cooper pairs transit from being non-bosonic to bosonic. Note that it does not require

CONCLUSION

To conclude, three indicators were used to quantify
the bosonic characters of a Cooper
 pair
 in an interacting Fermi gas : (a) hC † Ci, (b) h C, C † i, (c) χN +1 /χN .
Two different definitions of a Cooper pair were examined,
λ′n ∝ ṽn /ũn and λn ∝ ũ∗n ṽn . Our calculations suggest
that the latter one provides a better description of the
Cooper pairs as bosonic particles. Moreover, as the fraction of composite particles goes to one in the BEC limit,
the gas is basically in its simplest single mode. It appears
that using either one of the two definitions makes little

kF ) of two different Cooper pair wave functions, λk ∼ ũk ṽk

limit, two definitions differ significantly, while in (c) the BEC
limit, two definitions overlap (see text).

differences in the strong coupling regime (kF a)−1 ≥ 1.
This is consistent with the results in Ref. [11], in which
the authors addressed the similarity of both definitions.
As shown in Fig. 4, the difference between (13) and (18)
on the BCS side is that, the former only takes into account of a few momentum states on the Fermi surface,
whereas the latter one takes the average of all states inside the Fermi sphere. In a weakly interacting gas, only
atoms lying on the Fermi surface interact effectively, the
composite particle based on (13) would thus be more
bosonic since it takes into account the dominant correlated states. In the deep BEC limit, the Fermi sphere is
totally smeared out, and either choice of λn would weigh
different momentum states on an almost equal footage,
resulting in the merge of two different pictures.
If the system is not in the BEC limit, we have shown
that the bosonic character of a Cooper pair depends on
how the pair wave function is defined. Our work here
is an attempt to identify what definition is more effective to reveal a Cooper pair as a boson. From an experimental point of view, it is interesting to search for
observables associated with C or C ′ , so that one can
probe the the quantum statistics of Cooper pairs directly.
We also remark that our method can in principle be extended to nonuniform systems. However, the coefficients
ũn and ṽn , which are calculated from the natural orbits

5
[18, 19], do not have closed forms for analytical discussions. The question how a trapping potential affects the
bosonic properties of Cooper pairs is an open problem
for future studies.

The integrals are expressed in terms of K and E, which
are respectively the complete elliptic integral of the first
and second kind. We also need Pn , Legendre function of
the first kind of degree n.
