Abstract
We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact
quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described
by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object
(called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly
noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions.
In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category, namely the category of 'quantum families of
smooth isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan.
We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a
noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give
explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and
noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double
torus defined in [11] as the universal quantum group of holomorphic
isometries of the noncommutative torus.

Introduction

Since the formulation of quantum automorphism groups by Wang ([15],
[16]), following suggestions of Alain Connes, many interesting examples of
such quantum groups, particularly the quantum permutation groups of finite
sets and finite graphs, have been extensively studied by a number of mathematicians (see, e.g. [1], [2], [17] and references therein), who have also found
applications to and interaction with areas like free probability and subfactor
theory. The underlying basic principle of defining a quantum automorphism
group corresponding to some given mathematical structure (for example, a

finite set, a graph, a C ∗ or von Neumann algebra) consists of two steps :
first, to identify (if possible) the group of automorphisms of the structure as
a universal object in a suitable category, and then, try to look for the universal object in a similar but bigger category by replacing groups by quantum
groups of appropriate type. However, most of the work done so far concern
some kind of quantum automorphism groups of a 'finite' structure, for example, of finite sets or finite dimensional matrix algebras. It is thus quite
natural to try to extend these ideas to the 'infinite' or 'continuous' mathematical structures, for example classical and noncommutative manifolds. In
the present article, we have made an attempt to formulate and study the
quantum analogues of the groups of Riemannian isometries, which play a
very important role in the classical differential geometry. The group of Riemannian isometries of a compact Riemannian manifold M can be viewed as
the universal object in the category of all compact metrizable groups acting
on M , with smooth and isometric action. Therefore, to define the quantum
isometry group, it is reasonable to consider a category of compact quantum
groups which act on the manifold (or more generally, on a noncommutative
manifold given by spectral triple) in a 'nice' way, preserving the Riemannian
structure in some suitable sense, to be precisely formulated. In this article,
we have given a definition of such 'smooth and isometric' action by a compact quantum group on a (possibly noncommutative) manifold, extending
the notion of smooth and isometric action by a group on a classical manifold. Indeed, the meaning of isometric action is nothing but that the action
should commute with the 'Laplacian' coming from the spectral triple, and
we should mention that this idea was already present in [2], though only in
the context of a finite metric space or a finite graph. The universal object
in the category of such quantum groups, if it exists, should be thought of
as the quantum analogue of the group of isometries, and we have been able
to prove its existence under some regularity assumptions, all of which can
be verified for a general compact connected Riemannian manifold as well
as the standard examples of noncommutative manifolds. Motivated by the
ideas of Woronowicz and Soltan, we actually consider a bigger category. The
isometry group of a classical manifold, viewed as a compact metrizable space
(forgetiing the group structure), can be seen to be the universal object of a
category whose object-class consists of subsets (not necessarily subgroups)
of the set of smooth isometries of the manifold. Then it can be proved
that this universal compact set has a canonical group structure. A natural
quantum analogue of this has been formulated by us, called the category of
'quantum families of smooth isometries'. The underlying C ∗ -algebra of the
quantum isometry group has been identified with its universal object and
2

moreover, it is shown to be equipped with a canonical coproduct making it
into a compact quantum group.
We believe that a detailed study of quantum isometry groups will not
only give many new and interesting examples of compact quantum groups,
it will also contribute to the understanding of quantum group covariant
spectral triples. In fact, we have made some progress in this direction already
by constructing a spectral triple (which is often closely related to the original
spectral triple) on the Hilbert space of forms which is equivriant with respect
to a canonical unitary representation of the quantum isometry group.
In a companion article [3] with J. Bhowmick, we provide explicit computations of quantum isometry groups of a few classical and noncommutative
manifolds. However, we briefly quote some of main results of [3] in the
present article. One interesting observation is that the quantum isometry
group of the noncommutative two-torus Aθ (with the canonical spectral
triple) is (as a C ∗ algebra) a direct sum of two commutative and two noncommutative tori, and contains as a quantum subgroup (which is universal for certain class of isometric actions called holomorphic isometries) the
'quantum double-torus' discovered and studied by Hajac and Masuda ([11]).

2.1

Definition of the quantum isometry group
Isometry groups of classical manifolds

We begin with a well-known characterization of the isometry group of a (classical) compact Riemannian manifold. Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian
manifold and let Ω1 = Ω1 (M ) be the space of smooth one-forms, which has
a right Hilbert-C ∞ (M )-module structure given by the C ∞ (M )-valued inner
product << *, * >> defined by
<< ω, η >> (m) =< ω(m), η(m) > |m ,
∗ M at
where < *, * > |m is the Riemannian metric on the cotangent space Tm
1
the point m ∈ M . The Riemannian volume form allows us to make Ω a preHilbert space, and we denote its completion by H1 . Let H0 = L2 (M, dvol)
and consider the de-Rham differential d as an unbounded linear map from
H0 to H1 , with the natural domain C ∞ (M ) ⊂ H0 , and also denote its closure
by d. Let L := −d∗ d. The following identity can be verified by direct and
easy computation using the local coordinates :

(∂L)(φ, ψ) ≡ L(φ̄ψ)−L(φ̄)ψ−φ̄L(ψ) = 2 << dφ, dψ >> for φ, ψ ∈ C ∞ (M ) (∗).

Proposition 2.1 A smooth map γ : M → M is a Riemannian isometry if
and only if γ commutes with L in the sense that L(f ◦ γ) = (L(f )) ◦ γ for
all f ∈ C ∞ (M ).
Proof :
If γ commutes with L then from the identity (*) we get for m ∈ M and
φ, ψ ∈ C ∞ (M ) :
< dφ|γ(m) , dψ|γ(m) > |γ(m)
= << dφ, dψ >> (γ(m))

∗
∗ M is an isometry. Thus, γ is a

Riemannian isometry.
Conversely, if γ is an isometry, both the maps induced by γ on H0 and
H1 , i.e. Uγ0 : H0 → H0 given by Uγ0 (f ) = f ◦ γ and Uγ1 : H1 → H1 given
by Uγ1 (f dφ) = (f ◦ γ)d(φ ◦ γ) are unitaries. Moreover, d ◦ Uγ0 = Uγ1 ◦ d on
C ∞ (M ) ⊂ H0 . From this, it follows that L = −d∗ d commutes with Uγ0 . ✷
Now let us consider a compact metrizable (i.e. second countable) space
Y with a continuous map θ : M × Y → M . We abbreviate θ(m, y) as ym
and denote by ξy the map M ∋ m 7→ ym. Let α : C(M ) → C(M ) ⊗ C(Y ) ∼
=
C(M × Y ) be the map given by α(f )(m, y) := f (ym) for y ∈ Y , m ∈ M
and f ∈ C(M ). For a state φ on C(Y ), denote by αφ the map (id ⊗ φ) ◦ α :
C(M ) → C(M ). We shall also denote by C the subspace of C(M ) ⊗ C(Y )
generated by elements of the form α(f )(1 ⊗ ψ), f ∈ C(M ), ψ ∈ C(Y ). Since
C(M ) and C(Y ) are commutative algebras, it is easy to see that C is a
∗-subalgebra of C(M ) ⊗ C(Y ). Then we have the following

Theorem 2.2 (i) C is norm-dense in C(M ) ⊗ C(Y ) if and only if for every
y ∈ Y , ξy is one-to-one.
(ii) The map ξy is C ∞ for every y ∈ Y if and only if αφ (C ∞ (M )) ⊆ C ∞ (M )
for all φ.
(iii) Under the hypothesis of (ii), each ξy is also an isometry if and only if
4

αφ commutes with (L − λ)−1 for all state φ and all λ in the resolvent of L
(equivalently, αφ commutes with the Laplacian L on C ∞ (M )).
Proof :
(i) First, assume that ξy is one-to-one for all y. By Stone-Weirstrass Theorem, it is enough to show that C separates points. Take (m1 , y1 ) 6= (m2 , y2 )
in M × Y . If y1 6= y2 , we can choose ψ ∈ C(Y ) which separates y1 and y2 ,
hence (1 ⊗ ψ) ∈ C separates (m1 , y1 ) and (m2 , y2 ). So, we can consider the
case when y1 = y2 = y (say), but m1 6= m2 . By injectivity of ξy , we have
ym1 6= ym2 , so there exists f ∈ C(M ) such that f (ym1 ) 6= f (ym2 ), i.e.
α(f )(m1 , y) 6= α(f )(m2 , y). This proves the density of C.
For the converse, we argue as in the proof of Proposition 3.3 of [14].
Assume that C is dense in C(M ) ⊗ C(Y ), and let y ∈ Y , m1 , m2 ∈ M such
that ym1 = ym2 . That is, α(f )(1 ⊗ ψ)(m1 , y) = α(f )(1 ⊗ ψ)(m2 , y) for all
f ∈ C(M ), ψ ∈ C(Y ). By the density of C we get χ(m1 , y) = χ(m2 , y) for
all χ ∈ C(M × Y ), so (m1 , y) = (m2 , y), i.e. m1 = m2 .
(ii) The 'if part' of (ii) follows by considering the states corresponding to
point evaluation, i.e. C(Y ) ∋ ψ 7→ ψ(y), y ∈ Y . For the converse, we note
that an arbitrary
Borel measure μ on Y
R state φ corresponds to a regular
R
so that φ(h) = hdμ, and thus, αφ (f )(m) = f (ym)dμ(y) for f ∈ C(M ).
From this, by interchanging differentiation and integation (which is allowed
by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, since μ is a finite measure) we can
prove that αφ (f ) is C ∞ whenever f is so.
The assertion (iii) follows from Proposition 2.1 in a straghtforward way.
✷
Let us recall a few well-known facts about the Laplacian L, viewed as a
negative self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space L2 (M, dvol). It is known
(see [12] and references therein) that L has compact resolvents and all its
eigenvectors belong to C ∞ (M ). Moreover, it follows from the Sobolev Embedding Theorem that
\
Dom(Ln ) = C ∞ (M ).
n≥1

Let {eij , j = 1, ..., di ; i = 1, 2, ...} be the set of (normalised) eigenvectors of
L, where eij ∈ C ∞ (M ) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λi ,
|λ1 | < |λ2 | < .... We have the following:
Lemma 2.3 The complex linear span of {eij } is norm-dense in C(M ).
Proof :
This is a consequence of the asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues λi , as
5

well as the uniform bound of the eigenfunctions eij . For example, it is
known ([9],Theorem 1.2) that there exist constants C, C ′ such that keij k∞ ≤

n−1
C|λi | 4 , di ≤ C ′ |λT

for f ∈ C ∞ (M ) ⊆ k≥1 Dom(Lk ), we write f as an a-priori L2 -convergent
P

series ij fij eij (fij ∈ C), and observe that
|fij |2 |λi |2k < ∞ for every
P
k ≥ 1. Choose and fix sufficiently large k such that i≥0 |λi |n−1−2k < ∞,
which is possible due to the well-known Weyl asymptotics of eigenvalues of
L. Now, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the estimate for di , we have

Thus, the series ij fij eij converges to f in sup-norm, so Sp{eij , j = 1, 2, ..., di ; i =
1, 2, ...} is dense in sup-norm in C ∞ (M ), hence in C(M ) as well. ✷
Let us denote Sp{eij , j = 1, ..., di ; i ≥ 1} by A∞
0 from now on. We shall
now show that C ∞ (M ) can be replaced by the smaller subspace A∞
0 in
Theorem 2.2. We need a lemma for this, which will be useful later on too.
Lemma 2.4 Let H1 , H2 be Hilbert spaces and for i = 1, 2, let Li be (possibly
unbounded) self-adjoint operator on Hi with compact resolvents, and let Vi
be the linear span of eigenvectors of Li . Moreover, assume that there is an
eigenvalue of Li for which the eigenspace is one-dimensional, say spanned by
a unit vector ξi . Let Ψ be a linear map from V1 to V2 such that L2 Ψ = ΨL1
and Ψ(ξ1 ) = ξ2 . Then we have
hξ2 , Ψ(x)i = hξ1 , xi ∀x ∈ V1 .

(1)

Proof:
By hypothesis on Ψ, it is clear that there is a common eigenvalue, say λ0 , of
L1 and L2 , with the eigenvectors ξ1 and ξ2 respectively.
Let us write the set
S
of eigenvalues of Li as a disjoint union {λ0 } Λi (i = 1, 2), and let
L the corresponding orthogonal decomposition of Vi be given by Vi = Cξi λ∈Λi Viλ ≡
Cξi ⊕ Vi′ , say, where Viλ denotes the eigenspace of Li corresponding to the
eigenvalue λ. By assumption, Ψ maps V1λ to V2λ whenever λ is an eigenvalue
of L2 , i.e. V2λ 6= {0}, and otherwise it maps V1λ into {0}. Thus, Ψ(V1′ ) ⊆ V2′ .
Now, (1) is obviously satisfied for x = ξ1 , so it is enough to prove (1)
T for all
x ∈ V1′ . But we have hξ, xi = 0 for x ∈ V1′ , and since Ψ(x) ∈ V2′ = V2 {ξ2 }⊥ ,
it follows that hξ2 , Ψ(x)i = 0 = hξ1 , xi. ✷

Lemma 2.5 Let Y and α be as in Theorem 2.2. Then the following are
equivalent.
(a) For every y ∈ Y , ξy is smooth isometric.
∞
(b) For every state φ on C(Y ), we have αφ (A∞
0 ) ⊆ A0 , and αφ L = Lαφ on
∞
A0 .
Proof:
We prove only the nontrivial implication (b) ⇒ (a). Assume (b) that αφ
leaves A∞
0 invariant and commutes with L on it, for every state φ. To
prove that α is a smooth isometric action, it is enough (see the proof of
Theorem 2.2) to prove that αy (A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ for all y ∈ Y , where αy (f ) :=
(id⊗evy )(f ) = f ◦ξy , evy being the evaluation at the point y. Let M1 , ..., Mk
be the connected components of the compact manifold M . Thus, the Hilbert
space L2 (M, dvol) admits an orthogonal decomposition ⊕ki=1 L2 (Mi , dvol),
and the Laplacian L is of the form ⊕i Li where Li denotes the Laplacian on
Mi . Since each Mi is connected, we have Ker(Li ) = Cχi , where χi is the
constant function on Mi equal to 1. Now, we note that for fixed y and i,
the image of Mi under the continuous function ξy must be mapped into a
component, say Mj . Thus, by applying Lemma 2.4 with H1 = L2 (Mi ),H2 =
L2 (Mj ), Ψ = ξy and the L2 -continuity of the map f 7→ αy (f ) = f ◦ ξy , we
have

for all f in the linear span of
R eigenvectors ofRLi , hence (by density) for all f
in L2 (Mi ). It follows that M αy (f )dvol = M f dvol for all f ∈ L2 (M ), in
particular for all f ∈ C(M ). Since αy is a ∗-homomorphism on C(M ), we
have

αy (f g)dvol =

for all f, g ∈ C(M ). Thus, αy extends to an isometry on L2 (M ), to be
denoted by the same notation, which by our assumption commutes with the
n
self-adjoint operator L on the core A∞
0 , and hence αy commutes with L for
n
all n. In particular it leaves invariant the domains of each L , which implies
αy (A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ . ✷
In view of the fact that the set of isometries of M , denoted by ISO(M ),
is a compact second countable (i.e. compact metrizable) group, we see that
ISO(M ) is the maximal compact second countable group acting on M such
that the action is smooth and isometric. In other words, if we consider a
catogory whose objects are compact metrizable groups acting smoothly and
7

isometrically on M , and morphisms are the group homomorphisms commuting with the actions on M , then ISO(M ) (with its canonical action on
M ) is the initial object of this cateogory. However, one can take a more
general viewpoint and consider the category of compact metrizable spaces
Y equipped with a continuous map θ : M × Y → M satisfying (i)-(iii) of
Theorem 2.2, or equivalently, the pair of commutative unital C ∗ -algebras
B = C(Y ) and a unital C ∗ -homomorphism α : C(M ) → C(M ) → B satisfying the conditions (i)-(iii). The set of isometries ISO(M ) (as a topological
space) can be identified with the universal object of this category, and then
one can prove that it has a group structure.
It is quite natural to formulate a quantum analogue of the above, by considering, in the spirit of Woronowicz and Soltan (see [19] and [13]), 'quantum
families of isometries', which can be defined to be a pair (B, α) where B is
a (not necessarily commutative) C ∗ -algebra and α : C(M ) → C(M ) ⊗ B is
unital C ∗ -homomorhism satisfying (i)-(iii) of Theorem 2.2, i.e. the linear
span of α(C(M ))(1 ⊗ B) (which is not necessarily a ∗-subalgebra any more,
B being possibly noncommutative) is norm-dense in C(M ) ⊗ B and for every state φ on B, the map αφ keeps C ∞ (M ) invariant and commutes with
the Laplacian L. The morphisms of this category are obvious. We shall
prove that this category has a universal object, and this universal object
can be equipped with a canonical quantum group structure. This will define
the quantum isometry group of a manifold. However, we shall go beyond
classical manifolds and define quantum isometry group QISO(A∞ , H, D)
for a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D), with A∞ being unital, and satisfying certain assumptions. To this end, we need to carefully formulate the notion
of Laplacian in noncommutative geometry, which is the goal of the next
subsection.

2.2

Laplacian in noncommutative geometry

Given a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D), we recall from [10] and [6] the construction of the space of one-forms. We have a derivation from A∞ to the
A∞ -A∞ bimodule B(H) given by a 7→ [D, a]. This induces a bimodule
morphism π from Ω1 (A∞ ) (the bimodule of universal one-forms on A∞ ) to
B(H), such that π(δ(a)) = [D, a], where δ : A∞ → Ω1 (A∞ ) denotes the
universal derivation map. We set Ω1D ≡ Ω1D (A∞ ) := Ω1 (A∞ )/Ker(π) ∼
=
1
∞
π(Ω (A )) ⊆ B(H). Assume that the spectral triple is of compact type
and has a finite dimension in the sense of Connes ([6]), i.e. there is some
p > 0 such that the operator |D|−p (interpreted as the inverse of the restriction of |D|p on the closure of its range, which has a finite co-dimension
8

since D has compact resolvents) has finite nonzero Dixmier trace, denoted
by T rω (where ω is some suitable Banach limit, see, e.g. [6], [10]). Consider the canonical 'volume form' τ coming from the Dixmier trace, i.e.
1
−p ). Let us at this
τ : B(H) → C defined by τ (A) := T rω (|D|
−p ) T rω (A|D|
point assume that the spectral triple is QC ∞ , i.e. A∞ and {[D, a], a ∈ A∞ }
are contained in the domains of all powers of the derivation [|D|, *]. Under
this assumption, τ is a positive faithful trace on the C ∗ -subalgebra generated by A∞ and {[D, a] a ∈ A∞ }, and the GNS Hilbert space L2 (A∞ , τ ) is
0 . Similarly, we equip Ω1 with a semi-inner product given by
denoted by HD

The map dD : HD → HD given by dD (*) = [D, *] is an unbounded densely
defined linear map. Let us assume the following:
Assumption(i) (a) dD is closable (the closure is denoted again by dD );
(b) A∞ ⊆ Dom(L), where L := −d∗D dD and A∞ is viewed as a dense sub0 ;
space of HD
At this point, let us show that this assumption is valid under a very
natural condition on the spectral triple.
Lemma 2.6 Suppose that for every element a ∈ A∞ , the map R ∋ t 7→
αt (X) := exp(itD)Xexp(−itD) is differentiable at t = 0 in the normtopology of B(H), where X = a or [D, a]. Then the assumption (i) is satisfied. Moreover, in this case, L maps A∞ into the weak closure of A∞ in
0 ).
B(HD
Proof :
We first observe that τ (αt (A)) = τ (A) for all t and for all A ∈ B(H), since
exp(itD) commutes with |D|−p . If moreover, A belongs to the domain of
→ i[D, A] in operatornorm-differentiability (at t = 0) of αt , i.e. αt (A)−A
t
norm, then it follows from the property of the Dixmier trace that τ ([D, A]) =
τ (αt (A))−τ (A)
1
= 0. Now, since by assumption we have the normi limt→0
t
differentiability at t = 0 of αt (A) for A belonging to the ∗-subalgebra (say
B) generated by A∞ and [D, A∞ ], it follows that τ ([D, A]) = 0 ∀A ∈ B. Let
us now fix a, b, c ∈ A∞ and observe that
< a dD (b), dD (c) >
= τ ((a dD (b))∗ dD (c) >
= −τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ c]) + τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]c)
9

= τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]c),
using the fact that τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ c]) = 0. This implies
1

| < a dD (b), dD (c) > | ≤ k[D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]kτ (c∗ c) 2 = k[D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]kkck2 ,

0 . This proves that
where kck2 = τ (c∗ c) 2 denotes the L2 -norm of c ∈ HD
∗
a dD (b) belongs to the domain of dD for all a, b ∈ A∞ , so in particular
d∗D is dense, i.e. dD is closable. Moreover, taking a = 1, we see that
dD (A∞ ) ⊆ Dom(d∗D ), or in other words, A∞ ⊆ Dom(d∗D dD ). This proves
(i)(a) and (i)(b). The last sentence in the statement of the lemma can be
proven along the line of Theorem 2.9, page 129, [10]. ✷
We need few more assumptions on the operator L to define the quantum
isometry group.

Assumption (ii): L has compact resolvents,
Assumption(iii): L(A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ ;
Assumption(iv): Each eigenvector of L (which has a discrete spectrum,
hence a complete set of eigenvectors) belongs to A∞ ;
Assumption(v)('connectedness assumption'): the kernel of L is one-dimensional,
0 .
spanned by the identity 1 of A∞ , viewed as a unit vector in HD
We call L the noncommutative Laplacian and Tt the noncommutative heat
semigroup. We summarize some simple observations in form of the following

have L(x∗ ) = (L(x))∗ .
0 into A∞ for all t > 0, the the assumption
(b) If Tt := exp(tL) maps HD
(iv) is satisfied.
Proof :
It follows by simple calculation using the facts that τ is a trace and dD (x∗ ) =
−(dD (x))∗ that
τ (L(x∗ )∗ y)
= −τ (dD (x)dD (y)) = −τ (dD (y)dD (x)) = τ ((dD (y ∗ ))∗ dD (x))
= < y ∗ , L(x) >= τ (yL(x)) = τ (L(x)y),
0 (a) follows. To prove (b), we note
for all y ∈ A∞ . By density of A∞ in HD
0
that if x ∈ HD is an eigenvector of L, say L(x) = λx (λ ∈ C), then we have
Tt (x) = eλt x, hence x = e−λt Tt (x) ∈ A∞ . ✷

Since by assumption, L has a countable set of eigenvalues each with finite
multiplicity, let us denote them by λ0 = 0, λ1 , λ2 , ... with V0 = C 1, V1 , V2 , ...
be corresponding eigenspaces (finite dimensional), and for each i, let {eij , j =
1, ..., di } be an orthonormal basis of Vi . By Assumption (iv), Vi ⊆ A∞ for
each i, Vi is closed under ∗, and moreover, {e∗ij , j = 1, ..., di } is also an orthonormal basis for Vi , since τ (x∗ y) = τ (yx∗ ) for x, y ∈ A∞ . We also make
the following
Assumption (vi) The complex linear span of {eij , i = 0, 1, ...; j = 1, ..., di },
∞
say A∞
0 , is norm-dense in A .
Definition 2.8 We say that a spectral triple satisfying the assumptions (i)(vi) admissible.
Remark 2.9 We have just seen that classical spectral triple (A∞ = C ∞ (M ), H, D),
where M is compact connected spin manifold, H is the L2 space of square
integrable spinors and D is the Dirac operator, is indeed admissible in our
sense. Later on we shall discuss how we can weaken the connectedness
assumption as well, thus accommodating a general classical (commutative)
spectral triple in our set-up. Moreover, the standard examples of noncommutative spectral triples, e.g. those on Aθ , quantum Heisenberg manifold
etc., do belong to the admissible class.
Lemma 2.10 Let us assume that the spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) is admis∞

Definition and existence of the quantum isometry group

We begin by recalling the definition of compact quantum groups and their
actions from [18]. A compact quantum group is given by a pair (S, ∆), where
S is a unital separable C ∗ algebra equipped with a unital C ∗ -homomorphism
∆ : S → S ⊗ S (where ⊗ denotes the injective tensor product) satisfying
11

(ai) (∆ ⊗ id) ◦ ∆ = (id ⊗ ∆) ◦ ∆ (co-associativity), and
(aii) the linear span of ∆(S)(S ⊗ 1) and ∆(S)(1 ⊗ S) are norm-dense in
S ⊗ S.
It is well-known (see [18]) that there is a canonical dense ∗-subalgebra S0
of S, consisting of the matrix coefficients of the finite dimensional unitary
(co)-representations of S, and maps ǫ : S0 → C (co-unit) and κ : S0 → S0
(antipode) defined on S0 which make S0 a Hopf ∗-algebra.
We say that the compact quantum group (S, ∆) acts on a unital C ∗
algebra B, if there is a unital C ∗ -homomorphism α : B → B ⊗ S satisfying
the following :
(bi) (α ⊗ id) ◦ α = (id ⊗ ∆) ◦ α, and
(bii) the linear span of α(B)(1 ⊗ S) is norm-dense in B ⊗ S.

Let us now recall the concept of universal quantum groups as in [17],
[15] and references therein. We shall use most of the terminologies of [15],
e.g. Woronowicz C ∗ -subalgebra, Woronowicz C ∗ -ideal etc, however with
the exception that we shall call the Woronowicz C ∗ algebras just compact
quantum groups, and not use the term compact quantum groups for the
dual objects as done in [15]. For Q ∈ GLn (C), let Au (Q) denote the universal compact quantum group generated by uij , i, j = 1, ..., n satisfying the
relations
uu∗ = In = u∗ u, u′ QuQ−1 = In = QuQ−1 u′ ,
 ̃ is
where u = ((uij )), u′ = ((uji )) and u = ((u∗ij )). The coproduct, say ∆,

 ̃ ij ) =
∆(u

k

We refer the reader to [17] for a detailed discussion on the structure and classification of such quantum groups. Let us denote by Ui the quantum group
Adi (I), where di is dimension of the subspace Vi . We fix a representation
P
(i)
βi : Vi → Vi ⊗Ui of Ui on the Hilbert space Vi , given by βi (eij ) = k eik ⊗ukj ,
(i)

for j = 1, ..., di , where u(i) ≡ ukj are the generators of Ui as discussed before.
Thus, both u(i) and u ̄(i) are unitaries. It follows from [15] that the representations βi canonically induce a representation β = ∗i βi of the free product
U := ∗i Ui (which is a compact quantum group, see [15] for the details) on
0 , such that the restriction of β on V coincides with β
the Hilbert space HD
i
i
for all i.

12

In view of the characterization of smooth isometric action on a classical
manifold, we make the following definitions.
Definition 2.11 A quantum family of smooth isometries of a noncommutative manifold A∞ (or, more precisely on the corresponding spectral triple)
is a pair (S, α) where S is a separable unital C ∗ -algebra, α : A → A ⊗ S
(where A denotes the C ∗ algebra obtained by completing A∞ in the norm of
0 )) is a unital C ∗ -homomorphism, satisfying the following:
B(HD

(a) Sp α(A)(1 ⊗ S) = A ⊗ S,
∞
(b) αφ := (id ⊗ φ) ◦ α maps A∞
0 into itself and commutes with L on A0 ,
for every state φ on S.
In case the C ∗ -algebra S has a coproduct ∆ such that (S, ∆) is a compact
quantum group and α is an action of (S, ∆) on A, we say that (S, ∆) acts
smoothly and isometrically on the noncommutative manifold.
Fix a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D). Consider the category Q with the
object-class consisting of all quantum families of isometries (S, α) of the
given noncommutative manifold, and the set of morphisms Mor((S, α), (S ′ , α′ ))
being the set of unital C ∗ -homomorphisms φ : S → S ′ satisfying (id⊗φ)◦α =
α′ . We also consider another category Q′ whose objects are triplets (S, ∆, α)
where (S, ∆) is a compact quantum group acting smoothly and isometrically
on the given noncommutative manifold, with α being the corresponding action. The morphisms are the homomorphisms of compact quantum groups
which are also morphisms of the underlying quantum families. The forgetful functor F : Q′ → Q is clearly faithful, and we can view F (Q′ ) as a
subcategory of Q.
Let us assume from now on that the spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) is admissible. Our aim is to prove the existence of a universal object in Q. We shall
also prove that the (unique upto isomorphism) universal object belongs to
F (Q′ ), and its pre-image in Q′ is a universal object in the category Q′ . To
this end, we need some preparatory results.
Lemma 2.12 Consider an admissible spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) and let
(S, α) be a quantum family of smooth isometries of the spectral triple. Moreover, assume that the action α is faithful in the sense that there is no proper
C ∗ -subalgebra S1 of S such that α(A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ ⊗ S1 . Then α̃ : A∞ ⊗ S →
A∞ ⊗ S defined by α̃(a ⊗ b) : α(a)(1 ⊗ b) extends to an S-linear unitary on
0 ⊗ S, denoted again by α̃. Moreover, we can find a
the Hilbert S-module HD
∗
C -isomorphism φ : U/I → S between S and a quotient of U by a C ∗ -ideal

13

0 , where Π
I of U, such that α = (id ⊗ φ) ◦ (id ⊗ ΠI ) ◦ β on A∞ ⊆ HD
I
denotes the quotient map from U to U/I.
If, furthermore, there is a compact quantum group structure on S given
by a coproduct ∆ such that (S, ∆, α) is an object in Q′ , the map α : A∞ →
A∞ ⊗S extends to a unitary representation (denoted again by α) of the com0 . In this case, the ideal I is a Woronowicz
pact quantum group (S, ∆) on HD
∗
∗
C -ideal and the C -isomorphism φ : U/I → S is a morphism of compact
quantum groups.

Proof :
Let ω be any state on S. Since the action α : A∞ → A∞ ⊗ S is smooth
and isometric, we conclude by Lemma 2.10 that τ (αω (x)) = τ (x)ω(1) for all
x ∈ A. Since ω is arbitrary, we have (τ ⊗ id)α(x) = τ (x)1S for all x ∈ A.
So, < α(x), α(y) >S =< x, y > 1S , where < *, * >S denotes the S-valued
0 ⊗ S. This proves that α̃ defined by
inner product of the Hilbert module HD
∞
α̃(x ⊗ b) := α(x)(1 ⊗ b) (x ∈ A , b ∈ S) extends to an S-linear isometry on
0 ⊗ S. Moreover, since α(A∞ )(1 ⊗ S) is norm-dense
the Hilbert S-module HD
in Ā ⊗ S, it is clear that the S-linear span of the range of α(A∞ ) is dense in
0 ⊗ S, or in other words, the isometry α̃ has a dense
the Hilbert module HD
range, so it is a unitary.
Since αω leaves each Vi invariant, it is clear that α maps Vi into Vi ⊗ S
(i)
for each i. Let vkj (j, k = 1, ..., di ) be the elements of S such that α(eij ) =
P
(i)
(i)
k eik ⊗ vkj . Note that vi := ((vkj )) is a unitary in Mdi (C) ⊗ S. Moreover,
(i)

the ∗-subalgebra generated by all {vkj , i, j, k ≥ 1} must be dense in S by
the assumption of faithfulness.
We have already remarked that {e∗ij } is also an orthonormal basis of
Vi , and since α, being a C ∗ -action on A, is ∗-preserving, we have α(e∗ij ) =
P
(i)∗
(i)∗
(α(eij ))∗ = k e∗ik ⊗ vkj , and therefore ((vkj )) is also unitary. By univer(i)

(i)

sality of Ui , there is a C ∗ -homomorphism from Ui to S sending ukj to vkj ,
and by definition of the free product, this induces a C ∗ -homomorphism, say
Π, from U onto S, so that U/I ∼
= S, where I := Ker(Π).
In case S has a coproduct ∆ making it into a compact quantum group
and α is a quantum group action, it is easy to see that the subalgebra of
P (i)
(i)
(i)
(i)
S generated by vkj is a Hopf algebra, with ∆(vkj ) = l vkl ⊗ vlj . From
this, it follows that Π is Hopf-algebra morphism, hence I is a Woronowicz
C ∗ -ideal. ✷
Before we state and prove the main theorem, let us note the following
14

elementary fact about C ∗ -algebras.
Lemma 2.13 Let C be a C ∗ algebra and F be a nonempty collection of
C ∗ -ideals (closed two-sided ideals) of C. Then for any x ∈ C, we have
sup kx + Ik = kx + I0 k,
I∈F

where I0 denotes the intersection of all I in F and kx + Ik = inf {kx −
yk : y ∈ I} denotes the norm in C/I.
Proof :
It is clear that supI∈F kx + Ik defines a norm on C/I0 , which is in fact a
C ∗ -norm since each of the quotient norms k * +Ik is so. Thus the lemma
follows from the uniqueness of C ∗ norm on the C ∗ algebra C/I0 . ✷
Theorem 2.14 For any admissible spectral triple (A∞ , H, D), the category
Q of quantum families of smooth isometries has a universal (initial) object,
say (G, α0 ). Moreover, G has a coproduct ∆0 such that (G, ∆0 ) is a compact quantum group and (G, ∆0 , α0 ) is a universal object in the category Q′
of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on the given
spectral triple. The action α0 is faithful.
Proof :
0 to
Recall the C ∗ -algebra U considered before, and the map β from HD
0
∞
∞
HD ⊗U. By our definition of β, it is clear that β(A0 ) ⊆ A0 ⊗alg U. However,
β is only a linear map (unitary) but not necessarily a ∗-homomorphism. We
shall construct the universal object as a suitable quotient of U. Let F
be the collection of all those C ∗ -ideals I of U such that the composition
∗
∞
ΓI := (id ⊗ ΠI ) ◦ β : A∞
0 → A0 ⊗alg (U/I) extends to a C -homomorphsim
from Ā to Ā ⊗ (U/I), where ΠI denotes the quotient map from U onto
U/I. This collection is nonempty, since the trivial one-dimensional C ∗ algebra C gives an object in Q and by Lemma 2.12 we do get a member of
F. Now, let I0 be the intersection of all ideals in F. We claim that I0 is
again a member of F. Since any C ∗ -homomorphism is contractive, we have
kΓI (a)k ≡ kβ(a) + Ā ⊗ Ik ≤ kak for all a ∈ A∞
0 and I ∈ F. By Lemma
2.13, we see that kΓI0 (a)k ≤ kak for a ∈ A∞
,
so ΓI0 extends to a norm0
∞
contractive map on Ā by the density of A0 in Ā. Moreover, for a, b ∈ Ā
and for I ∈ F, we have ΓI (ab) = ΓI (a)ΓI (b). Since ΠI = ΠI ◦ ΠI0 , we can
rewrite the homomorphic property of ΓI as
ΓI0 (ab) − ΓI0 (a)ΓI0 (b) ∈ Ā ⊗ (I/I0 ).
15

Since this holds for every I ∈ F, we conclude that ΓI0 (ab) − ΓI0 (a)ΓI0 (b) ∈
T
I∈F Ā⊗(I/I0 ) = (0), i.e. ΓI0 is a homomorphism. In a similar way, we can
show that it is a ∗-homomorphism. Since each βi is a unitary representation
of the compact quantum group Ui on the finite dimensional space Vi , it
follows that βi (Vi )(1 ⊗ Ui ) is total in Vi ⊗ Ui . In particular, for any vi ∈ Vi
(i arbitrary), the element vi ⊗ 1Ui = vi ⊗ 1U belongs to the linear span of
βi (Vi )(1⊗Ui ) ⊂ β(Vi )(1⊗U). Thus, A∞
0 ⊗1U is contained in the linear span of
∞ ⊗1
is
linearly
spanned by ΓI0 (A∞
β(A∞
)(1⊗U)
and
hence
A
U
0 )(1⊗U/I0 ).
0

I0

By the norm-denisty of A∞
0 in A and the contractivity of the quotient map,
it follows that A ⊗ U /I0 is the closed linear span of ΓI0 (A∞
0 )(1 ⊗ U/I0 ).
This completes the proof that (U/I0 , ΓI0 ) is indeed an object of Q.
We now show that G := U/I0 is a universal object in Q. To see this, consider any object (S, α) of Q. Without loss of generality we can assume the
action to be faithful, since otherwise we can replace S by the C ∗ -subalgebra
(i)
generated by the elements {vkj } appearing in the proof of Lemma 2.12. But
by Lemma 2.12 we can further assume that S is isomorphic with U/I for
some I ∈ F. Since I0 ⊆ I, we have a C ∗ -homomorphism from U/I0 onto
U/I, sending x + I0 to x + I, which is clearly a morphism in the category Q.
This is indeed the unique such morphism, since it is uniquely determined on
(i)
the dense subalgebra generated by {ukj + I0 , i, j, k ≥ 1} of G.
To construct the coproduct on G = U/I0 , we first consider α(2) = (ΓI0 ⊗
id) ◦ ΓI0 : A → A ⊗ G ⊗ G. It is easy to verify that (G ⊗ G, α(2) ) is an object
in the category Q, so by the universality of (G, ΓI0 ), we have a unique unital
C ∗ -homomorphism ∆0 : G → G ⊗ G satisfying
(id ⊗ ∆0 ) ◦ ΓI0 (x) = α(2) (x) ∀x ∈ A.
Taking x = eij , we get

on the linear span of {ujk , i, j, k ≥ 1}, and hence on the whole of U. This
implies that ∆0 maps I0 = Ker(πI0 ) into Ker(πI0 ⊗πI0 ) = (I0 ⊗1+1⊗I0) ⊂
16

U ⊗ U. In other words, I0 is a Hopf C ∗ -ideal, and hence G = U/I0 has the
canonical compact quantum group structure as a quantum subgroup of U. It
is clear from the relation (2) that ∆0 coincides with the canonical coproduct
of the quantum subgroup U/I0 inherited from that of U. It is also easy to
see that the object (G, ∆0 , ΓI0 ) is universal in the category Q′ , using the fact
that (by Lemma 2.12) any compact quantum group (G, Φ) acting smoothly
and isometrically on the given spectral triple is isomorphic with a quantum
subgroup U/I, for some Hopf C ∗ -ideal I of U.
Finally, the faithfulness of α0 follows from the universality by standard
arguments which we briefly sketch. If G1 ⊂ G is a ∗-subalgebra of G such
that α0 (A) ⊆ A ⊗ G1 , it is easy to see that (G1 , ∆0 , α0 ) is also a universal
object, and by definition of universality of G it follows that there is a unique
morphism, say j, from G to G1 . But the map j ◦ i is a morphism from G to
itself, where i : G1 → G is the inclusion. Again by universality, we have that
j ◦ i = idG , so in particular, i is onto, i.e. G1 = G. ✷
Definition 2.15 We shall call the universal object (G, ∆0 ) obtained in the
theorem above the quantum isometry group of (A∞ , H, D) and denote it
by QISO(A∞ , H, D), or just QISO(A∞ ) (or sometimes QISO(Ā)) if the
spectral triple is understood from the context.
Remark 2.16 Assume that an admissible spectral
triple (A∞ , H, D) also
T
satisfies the condition (i) of Lemma 2.5, i.e.
Dom(Ln ) = A∞ . Let α :
A → A⊗S be a smooth isometric action on A∞ by a compact quantum group
S. We recall from the proof of Lemma 2.12 that the map α̃ from A ⊗ S to
0 ⊗ S, i.e.
itself extends to an S-linear unitary on the Hilbert S-module HD
0
α̃ can be viewed as a unitary in B(HD ) ⊗ S. Clearly, for any state φ on
0 ). Now, by the definition of a smooth
S, we have αφ = (id ⊗ φ)(α̃) ∈ B(HD
isometric action, the bounded operator αφ commutes with the self-adjoint
L. So, αφ must commute with Ln
operator L on A∞
0 , which is a core for T
for all n, and in particular keeps A∞ = n Dom(Ln ) invariant.

Remark 2.17 Let us now briefly indicate how one can weaken the hypothesis of connectedness. Such an extension of our results is desirable
to accommodate the classical spaces, including the finite sets and graphs,
in our framework. One possibile approach could be to consider the category of compact quantum group actions α which are not only 'smmoth' and
'isometric' in our sense, but also satisfy the τ -invariance condition, i.e.
(τ ⊗ id)(α(a)) = τ (a)1. It is easy to see that the connectedness assumption
has been used by us only to prove that the τ -invariance is automatic for
17

smooth isometric actions. Thus, if we work in the smaller cateogory of such
τ -invraiant actions only, the proof of Theorem 2.14 does go through and thus
we can prove the existence of a universal object, to be defined as the quantum
isometry group. It is easy to see that for the algebra of functions on a finite
set, with the spectral triple given by D = 0, this quantum isometry group
coincides with thw quantum permutation group defined by Wang.
Remark 2.18 It is easy to see how to extend our formulation and results
to spectral triples which are not necessarily of type II, i.e. when the trace
τ is replaced by some non-tracial positive functional. Indeed, our construction will go through in such a situation more or less verbatim, by replacing
the universal quantum groups Adi (I) by Adi (Qi ) for some suitable choice of
matrices Qi coming from the modularity property of τ .

2.4

Construction of quantum group-equivariant spectral triples

In this subsection, we shall briefly discuss the relevance of quantum isometry
group to the problem of constructing quantum group equivariant spectral
triples, which is important to understand the role of quantum groups in the
framework of noncommutative geometry. There has been a lot of activity
in this direction recently, see, for example, the articles by Chakraborty and
Pal ([5]), Connes ([7]), Landi et al ([8]) and the references therein. In the
classical situation, there exists a natural unitary representation of the isometry group G = ISO(M ) of a manifold M on the Hilbert space of forms, so
that the operator d + d∗ (where d is the de-Rham differential operator) commutes with the representation. Indeed, d+d∗ is also a Dirac operator for the
spectral triple given by the natural representation of C ∞ (M ) on the Hilbert
space of forms, so we have a canonical construction of G-equivariant spectral
triple. Our aim in this subsection is to generalize this to the noncommutative framework, by proving that dD + d∗D is equivariant with respect to a
canonical unitary representation on the Hilbert space of 'noncommutative
forms' (see, for example, [10] for a detailed discussion of such forms).
Consider an admissible spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) and moreover, make
the assumption of Lemma 2.6, i.e. assume that t 7→ eitD xe−itD is normdifferentiable at t = 0 for all x in the ∗-algebra B generated by A∞ and
[D, A∞ ].
Lemma 2.19 In the notation of Lemma 2.6, we have the following (where
b, c ∈ A∞ ):
1
(3)
d∗D (dD (b)c) = − (bL(c) − L(b)c − L(bc)) .
2
18

Proof:
Denote by χ(b, c) the right hand side of euqation (3) and fix any a ∈ A∞ .
Using the facts the the functional τ is a faithful trace on the ∗-algebra B,
L = −d∗D dD and that [D, X] = 0 for any X in B, we have,
τ (a∗ χ(b, c))
1
= − {τ (a∗ bL(c)) + τ (ca∗ L(b)) + τ (a∗ L(bc))}
2
1
=
{τ ([D, a∗ b][D, c]) − τ ([D, ca∗ ][D, b]) − τ ([D, a∗ ][D, bc])}
2
1
=
{τ (a∗ [D, b][D, c]) − τ ([D, c]a∗ [D, b]) − τ (c[D, a∗ ][D, b]) − τ ([D, a∗ ][D, b]c)}
2
= −τ ([D, a∗ ][D, b]c)
= τ ([D, a]∗ [D, b]c)
= hdD (a), dD (b)ci
= τ (a∗ (d∗D (dD (b)c))).
✷
From this, we get the following by a simple computation:
1
hadD (b), a′ dD (b′ )i = − τ (b∗ Ψ(a∗ a, b′ )),
2

(4)

for a, b, a′ , b′ ∈ A∞ , and where Ψ(x, y) := L(xy)−L(x)y +xL(y). Now, let us
denote the quantum isometry group of the given spectral triple (A∞ , H, D)
by (G, ∆, α). Let A0 denote the ∗-algebra generated by A∞
0 , G0 denote ∗algebra of G generated by matrix elements of irreducible representations.
Clearly, α : A0 → A0 ⊗alg G0 is a Hopf-algebraic action of G0 on A0 . Define
Ψ̃ : (A0 ⊗alg G0 ) × (A0 ⊗alg G0 ) → A0 ⊗alg G0 by
Ψ̃((x ⊗ q), (x′ ⊗ q ′ )) := Ψ(x, x′ ) ⊗ (qq ′ ).
It follows from the relation (L ⊗ id) ◦ α = α ◦ L on A0 that
Ψ̃(α(x), α(y)) = α(Ψ(x, y)).

(5)

We now define a linear map α(1) from the linear span of {adD (b) : a, b ∈ A0 }
1 ⊗ G by setting
to HD

P (1) (2)
where for any x ∈ A0 we write α(x) = i xi ⊗xi ∈ A0 ⊗alg G0 (summation
over finitely many terms). We shall sometimes use the Sweedler convention
of writing the above simply as α(x) = x(1) ⊗ x(2) . It then follows from the
identities (4) and (5), and also the fact that (τ ⊗ id)(α(a)) = τ (a)1 for all
a ∈ A0 that
hadD (b), a′ dD (b′ )iG
1
= − (τ ⊗ id)(α(b∗ )Ψ̃(α(a∗ a′ ), α(b′ )))
2
1
= − (τ ⊗ id)(α(b∗ )α(Ψ(a∗ a′ , b′ )))

= − (τ ⊗ id)(α(b∗ Ψ(a∗ a′ , b′ )))
2
1
= − τ (b∗ Ψ(a∗ a′ , b′ ))1G
2
= hadD (b), a′ dD (b′ )i1G .
This proves that α(1) is indeed well-defined and extends to a G-linear isom1 ⊗ G, to be denoted by U (1) , which sends (ad (b)) ⊗ q to
etry on HD
D
(1)
α (adD (b))(1 ⊗ q), a, b ∈ A0 , q ∈ G. Moreover, since the linear span
0
of α(A∞
0 )(1 ⊗ G) is dense in HD ⊗ G, it is easily seen that the range of the
(1)
1 ⊗ G, i.e. U (1) is a unitary. In fact, from its
isometry U is the whole of HD
definition it can also be shwon that U (1) is a unitary representation of the
1 .
compact quantum group G on HD
In a similar way, we can construct unitary representation U (n) of G on
the Hilbert space of n-forms for any n ≥ 1, by defining

(using Sweedler convention) and verifying that it extends to a unitary.
0 discussed beWe also denote by U (0) the unitary representation α̃ onLHD
(n) of G on
fore. Finally, we have a unitary representation U =
n≥0 U
L
n , and also extend d as a closed densely defined operator on H̃
H̃ := n HD
D
in the obvious way, by defining dD (a0 dD (a1 )...dD (an )) = dD (a0 )...dD (an ).
It is now straightforward to see the following:
Theorem 2.20 The operator D ′ := dD +d∗D is equivariant in the sense that
U (D ′ ⊗ 1) = (D ′ ⊗ 1)U .
We point out that there is a natural representation π of A on H̃ given
by π(a)(a0 dD (a1 )...dD (an )) = aa0 dD (a1 )...dD (an ), and (π(A∞ ), H̃, D′ ) is
indeed a spectral triple, which is G-equivariant.
20

Although the relation between spectral properties of D and D ′ is not
clear in general, in many cases of interest (e.g. when there is an underlying
type (1, 1) spectral data in the sense of [10]) these two Dirac operators are
closely related. As an illustration, consider the canonical spectral on the
noncommutative 2-torus Aθ , which is discussed in some details in the next
section. In this case, the Dirac operator D acts on L2 (Aθ , τ ) ⊗ C2 , and it
can easily be shown (see [10]) that the Hilbert space of forms is isomorphic
with L2 (Aθ , τ ) ⊗ C4 ∼
= L2 (Aθ ) ⊗ C2 ; thus D′ is essentially same as D in this
case.

Examples and computations

We give some simple yet interesting explicit examples of quantum isometry
groups here. However, we give only some computational details for the first
example, and for the rest, the reader is referred to a companion article ([3]).
Example 1 : commutative tori
Consider M = T, the one-torus, with the usual Riemannian structure. The
∗-algebra A∞ = C ∞ (M ) is generated by one unitary U , which is the multiplication operator by z in L2 (T). The Laplacian is given by L(U n ) = −n2 U n .
∞ smoothly, let A , n ∈ Z be
If a compact quantum group (S, ∆P
S ) acts on A
n
elements of S such that α0 (U ) = n U n ⊗ An (here α0 : A∞ → A∞ ⊗alg S
is the S-action on A∞ ). Note that this infinite sum converges at least
in the topology of the Hilbert space L2 (T) ⊗ L2 (S), where L2 (S) denotes
the GNS space for the Haar state of S. It is clear that the condition
(L ⊗ id) ◦ α0 = α0 ◦ L forces to have An = 0 for all but n = ±1. The
conditions α0 (U )α0 (U )∗ = α0 (U )∗ α0 (U ) = 1 ⊗ 1 further imply the following:
A∗1 A1 + A∗−1 A−1 = 1 = A1 A∗1 + A−1 A∗−1 ,
A∗1 A−1 = A∗−1 A1 = A1 A∗−1 = A−1 A∗1 = 0.
It follows that A±1 are partial isometries with orthogonal domains and
ranges. Say, A1 has domain P and range Q. Hence the domain and
range of A−1 are respectively 1 − P and 1 − Q. Consider the unitary
V = A + B, so that V P = A, V (1 − P ) = B. Now, from the fact that
(L ⊗ id)(α0 (U 2 )) = α0 (L(U 2 )) it is easy to see that the coefficient of 1 ⊗ 1 in
the expression of α0 (U )2 must be 0, i.e. AB + BA = 0. From this, it follows
that V and P commute and therefore P = Q. By straightforward calculation
using the facts that V is unitary, P is a projection and V and P commute, we
21

can verify that α0 given by α0 (U ) = U ⊗ V P + U −1 ⊗ V (1 − P ) extends to a
∗-homomorphsim from A∞ to A∞ ⊗C ∗ (V, P ) satisfying (L⊗id)◦α0 = α0 ◦L.
It follows that the C ∗ algebra QISO(T) is commutative and generated by a
unitary V and a projection P , or equivalently by two partial isometries A,
B such that A∗ A = AA∗ , B ∗ B = BB ∗ , AB = BA = 0. So, as a C ∗ algebra
it is isomorphic with C(T) ⊕ C(T) ∼
= C(T × Z2 ). The coproduct (say ∆0 )
can easily be calculated from the requirement of co-associativity, and the
Hopf algebra structure of QISO(T) can be seen to coincide with that of
the semi-direct product of T by Z2 , where the generator of Z2 acts on T by
sending z 7→ z̄.
We summarize this in form of the following.
Theorem 3.1 The universal quantum group of isometries QISO(T) of the
one-torus T is isomorphic (as a quantum group) with C(T >⊳Z2 ) = C(ISO(T)).
We can easily extend this result to higher dimensional commutative tori,
and can prove that the quantum isometry group coincides with the classical
isometry group. This is some kind of rigidity result, and it will be interesting to investigate the nature of quantum isometry groups of more general
classical manifolds.
Example 2 : Noncommutative torus; holomorphic isomrtries
Next we consider the simplest and well-known example of noncommutative
manifold, namely the noncommutative two-torus Aθ , where θ is a fixed
irrational number (see [6]). It is the universal C ∗ algebra generated by
two unitaries U and V satisfying the commutation relation U V = λV U ,
where λ = e2πiθ . There is a canonical faithful trace τ on Aθ given by
τ (U m V n ) = δmn . We consider the canonical spectral triple (A∞ , H, D),
where A∞ is the unital ∗-algebra spanned by U, V , H = L2 (τ ) ⊕ L2 (τ ) and
D is given by


0
d1 + id2
D=
,
d1 − id2
0
where d1 and d2 are closed unbounded linear maps on L2 (τ ) given by
d1 (U m V n ) = mU m V n , d2 (U m V n ) = nU m V n . It is easy to compute the
space of one-forms Ω1D (see [4], [10], [6]) and the Laplacian L = −d∗ d is
given by L(U m V n ) = −(m2 + n2 )U m V n . For simplicity of computation,
instead of the full quantum isometry group we at first concentrate on an
interesting quantum subgroup G = QISOhol (A∞ , H, D), which is the universal quantum group which leaves invariant the subalgebra of A∞ consisting
of polynomials in U , V and 1, i.e. span of U m V n with m, n ≥ 0. The proof
of existence and uniqueness of such a universal quantum group is more or
22

less identical to the proof of existence and uniqueness of QISO. We call G
the quantum group of "holomorphic" isometries, and observe in the theorem
stated below without proof (see [3]) that this quantum group is nothing but
the quantum double torus studied in [11].
Theorem 3.2 Consider the following co-product ∆B on the C ∗ algebra B =
C(T2 )⊕A2θ , given on the generators A0 , B0 , C0 , D0 as follows ( where A0 , D0
correspond to C(T2 ) and B0 , C0 correspond to A2θ )
∆B (A0 ) = A0 ⊗ A0 + C0 ⊗ B0 , ∆B (B0 ) = B0 ⊗ A0 + D0 ⊗ B0 ,
∆B (C0 ) = A0 ⊗ C0 + C0 ⊗ D0 , ∆B (D0 ) = B0 ⊗ C0 + D0 ⊗ D0 .
Then (B, ∆0 ) is a compact quantum group and it has an action α0 on Aθ
given by
α0 (U ) = U ⊗ A0 + V ⊗ B0 , α0 (V ) = U ⊗ C0 + V ⊗ D0 .
Moreover, (B, ∆B ) is isomorphic (as quantum group) with G = QISOhol (A∞ , H, D).
We refer to [3] for a proof of the above result, and to [11] for the computation
of the Haar stat and representation theory of the compact quantum group
G.
Example 3 : Noncommutative Torus; full quantum isometry group
By similar but somewhat tedious calculations (see [3]) one can also describe
explicitly the full quantum isometry group QISO(A∞ , H, D). It is as a
C ∗ algebra has eight direct summands, four of which are isomorphic with
the commutative algebra C(T2 ), and the other four are irrational rotation
algebras.
Theorem 3.3 QISO(Aθ ) = ⊕8k=1 C ∗ (Uk1 , Uk2 ) (as a C ∗ algebra), where for
odd k, Uk1 , Uk2 are the two commuting unitary generators of C(T2 ), and for
even k, Uk1 Uk2 = exp(4πiθ)Uk2 Uk1 , i.e. they generate A2θ . The (co)-action
on the generators U, V (say) of Aθ are given by the following :
α0 (U ) = U ⊗(U11 +U31 )+V ⊗(U52 +U62 )+U −1 ⊗(U21 +U41 )+V −1 ⊗(U72 +U82 ),
α0 (V ) = U ⊗(U51 +U71 )+V ⊗(U12 +U22 )+U −1 ⊗(U61 +U81 )+V −1 ⊗(U32 +U42 ).
From the co-associativity condition, the co-product of QISO(Aθ ) can easily
be calculated. For the detailed description of the coproduct, counit, antipode and study of the representation theory of QISO(Aθ ), the reader is
referred to [3]. It is interesting to mention here that the quantum isometry
23

group of Aθ is a Rieffel type deformation of the isometry group (which is
same as the quantum isometry group) of the commutative two-torus. The
commutative two-torus is a subgroup of its isometry group, but when the
isometry group is deformed into QISO(Aθ ), the subgroup relation is not
respected, and the deformation of the commutative torus, which is A2θ , sits
in QISO(Aθ ) just as a C ∗ subalgebra (in fact a direct summand) but not
as a quantum subgroup any more. This perhaps provides some explanation
of the non-existence of any Hopf algebra structure on the noncommutative
torus.
