Abstract. Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficients of modular
forms on SL2 (Z) for p = 2, 3, 5, 7. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly
holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on Γ0 (4N ) for N = 1, 2, 4. The proof
is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral
weight. As applications of our main result, we obtain congruences on various modular
objects, such as those for Borcherds exponents, for Fourier coefficients of quotients of
Eisentein series and for Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on the Maass Space.

1. Introduction and Statement of Main Results
Serre obtained the p-adic limits of the integral Fourier coefficients of modular forms on
SL2 (Z) for p = 2, 3, 5, 7 (see Théorème 7 and Lemma 8 in [20]). In this paper, we extend
the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on Γ0 (4N)
for N = 1, 2, 4. The proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular
forms of half integral weight. As applications of our main result, we obtain congruences
for various modular objects, such as those for Borcherds exponents, for Fourier coefficients
of quotients of Eisentein series and for Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on the
Maass Space.

When t ∼ ∞, we denote atf (n) by af (n). Note that the number r(t) is independent of the
choice of f ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) and λ. We call t a regular cusp if r(t) = 0 (see Chapter IV.
2
§1. of [15] for a more general definition of a λ-regular cusp ).
Remark 1.1. Our definition of a regular cusp is different from the usual one.
Let U4N := {t1 , * * * , tν(4N ) } be the set of all inequivalent regular cusps of Γ0 (4N). Note
that the genus of Γ0 (4N) is zero if and only if 1 ≤ N ≤ 4. Let Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) be the space
2
of weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight λ + 12 on Γ0 (4N) and let M0λ+ 1 (Γ0 (N))
2
denote the set of f (z) ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N)) such that the constant term of its q-expansion at
2
each cusp is zero. Let Up be the operator defined by
(f |Up )(z) :=

∞
X

af (pn)q n .

n=n0

Let OL be the ring of integers of a number field L with a prime ideal p ⊂ OL . For
P
P
f (z) :=
af (n)q n and g(z) :=
ag (n)q n ∈ L[[q −1 , q]] we write
f (z) ≡ g(z)

(mod p)

if and only if af (n) − ag (n) ∈ p for every integer n.
With these notations we state the following theorem.
Theorem 1. For N = 1, 2, 4 consider
f (z) :=

∞
X

n=n0

af (n)q n ∈ M0λ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) ∩ L[[q −1 , q]].
2

Suppose that p ⊂ OL is any prime ideal such that p|p, p prime, and that af (n) is p-integral
for every integer n ≥ n0 .
(1) If p = 2 and af (0) = 0, then there exists a positive integer b such that
(f |(Up )b )(z) ≡ 0 (mod pj ) for each j ∈ N.
(2) If p ≥ 3 and f (z) ∈ M0λ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) with λ ≡ 2 or 2 +
2
exists a positive integer b such that

N

(mod

p−1
),
2

then there

(f |(Up )b )(z) ≡ 0 (mod pj ) for each j ∈ N.
Remark 1.2. The p-adic limit of a sum of Fourier coefficients of f ∈ M 3 (Γ0 (4N)) was
2
studied in [13].
Our method only allows to prove a weaker result if f (z) 6∈ M0λ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)).

Suppose that p ⊂ OL is any prime ideal with p|p, p prime, p ≥ 5, and that af (n) is
 
p-integral for every integer n ≥ n0 . If λ ≡ 2 or 2 + N1 (mod p−1

2. Applications: More Congruences
In this section, we study congruences for various modular objects such as those for
Borcherds exponents and for quotients of Eisenstein series.
2.1. p-adic Limits of Borcherds Exponents. Let MH denote the set of meromorphic
modular forms of integral weight on SL2 (Z) with Heegner divisor, integer coefficients and
leading coefficient 1. Let

Hurwitz class number of discriminant −n. The following was proved by Borcherds.

Theorem 2.1 ([4]). The map Ψ is an isomorphism from M+1 (Γ0 (4)) to MH , and the

weight of Ψ(f (z)) is af (0).

for every positive integer m. Here, ̟(F ) is a constant determined by the constant
term of the q-expansion of Ψ−1 (F ) at 0.
2.2. Sums of n-Squares. For u ∈ Z>0 , let
rn (u) := ♯{(s1 , * * * , sn ) ∈ Zn : s21 + * * * + s2n = u}.

Remark 2.2. As for an example, if λ ≡ 2 (mod p − 1) and p is an odd prime, then there
exists a positive integer C0 such that

r2λ+1 p2b ≡ 10 (mod p), ∀b > C0

2.3. Quotients of Eisenstein Series. Congruences for the coefficients of quotients of
elliptic Eisenstein series have been studied in [3]. Let us consider the Cohen Eisenstein
P

series Hr+ 1 (z) := ∞
N =0 H(r, N)q of weight r + 2 , r ≥ 2 (see [7]). We derive congruences
2
for the coefficients of quotients of Hr+ 1 (z) and Eisenstein series.

aW (112b+1 ) ≡ 2 (mod 11)
for every integer b > C0 .
2.4. The Maass Space. Next we deal with congruences for the Fourier coefficients of
a Siegel modular form in the Maass space. To define the Maass space, let us introduce
notations given in [17]: let T ∈ M2g (Q) be a rational, half-integral, symmetric, nondegenerate matrix of size 2g with discriminant

(see (6.2) for details). This space is called the Maass space of genus 2g and weight g + k.
In [17] it was proved that the Maass space is the same as the image of the Ikeda lifting

This paper is organized as follows. Section 3 gives a linear relation among Fourier
coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. The remaining sections contain
detailed proofs of the main theorems.

Let V (N; k, n) be the subspace of Cn generated by the first n coefficients of the qexpansion of f at ∞ for f ∈ Sk (Γ0 (N)), where Sk (Γ0 (N)) denotes the space of cusp forms
of weight k ∈ Z on Γ0 (N). Let L(N; k, n) be the orthogonal complement of V (N; k, n)

in Cn with the usual inner product of Cn . The vector space L(1; k, d(k) + 1), d(k) =
dim(Sk (Γ(1))), was studied by Siegel to evaluate the value of the Dedekind zeta function
at a certain point. The vector space L(1; k, n) is explicitly described in terms of the
principal part of negative weight modular forms in [9]. These results were extended in [8]
to the groups Γ0 (N) of genus zero. For 1 ≤ N ≤ 4, let

Let ∆4N,λ := q δλ (4N ) + O(q δλ (4N )+1 ) be in Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N) with the maximum order at ∞,

is an isomorphism.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Suppose that G(z) is a meromorphic modular form of weight 2 on
Γ0 (4N). For τ ∈ H∪C4N , let Dτ be the image of τ under the canonical map from H∪C4N
to a compact Riemann surface X0 (4N). Here H is the usual complex upper half plane,
and C4N denotes the set of all inequivalent cusps of Γ0 (4N). The residue ResDτ Gdz of
G(z) at Dτ ∈ X0 (4N) is well-defined since we have a canonical correspondence between a
meromorphic modular form of weight 2 on Γ0 (4N) and a meromorphic 1-form of X0 (4N).
If Resτ G denotes the residue of G at τ on H, then
ResDτ Gdz =

Resτ G.

Here lτ is the order of the isotropy group at τ . The residue of G at each cusp t ∈ C4N is

Now we give a proof of Theorem 3.1.
To prove Theorem 3.1, take

where g ∈ Mr+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) and f (z) = ∞
n=1 af (n)q ∈ Mλ+ 12 (Γ0 (4N)). Note that G(z) is
2
holomorphic on H. Since g(z), R4N (z) and f (z) are holomorphic and R4N (z) has no zero
on H, it is enough to compute the residues of G(z) only at all inequivalent cusps to apply
g(z)
the Residue Theorem. The q-expansion of R4N
f (z) at ∞ is

This shows that Φr,e (4N) is well-defined. The linearity of the map Φr,e (4N) is clear.
It remains to check that Φr,e (4N) is an isomorphism. Since there exists no holomorphic
modular form of negative weight except the zero function, we obtain the injectivity of
Φr,e (4N). Note that for e ≥ λ−1

ν(4) = 2, ν(8) = 3, ν(12) = 4, ν(16) = 6

(see §1 of Chapter 4. in [15] for details). The dimension formula of Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) (see
2
Table 1) together with the results in (3.1) and (3.5), implies that

Since the Fourier coefficients of η(z) and η(z)

integral coefficients.
Recall that ∆4N,λ = q δλ (4N ) + O(q δλ (4N )+1 ) is the modular form of weight λ + 21 on

the basis of Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) can be chosen as

If ∆4N,λ (z) is p-integral, then {∆4N,λ (z)j4N (z)e | 0 ≤ e ≤ δλ (4N)} also forms a basis of

To apply Theorem 4.4, we need the following two propositions.
Proposition 4.5 (Proposition 3.2 in [22]). Suppose that p is an odd prime, k and N are
integers with (N, p) = 1. Let
X
f (z) =
a(n)q n ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)).

Proposition 4.6 (Proposition 5.1 in [1]). Suppose that p is an odd prime such that p ∤ N
and consider
∞
X
g(z) =
a(n)q n ∈ Sλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4Npj )) ∩ L[[q]], for each j ∈ N.
2

n=1

Suppose further that p ⊂ OL is any prime ideal with p|p and that a(n) is p-integral for
every integer n ≥ 1. Then there exists G(z) ∈ Sλ′ + 1 (Γ0 (4N)) ∩ OL [[q]] such that
2

G(z) ≡ g(z) (mod p),
where λ′ +

= (λ + 12 )pj + pe (p − 1) with eN large.

Remark 4.7. Proposition 4.6 was proved for p ≥ 5 in [1]. One can check that this holds
also for p = 3.
Now we prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1. Take

if p = 3,
if p ≥ 5.

D. CHOI AND Y. CHOIE

Using properties of eta-quotients (see [12]), note that Gp (z) vanishes at every cusp of
Γ0 (16) except ∞ if p = 2, and vanishes at every cusp ac of Γ0 (4Np2 ) with p2 ∤ N if p ≥ 3.
Thus, Proposition 4.5 implies that there exist positive integers l, m, k such that
(
if p = 2,
(f |Upm )(z)Gp (z)l ∈ Sk+ 1 (Γ0 (16))
2

(f |Upm )(z)Gp (z)l ∈ Sk+ 1 (Γ0 (4p2 N))

if p ≥ 3.

Note that k ≡ λ (mod p − 1). Using Proposition 4.6, we can find
F (z) ∈ Sk′ + 1 (Γ0 (4N))
2

such that F (z) ≡ (f (z)|Upm )Gp (z)l ≡ (f |Upm )(z) (mod p) and k ′ ≡ k (mod p − 1).
Theorem 4.4 implies that there exists a positive integer b such that (F |Up2b )(z) ≡ 0
(mod p). Thus, we have shown so far that if ρ ∈ p \ p2 , all the Fourier coefficients of
