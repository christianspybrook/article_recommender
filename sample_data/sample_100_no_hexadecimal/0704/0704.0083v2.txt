The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the
Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. This ensemble
corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but
in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the
Lorentzian path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons
limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these
instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained
within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the bounded
range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of
constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy
problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.

Euclidean quantum gravity (EQG) is a lame duck in
modern particle physics and cosmology. After its summit in early and late eighties (in the form of the cosmological wavefunction proposals [1, 2] and baby universes
boom [3]) the interest in this theory gradually declined,
especially, in cosmological context, where the problem of
quantum initial conditions was superseded by the concept of stochastic inflation [4]. EQG could not stand the
burden of indefiniteness of the Euclidean gravitational
action [5] and the cosmology debate of the tunneling vs
no-boundary proposals [6].
Thus, a recently suggested EQG density matrix of the
Universe [7] is hardly believed to be a viable candidate
for the initial state of the Universe, even though it avoids
the infrared catastrophe of small cosmological constant
Λ, generates an ensemble of universes in the limited
range of Λ, and suggests a strong selection mechanism
for the landscape of string vacua [7, 8]. Here we want to
justify this result by deriving it from first principles of
Lorentzian quantum gravity applied to a microcanonical
ensemble of closed cosmological models.
Thermal properties in quantum cosmology [9] are incorporated by a mixed physical state, which is dynamically more preferable than a pure state of the HartleHawking type. This follows from the path integral for
the EQG statistical sum [7, 8]. It can be cast into the
form of the integral over a minisuperspace of the lapse
function N (τ ) and scale factor a(τ ) of spatially closed
FRW metric ds2 = N 2 (τ ) dτ 2 + a2 (τ ) d2 Ω(3) ,

Here ΓE [ a, N ] is the Euclidean effective action of all

sical Eucidean action, and the integration runs over periodic fields on the Euclidean spacetime with a compactified time τ (of S 1 × S 3 topology).

of quantum fields and their vacuum (Casimir) energy,

overall conformal anomaly of all fields φ(x).

modified by the quantum B-term and the radiation term
C/a4 with the constant C satisfying the bootstrap equation C = B/2 + dF (η)/dη. Such solutions represent
garland-type instantons which exist only in the limited
range 0 < Λmin < Λ < 3m2P /B [7, 8] and eliminate the
infrared catastrophe of Λ = 0. The period of these quasithermal instantons is not a freely specifiable parameter,
but as a function of Λ follows from this bootstrap. Therefore this is not a canonical ensemble.
Contrary to the construction above, the density matrix that we advocate here is given by the canonical path
integral of Lorentzian quantum gravity. Its kernel in the

where the integration runs over histories of phase-space
variables (q(t), p(t)) interpolating between q± at t± and
the Lagrange multipliers of the gravitational constraints
Hμ = Hμ (q, p) - lapse and shift functions N (t) = N μ (t).
The measure D[ q, p, N ] includes the gauge-fixing
factor
Q
containing the delta function δ(χ) = μ δ(χμ ) of gauge
conditions χμ and the ghost factor [10, 11] (condensed
index μ includes also continuous spatial labels). It is
important that the integration range of N μ
− ∞ < N < +∞,

(6)

is such that it generates in the integrand
the deltaQ
functions of these constraints δ(H) = μ δ(Hμ ). As a
consequence the kernel (5) satisfies the set of quantum
Dirac constraints - Wheeler-DeWitt equations

(7)
Ĥμ q, ∂/i∂q ρ( q, q− ) = 0,

and the density matrix (5) can be regarded as an operator
delta-function of these constraints
Y

ρ̂ ∼ "
δ(Ĥμ ) ".
(8)
μ

This notation should not be understood literally because
this multiple delta-function is not well defined, for the
operators Ĥμ do not commute and form a quasi-algebra
with nonvanishing structure functions. Moreover, exact operator realization Ĥμ is not known except the
first two orders of a semiclassical ~-expansion [12]. Fortunately, we do not need a precise form of these constraints, because we will proceed with their path-integral
solutions well adjusted to the semiclassical perturbation
theory. This strategy does not extend beyond typical
field-theoretic considerations when the path integral is
regarded more fundamental than the Schrodinger equation marred with the problems of divergent equal-time
commutators, operator ordering, etc.
The very essence of our proposal is the interpretation
of (5) and (8) as the density matrix of a microcanonical
ensemble in spatially closed quantum cosmology. A simplest analogy is the density matrix of an unconstrained
system having a conserved Hamiltonian Ĥ in the microcanonical state with a fixed energy E, ρ̂ ∼ δ(Ĥ − E).
Major distinction of (8) from this case is that spatially
closed cosmology does not have freely specifiable constants of motion like the energy or other global charges.
Rather it has as constants of motion the Hamiltonian and
momentum constraints Hμ , all having a particular value
- zero. Therefore, the expression (8) can be considered
as a most general and natural candidate for the quantum
state of the closed Universe. Below we confirm this fact

by showing that in the physical sector the corresponding statistical sum is just a uniformly distributed (with
a unit weight) integral over entire phase space of true
physical degrees of freedom. Thus, this is a sum over
Everything. However, in terms of the observable quantities, like spacetime geometry, this distribution turns out
to be nontrivially peaked around a particular set of universes. Semiclassically this distribution is given by the
EQG density matrix and the saddle-point instantons of
the above type [7].
From the normalization of the density matrix in the
physical Hilbert space the statistical sum follows as the
path integral

where the integration runs over periodic

the space of solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equations
(ψ1 |ψ2 ) = hψ1 |μ̂|ψ2 i from thatR of the space of squareintegrable functions, hψ1 |ψ2 i = dq ψ1∗ ψ2 . This measure
includes the delta-function of unitary gauge conditions
and an operator factor built with the aid of the relevant
ghost determinant [12].
On the other hand, in terms of the physical phase space
variables the Faddeev-Popov path integral equals [10, 11]

where T denotes the chronological ordering. Here the
physical Hamiltonian Hphys (t) and its operator realization Ĥphys (t) are nonvanishing only in unitary gauges explicitly depending on time [12], ∂t χμ (q, p, t) 6= 0. In static
gauges, ∂t χμ = 0, they identically vanish, because in spatially closed cosmology the full Hamiltonian reduces to
the combination of constraints.
The path integral (10) is gauge-independent on-shell
[10, 11] and coincides with that in the static gauge.
Therefore, from Eqs.(9)-(10) with Ĥphys = 0, the statistical sum of our microcanonical ensemble equals
Z
e−Γ = Trphys Iphys = dqphys dpphys
= sum over Everything. (11)
This ultimate equipartition, not modulated by any nontrivial density of states, is a result of general covariance
and closed nature of the Universe lacking any freely specifiable constants of motion. The volume integral of entire

3
physical phase space, whose structure and topology is
not known, is very nontrivial. However, below we show
that semiclassically it is determined by EQG methods
and supported by instantons of [7] spanning a bounded
range of the cosmological constant.

Integration runs over periodic fields (not indicated explicitly but assumed everywhere below) even despite the
Lorentzian signature of the underlying spacetime. Similarly to the procedure of [7, 8] leading to (1)-(2) in
the Euclidean case, we decompose [ q, N ] into a minisuperspace [ aL (t), NL (t) ] and the "matter" φL (x) variables, the subscript L indicating their Lorentzian nature. With a relevant decomposition of the measure
D[ q, N ] = D[ aL , NL ]×DφL (x), the microcanonical sum
takes the form
Z
e−Γ = D[ aL , NL ] eiΓL [ aL , NL ] ,
(13)
Z
eiΓL [ aL , NL ] = DφL (x) eiSL [ aL , NL ; φL (x)] , (14)
where ΓL [ aL , NL ] is a Lorentzian effective action. The
stationary point of (13) is a solution of the effective equation δΓL /δNL (t) = 0. In the gauge NL = 1 it reads as
a Lorentzian version of the Euclidean equation (4) and
the bootstrap equation for the radiation constant
R C with
the Wick rotated τ = it, a(τ ) = aL (t), η = i dt/aL (t).
However, with these identifications C turns out to be
purely imaginary
R (in view of the complex nature of the
free energy F (i dt/aL )). Therefore, no periodic solutions exist in spacetime with a real Lorentzian metric.
On the contrary, such solutions exist in the Euclidean
spacetime. Alternatively, the latter can be obtained with
the time variable unchanged t = τ , aL (t) = a(τ ), but
with the Wick rotated lapse function
NL = −iN, iSL [ aL , NL ; φL ] = −SE [ a, N ; φ ].

(15)

In the gauge N = 1 (NL = −i) these solutions exactly
coincide with the instantons of [7]. The corresponding
saddle points of (13) can be attained by deforming the
integration contour (6) of NL into the complex plane to
pass through the point NL = −i and relabeling the real
Lorentzian t with the Euclidean τ . In terms of the Euclidean N (τ ), a(τ ) and φ(x) the integrals (13) and (14)
take the form of the path integrals (1) and (2) in EQG,
iΓL [ aL , NL ] = −ΓE [ a, N ].

(16)

However, the integration contour for the Euclidean N (τ )
runs from −i∞ to +i∞ through the saddle point N = 1.
This is the source of the conformal rotation in Euclidean
quantum gravity, which is called to resolve the problem of
unboundedness of the gravitational action and effectively

renders the instantons a thermal nature, even though
they originate from the microcanonical ensemble. This
mechanism implements the justification of EQG from
canonical quantization of gravity [14] (see also [15] in
black hole context).
To show this we calculate (1) in the one-loop approximation with the measure inherited from the canonical
path integral (5) D[ a, N ] = Da DN μ[ a, N ] δ[ χ ] Det Q.
Here μ[ a, N ] is a local measure determined by the Lagrangian N L(a, a′ ), (3), in the local part of ΓE [ a, N ],

The Faddeev-Popov factor δ[ χ ] Det Q contains a gauge
condition χ = χ(a, N ) fixing the one-dimensional diffeomorphism, τ → τ̄ = τ − f /N , which for infinitesimal f = f (τ ) has the form ∆f N ≡ N̄ (τ ) − N (τ ) = f ̇,
∆f a ≡ ā(τ ) − a(τ ) = ȧ f /N , and Q = Q(d/dτ ) is a
ghost operator determined by the gauge transformation
of χ(a, N ), ∆f χ = Q(d/dτ ) f (τ ).
The conformal mode σ of the perturbations δa = σa0
and δN = σN0 on the saddle-point background (labeled
below by zero, a = a0 + δa, N = N0 + δN ) originates from imposing the background gauge χ(a, N ) =
δN − (N0 /a0 ) δa. In this gauge Q = a(d/dτ )a−1 , and
the quadratic part of ΓE takes the form [13]

In view of periodic boundary conditions for both operators their determinants cancel each other (their zero
modes to be eliminated because they correspond to the
conformal Killing symmetry of FRW instantons) [13].
Therefore, the contribution of the conformal mode reduces to the selection of instantons with a fixed time period, effectively endowing them with a thermal nature.
As suggested in [7, 8, 16] these instantons serve as
initial conditions for inflationary universes which evolve
according to the Lorentzian version of Eq.(4) and, at late
stages, have two branches of a cosmological acceleration

with Hubble scales H±
= (m2P /B)(1 ± (1 − 2BH 2)1/2 ). If
2
the initial Λ = 3H is a composite inflaton field decaying
at the end of inflation, then one of the branches under2
goes acceleration with H+
= 2m2P /B. This is determined
by the new quantum gravity scale suggested in [8] – the
upper bound of the instanton Λ-range, Λmax = 3m2P /B.
To match the model with inflation and the dark energy
phenomenon, one needs B of the order of the inflation
scale in the very early Universe and B ∼ 10120 now, so
that this parameter should effectively be a growing function of time.
This picture seems to fit into string theory at its lowenergy field-theoretic level. Then, with a bounded range
of Λ, it might constrain the landscape of string vacua
[7, 8]. Moreover, string theory has a qualitative mechanism to promote the constant B to the level of a moduli variable indefinitely growing with the evolving size
R(t) of extra dimensions. Indeed B as a coefficient in
the overall conformal anomaly of 4-dimensional quantum
fields basically counts their number N , B ∼ N . In the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory and string theory the effective
4-dimensional fields arise as KK and winding modes with
the masses [17]

break their conformal symmetry. These modes remain
approximately conformally invariant as long as their
masses are much smaller than the spacetime curvature,

∼ m2P /N . Therefore the number of conformally invariant modes changes with R. Simple estimates
show that for pure KK modes (w = 0, n ≤ N ) their number grows with R as N ∼ (mP R)2/3 , whereas for pure
winding modes (n = 0, w ≤ N ) their number grows with

the decreasing R as N ∼ (mP α′ /R)2/3 . Thus, the effect
of indefinitely growing B is possible for both scenarios
with expanding or contracting extra dimensions. In the
first case this is the growing tower of superhorizon
p KK
modes which make the horizon scale H+ = mP 2/B ∼
mP /(mP R)1/3 indefinitely decreasing with R → ∞. In
the second case this is the tower of superhorizon winding
modes which make this acceleration scale decrease with
the decreasing R as H+ ∼ mP (R/mP α′ )1/3 . This effect
is flexible enough to accommodate the present day acceleration scale H0 ∼ 10−60 mP (though, by the price of
fine-tuning an enormous coefficient of expansion or contraction of R). This gives a new dark energy mechanism
driven by the conformal anomaly and transcending the
inflationary and matter-domination stages starting with
the state of the microcanonical distribution.
To summarize, within a minimum set of assumptions
(the equipartition in the physical phase space (11)),
we seem to have the mechanism of constraining the
landscape of string vacua and get the full evolution of
the Universe as a quasi-equilibrium decay of its initial
microcanonical state. Thus, contrary to anticipations
of Sidney Coleman, "there is Nothing rather than
Something" [3], one can say that Something (rather
than Nothing) comes from Everything.
