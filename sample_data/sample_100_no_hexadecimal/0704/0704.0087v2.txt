Abstract. Our main result in this paper is the following: Given H m , H n
hyperbolic spaces of dimensional m ≥ 2 and n corresponding, and given a
Holder function f = (f 1 , ..., f n−1 ) : ∂H m → ∂H n between geometric boundaries of H m and H n . Then for each ǫ > 0 there exists a harmonic map
u : H m → H n which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of Euclidean) and u|∂H m = (f 1 , ..., f n−1 , ǫ).

1. Introduction
Let H m and H n are hyperbolic spaces with dimensions m ≥ 2 and n correspondingly. For convenience, we use the upper-half space models for H m and H n . So
H m = {(x1 , ..., xm ) ∈ IRm : xm > 0}, H n = {(y 1 , ..., y n ) ∈ IRn : y n > 0} with

So the tension fields of u = (y 1 , ..., y n ) is

where ∇0 is the Euclidean gradient and ∆0 is the Euclidean Laplacian.
A C 2 map u : H m → H n is called a harmonic map if τ (u)s = 0 for all s =
1, 2, ..., n. The literature about harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds are
abundant, we refer the readers to the classical work [4].
One of the interesting problems for harmonic maps is that of the Dirichlet problem at infinity: Given ∂H m and ∂H n geometric boundaries of H m and H n , and

of Euclidean), is there a harmonic map u : H m → H n such that in Euclidean sense
u is continuous up to the boundary ∂H m and takes boundary value f ?
For this problem with some more requirements for the smoothness of f , there are
many results. In three papers [8], [9] and [7], Li and Tam established the existence
and uniqueness of a harmonic function u which is C 1 up to the boundary and has
boundary value f , provided f is C 1 . But for more general types of f , according to
our knowledge, there is no answer to the existence of a solution u.
In this paper we establish the existence of approximate solutions to the Dirichlet
problem for harmonic maps between two hyperbolic spaces with prescribed boundary value. More explicitly, we prove the following result
Theorem 1. Let f : H m → H n be a bounded
R 1uniformly continuous. Let functions
g and φ be as in Section 2. Assume that 0 t−1 g(t)dt < ∞, in particular, this
condition is satisfied if f is Holder continuous. For each ǫ > 0, there exists a
harmonic map uǫ : H m → H n which is continuous up to the boundary ∂H m and
u|∂H m = (f 1 , ..., f n−1 , ǫ).
Our strategy for proving this result is the follows: First, we construct an initial
map, i.e., a C 2 map v = (v 1 , ..., v n−1 , v n ) : H m → H n which has boundary value
f for any continuous map f : ∂H m → H n . For this step we follows the ideas in
[9], with some changes: Since the function f needs not to differentiable, we can
not take v n as in [9], and the function v n of ours is a function of one variable xm .
Then, we use this function to produce harmonic maps uǫ : H m → H n which takes
boundary value (f 1 , ..., f n−1 , v n + ǫ) for every ǫ > 0.
2. Initial maps
In this part, we use the techniques in [9] to construct good initial maps v having
the map f : ∂H m → ∂H n as the boundary value.
Let f : IRm−1 → IRn−1 be a uniformly continuous bounded function. Let
g : H m → (0.∞) be C 2 , bounded and
lim g(x′ , xm ) = 0,

xm →0

uniformly in x′ .
We denote by v = {f, g} : H m → H n the extension of f defined as follows
Z
2
xm f α (y ′ )
dy ′ ,
v α (x′ , xm ) =
′
mωm Rm−1 (|x − y ′ |2 + (xm )2 )m/2
for 1 ≤ α ≤ n − 1 and
v n (x′ , xm ) = g(x′ , xm ).
By results in [9] (pp. 628-630) we have
(i) v is C 2 and up to the boundary given by xm = 0 it is continuous.
(ii) If 1 ≤ α ≤ n − 1 then
lim xm |∇0 v α | = 0,

xm →0

uniformly in x′ .
Moreover, by estimates of elliptic PDEs (see Theorem 2.10 in [5]), noting that
v α is bounded, there exists constants C > 0 such that
(2.1)

max{(xm )3 |D3 v α |, (xm )2 |D2 v α |, (xm )|∇0 v α |} ≤ C.

Since g is monotone it follows that g is Lebesgue measurable. Moreover, since g is
bounded, we see that φ is well-defined.
Using polar coordinates with center at x′ we see that there exists a constant
C > 0 such that
Z
xm |f (y ′ ) − f (x′ )|
≤ Cφ(xm ),
IRm−1 (|x′ − y ′ |2 + (xm )2 )m/2
for all x′ ∈ IRm−1 .
Since f is uniformly continuous we see that
lim g(r) = 0.

r→0

Now we show that
lim φ(xm ) = 0.

xm →0

Indeed, for any ǫ > 0, we find δ > 0 such that
g(s) ≤ ǫ,
if 0 < s ≤ δ. So, if K = sups∈IR g(s) we have

Letting r → 0 we see that
lim sup φ(r) ≤ ǫπ/2.
r→0

Since ǫ > 0 is arbitrary, we see that
lim φ(r) = 0.

r→0

Thus, if we put v = {f, φ(xm )} we see that v is an extension of f . Moreover we
have the following result
Lemma 1. Let f : ∂H m → ∂H n be nonconstant, uniformly continous and
bounded. Put v = {f, φ(xm )} as above. Then v is smooth, up to the boundary
it is continuous, v|IRm−1 = f and there exists C > 0 such that for xm near 0 we
have
||τ (v)||2 ≤ C.

Proof. By Section 6 in [9] we have
|(xm )∇0 v α | ≤ C3 |φ(xm )|,
where 1 ≤ α ≤ n − 1 and C3 is a positive constant.

So

where C4 is a constant.

Since f is nonconstant we see easily that g ′ 6≡ 0 (in fact, we don't need this
restriction since we can add g with a non-constant positive function, for example
(xm )1/2 ). So since g ′ ≥ 0, it follows from above equalities that
φ′ (r) > 0,
and
|rφ"(r)| ≤ C5 φ′ (r),
where C5 is a positive constant. Then use the formula for the tension field we are
done.

3. Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. Fixed ǫ > 0. We define vǫ : H m → H n as follows:
vǫ (x) = (v 1 (x), v 2 (x), ..., v n−1 (x), φ(xm ) + ǫ).
For each δ > 0 denote uǫ,δ : H m k Ωδ = {xm > δ} → H n the harmonic map
taking value vǫ on ∂Ωδ .
By inequality (2.1) in [2] and properties of v and vǫ (see Lemma 1) we have
∆H m dH n (uǫ,δ , vǫ ) ≥ −|τ (vǫ )| ≥ −C

the subsequent limit of uǫ,δ . Moreover for all x ∈ H m we have

dH n (uǫ , vǫ ) ≤ C ψ(xm ).

Hence
lim dH n (uǫ , vǫ ) = 0,

xm →0

which shows that uǫ is continuous up to the boundary and takes boundary value
vǫ (x1 , ..., xm−1 , 0) = (f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n−1 , ǫ).
