Abstra t

A fully differential al ulation in perturbative quantum hromodynami s is presented for the
produ tion of massive photon pairs at hadron olliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative
ontributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subpro esses are in luded,
as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmi a ura y. The region of phase spa e is spe ified in whi h the al ulation is most reliable.
Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predi tions are made
for more detailed tests with CDF and DØ data. Predi tions are shown for distributions of diphoton
pairs produ ed at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton
pairs from the de ay of a Higgs boson are ontrasted with those produ ed from QCD pro esses at
the LHC, showing that enhan ed sensitivity to the signal an be obtained with judi ious sele tion
of events.

INTRODUCTION
The long-sought Higgs boson(s)

h

of ele troweak symmetry breaking in parti le physi s

may soon be observed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through the diphoton
de ay mode (h

→ γγ ).

Purely hadroni

standard model pro esses are a

opious sour e

of diphotons, and a narrow Higgs boson signal at relatively low masses will appear as a
small peak above this

onsiderable ba kground. A pre ise theoreti al understanding of the

kinemati distributions for diphoton produ tion in the standard model ould provide valuable
guidan e in the sear h for the Higgs boson signal and assist in the important measurement
of Higgs boson

oupling strengths.

In this paper we address the theoreti al

al ulation of the invariant mass, transverse mo-

mentum, rapidity, and angular distributions of

ontinuum diphoton produ tion in proton-

antiproton and proton-proton intera tions at hadron

ollider energies. We

ompute all

on-

tributions to diphoton produ tion from parton-parton subpro esses through next-to-leading
order (NLO) in perturbative quantum

hromodynami s (QCD). These higher-order

ontri-

butions are large at the LHC, and their in lusion is mandatory for quantitatively trustworthy predi tions. We resum initial-state soft and

We

al ulations with data on isolated

diphoton produ tion from the Fermilab Tevatron [1℄. The good agreement we obtain with
the Tevatron data adds

onfiden e to our predi tions at the energy of the LHC. The present

work expands on our re ent abbreviated report [2℄, and it may be read in
our detailed treatment of the

onjun tion with

ontributions from the gluon-gluon subpro ess [3℄.

Our attention is fo used on the produ tion of isolated photons, i.e., high-energy photons
observed at some distan e from appre iable hadroni

remnants in the parti le dete tor.

The rare isolated photons tend to originate dire tly in hard QCD s attering, in

ontrast to

opiously produ ed non-isolated photons that arise from nonperturbative pro esses su h as

In addition, a fragmentation

ontribution of entirely different nature arises when the

require Q > 27 GeV or QT < Q, as dis ussed above. The two uts have similar effe ts on
the event distributions. Figure 8 shows the effe ts of the QT < Q ut on the QT and ∆φ

The

order to test perturbative QCD predi tions in the full γγ invariant mass range a essible at

the LHC. The values of the pT uts on the photons in Eq. (26) preserve a large fra tion of
Higgs boson events with Q > 115 GeV. These uts may be too restri tive in studies of γγ
produ tion at smaller

Q,

onsidering that the two final-state photons most likely originate
QT and have similar values of pγT of about Q/2. The pT uts
interfere with the expe ted Sudakov broadening of QT distributions with in reasing diphoton

γγ

from a

pair with small

invariant mass, as dis ussed in Se tion III A 5. We further note that the asymmetry between
γ
the pT uts on the harder and softer photons is ne essary in a fixed-order perturbative QCD
al ulation, but it is not required in the resummed al ulation. At a fixed order of αs ,
γ
asymmetry in the pT uts prevents instabilities in dσ/dQ aused by logarithmi divergen es
in dσ/dQT at small QT . Su h instabilities are eliminated altogether on e the small-QT
logarithmi terms are resummed to all orders of αs . Here we do not onsider alternative
pγT uts, although experimental ollaborations are en ouraged to employ relaxed and/or

uts to in rease the γγ event sample in their data analysis.

This distribution is qualitatively the same if integrated

QT , as in Fig. 15, or integrated above some minimal QT value, as in an experimental
measurement. Without isolation imposed, the spin-0 Higgs boson signal must be flat in φ∗ ,
but the QCD ba kground peaks toward φ∗ = 0 and π (i.e., sin φ∗ = 0) as a result of the
2, 3
final-state qg singularity.
Isolation uts suppress both the signal and the ba kground for
sin φ∗ < sin ∆R. The result is a signal distribution with a broad peak near φ∗ = π/2, while
the ba kground favors values of φ∗ near 0 and π . A sele tion of events with φ∗ in the vi inity
of π/2, and QT large enough, helps to redu e the impa t of the qg ba kground.In the lab

By definition, the re oil parton 5 always lies in the Oxz plane (has zero azimuthal angle) in the CollinsSoper frame. For the final-state singularity to o ur at NLO, the photons should be in the same plane
