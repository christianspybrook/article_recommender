The shape of the hadronic form factor f+ (q 2 ) in the decay D0 → K − e+ νe has been measured
in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations. We use 75 fb−1 of
data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding
decay branching fraction, relative to the decay D0 → K − π + , has also been measured to be RD =
BR(D0 → K − e+ νe )/BR(D0 → K − π + ) = 0.927 ± 0.007 ± 0.012. From these results, and using the
present world average value for BR(D0 → K − π + ), the normalization of the form factor at q 2 = 0
is determined to be f+ (0) = 0.727 ± 0.007 ± 0.005 ± 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical,
systematic, and from external inputs, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

Measurements of exclusive semileptonic D decays provide an accurate determination of the hadronic form factors entering in these decays. Assuming that the CKM
matrix is unitary, the elements |Vcs | and |Vcd | can be determined:
|Vcs | = |Vud | −

|Vcb |2
+ O(λ6 ) = 0.9729 ± 0.0003, (1)
2

using the measured values [1] of |Vud | and |Vcb |, and the
sine of the Cabibbo angle λ = sin(θc ) ≃ 0.227. Theoretical predictions give estimates of the form factors in
exclusive semileptonic B and D meson decays. Precise
measurements of the hadronic form factors in D decays
can help to validate predictions from QCD calculations in
both D and B decays. Better understanding of the form
factors in B decays is necessary to improve the precision
on the determination of |Vcb | and |Vub |.
In D0 → K − e+ νe decays [2], with a pseudoscalar
hadron emitted in the final state, and neglecting the electron mass, the differential decay rate depends only on one
form factor f+ (q 2 ),

where GF is the Fermi constant, q 2 is the invariant mass
squared of the two leptons, e+ and νe , and p~K (q 2 ) is
the kaon three-momentum in the D0 rest frame [3]. In
this paper we present measurements of the q 2 variation
and absolute value of the hadronic form factor at q 2 = 0
for the decay D0 → K − e+ νe (γ). The data consist of
D mesons produced in e+ e− → cc̄ continuum events at
a center of mass energy near the Υ (4S) mass, and were
recorded by the BABAR detector at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center's PEP-II collider. A semi-inclusive
reconstruction technique is used to select charm semileptonic decays with high efficiency. As a result of this approach, events with a photon radiated during the D0 decay are included in the signal. The systematic uncertainties are kept as low as possible by using control samples
extracted from data where possible.
Measurements of D → K l̄νl , based on smaller signal
events samples, have been published by the CLEO [4],
FOCUS [5] and Belle [6] collaborations.
This paper is organized as follows. A general description of the hadronic form factor, f+ (q 2 ), is given in Section II, where the different parameterizations considered

in this analysis are explained. In Section III a short description of the detector components that are important
to this measurement is given. The selection of signal
events and the rejection of background are considered in
Section IV. In Section V, the measured q 2 variation of
the hadronic form factor is discussed and compared with
previous measurements. In Section VI the measured decay rate is given and in Section VII these measurements
are combined to obtain the value of f+ (0).
II.

THE F+ (Q2 ) HADRONIC FORM FACTOR

The amplitude for the decay D0 → K − l+ νl depends
on two hadronic form factors:


m2 − m2

q

mD − mK

qμ f0 (q 2 )
(3)
q2
where Vμ = s̄γμ c. The constraint f+ (0) = f0 (0) ensures that there is no singularity at q 2 = 0. When the
charged lepton is an electron, the contribution from f0
is proportional to m2e and can be neglected in decay rate
measurements.
The parameterizations of f+ (q 2 ) which have been compared with present measurements and a few examples of
theoretical approaches, proposed to determine the values of corresponding parameters, are considered in the
following.
A.

Form factor parameterizations

The most general expressions of the form factor f+ (q 2 )
are analytic functions satisfying the dispersion relation:
f+ (q 2 ) =

. (4)
t − q 2 − iǫ

The only singularities in the complex t ≡ q 2 plane originate from the interaction of the charm and the strange
quarks in vector states. They are a pole, situated at the
Ds∗ mass squared and a cut, along the positive real axis,
starting at threshold (t+ = (mD + mK )2 ) for D0 K − production.
1.

Taylor expansion

This cut t-plane can be mapped onto the open unit
disk with center at t = t0 using the variable:
√
√
t+ − t − t+ − t0
√
.
(5)
z(t, t0 ) = √
t+ − t + t+ − t0
In this variable, the physical region for the semileptonic
2
= (mD −mK )2 ) corresponds to
decay (0 < t < t− = qmax

7
a real segment extending between ±zmax
±0.051. This
 =p

value of zmax is obtained for t0 = t+ 1 − 1 − t− /t+ .
The z expansion of f+ is thus expected to converge
quickly. The most general parameterization [7], consistent with constraints from QCD,

with δpole = (1/γpole − αpole )/(1 − αpole ) and βpole =
1/γpole .
If in addition, the form factors f+ and f0 must obey a
relation, valid at large recoil and in the heavy quark limit,
then αpole = 1/γpole [11] (βpole = αpole and δpole = 0 in
this case). Equation (10) becomes:

∞

f+ (t) =

ak (t0 ) z k (t, t0 ),

k=0

is based on earlier considerations [8]. The function
P (t) = z(t, m2Ds∗ ) has a zero at the Ds∗ pole mass and
|P | = 1 along the unit circle; Φ is given by:

where χV can be obtained from dispersion relations using
perturbative QCD and depends on u = ms /mc [9]. At
leading order, with u = 0 [10],
χV =

32π 2 m2c

(8)

The choice of P and Φ is such that:
∞
X
a2k (t0 ) ≤ 1.

(9)

Having measured the first coefficients of this expansion,
Eq. (9) can constrain the others. This constraint, which
depends on χV , may have to be abandoned in the case of
charm decays as the charm-quark mass may not be large
enough to prevent the previous evaluation of χV from
receiving large 1/mc and QCD corrections. However the
parameterization given in Eq. (6) remains valid and it
has been compared [7] with available measurements. The
first two terms in the expansion were sufficient to describe
the data.
Model-dependent parameterizations

A less general approach assumes that the q 2 variation
of f+ (q 2 ) is governed mainly by the Ds∗ pole and that
the other contributions can be accounted for by adding
another effective pole at a higher mass [11]:

known as the modified pole ansatz. Initially an even

which considered only the contribution from the Ds∗ pole.
In the following, the pole mass entering in

is fitted. Note that such an effective pole mass value has
no clear physical interpretation and that the proposed q 2

The obtained value may nonetheless be useful for comparison with results from different experiments.

Values of the parameters that determine f+ (q 2 ) were
obtained initially from constituent quark models and
from QCD sum rules. These two approaches have an intrinsically limited accuracy. In this respect, results from
lattice QCD computations are more promising because
their accuracy is mainly limited by available computing
resources.
1.

Quark Models

Quark model calculations estimate meson wave functions and use them to compute the matrix elements that
appear in the hadronic current. There are a large variety
of theoretical calculations [12]. Among these models we
have selected the ISGW model [13], simply because it is
widely used to simulate heavy hadron semileptonic decays. This model was expected to be valid in the vicinity
2
, a region of maximum overlap between the iniof qmax
tial and final meson wave functions. In ISGW2 [14] the
exponential q 2 dependence of the form factor has been
replaced by another parameterization, with a dipole behavior, expected to be valid over a larger q 2 range:

QCD sum rules

QCD sum rules [15] and their extension on the light
cone [16], are expected to be valid at low q 2 . Using a
value of 150 MeV for the strange quark mass, one obtains
[16]:
f+ (0) = 0.78 ± 0.11 and αpole = −0.07+0.15

(14)

using the modified pole ansatz. The uncertainty of f+ (0)
is estimated to be of order 15%, and the q 2 dependence
is expected to be dominated by a single pole at the Ds∗
mass because the value of αpole is compatible with zero.
3.

Lattice QCD

Lattice QCD computation is the only approach able
to compute f+ (q 2 ) from first principles. Current results
must be extrapolated to physical values of light quark
masses and corrected for finite lattice size and discritization effects. There have been several evaluations of
f+ (q 2 ) for different values of the momentum transfer in
the quenched approximation [17, 18]. These results have
been combined [17], giving f+ (0) = 0.73 ± 0.07. The
first unquenched calculation has been published recently
[19]: f+ (0) = 0.73 ± 0.03 ± 0.07 and αpole = 0.50 ± 0.04,
using the modified pole ansatz to parameterized the q 2
dependence of the form factor.

this analysis are summarized in Table I, along with their
corresponding parameters and expected values, where
available.
III.

THE BABAR DETECTOR AND DATASET

A detailed description of the BABAR detector and of the
algorithms used for charged and neutral particle reconstruction and identification is provided elsewhere [20, 21].
Charged particles are reconstructed by matching hits
in the 5-layer double-sided silicon vertex tracker (SVT)

with track elements in the 40-layer drift chamber (DCH),
which is filled with a gas mixture of helium and isobutane. Slow particles which do not leave enough hits in the
DCH due to the bending in the 1.5-T magnetic field, are
reconstructed in the SVT. Charged hadron identification
is performed combining the measurements of the energy
deposition in the SVT and in the DCH with the information from the Cherenkov detector (DIRC). Photons are
detected and measured in the CsI(Tl) electro-magnetic
calorimeter (EMC). Electrons are identified by the ratio of the track momentum to the associated energy deposited in the EMC, the transverse profile of the shower,
the energy loss in the DCH, and the Cherenkov angle in
the DIRC. Muons are identified in the instrumented flux
return, composed of resistive plate chambers interleaved
with layers of steel and brass.
The results presented here are obtained using a total integrated luminosity of 75 fb−1 registered by the
BABAR detector during the years 2000-2002. Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation samples of Υ (4S) decays, charm and
other light quark pairs from continuum equivalent, respectively, to 2.8, 1.2 and 0.7 times the data statistics,
respectively, have been generated using GEANT4 [22].
These are used mainly to evaluate background components. Quark fragmentation, in continuum events, is described using the JETSET package [23]. The MC distributions have been rescaled to the data sample luminosity,
using the expected cross sections of the different components (1.3nb for cc, 0.525 nb for B + B − and B 0 B̄ 0 , 2.09nb
for light uū, dd ̄ and ss̄ quark events). Dedicated samples of pure signal events, equivalent to seven times the
data statistics, are used to correct measurements for efficiency and finite resolution effects. They have been generated using the modified pole parameterization ansatz
for f+ (q 2 ) with αpole = 0.50. Radiative decays (D0 →
K − e+ νe γ) are modeled by PHOTOS [24]. To account for
one of the most important sources of background, a special event sample with, in each event, at least one cascade
decay D∗+ → D0 π + , D0 → K − π 0 e+ νe (or its charge
conjugate) has been generated with a parameterization
of the form factors in agreement with measurements from
the FOCUS collaboration [25]. Events with a D∗+ and
a D0 decaying into K − π + or K − π + π 0 have been reconstructed in data and simulation. These control samples
have been used to adjust the c-quark fragmentation distribution and the kinematic characteristics of particles
accompanying the D meson in order to better match the
data. They have been used also to measure the reconstruction accuracy on the missing neutrino momentum.

IV.

SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION

We reconstruct D0 → K − e+ νe (γ) decays in e+ e− →
cc̄ events where the D0 originates from the D∗+ → D0 π + .
The main sources of background arise from events with
a kaon and electron candidate. Such events come from
Υ (4S) decays and the continuum production of charmed

9
hadrons. Their contribution is reduced using variables
sensitive to the particle production characteristics that
are different for signal and background events.

Signal selection

Charged and neutral particles are boosted to the center of mass system (c.m.) and the event thrust axis is
determined. The direction of this axis is required to be
in the interval | cos(θthrust )| < 0.6 to minimize the loss of
particles in regions close to the beam axis. A plane perpendicular to the thrust axis is used to define two hemispheres, equivalent to the two jets produced by quark
fragmentation. In each hemisphere, we search for pairs
of oppositely charged leptons and kaons. For the charged
lepton candidates we consider only electrons or positrons
with c.m. momentum greater than 0.5 GeV/c.
Since the νe momentum is unmeasured, a kinematic
fit is performed, constraining the invariant mass of the
candidate e+ K − νe system to the D0 mass. In this fit,
the D0 momentum and the neutrino energy are estimated
from the other particles measured in the event. The D0
direction is taken as the direction opposite to the sum of
the momenta of all reconstructed particles in the event,
except for the kaon and the positron associated with the
signal candidate. The energy of the jet is determined
from the total c.m. energy and from the measured masses
of the two jets. The neutrino energy is estimated as the
difference between the total energy of the jet and the
sum of the energies of all reconstructed particles in the
hemisphere. A correction, which depends on the value
of the missing energy measured in the opposite jet, is
applied to account for the presence of missing energy due
to particles escaping detection, even in the absence of a
neutrino from the D0 decay.
The D0 candidate is retained if the χ2 probability of
the kinematic fit exceeds 10−3 . Detector performance for
the reconstruction of the D0 direction and for the missing
energy are measured using events in which the D0 decays
into K − π + . Corrections are applied to account for observed differences between data and simulation. Each
D0 candidate is combined with a charged pion, with the
same charge as the lepton, and situated in the same hemisphere. The mass difference δ(m) = m(D0 π + ) − m(D0 )
is evaluated and is shown in Fig. 1. This distribution contains events which in addition pass the requirements on
the Fisher discriminant FB B̄ suppressing B B̄ background
and also give a satisfactory kinematic fit constraining the
invariant mass . This last requirement is the reason of
the slow decrease of the δ(m) distribution. At large δ(m)
values, a small excess of background is measured in data
and the simulation is rescaled accordingly. Only events
with δ(m) < 0.16 GeV/c2 are used in the analysis.

B.

Background rejection

Background events arise from Υ (4S) decays and
hadronic events from the continuum. Three variables
are used to reduce the contribution from B B̄ events:
R2 (the ratio between the second and zeroth order FoxWolfram moments [26]), the total charged and neutral
multiplicity and the momentum of the soft pion (πs ) from
the D∗+ . These variables exploit the topological differences between events with B decays and events with cc̄
fragmentation. The particle distribution in Υ (4S) decay
events tends to be isotropic as the B mesons are produced near threshold, while the distribution in cc̄ events
is jet-like as the c.m. energy is well above the charm
threshold. This also results in a softer D∗+ momentum
spectrum in Υ (4S) decays compared to cc̄ events.
Corresponding distributions of these variables for signal and background events are given in Fig. 2. These
variables have been combined linearly in a Fisher discriminant. The requirement FB B̄ > 0.5 retains 65% of
signal and 6% of B B̄-background events.

Background events from the continuum arise mainly
from charm particles as requiring an electron and a kaon
reduces the contribution from light-quark flavors to a low
level. Because charm hadrons take a large fraction of the
charm quark energy charm decay products have higher
average energies and different angular distributions (relative to the thrust axis or to the D direction) compared
with other particles in the hemisphere emitted from the
hadronization of the c and c quarks. These other particles are referred to as "spectator" in the following; the
"leading" particle is the one with the largest momentum.
To reduce background from cc̄ events, the following variables are used:
• the D0 momentum;
• the spectator system mass, msp. , which has lower
values for signal events;
• the direction of the spectator system momentum
relative to the thrust axis cos θsp.−thrust ;
• the momentum of the leading spectator track;

The first six variables depend on the properties of c-quark
hadronization whereas the last two are related to decay characteristics of the signal. Distributions for four
of the most discriminating variables are given in Fig. 3.
D0 → K − π + events have been used to tune the simulation parameters so that distributions of the variables
used to reject background agree with those measured
with data events. These eight variables have been combined linearly into a Fisher discriminant variable (Fcc )
and events have been kept for values above 0. This selection retains 77% of signal events that were kept by the
previous selection requirement and rejecting 66% of the
background (Fig. 4).
The remaining background from cc̄-events can be divided into peaking (60%) and non-peaking (40%) candi-

q 2 measurement

To improve the accuracy of the reconstructed D0 momentum, the nominal D∗+ mass is added as a constraint
in the previous fit and only events with a χ2 probability higher than 1% are kept (Fig. 1 is obtained requiring
only that the fit has converged). The measured qr2 distri2
bution, where qr2 = (pD − pK ) , is given in Fig. 5. There

are 85260 selected D candidates containing an estimated
number of 11280 background events. The non-peaking
component comprises 54% of the background.
To obtain the true q 2 distribution, the measured one
has to be corrected for selection efficiency and detector
resolution effects. This is done using an unfolding algorithm based on MC simulation of these effects.
The variation of the selection efficiency as a function of q 2 is given in Fig. 6. The resolution of the
q 2 measurement for signal events is obtained from MC

simulation. The resolution function can fitted by the
sum of two Gaussian functions, with standard deviations
σ1 = 0.066 GeV2 and σ2 = 0.219 GeV2 , respectively.
The narrow component corresponds to 40% of the events.
To obtain the unfolded q 2 distribution for signal events,
corrected for resolution and acceptance effects, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [27] of the resolution matrix has been used. This method uses a two-dimensional
matrix which relates the generated q 2 distribution to the
detected distribution, qr2 , as input. After subtracting the
estimated background contribution, the measured binned
qr2 distribution is linearly transformed into the unfolded
q 2 distribution. This approach provides the full covariance matrix for the bin contents of the unfolded distribution. Singular values (SV) are ordered by decreasing
values. These values contain the information needed to
transform the measured distribution into the unfolded
spectrum, along with statistical uncertainties from fluctuations. Not all SV are relevant; non-significant values
have zero mean and standard deviation equal to unity
[27]. Using toy simulations, we find that seven SV have
to be kept with events distributed over ten bins. Because
the measurement of the form-factor parameters relies on
the measured qr2 distribution, it does not require unfolding, and is independent of this particular choice.

RESULTS ON THE Q2 DEPENDENCE OF
THE HADRONIC FORM FACTOR

The unfolded q 2 distribution, normalized to unity, is
presented in Fig. 7 and in Table II. Also given in this
table are the statistical and total uncertainties and the
correlations of the data in the ten bins. Figure 7 shows
the result of fits to the data for two parameterizations of
the form factor with a single free parameter, the simple
pole and the modified pole ansatz. Both fitted distributions agree well with the data.
A summary of these and other form factor parameterizations is given in Table III. These results will be
discussed in detail in Section V B.
The fit to a model is done by comparing the number
of events measured in a given bin of q 2 with the expectation from the exact analytic integration of the expression

pK (q 2 ) f+ (q 2 ) over the bin range, with the overall

normalization left free. The result of the fit corresponding to the parameterization of the form factor using two
parameters (see Eq. 10) is given in Fig. 8.

Systematic Uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties of the form factor parameters are likely to originate from imperfect simulation of

of the size of correction on the fit results, and adopt the

c-quark hadronization tuning

The signal selection is based on variables related to
c-quark fragmentation and decay properties of signal
events. Simulated events have been weighted to agree
with the distributions observed in data. Weights have
been obtained using events with a reconstructed D0 decaying into K − π + . After applying these corrections,
the distribution of the Fisher discriminant that contains
these variables is compared for data and simulation. The
remaining difference is used to evaluate the corresponding systematic uncertainty. It corresponds to the variations on fitted quantities obtained by correcting or not

14
for this difference, which is below 5% over the range of
this variable.

3.

Resolution on q 2

To measure possible differences between data and
simulation on the q 2 reconstruction accuracy, D0 →
K − π + π 0 events are used again. Distributions of the difference qr2 − q 2 , obtained by selecting events in a given
bin of q 2 are compared. These distributions are systematically slightly narrower for simulated events and the
fraction of events in the distant tails are higher for data
(see Fig. 9).
With the D0 → K − π + sample we study, in data and
simulation, the accuracy of the D0 direction and missing
energy reconstruction for the D0 → K − e+ νe analysis.
This information is used in the mass-constrained fits and
thus influences the q 2 reconstruction. Once the simulation is tuned to reproduce the results obtained on data
for these parameters, the q 2 resolution distributions agree
very well, as shown in Fig. 9. One half of the measured
variation on the fitted parameters from these corrections
has been taken as a systematic uncertainty.

It is important to verify that the q 2 variation of the
selection efficiency is well described by the simulation.
This is done by analyzing D0 → K − π + π 0 as if they were
K − e+ νe events. The two photons from the π 0 are removed and events are reconstructed using the algorithm
applied to the semileptonic D0 decay. The "missing" π 0
and the charged pion play, respectively, the roles of the
neutrino and the electron. To preserve the correct kinematic limits, it is necessary to take into account that
the "fake" neutrino has the π 0 mass and that the "fake"
electron has the π + mass.
Data and simulated events, which satisfy the same
analysis selection criteria as for Keνe , have been compared. For this test, the cos(θe ) and pe are removed from
the Fisher discriminant, because distributions for these
two variables are different from the signal events.
The ratio of efficiencies measured in data and simulation is fit with a linear expression in q 2 . The corresponding slope, (0.71±0.68)%, indicates that there is no significant bias when the event selection criteria are applied.
The measured slope is used to define a correction and to
estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty.

kaons. These corrections have been applied and the observed variation has been taken as the estimate of the
systematic uncertainty.

5.

Background estimate

The background under the D∗+ signal has two components that have, respectively, non-peaking and peaking
behavior.
The non-peaking background originates from non-cc
events and from continuum charm events in which the
πs candidate does not come from a cascading D∗+ . By
comparing data and simulated event rates for δ(m) >
0.18 GeV/c2 (see Fig. 1), a correction of 1.05 is determined from simulation for the non-peaking background.
This correction is applied and an uncertainty of ±0.05 is
used as the corresponding systematic uncertainty.
Events which include a slow pion originating from D∗+
decay contribute in several ways to the peaking background. The production rate of D∗+ mesons in the simulation is in agreement with expectations based on measurements from CLEO [28]. The uncertainty of ±0.06 on
this comparison is dominated by the systematic uncertainty from the CLEO result.
To study the remaining effects, the peaking background components have been divided according to the
process from which they originate and have been ordered
by decreasing level of importance:
• the K − and the electron originate from a D0 decay (54%). The main source comes from D0 →
K − π 0 e+ νe . We have corrected the decay branching fraction used for this channel in the MC (2.02%)
using recent measurements (2.17 ± 0.16% [1]). The
uncertainty on this value has been used to evaluate
the corresponding systematic uncertainty.
• the electron comes from a converted photon or a
Dalitz decay (24%). It has been assumed that the
simulation correctly accounts for this component;
• the K − does not originate from a charm hadron
(14%). This happens usually when there is another
negative charged kaon accompanying the D∗+ . We
have studied the production of charged kaon accompanying a D∗+ using D0 → K − π + events and measure a correction factor of 0.87±0.02 and 0.53±0.02,
respectively, for same sign and opposite sign KD∗ pairs. The simulation is modified accordingly
and the remaining systematic uncertainty from this
source becomes negligible;
• fake kaon candidate (mainly pions) (6%) or fake
electrons (1%). Differences between data and MC
on the evaluation of fake rates have been studied
in BABAR. As this affects small components of the

Fitting procedure and radiative events

To fit form factor parameters we compare the number of expected events in each bin with the measured
one after all corrections. In this approach it is always
assumed that the q 2 variation of f+ (q 2 ) is given exactly by the form factor parameterization. This hypothesis is not correct, a priori, for radiative decays as
q 2 = (pD − pK )2 = (pe + pν + pγ )2 is not (perhaps) equal
to the variable that enters in f+ for such decays. PHOTOS is used to generate decays with additional photons
and the modified pole ansatz is taken to parameterize
the hadronic form factor in signal events. To quantify
possible distortion of the fit we compare the fitted value
of a form factor parameter with the one obtained from a
fit to the generated q 2 distribution (see Table IV).
TABLE IV: Measured differences between the nominal and
fitted values of parameters. Quoted uncertainties correspond
to MC statistics. The last column gives the impact of the
radiative effects on the form factor measurements as predicted
by PHOTOS.

Corresponding corrections, given in the second column

To evaluate the importance of corrections induced by
radiative effects, we have compared also the fitted value
of a parameter on q 2 distributions generated with and
without using PHOTOS. Measured differences are given
in the last column of Table IV. They have not been
applied to the values quoted in Table III for the different
parameters. We measure also that radiative effects affect
mainly the fraction of the decay spectrum in the first bin
in Table II which has to be increased by 0.0012 to correct
for this effect.

Control of the statistical accuracy in the SVD approach

Once the number of SV is fixed, one must verify that
the statistical precision obtained for each binned unfolded value is correct and if biases generated by removing information are under control. These studies are done
with toy simulations. One observes that the uncertainty

obtained from a fit of the unfolded distribution is underestimated by a factor which depends on the statistics
of simulated events and is ∼ 1.06 in the present analysis. Pull distributions indicate also that the unfolded
values, in each bin, have biases which are below 10% of
the statistical uncertainty. Similar studies are done for
the determination of form factor parameters.

8.

Summary of systematic errors

The systematic uncertainties for determining form factor parameters are summarized in Table V.
The systematic error matrix for the ten unfolded values is computed by considering, in turn, each source of
uncertainty and by measuring the variation, δi , of the corresponding unfolded value in each bin (i). The elements
of the uncertainty matrix are the sum, over all sources
of systematic uncertainty, of the quantities δi * δj . The
total error matrix is evaluated as the sum of the matrices
corresponding, respectively, to statistical and systematic
uncertainties.

B.

Comparison with expectations and with other
measurements

The summary of the fits to the normalized q 2 distributions are presented in Table III. As long as we allow
the form factor parameters to be free in the fit, the fitted distributions agree well with the data and it is not
possible to reject any of the parameterizations.
However, if the form factor parameters are constrained
to specific predicted values, the agreement is not good.
For the ISGW2 model, the predicted dependence of the
form factor on q 2 disagrees with the data and the fitted value of the parameter αI differs from the predicted
value, αI = 0.104 GeV−2 by more than a factor two.
As observed by previous experiments, the simple pole
model ansatz, with mpole = mDs∗ = 2.112 GeV/c2 does
not reproduce the measurements. This means that the
contribution from the continuum DK interaction cannot be neglected. If one introduces a second parameter δpole to account for contributions from an effective

pole at higher mass (see Eq. 10) the two parameters are
fully correlated and there is no unique solution, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The modified pole ansatz corresponds
to δpole = 0.
In Table VI the fitted parameters for the simple pole
ansatz and the modified pole [11] ansatz are compared
for different experiments. The fitted pole masses are all
well below the mass of the Ds∗ meson. The results presented here are consistent within the stated uncertainties
with earlier measurements. Except for the BELLE measurement, all other measurements appear to favor a value
of αpole that is lower than the value predicted by lattice
QCD, namely αpole = 0.50 ± 0.04.

In Fig. 10, the dependence of the form factor on q 2 is
presented. The data are compared to earlier measurements by the FOCUS experiment, as well as with predictions from lattice QCD calculations [19]. As stated
above, the data favor a somewhat lower value for αpole .
The data have also been mapped into the variable z.
Figure 11 shows the product P × Φ × f+ as a function of
z. By convention, this quantity is constrained to unity
at z = zmax , which corresponds to q 2 = 0. We perform a
fit to a polynomial, P × Φ × f+ ∼ 1 + r1 z + r2 z 2 . The
data are compatible with a linear dependence, which is
fully consistent with the modified pole ansatz for f+ (q 2 ),
as illustrated in Fig. 11.

Selection of candidate signal events

The selection of D0 → K − e+ νe candidates is explained
in section IV A. For the rate measurement, the constraint on the D∗+ mass is not applied and also the
momentum of the soft pion candidate is not included
in the Fisher discriminant variable designed to suppress
B B̄-background. Since generic simulated signal events
used in this measurement have been generated with the
ISGW2 model, they have been weighted so that their q 2
distribution agrees with the measurement presented in
this paper. Furthermore, we require for the Fisher discriminant FB B̄ > 0 and restrict δ(m) < 0.16 GeV/c2 .
After background subtraction, there remain 76283 ± 323
and 95302 ± 309 events in data and simulation, respectively. This gives:

= 0.8004 ± 0.0043.

discriminant to suppress B B̄-events, on the thrust axis
direction and on other common variables are applied.
Events are also analyzed in the same way, with two hemispheres defined from the thrust axis. In each hemisphere
a D0 candidate is reconstructed by combining a charged
K with a pion of opposite sign. These tracks have to
form a vertex and the Kπ mass must be within the range
[1.77, 1.95] GeV/c2 . Another charged pion of appropriate sign is added to form a D∗+ candidate.
In addition, the following selection criteria are used:
• the fraction of the beam momentum, in the c.m.
frame, taken by the D∗ candidate must exceed 0.48
to remove contributions from B B̄ events;

• the measured D0 mass must be in the range between 1.83 and 1.89 GeV/c2 . This requirement
eliminates possible contributions from remaining
D0 → K − K + or π + π − decays (see Fig. 12-a);
• the vertex fit for the D0 and D∗ have to converge.

The δ(m) distribution for candidate events is shown in
Fig. 12-c. The following components contribute to the
D∗+ signal (see Fig. 12-b):
• D0 → K − π + with no extra photon;
• D0 → K − π + with at least one extra photon;

• D0 → K − π + (γ) where the π + , mainly from the
D∗+ , decays into a muon.

The impact of the selection requirement on the reconstructed Kπ mass, has been studied. The Kπ mass distribution signal for simulated events (not including radiative photons) is compared with the corresponding distribution obtained with data after background subtraction.
The background contributions are taken from the simulation. The fraction of D0 candidates in the selected mass
range (between 1.83 and 1.89 GeV/c2 ) is (97.64 ± 0.25)%
in MC and (97.13 ± 0.29)% in data events. The ratio of

The δ(m) distribution corresponding to other event

such that this difference has a small effect on the measured number of D∗+ events in data and in the simulation. There are 166960±409 and 134537±374 candidates
selected in the interval δ(m) ∈ [0.142, 0.149] GeV/c2 for

Systematic uncertainties on RD

− +

Since D → K e νe events have been selected using
a selection requirement on δ(m), we need to confirm that
the distribution of this variable is similar in data and
simulation. This is checked by comparing the distributions obtained with D0 → K − π + π 0 events analyzed as
if they were semileptonic decays. The δ(m) distributions
are compared in Fig. 13. Below 0.16 GeV/c2 , there are
0.93552±0.00066 of the D∗+ candidates in the simulation
and 0.93219 ± 0.00078 for data. The corresponding ratio
of efficiencies (MC/data) is equal to 1.0036 ± 0.0010.
Using D0 → K − π + π 0 events, we also measure the difference between the fraction of events retained after the
mass-constrained fits. Namely, it is 0.98038 ± 0.00037 in
the simulation compared to 0.97438 ± 0.00049 in data.
The relative efficiency (MC/data) for this selection is
1.0062 ± 0.0006. Based on these two measured corrections the ratio of efficiencies are:
ǫ(D0 → K − e+ νe )MC
= 1.0098 ± 0.0011.
(21)
ǫ(D0 → K − e+ νe )data
The quoted uncertainties, in this section, are of statistical
origin and will be included in the statistical uncertainty
on RD . Other differences between the two analyzed channels are considered in the following section and contribute
to systematic uncertainties.

A summary of the systematic uncertainties on RD are
given in Table VII. They originate from selection criteria
which are different for the two channels. Some of these
uncertainties are the same as those already considered
for the determination of the q 2 variation of f+ .

1.

Correlated systematic uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties on the decay rate coming
from effects that contribute in the measurement of the
q 2 dependence of f+ (q 2 ) are evaluated in Section V A
and the full covariance matrix for the measurements of
the number of D0 → K − e+ νe signal events and the fraction of the decay spectrum fitted in each of the ten bins
is determined. Among the sources of systematic uncertainties, listed in Table V, those corresponding to:
• the reconstruction algorithm,
• the tuning of the resolution on q 2 ,
• the corrections applied on electron identification,
and

20
• the background normalization
are taken as common sources. Corresponding relative
uncertainties on RD are given in Table VII.
Other systematic uncertainties contributing to the
form factor measurement also affect the reference channel and so their effects on RD cancel. They are related to
the c-hadronization tuning and to the corrections applied
on the kaon identification.

2.

Selection requirement on the Fisher discriminant

The stability of the fraction of D0 → K − e+ νe events
selected in data and in simulation as a function of the
Fisher discriminant, Fcc , designed to suppress cc̄ background has been examined. This is done by comparing
the distributions of this variable measured in data and in
simulation as given in Fig. 4 for two selected intervals in
δ(m).
The value corresponding to Fcc > 0 and for events selected in the range δ(m) < 0.16 GeV/c2 is used as the
central result and half the difference between the measurements corresponding to Fcc greater than −0.25 and +
0.25 is taken as systematic uncertainty. This range corresponds to a relative change of 40% of the efficiency for
signal events, and gives an uncertainty of ±0.0061 on the
ratio of data and simulated signal candidates.

3.

D∗+ counting in D0 → K − π +

D∗+ candidates are selected in the range δ(m) ∈
[0.142, 0.149] GeV/c2 . From the simulation it is expected that the fraction of signal events outside this
interval is equal to 1.4%. Even though the D∗+ signal is slightly narrower in the simulation, there is not
a large discrepancy in the tails. The fraction of signal
events measured in the sidebands δ(m) ∈ [0.140, 0.142]⊕
[0.149, 0.150] GeV/c2 is 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, for
simulation and data. An uncertainty of ±0.004, corresponding to 30% uncertainty on the total fraction of
events outside the selected δ(m) interval is assumed.

Using the world average for the branching fraction
BR(D0 → K − π + ) = (3.80 ± 0.07)% [1], gives BR(D0 →

the last quoted uncertainty corresponds to the accuracy

SUMMARY

The decay rate distribution for the channel D0 →
K e νe (γ) has been measured in ten bins in Table II.
Several theoretical expectations for the variation of this
form factor with q 2 have been considered and values for
the corresponding parameters have been obtained (see
Table III). The q 2 variation of the form factor can be
parameterized with a single parameter using different expressions. The ISGW2 model with expected values for
the parameters is excluded, as is the pole mass parameterization with mpole = mDs∗ .
The value of the decay branching fraction has been also
measured independent of a model.
Combining these measurements, the value of the
hadronic form factor is obtained:

time and I = 0 max p~K (q 2 ) f+ (q 2 )/f+ (0) dq 2 . To
account for the variation of the form factor within one
bin, and in particular to extrapolate the result at q 2 = 0,
the pole mass and the modified pole ansatze have been
used; the corresponding values obtained for f+ (0) differ
by 0.002. Taking the average between these two values
and including their difference in the systematic uncertainty, this gives
f+ (0) = 0.727 ± 0.007 ± 0.005 ± 0.007,

(24)

where the last quoted uncertainty corresponds to the accuracy on BR(D0 → K − π + ), τD0 and |Vcs |. It agrees
with expectations and in particular with LQCD computations [19]. Using the z expansion of Eq. (6), we find
a0 = (2.98 ± 0.01 ± 0.03 ± 0.03) × 10−2 .
The high accuracy of the present measurement will be
a reference test for improved lattice determinations of the
q 2 variation of f+ .
