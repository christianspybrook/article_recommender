Abstract
This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which
the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita α-contexts (in which
the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of ZimmermannHuisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or
the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the
notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective
Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of categories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.
We end up with applications of Morita α-contexts to ∗-modules and injective right
wide Morita contexts.

Introduction

Morita contexts, in general, and (semi-)strict Morita contexts (with surjective connecting bilinear morphisms), in particular, were extensively studied and developed exponentially during the last few decades (e.g. [AGH-Z1997]). However, we sincerely feel that
there is a gap in the literature on injective Morita contexts (i.e. those with injective connecting bilinear morphisms). Apart from the results in [Nau1994-a], [Nau1994-b] (where
the second author initially explored this notion) and from an application to Grothendieck
groups in the recent paper ([Nau2004]), it seems that injective Morita contexts were not
studied systematically at all.

We noticed that in several results of ([Nau1993], [Nau1994-a] and [Nau1994-b]) that are
related to Morita contexts, only one trace ideal is used. Observing this fact, we introduce
the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data and investigate them. Several results
are proved then for injective Morita semi contexts and/or injective Morita data.
Consider a Morita datum M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ), with not necessarily compatible bimodule morphisms <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T and <, >S : Q ⊗T P → S. We say that M is
injective, iff <, >T and <, >S are injective, and to be a Morita α-datum, iff the associated
dual pairings Pl := (Q, T P ), Pr := (Q, PS ), Ql := (P, S Q) and Qr := (P, QT ) satisfy
the α-condition (which is closely related to the notion of local projectivity in the sense of
Zimmermann-Huisgen [Z-H1976]). The α-condition was introduced in [AG-TL2001] and
further investigated by the first author in [Abu2005].
While (semi-)strict unital Morita contexts induce equivalences between the whole module categories of the rings under consideration, we show in this paper how injective Morita
(semi-)contexts and injective Morita data play an important role in establishing equivalences between suitable intersecting subcategories of module categories (e.g. intersections
of subcategories that are localized/colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum with subcategories of static/adstatic modules, etc.). Our main applications in addition to equivalences related to the Kato-Ohtake-Müller localization-colocalization theory (developed in
[Kat1978], [KO1979] and [Mül1974]), will be to ∗-modules (introduced by Menini and Orsatti [MO1989]) and to right wide Morita contexts (introduced by F. Castaño Iglesias and
J. Gómez-Torrecillas [C-IG-T1995]).
Most of our results will be stated for left modules, while deriving the "dual" versions for
right modules is left to the interested reader. Moreover, for Morita contexts, some results
are stated/proved for only one of the Morita semi-contexts, as the ones corresponding to
the second semi-context can be obtained analogously. For the convenience of the reader, we
tried to make the paper self-contained, so that it can serve as a reference on injective Morita
(semi-)contexts and their applications. In this respect, and for the sake of completeness, we
have included some previous results of the authors that are (in most cases) either provided
with new shorter proofs, or are obtained under weaker conditions.
This paper is organized as follows: After this brief introduction, we give in Section 2
some preliminaries including the basic properties of dual α-pairings, which play a central
role in rest of the work. The notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data are introduced in Section 3, where we clarify their relations with the dual pairings and the so-called
elementary rngs. Injective Morita (semi-)contexts appear in Section 4, where we study
their interplay with dual α-pairings and provide some examples and a counter-example.
In Section 5 we include some observations regarding static and adstatic modules and use
them to obtain equivalences among suitable intersecting subcategories of modules related
to a Morita (semi-)context. In the last section, more applications are presented, mainly to
subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by a trace ideal of an injective
Morita (semi-)context, to ∗-modules and to injective right wide Morita contexts.

Preliminaries

Throughout, R denotes a commutative ring with 1R 6= 0R and A, A′ , B, B ′ are unital
R-algebras. We have reserved the term "ring" for an associative ring with a multiplicative
unity, and we will use the term "rng" for a general associative ring (not necessarily with
unity). All modules over rings are assumed to be unitary, and ring morphisms are assumed
to respect multiplicative unities. If T and S are categories, then we write T ≤ S (T ≤ S)
to mean that T is a (full) subcategory of S, and T ≈ S to indicate that T and S are
equivalent.

Rngs and their modules
2.1. By an A-rng (T, μT ), we mean an (A, A)-bimodule T with an (A, A)-bilinear morphism μT : T ⊗A T → T, such that μT ◦ (μT ⊗A idT ) = μT ◦ (idT ⊗A μT ). We call an A-rng
(T, μT ) an A-ring, iff there exists in addition an (A, A)-bilinear morphism ηT : A → T,
called the unity map, such that μT ◦ (ηT ⊗A idT ) = θlT and μT ◦ (idT ⊗A η T ) = θrT (where
θlT

θrT

A ⊗A T ≃ T and T ⊗A A ≃ T are the canonical isomorphisms). So, an A-ring is a unital
A-rng; and an A-rng is (roughly speaking) an A-ring not necessarily with unity.
2.2. A morphism of rngs (ψ : δ) : (T : A) → (T ′ : A′ ) consists of a morphism of R-algebras
(A,A′ )
δ : A → A′ and an (A, A)-bilinear morphism ψ : T → T ′ , such that μT ′ ◦χ(T ′ ,T ′ ) ◦(ψ ⊗A ψ) =
(A,A′ )

ψ ◦ μT (where χ(T ′ ,T ′ ) : T ′ ⊗A T ′ → T ′ ⊗A′ T ′ is the canonical map induced by δ). By RNG
we denote the category of associative rngs with morphisms being rng morphisms, and
by URNG < RNG the (non-full) subcategory of unital rings with morphisms being the
morphisms in RNG which respect multiplicative unities.
2.3. Let (T, μT ) be an A-rng. By a left T -module we mean a left A-module N with a left
N
N
N
A-linear morphism φN
T : T ⊗A N → N, such that φT ◦ (μT ⊗A idN ) = φT ◦ (idT ⊗A φT ). For
left T -modules M, N, we call a left A-linear morphism f : M → N a T -linear morphism,
iff f (tm) = tf (m) for all t ∈ T. The category of left T -modules and left T -linear morphisms
is denoted by T M. The category MT of right T -modules is defined analogously. Let (T : A)
and (T ′ : A′ ) be rngs. We call an (A, A′ )-bimodule N a (T, T ′ )-bimodule, iff (N, φN
T ) is
N
N
N
′
a left T -module and (N, φT ′ ) is a right T -module, such that φT ′ ◦ (φT ⊗A′ idT ′ ) = φN
T ◦

).
For
(T,
T
)-bimodules
M,
N,
we
call
an
(A,
A
)-bilinear
morphism
f
:
M
→
N
(idT ⊗A φN
′
T
′
′
′
(T, T )-bilinear, provided f is left T -linear and right T -linear. The category of (T, T )bimodules is denoted by T MT ′ . In particular, for any A-rng T, a left (right) T -module
M has a canonical structure of a unitary right (left) S-module, where S := End(T M)op
(S := End(MT )); and moreover, with this structure M becomes a (T, S)-bimodule (an
(S, T )-bimodule).
Remark 2.4. Similarly, one can define rngs over arbitrary (not-necessarily unital) ground
rngs and rng morphisms between them. Moreover, one can define (bi)modules over such
rngs and (bi)linear morphisms between them.

Notation. Let T be an A-rng. We write T U (UT ) to denote that U is a left (right) T module. For a left (right) T -module T U, we consider the set ∗ U := HomT − (U, T ) (U ∗ :=
Hom−T (U, T )) of all left (right) T -linear morphisms from U to T with the canonical right
(left) T -module structure.

Generators and cogenerators
Definition 2.5. Let T be an A-rng. For a left T -module T U consider the following subclasses of T M :
Gen(T U)
Cogen(T U)
Pres(T U)
Copres(T U)

:=
:=
:=
:=

{T V | ∃ a set Λ and an exact sequence U (Λ) → V → 0};
{T W | ∃ a set Λ and an exact sequence 0 → W → U Λ };
{T V | ∃ sets Λ1 , Λ2 and an exact sequence U (Λ2 ) → U (Λ1 ) → V → 0};
{T W | ∃ sets Λ1 , Λ2 and an exact sequence 0 → W → U Λ1 → U Λ2 };

A left T -module in Gen(T U) (respectively Cogen(T U), Pres(T U), Copres(T U)) is said to be
U-generated (respectively U-cogenerated, U-presented, U-copresented). Moreover,
we say that T U is a generator (respectively cogenerator, presentor, copresentor), iff
Gen(T U) = T M (respectively Cogen(T U) = T M, Pres(T U) = T M, Copres(T U) = T M).

Dual α-pairings
In what follows we recall the definition and properties of dual α-pairings introduced
in [AG-TL2001, Definition 2.3.] and studied further in [Abu2005].
2.6. Let T be an A-rng. A dual left T -pairing Pl = (V, T W ) consists of a left T -module
W and a right T -module V with a right T -linear morphism κPl : V → ∗ W (equivalently
a left T -linear morphism χPl : W → V ∗ ). For dual left pairings Pl = (V, T W ), P′l = (V ′ ,
′
′
′
T ′ W ), a morphism of dual left pairings (ξ, θ) : (V , W ) → (V, W ) consists of a triple
(ξ, θ : ς) : (V,

TW)

→ (V ′ ,

T′W

′

),

where ξ : V → V ′ and θ : W ′ → W are T -linear and ς : T → T ′ is a morphism of rngs,
such that considering the induced maps <, >T : V × W → T and <, >T ′ : V ′ × W ′ → T ′ we
have
(1)
< ξ(v), w ′ >T ′ = ς(< v, θ(w ′) >T ) for all v ∈ V and w ′ ∈ W ′ .
The dual left pairings with the morphisms defined above build a category, which we denote
by Pl . With Pl (T ) ≤ Pl we denote the full subcategory of dual T -pairings. The category
Pr of dual right pairings and its full subcategory Pr (T ) ≤ Pr of dual right T -pairings are
defined analogously.

Remark 2.7. The reader should be warned that (in general) for a non-commutative rng T
and a dual left T -pairing Pl = (V, T W ), the following map induced by the right T -linear
morphism κPl : V → ∗ W :
<, >T : V × W → T, < v, w >T := κPl (v)(w)
is not necessarily T -balanced, and so does not induce (in general) a map V ⊗T W → T. In
fact, for all v ∈ V, w ∈ W and t ∈ T we have
< vt, w >
< v, tw >

= κPl (vt)(w) = [κPl (v)t](w) = [κPl (v)(w)]t
= κPl (v)(tw) = t[κPl (v)(w)] = t < v, w >T .

= < v, w >T t;

2.8. Let T be an A-rng, N, W be left T -modules and identify N W with the set of all
mappings from W to N. Considering N with the discrete topology and N W with the product
topology, the induced relative topology on HomT − (W, N) ֒→ N W is a linear topology (called
the finite topology), for which the basis of neighborhoods of 0 is given by the set of
annihilator submodules:
Bf (0) := {F ⊥(HomT − (W,N )) | F = {w1 , ..., wk } ⊂ W is a finite subset},
where
F ⊥(HomT − (W,N )) := {f ∈ HomT − (W, N)) | f (W ) = 0}.
2.9. Let T be an A-rng, Pl = (V, T W ) a dual left T -pairing and consider for every right
T -module UT the following canonical map
X

αP

U

We say that Pl = (V, T W ) ∈ Pl (T ) satisfies the left α-condition (or is a dual left αα
l
pairing), iff αP
U is injective for every right T -module UT . By Pl (T ) ≤ Pl (T ) we denote the
full subcategory of dual left T -pairings satisfying the left α-condition. The full subcategory
of dual right α-pairings Prα (T ) ≤ Pr (T ) is defined analogously.
Definition 2.10. Let T be an A-rng, Pl = (V, T W ) be a dual left T -pairing and consider
l
κPl : V → ∗ W and αP
V : V ⊗T W → End(VT ).

We say Pl ∈ Pl (T ) is

For proofs of the following basic properties of locally projective modules and dual
α-pairings see [Abu2005] and [Z-H1976]:
Proposition 2.12. Let T be an A-ring and Pl = (V, T W ) ∈ Pl (T ).
1. The left T -module T W is locally projective if and only if (∗ W, W ) is an α-pairing.

projective modules:
Proposition 2.13. Let T be a ring, T W a left T -module, S := End(T W )op and consider
the canonical (S, S)-bilinear morphism

mapping

It follows then by [BW2003, 42.13.], that Im([, ]W
N ) ⊆ HomT (W, N) is dense. In
particular, setting N = W we conclude that Im([, ]W ) ⊆ End(T W ) is dense. On

Morita (Semi)contexts

We noticed, in the proofs of some results on equivalences between subcategories of
module categories associated to a given Morita context, that no use is made of the compatibility between the connecting bimodule morphisms (or even that only one trace ideal
is used and so only one of the two bilinear morphisms is really in action). Some results of
this type appeared, for example, in [Nau1993], [Nau1994-a] and [Nau1994-b]. Moreover,
in our considerations some Morita contexts will be formed for arbitrary associative rngs
(i.e. not necessarily unital rings). These considerations motivate us to make the following
general definitions:
3.1. By a Morita semi-context we mean a tuple
mT = ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T , I),

(3)

where T is an A-rng, S is a B-rng, P is a (T, S)-bimodule, Q is an (S, T )-bimodule,
<, >T : P ⊗S Q → T is a (T, T )-bilinear morphism and I := Im(<, >T ) ⊳ T (called the
trace ideal associated to mT ). We drop the ground rings A, B and the trace ideal I ⊳ T,
if they are not explicitly in action. If mT (3) is a Morita semi-context and T, S are unital
rings, then we call mT a unital Morita semi-context.
3.2. Let mT = ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T ), mT ′ = ((T ′ : A′ ), (S ′ : B ′ ), P ′ , Q′ , <, >T ′ ) be
Morita semi-contexts. By a morphism of Morita semi-contexts from mT to mT ′ we
mean a four fold set of morphisms
((β : δ), (γ : σ), φ, ψ) : ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q) → ((T ′ : A′ ), (S ′ : B ′ ), P ′, Q′ ),
where (β : δ) : (T : A) → (T ′ : A′ ) and (γ : σ) : (S : B) → (S ′ : B ′ ) are rng morphisms,
φ : P → P ′ is (T, S)-bilinear and ψ : Q → Q′ is (S, T )-bilinear, such that
β(< p, q >T ) =< φ(p), ψ(q) >T ′ for all p ∈ P, q ∈ Q .
Notice that we consider P ′ as a (T, S)-bimodule and Q′ as an (S, T )-bimodule with actions
induced by the morphism of rngs (β : δ) and (γ : σ). By MSC we denote the category
of Morita semi-contexts with morphisms defined as above, and by UMSC < MSC the
(non-full) subcategory of unital Morita semi-contexts.
7

Morita semi-contexts are closely related to dual pairings in the sense of [Abu2005]:
3.3. Let (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ) ∈ MSC and consider the canonical isomorphisms of Abelian
groups
ξ

ζ

Hom(S,T ) (Q, ∗ P ) ≃ Hom(T,T ) (P ⊗S Q, T ) ≃ Hom(T,S) (P, Q∗ ).
This means that we have two dual T -pairings Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Pl (T ) and Qr := (P, QT ) ∈
Pr (T ), induced by the canonical T -linear morphisms
κPl := ξ −1 (<, >T ) : Q → ∗ P and κQr := ζ(<, >T ) : P → Q∗ .
On the other hand, let (S, T, Q, P, <, >S ) ∈ MSC and consider the canonical isomorphisms
of Abelian groups
ζ′

ξ′

Hom(S,T ) (Q, P ∗ ) ≃ Hom(S,S) (Q ⊗T P, S) ≃ Hom(T,S) (P, ∗ Q).
Then we have two dual S-pairings Pr := (Q, PS ) ∈ Pr (S) and Ql := (P, S Q) ∈ Pl (S),
induced by the canonical morphisms
κPr := ξ ′−1 (<, >S ) : Q → P ∗ and κQr := ζ ′ (<, >S ) : P → ∗ Q.
3.4. By a Morita datum we mean a tuple
M = ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J),

(4)

where the following are Morita semi-contexts.
MT := ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T , I) and MS := ((S : B), (T : A), Q, P, <, >S , J) (5)
If, moreover, the bilinear morphisms <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T and < −, >S : Q ⊗T P → S are
compatible, in the sense that
< q, p >S q ′ = q < p, q ′ >T and p < q, p′ >S =< p, q >T p′ ∀ p, p′ ∈ P, q, q ′ ∈ Q, (6)
then we call M a Morita context. If T, S in a Morita datum (context) M are unital,
then we call M a unital Morita datum (context).
3.5. Let M = ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) and M′ = ((T ′ : A′ ), (S ′ : B ′ ), P ′, Q′ , <
, >T ′ , <, >S ′ ) be Morita contexts. Extending [Ami1971, Page 275], we mean by a morphism of Morita contexts from M to M′ a four fold set of maps
((β : δ), (γ : σ), φ, ψ) : ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q) → ((T ′ : A′ ), (S ′ : B ′ ), P ′, Q′ ),
where (β : δ) : (T : A) → (T ′ : A′ ), (γ : σ) : (S : B) → (S ′ : B ′ ) are rng morphisms,
φ : P → P ′ is (T, S)-bilinear and ψ : Q → Q′ is (S, T )-bilinear, such that
β(< p, q >T ) =< φ(p), ψ(q) >T ′ and γ(< q, p >S ) =< ψ(q), φ(p) >S ′ ∀ p ∈ P, q ∈ Q.
By MC we denote the category of Morita contexts with morphisms defined as above, and
by UMC < MC the (non-full) subcategory of unital Morita contexts.
8

Example 3.6. If R is commutative, then any Morita semi-context (R, R, P, Q, <, >R) yields
<,>R
a Morita context (R, R, P, Q, <, >R, [, ]R ), where [, ]R := Q ⊗R P ≃ P ⊗R Q −→ R.
3.7. We call a Morita semi-context mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ) semi-derived (derived),
iff S := End(T P )op (and Q = ∗ P ). We call a Morita datum, or a Morita context, M =
(T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) semi-derived (derived), iff S = End(T P )op , or T = End(PS )
(S = End(T P )op and Q = ∗ P, or T = End(PS ) and Q = P ∗ ).
Remark 3.8. Following [Cae1998, 1.2.] (however, dropping the condition that the bilinear
map <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T is surjective), Morita semi-contexts (T, S, P, Q, <>T ) in our sense
were called dual pairs in [Ver2006]. However, we think the terminology we are using is more
informative and avoids confusion with other notions of dual pairings in the literature (e.g.
the ones studied by the first author in [Abu2005]). The reason for this specific terminology
(i.e. Morita semi-contexts) is that every Morita context contains two Morita semi-contexts
as clear from the definition; and that any Morita semi-context can be extended to a (not
necessarily unital) Morita context in a natural way as explained below.

Elementary rngs
In what follows we demonstrate how to build new Morita (semi-)contexts from a given
Morita semi-context. These constructions are inspired by the notion of elementary rngs in
[Cae1998, 1.2.] (and [Ver2006, Remark 3.8.]):
Lemma 3.9. Let mT := ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T ) ∈ MSC.
1. The (T, T )-bimodule T := P ⊗S Q has a structure of a T -rng (A-rng) with multiplication
(p ⊗S q) *T (p′ ⊗S q ′ ) :=< p, q >T p′ ⊗S q ′ ∀ p, p′ ∈ P, q, q ′ ∈ Q,
such that <, >T : T → T is a morphism of A-rngs, P is a (T, S)-bimodule and Q is
an (S, T)-bimodule, where
(p ⊗S q) ⇀ pe :=< p, q >T pe and qe ↼ (p ⊗S q) := qe < p, q >T .

Moreover, we have morphisms of T -rngs (A-rngs)

T → End(PS ),

((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, idT) ∈ MSC and we have a morphism of Morita semi-contexts
(<, >T , idS , , idP , idQ ) : (T, S, P, Q, idT) → (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ).

2. The (S, S)-bimodule S := Q ⊗T P has a structure of an S-rng (B-rng) with multiplication
(q ⊗T p) *S (q ′ ⊗T p′ ) := q < p, q ′ >T ⊗T p′ = q⊗T < p, q ′ >T p′ ∀ p, p′ ∈ P, q, q ′ ∈ Q,
such that <, >S : S → S is a morphism of B-rngs, P is a (T, S)-bimodule and Q is
an (S, T )-bimodule, where
pe ↼ (q ⊗T p) :=< pe, q >T p and (q ⊗T p) ⇀ qe := q < p, qe >T .

Moreover, we have morphisms of S-rngs (B-rngs)

and M := ((T : A), (S : B), P, Q, <, >T , idS ) is a Morita context.

Remarks 3.10.
1. Given ((S : B), (T : A), Q, P, <, >S ) ∈ MSC, the (S, S)-bimodule
S := Q ⊗T P becomes an S-rng with multiplication
(q ⊗T p) *S (q ′ ⊗T p′ ) :=< q, p >S q ′ ⊗T p′ ∀ p, p′ ∈ P, q, q ′ ∈ Q;
and the (T, T )-bimodule T := P ⊗S Q becomes a T -rng with multiplication
(p ⊗S q) *T (p′ ⊗S q ′ ) := p < q, p′ >S ⊗S q ′ = p ⊗S < q, p′ >S q ′ ∀ p, p′ ∈ P, q, q ′ ∈ Q.
Analogous results to those in Lemma 3.9 can be obtained for the S-rng S and the
T -rng T.
2. Given a Morita semi-context (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ) several equivalent conditions for the
T -rng T := P ⊗S Q to be unital and the modules T P, QT to be firm can be found in
[Ver2006, Theorem 3.3.]. Analogous results can be formulated for the S-rng Q ⊗T P
and the S-modules PS , S Q corresponding to any (S, T, Q, P, <, >S ) ∈ MSC.
Proposition 3.11.
1. Let mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ) ∈ UMSC and assume the A-rng
T := P ⊗S Q to be unital. If <, >T : T → T respects unities (and mT is injective),
<,>T

then <, >T is surjective (T ≃ T as A-rings).
2. Let mS = (S, T, Q, P, <, >S ) ∈ UMSC and assume the B-rng S := Q ⊗S P to
be unital. If <, >S : S → S respects unities (and mS is injective), then <, >S is
<,>S

surjective (S ≃ S as B-rings).
3. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) ∈ UMC and assume the rngs T := P ⊗S Q, T,
S := Q ⊗S P to be unital. If <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T and <, >S : S → S respect unities,
<,>T
<,>S
then T ≃ T as A-ring, S ≃ S as B-rings and we have equivalences of categories
T M ≈ S M (and MT ≈ MS ).

known that a unital Morita context with surjective connecting bimodule morphisms is
<,>T
<,>S
strict (e.g. [Fai1981, 12.7.]), hence T ≃ T, S ≃ S. The equivalences of categories
T M ≃ T M ≈ S M ≃ S M (and MT ≃ MT ≈ MS ≃ MS ) follow then by classical Morita
Theory (e.g. [Fai1981, Chapter 12]).
Definition 3.12. Let T be an A-rng, VT a right T -module and consider for every left
T -module T L the annihilator
ann⊗
L (VT ) := {l ∈ L | V ⊗T l = 0}.
Following [AF1974, Exercises 19], we say VT is L-faithful, iff ann⊗
L (VT ) = 0; and to be
completely faithful, iff VT is L-faithful for every left T -module S L. Similarly, we can
define completely faithful left T -modules.
Under suitable conditions, the following result characterizes the Morita data, which
are Morita contexts:
Proposition 3.13. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) be a Morita datum.

and T ≃ T as rngs.
Proof.

1. Obvious.

2. Assume S ≃ S and T ≃ T as rngs. If p ∈ P and q, q ′ ∈ Q are arbitrary, then we have
for any pe ∈ P :

< q, p >S q ′ ⊗T pe = (q ⊗T p) *S (q ′ ⊗T pe) = (q ⊗T p) *S (q ′ ⊗T pe) = q < p, q ′ >T ⊗T pe,

hence < q, p >S q ′ − q < p, q ′ >T ∈ annQ (P ) = 0 (since T P is Q-faithful), i.e.
< q, p >S q ′ = q < p, q ′ >T for all p ∈ P and q, q ′ ∈ Q. Assuming QT is P -faithful,
one can prove analogously that < p, q >T p′ = p < q, p′ >S for all p, p′ ∈ P and
q ∈ Q. Consequently, M is a Morita context.

Injective Morita (Semi-)Contexts

Definition 4.1. We call a Morita semi-context mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , I) :
injective (resp. semi-strict, strict), iff <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T is injective (resp. surjective, bijective);
non-degenerate, iff Q ֒→ ∗ P and P ֒→ Q∗ canonically;
Morita α-semi-context, iff Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Plα (T ) and Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ).
11

Notation. By MSCα ≤ MSC (UMSCα ≤ UMSC) we denote the full subcategory of
(unital) Morita semi-contexts satisfying the α-condition. Moreover, we denote by IMSC ≤
MSC (IUMSC ≤ UMSC) the full subcategory of injective (unital) Morita semi-contexts.
Definition 4.2. We say a Morita datum (context) M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) :
is injective (resp. semi-strict, strict), iff <, >T : P ⊗S Q → T and <, >S : Q⊗T P → S
are injective (resp. surjective, bijective);
is non-degenerate, iff Q ֒→ ∗ P, P ֒→ Q∗ , Q ֒→ P ∗ and P ֒→ ∗ Q canonically;
satisfies the left α-condition, iff Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Plα (T ) and Ql := (P, S Q) ∈ Plα (S);
satisfies the right α-condition, iff Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ) and Pr := (Q, PS ) ∈
α
Pr (S);
satisfies the α-condition, or M is a Morita α-datum (Morita α-context), iff M
satisfies both the left and the right α-conditions.
Notation. By MCαl < MC (UMCαl < UMC) we denote the full subcategory of Morita
contexts satisfying the left α-condition, and by MCαr < MC (UMCαr < UMC) the full
subcategory of (unital) Morita contexts satisfying the right α-condition. Moreover, we set
MCα := MCαl ∩ MCαr and UMCα := UMCαl ∩ UMCαr .
Lemma 4.3. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) ∈ MC. Consider the Morita semicontext MS := (S, T, Q, P, <, >S ), the dual pairings Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Pl (T ), Qr :=
(P, QT ) ∈ Pr (T ) and the canonical morphisms of rings
ρP : S → End(T P )op and λQ : S → End(QT ).
1. If Qr is injective (semi-strict), then MS is injective (ρP : S → End(T P )op is a
surjective morphism of B-rngs).
2. Assume PS is faithful and let Qr be semi-strict. Then S ≃ End(T P )op (an isomorphism of unital B-rings) and MS is strict.
3. If Pl is injective (semi-strict), then MS is injective (λQ : S → End(QT ) is a surjective morphism of B-rngs).
4. Assume S Q is faithful and let Pl is semi-strict. Then S ≃ End(QT ) (an isomorphism
of unital B-rings) and MS is strict.
Proof. We prove only "1" and "2", as "3" and "4" can be proved analogously.

The following result shows that Morita α-contexts are injective:
Corollary 4.4. MCαl ∪ MCαr ≤ IMC.
Example 4.5. Let mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T ) be a non-degenerate Morita semi-context. If
T is a QF ring and the T -modules T P, QT are projective, then by Proposition 2.12 "7"
Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Plα (T ) and Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ) (i.e. mT is a Morita α-semicontext, whence injective). On the other hand, let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) be a
non-degenerate Morita datum. If T, S are QF rings and the modules T P, QT , PS , S Q are
projective, then M is an Morita α-datum (whence injective).
Every semi-strict unital Morita context is injective (whence strict, e.g. [Fai1981, 12.7.]).
The following example, which is a modification of [Lam1999, Example 18.30]), shows that
the converse is not necessarily true:
14

Example
4.6.
 Let T = M2 (Z2 ) be the ring of 2 × 2 matrices with entries in Z2 . Notice that

P := T e = { ′

a b
| a , c ∈ Z2 } and Q := eT = {

| a, b ∈ Z2 }.

Then P = T e is a (T, eT e)-bimodule and Q = eT is an (eT e, T )-bimodule. Moreover, we
have a Morita context
Me = (T, eT e, T e, , eT, <, >T , < . >eT e ),
where the connecting bilinear maps are

Straightforward computations show that <, >T is injective but not surjective (as

Im(<, >T )) and that <, >eT e is in fact an isomorphism. This means that Me is an injective
Morita context that is not semi-strict (whence not strict).


Definition 4.7. Let T be a rng and I ⊳ T an ideal. For every left T -module T V consider
the canonical T -linear map
ζ I,V : V → HomT (I, V ), v 7→ [t 7→ tv].
We say T I is strongly V -faithful, iff annV (I) := Ker(ζ I,V ) := 0. Moreover, we say I is
strongly faithful, if T I is V -faithful for every left T -module T V. Strong faithfulness of I
w.r.t. right T -modules can be defined analogously.
Remark 4.8. Let T be a rng, I ⊳ T an ideal and T U a left ideal. It's clear that ann⊗
U (IT ) ⊆
annU (I) := Ker(ζ I,U ). Hence, if T I is strongly U-faithful, then IT is U-faithful (which
justifies our terminology). In particular, if T I is strongly faithful, then IT is completely
faithful.
Morita α-contexts are injective by Corollary 4.4. The following result gives a
partial converse:
15

Lemma 4.9. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) ∈ MC and assume the Morita semicontext MS := (S, T, Q, P, <, >S , J) is injective.
1. If S J is strongly faithful, then Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ).
2. If JS is strongly faithful, then Pl := (Q, T P ) ∈ Plα (T ).
Proof. We prove only "1", since "2" can be proved similarly. Assume MS is injective and
consider for every left T -module U the following diagram

Equivalences of Categories

In this section we give some applications of injective Morita (semi-)contexts and injective Morita data to equivalences between suitable subcategories of modules arising in
the Kato-Müller-Ohtake localization-colocalization theory (as developed in (e.g. [Kat1978],
[KO1979], [Mül1974]). All rings, hence all Morita (semi-)contexts and data, in this section
are unital.
16

Static and Adstatic Modules
5.1. ([C-IG-TW2003]) Let A and B be two complete cocomplete Abelian categories, R :
A → B an additive covariant functor with left adjoint L : B → A and let
ω : LR → 1A and η : 1B → RL
be the induced natural transformations (called the counit and the unit of the adjunction,
respectively). Related to the adjoint pair (L, R) are two full subcategories of A and B :
ηY

ωX

Stat(R) := {X ∈ A | LR(X) ≃ X} and Adstat(R) := {Y ∈ B | Y ≃ RL(Y )},
whose members are called R-static objects and R-adstatic objects, respectively. It is
evident (from definition) that we have equivalence of categories Stat(R) ≈ Adstat(R).
A typical situation, in which static and adstatic objects arise naturally is the
following:
5.2. Let T, S be rings, T US a (T, S)-bimodule and consider the covariant functors
HlU := HomT (U, −) :

TM

→

SM

and TlU := U ⊗S − :

SM

→

T M.

It is well-known that (TlU , HlU ) is an adjoint pair of covariant functors via the natural
isomorphisms
HomT (U ⊗S M, N) ≃ HomS (M, HomT (U, N)) for all M ∈

SM

and N ∈

TM

and the natural transformations
ω lU : U ⊗S HomT (U, −) → 1T M and η lU : 1S M → HomT (U, U ⊗S −)
yield for every T K and S L the canonical morphisms
ω lU,K : U ⊗S HomT (U, K) → K and η lU,L : L → HomT (U, U ⊗S L).

(9)

We call the HlU -static modules U-static w.r.t. S and set
ω lU,K

Statl (T US ) := Stat(HlU ) = {T K | U ⊗S HomT − (U, K) ≃ K};
and the HlU -adstatic modules U-adstatic w.r.t. S and set
η lU,L

Adstatl (T US ) := Adstat(HlU ) = {S L | L ≃ HomT − (U, U ⊗S L)}.
By [Nau1990a] and [Nau1990b], there are equivalences of categories
Statl (T US ) ≈ Adstatl (T US ).
17

(10)

On the other hand, one can define the full subcategories Statr (T US ) ≈ Adstatr (T US ) :
Statr (T US )
Adstatr (T US )

:=
:=

{KS | Hom−S (U, K) ⊗T U ≃ K};
{LT | L ≃ Hom−S (U, L ⊗T U)}.

In particular, setting
Stat(T U)
Stat(US )

:=
:=

Statl (T UEnd(T U )op );
Statr (End(S U ) US );

Adstat(T U)
Adstat(US )

:=
:=

Adstatl (T UEnd(T U )op );
Adstatr (End(S U ) US ),

there are equivalences of categories:
Stat(T U) ≃ Adstat(T U) and Stat(US ) ≃ Adstat(US ).

(11)

Remark 5.3. The theory of static and adstatic modules was developed in a series of papers
by the second author (see the references). They were also considered by several other
authors (e.g. [Alp1990], [CF2004]). For other terminologies used by different authors, the
interested reader may refer to a comprehensive treatment of the subject by R. Wisbauer
in [Wis2000].

Intersecting subcategories
Several intersecting subcategories related to Morita contexts were introduced in
the literature (e.g. [Nau1993], [Nau1994-b]). In what follows we introduce more and we
show that many of these coincide, if one starts with an injective Morita semi-context.
Moreover, other results on equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related
to an injective Morita context will be reframed for arbitrary (not necessarily compatible)
injective Morita data.
Definition 5.4.
1. For a right T -module X, a T -submodule X ′ ⊆ X is called K-pure
for some left T -module T K, iff the following sequence of Abelian groups is exact
0 → X ′ ⊗T K → X ⊗T K → X/X ′ ⊗T K → 0;
2. For a left T -module Y, a T -submodule Y ′ ⊆ Y is called L-copure for some left
T -module T L, iff the following sequence of Abelian groups is exact
0 → HomT (Y /Y ′ , L) → HomT (Y, L) → HomT (Y ′ , L) → 0.
Definition 5.5. (Compare [KO1979, Theorems 1.3., 2.3.]) Let T be a ring, I ⊳ T an
ideal, U a left T -module and consider the canonical T -linear morphisms
ζ I,U : U → HomT (I, U) and ξ I,U : I ⊗T U → U.
1. We say T U is I-divisible, iff ξ I,U is surjective (equivalently, iff IU = U).
18

ζ I,U

2. We say T U is I-localized, iff U ≃ HomT (I, U) canonically (equivalently iff T I is
strongly U-faithful and T I ⊆ T is U-copure).

ξI,U

3. We say a left T -module U is I-colocalized, iff I ⊗T U ≃ U canonically (equivalently,
iff T U is I-divisible and IT ⊆ T is U-pure).

Notation. For a ring T, an ideal I ⊳ T, and with morphisms being the canonical ones,
we set

[Kat1978], [KO1979]):

Given mS = (S, T, Q, P, <, >S , J) ∈ UMSC one can define analogously, the corresponding
intersecting subcategories of S M and MS .
As an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.6 we get
Corollary 5.8. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) ∈ IUMC and consider the associated Morita semi-contexts MT and MS (5).
1. If I C ≤ Dl (MT ) and J C ≤ Dl (MS ), then Vl (MT ) ≈ Vl (MS ). Similarly, if CI ≤
Dr (MT ) and CJ ≤ Dr (MS ), then Vr (MT ) ≈ Vr (MS ).
2. If I L ≤ Dl (MT ) and J L ≤ Dl (MS ), then Wl (MT ) ≈ Wl (MS ). Similarly, if LI ≤
Dr (MT ) and LJ ≤ Dr (MS ), then Wr (MT ) ≈ Wr (MS ).
Starting with a Morita context, the following result was obtained in [Nau1993,
Theorem 3.2.]. We restate the result for an arbitrary (not necessarily compatible) Morita
datum and sketch its proof:
Lemma 5.9. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) be a unital Morita datum and consider the associated Morita semi-contexts MT and MS in (5). Then there are equivalences
of categories

Proof. Let T V ∈ Xl (MT ). By the equivalence Statl (T PS )
≈
Adstatl (T PS ) in 5.2 we
l
have HomT − (P, V ) ∈ Adstat (T PS ). Moreover, V ∈ Dl (M), hence HomT − (P, V ) ≃ Q ⊗T V
20

Q⊗T −

canonically and it follows then from the equivalence Adstatl (S QT ) ≈ Statl (S QT ) that
HomT − (P, V ) ∈ Statl (S QT ). Moreover, we have the following natural isomorphisms
P ⊗S HomT − (P, V ) ≃ V ≃ HomS− (Q, Q ⊗T V ) ≃ HomS− (Q, HomT − (P, V )),

(13)

i.e. HomT − (P, V ) ∈ Dl (MS ). Consequently, HomT − (P, V ) ∈ Xl (MS ). Moreover, (13)
yields a natural isomorphism V ≃ HomS− (Q, HomT − (P, V )). Analogously, one can show for
every W ∈ Xl (MS ) that HomS− (Q, W ) ∈ Xl (MT ) and that W ≃ HomT − (P, HomS− (Q, W ))
naturally. Consequently, Xl (MT ) ≈ Xl (MS ). The equivalences Xr (MT ) ≈ Xr (MS ) can
be proved analogously.
Proposition 5.10. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) be a unital injective Morita
datum and consider the associated Morita semi-contexts MT and MS in (5).
1. There are equivalences of categories

Statr (T IT )

≈ Adstatl (T IT );
≈ Adstatr (T IT );

Statl (S JS ) ≈
Statr (S JS ) ≈

Adstatl (S JS );
Adstatr (S JS ).

2. If Statl (T IT ) ≤ Xl∗ (MS ) and Statl (S JS ) ≤ Xl∗ (MT ), then there are equivalences of
categories
Statl (T IT ) ≈ Statl (S JS ) and Adstatl (T IT ) ≈ Adstatl (S JS ).
3. If Statr (T IT ) ≤ Xr∗ (MS ) and Statr (S JS ) ≤ Xr∗ (MT ), then there are equivalences of
categories
Statr (T IT ) ≈ Statr (S JS ) and Adstatr (T IT ) ≈ Adstatr (S JS ).
<,>T

Proof. To prove "1", notice that since M is an injective Morita datum, P ⊗S Q ≃ I
<,>S
and Q ⊗T P ≃ J as bimodules and so the four equivalences of categories result from 5.2.
To prove "2", one can use an argument similar to that in [Nau1994-b, Theorem 3.9.] to
show that the inclusion Statl (T IT ) = Statl (T (P ⊗S Q)T ) ≤ Xl∗ (MS ) implies Statl (T IT ) =
Statl (T (P ⊗S Q)T ) = Xl (MT ) and that the inclusion Statl (S JS ) = Statl (S (Q ⊗T P )S ) ≤
Xl∗ (MT ) implies Statl (S JS ) = Statl (S (Q ⊗T P )S ) = Xl (MS ). The result follows then by
Lemma 5.9. The proof of "3" is analogous to that of "2".
For injective Morita semi-contexts, several subcategories in (12) are shown in the
following result to be equal:
Theorem 5.11. Let mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , I) ∈ IUMS. Then
1. Vl (mT ) = Vl (mT ), Wl (mT ) = Wl (mT ), whence
bl (mT ) = W
cl (mT ) = Xl (mT ) = Xl (mT ) =
V
21

I C∩Dl (mT )∩ I L

and Xl∗ (mT ) = X∗l (mT ).

2. Vr (mT ) = Vr (mT ), Wr (mT ) = Wr (mT ), whence
br (mT ) = W
cr (mT ) = Xr (mT ) = Xr (mT ) = CI ∩Dr (mT )∩LI and Xr∗ (mT ) = X∗r (mT ).
V

Proof. We prove only "1" as "2" can be proved analogously. Assume the Morita semicontext mT = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , I) is injective. By our assumption we have for every
V ∈ Dl (mT ) the commutative diagram
can
≃

P ⊗S (Q ⊗T V )

I ⊗T V

ξ I,V

Then it becomes obvious that ω lP,V : P ⊗S HomT (P, V ) → V is an isomorphism if and only
if ξ I,V : I ⊗T V → V is an isomorphism. Consequently
V(mT ) = Dl (mT ) ∩ Statl (T PS ) = Dl (mT ) ∩ I C = V(mT ).
On the other hand, we have for every V ∈ Dl (mT ) the following commutative diagram
can

It follows then that ηlP,L : V → HomS (Q, Q ⊗T P ) is an isomorphism if and only if
ζ I,V : V → HomT (I, V ) is an isomorphism. Consequently,
W(mT ) = Dl (mT ) ∩ Adstatl (T PS ) = Dl (mT ) ∩I L = W(mT ).
Moreover, we have
bl (mT ) :=
V
=

Vl (mT ) ∩ I L
I C ∩ Wl (mT )

= Vl (mT ) ∩ I L
= I C ∩ Wl (mT )

On the other hand, we have

cl (mT ).

Xl (mT ) = Vl (mT ) ∩ Wl (mT ) = Vl (mT ) ∩ Wl (mT ) = Xl (mT )
bl (mT ) = W
cl (mT ) = Xl (mT ) = Xl (mT ) and X ∗ (mT ) = X∗ (mT ) are
and so the equalities V

established.
22

In addition to establishing several other equivalences of intersecting subcategories,
b≈W
c in [Nau1994-b, Theorem
the following results reframe the equivalence of categories V
4.9.] for an arbitrary (not necessarily compatible) injective Morita datum:
Theorem 5.12. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) be an injective Morita datum and
consider the associated Morita semi-contexts MT and MS (5).
1. The following subcategories are mutually equivalent:
bl (MT ) = W
cl (MT ) = Xl (MT ) = Xl (MT ) ≈ Xl (MS ) = Xl (MS ) = W
cl (MS ) = V
bl (MS ).
V
(16)
2. If Vl (MT ) ≤ I L and Wl (MS ) ≤ J C, then Vl (MT ) ≈ Wl (MS ). If Wl (MT ) ≤ I C
and Vl (MS ) ≤ J L, then Wl (MT ) ≈ Vl (MS ).
3. The following subcategories are mutually equivalent:
br (MT ) = W
cr (MT ) = Xr (MT ) = Xr (MT ) ≈ Xr (MS ) = Xr (MS ) = W
cr (MS ) = V
br (MS ).
V
(17)
4. If Vr (MT ) ≤ LI and Wr (MT ) ≤ CJ , then Vr (MT ) ≈ Wr (MS ). If Wr (MT ) ≤ CJ
and Vr (MS ) ≤ LI , then Vr (MS ) ≈ Wr (MT ).
Proof. By Lemma 5.9, Xl (MT ) ≈ Xl (MS ) and so "1" follows by Theorem 5.11. If
Vl (MT ) ≤ I L and Wl (MS ) ≤ J C, then we have
bl (MT ) ≈ W
cl (MS ) = Wl (MS ) ∩
Vl (MT ) = Vl (MT ) ∩ I L = V

On the other hand, if Wl (MT ) ≤ I L and Vl (MS ) ≤

J C,

JC

= Wl (MS ).

then

cl (MT ) ≈ V
bl (MS ) = Vl (MS ) ∩
Wl (MT ) = Wl (MT ) ∩ I C = W

JL

= Vl (MS ).

So we have established "2". The results in "3" and "4" can be obtained analogously.

More applications

In this final section we give more applications of Morita α-(semi-)contexts and
injective Morita (semi-)contexts. All rings in this section are unital, whence all Morita
(semi-)contexts are unital. Moreover, for any ring T we denote with T E an arbitrary, but
fixed, injective cogenerator in T M.
Notation. Let T be an A-ring. For any left T -module T V, we set # V := HomT (V, T E). If
moreover, T VS is a (T, S)-bimodule for some B-ring S, then we consider #
S V with the left
S-module structure induced by that of VS .
23

Lemma 6.1. (Compare [Col1990, Lemma 3.2.], [CF2004, Lemmas 2.1.2., 2.1.3.]) Let T be
an A-ring, S a B-ring and T VS a (T, S)-bimodule,
1. A left T -module T K is V -generated if and only if the canonical T -linear morphism
ω lV,K : V ⊗S HomT (V, K) → K

(18)

is surjective. Moreover, V ⊗S W ⊆ Pres(T V ) ⊆ Gen(T V ) for every left S-module
S W.
2. A left S-module S L is #
S V -cogenerated if and only if the canonical S-linear morphism
ηlV,L : L → HomT (V, V ⊗S L)

(19)

#
is injective. Moreover, HomT (V, M) ⊆ Copres(#
S V ) ⊆ Cogen(S V ) for every left
T -module T M.

Remark 6.2. Let T be an A-ring, S a B-ring and T VS a (T, S)-bimodule. Notice that for
any left S-module S L we have
l
ann⊗
L (VS ) := {l ∈ L | V ⊗S l = 0} = Ker(η V,L ),

whence (by Lemma 6.1 "2" ) VS is L-faithful if and only if S L is #
S V -cogenerated. It follows
#
then that VS is completely faithful if and only if S V is a cogenerator.

Localization and colocalization
In what follows we clarify the relations between static (adstatic) modules and subcategories colocalized (localized) by a trace ideal of a Morita context satisfying the α-condition.
Recall that for any (T, S)-bimodule T PS we have by Lemma 6.1:
Statl (T PS ) ⊆ Gen(T P ) and Adstatl (T PS ) ⊆ Cogen(#
S P ).

(20)

Theorem 6.3. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S , I, J) ∈ UMC. Then we have
IC

ID

⊆ Gen(T P ).

Assume Pr := (Q, PS ) ∈ Prα (S). Then
1. Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ) ⊆ I F.
2. If Gen(T P ) ⊆ I C, then I C = I D = Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ).
3. If Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ), then T I ⊆ T T is pure and I C = I D.
24

(21)

Proof. For every left T -module T K, consider the following diagram with canonical morphisms and let α2 := ζ I,K ◦ ω lP,K . It is easy to see that both rectangles and the two right
triangles commutes:

It follows directly from the definitions that I C ⊆ I D and Statl (T PS ) ⊆ Gen(T P ). If T K
r
l
is I-divisible, then ξ I,K ◦ <, >T ⊗T idK = ω lP,K ◦ idP ⊗S αQ
K is surjective, whence ω P,K
is surjective and we conclude that T K is P -generated by Lemma 6.1 "1". Consequently,
I D ⊆ Gen(T P ).
Assume now that Pr ∈ Prα (S). Considering the canonical map ρQ : T → End(S Q)op ,
r
the map ρQ ◦ <, >T = αP
Q is injective and so the bilinear map <, >T is injective (i.e.
<,>T

r
−1
P ⊗S Q ≃ I). Define α1 := (idP ⊗S αQ
K ) ◦ (<, >T ⊗T idK ) , so that the left triangles
Pr
commute. Notice that αHomT (P,K) is injective and the commutativity of the upper right
triangle in Diagram (22) implies that α2 is injective (whence ω lP,K is injective by the
commutativity of the lower right triangle).

1. If K ∈ Statl (T PS ), then the commutativity of the lower right triangle (22) and the
injectivity of α2 show that ζ I,K is injective; hence, Statl (T PS ) ⊆ I F. On the other
hand, if T K is P -generated, then ω lP,K is surjective by Lemma 6.1 (1), thence bijective,
i.e. K ∈ Statl (T PS ). Consequently, Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ).
2. This follows directly from the inclusions in (21) and "1".
3. Assume Qr := (P, QT ) ∈ Prα (T ). Since Pr ∈ Prα (S), it follows by analogy to Propor
sition 2.12 "3" that PS is flat, hence idP ⊗S αQ
K is injective. The commutativity of
the upper left triangle in Diagram (22) implies then that α1 is injective, thence ξ I,K
is injective by commutativity of the lower left triangle (i.e. T I ⊆ T T is K-pure). If
TK

ξ I,K

is divisible, then K ⊗T I ≃ K (i.e. K ∈ I C).

#
hence S L is #
S P -cogenerated by Lemma 6.1 "2". Consequently, J F ⊆ Cogen(S P ).
Assume now that Qr ∈ Prα (T ). Then it follows from Lemma 4.3 that <, >S is injective

η lP,L is injective, hence L ∈ Cogen(#

3. This follows directly from the assumptions and "2".

∗-Modules
To the end of this section, we fix a unital ring T, a left T -module T P and set S :=
End(T P )op .
Definition 6.5. ([MO1989]) We call T P a ∗-module, iff Gen(T P ) ≈ Cogen(#
S P ).
Remark 6.6. It was shown by J. Trlifaj [Trl1994] that all ∗-modules are finitely generated.
By definition, Statl (T PS ) ≤ T M and Adstatl (T PS ) ≤ S M are the largest subcategories between which the adjunction (P ⊗S −, HomT (P, −)) induces an equivalence. On
the other hand, Lemma 6.1 shows that Gen(T P ) ≤ T M and Cogen(#
S P ) ≤ S M are the
largest such subcategories (see [Col1990, Section 3] for more details). This suggests the
following observation:
26

Proposition 6.7. ([Xin1999, Lemma 2.3.]) We have
TP

is a ∗ -module ⇔ Stat(T P ) = Gen(T P ) and Adstat(T P ) = Cogen(#
S P ).

Definition
X6.8. A left T -module T U is said
X to be
semi- -quasi-projective (abbr. s- -quasi-projective), iff for any left T -module
T V ∈ Pres(T U) and any U-presentation
′

U (Λ) → U (Λ ) → V → 0
of T V (if any), the following induced sequence is exact:

HomT (U, U (Λ) ) → HomT (U, U (Λ ) ) → HomT (U, V ) → 0;
X
X
weakly- -quasi-projective (abbr. w- -quasi-projective), iff for any left T module T V and any short exact sequence

0 → HomT (U, K) → HomT (U, U (Λ ) ) → HomT (U, V ) → 0;
X
self-tilting, iff T U is w- -quasi-projective and Gen(T U) = Pres(T U);
X
-self-static, iff any direct sum U (Λ) is U-static.
(self)-small, iff HomT (U, −) commutes with direct sums (of T U);
Proposition 6.9. Assume M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) is a unital Morita context.
1. If Pr := (Q, PS ) ∈ Prα (S), then:
(a) Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS );
(b) there is an equivalence of categories Gen(T P ) ≈ Cop(#
S P );
X
(c) T P is
-self-static and Statl (T PS ) is closed under factor modules.

(d) Gen(T P ) = Pres(T P );

2. If M ∈ UMCαr and Cogen(#
S P ) ⊆ J L, then:
l
(a) Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ) and Cogen(#
S P ) = Adstat (T PS );

(b) there is an equivalence of categories Cogen(#
S P ) ≈ Gen(T P );
(c)

TP

is a ∗-module;

(d)

TP

is self-tilting and self-small.
27

Proof.
1. If Pr ∈ Prα (S), then it follows by Theorem 6.3 that Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ),
which is equivalent to each of "b" and "c" by [Wis2000, 4.4.] and to "d" by [Wis2000,
4.3.].
2. It follows by the assumptions, Theorems 6.3, 6.4 and 5.2 that Gen(T P ) = Statl (T PS ) ≈
#
Adstatl (T PS ) = Cogen(#
S P ), whence Gen(T P ) ≈ Cogen(S P ) (which is the definition
of ∗-modules). Hence "a" ⇔"b" ⇔"c". The equivalence "a" ⇔ "d" is evident by
[Wis2000, Corollary 4.7.] and we are done.

Wide Morita Contexts
Wide Morita contexts were introduced by F. Castaño Iglesias and J. Gómez-Torrecillas
[C-IG-T1995] and [C-IG-T1996] as an extension of classical Morita contexts to Abelian
categories.
Definition 6.10. Let A and B be Abelian categories. A right (left) wide Morita
context between A and B is a datum Wr = (G, A, B, F, η, ρ), where G : A ⇄ B : F are
right (left) exact covariant functors and η : F ◦ G −→ 1A , ρ : G ◦ F −→ 1B (η : 1A −→
F ◦ G, ρ : 1B −→ G ◦ F ) are natural transformations, such that for every pair of objects
(A, B) ∈ A × B the compatibility conditions G(ηA ) = ρG(A) and F (ρB ) = ηF (B) hold.
Definition 6.11. Let A and B be Abelian categories and W = (G, A, B, F, η, ρ) be a right
(left) wide Morita context. We call W injective (respectively semi-strict, strict), iff η
and ρ are monomorphisms (respectively epimorphisms, isomorphisms)
Remarks 6.12. Let W = (G, A, B, F, η, ρ) be a right (left) wide Morita context.
1. It follows by [CDN2005, Propositions 1.1., 1.4.] that if either η or ρ is an epimorphism
(monomorphism), then W is strict, whence A ≈ B.
2. The resemblance of injective left wide Morita contexts is with the Morita-Takeuchi
contexts for comodules of coalgebras, i.e. the so called pre-equivalence data for categories of comodules introduced in [Tak1977] (see [C-IG-T1998] for more details).
Injective Right wide Morita contexts
In a recent work [CDN2005, 5.1.], Chifan, et. al. clarified (for module categories) the
relation between classical Morita contexts and right wide Morita contexts. For the convenience of the reader and for later reference, we include in what follows a brief description
of this relation.
6.13. Let T, S be rings, A := T M and B := S M. Associated to each Morita context
M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) is a wide Morita context as follows: Define G : A ⇄ B : F
28

by G(−) = Q ⊗T − and F (−) = P ⊗S −. Then there are natural transformations η :
F ◦ G −→ 1T M and ρ : G ◦ F −→ 1S M such that for each T V and WS :
X
X
η V : P ⊗S (Q ⊗T V ) → V,
pi ⊗S (qi ⊗T vi ) 7→
< pi , qi >T vi ,
X
X
ρW : Q ⊗T (P ⊗S W ) → W,
qi ⊗T (pi ⊗S wi ) 7→
< qi , pi >S wi .

Then the datum Wr (M) := (G, T M, S M, F, η, ρ) is a right wide Morita context.
Conversely, let T ′ , S ′ be two rings and Wr′ = (G′ , T ′ M, S ′ M, F ′, η ′ , ρ′ ) be a right wide
Morita context between T ′ M and S ′ M such that the right exact functors G′ : T ′ M ⇄
′
S ′ M : F commute with direct sums. By Watts' Theorems (e.g. [Gol1979]), there exists a
(T, S)-bimodule P ′ (e.g. F ′ (S ′ )) such that F ′ ≃ P ′ ⊗S ′ −, an (S, T )-bimodule Q′ such that
G′ ≃ Q′ ⊗T ′ − and there should exist two bilinear forms
<, >T ′ : P ′ ⊗S ′ Q′ → T ′ and <, >S ′ : Q′ ⊗T ′ P ′ → S ′ ,
such that the natural transformations η′ : F ′ ◦ G′ → 1T ′ M , ρ : G′ ◦ F ′ → 1S ′ M are given by
η ′V ′ (p′ ⊗S ′ q ′ ⊗T ′ v ′ ) =< p′ , q ′ >T ′ v ′ and ρ′W ′ (q ′ ⊗T p′ ⊗S w ′ ) =< q ′ , p′ >S ′ w ′
for all V ′ ∈ T ′ M, W ′ ∈ S ′ M, p′ ∈ P ′, q ′ ∈ Q′ , v ′ ∈ V ′ and w ′ ∈ W ′ . It can be shown that
in this way one obtains a Morita context M′ = M′ (Wr′ ) := (T ′ , S ′, P ′ , Q′ , <, >T ′ , <, >S ′ ).
Moreover, it turns out that given a wide Morita context Wr , we have Wr ≃ Wr (M(Wr )).
The following result clarifies the relation between injective Morita contexts and
injective right wide Morita contexts.
Theorem 6.14. Let M = (T, S, P, Q, <, >T , <, >S ) be a Morita context, A := T M, B :=
S M and consider the induced right wide Morita context Wr (M) := (G, A, B, F, η, ρ).
1. If Wr (M) is an injective right wide Morita context, then M is an injective Morita
context.
2. If M ∈ UMCαr , then Wr (M) is an injective right wide Morita context.
Proof.
1. Let Wr (M) be an injective right wide Morita context. Then in particular,
<, >T = η T and <, >S = ρS are injective, i.e. M is an injective Morita context.
2. X
Assume that M satisfies the right α-condition. Suppose there exists some T V and
pi ⊗S (qi ⊗T vi ) ∈ Ker(η V ). Then for any q ∈ Q we have

context Wr (M) is injective.
