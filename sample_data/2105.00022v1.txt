CONSTRUCTING CERTAIN FAMILIES OF 3-POLYTOPAL
GRAPHS
Riccardo W. Maffucci∗

Abstract
Let n ≥ 3 and rn be a 3-polytopal graph such that for every 3 ≤ i ≤ n, rn has at
least one vertex of degree i. We find the minimal vertex count for rn . We then describe
an algorithm to construct the graphs rn . A dual statement may be formulated for
faces of 3-polytopes. The ideas behind the algorithm generalise readily to solve related
problems.
Moreover, given a 3-polytope tl comprising a vertex of degree i for all 3 ≤ i ≤ l, l
fixed, we define an algorithm to output for n > l a 3-polytope tn comprising a vertex of
degree i, for all 3 ≤ i ≤ n, and such that the initial tl is a subgraph of tn . The vertex
count of tn is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that it matches the aforementioned
minimal vertex count up to order of magnitude, as n gets large. In fact, we only lose a
small quantity on the coefficient of the second highest term, and this quantity may be
taken as small as we please, with the tradeoff of first constructing an accordingly large
auxiliary graph.

Keywords: Algorithm, planar graph, degree sequence, valency, 3-polytope, polyhedron.

Introduction

1.1

The question

Graphs that are planar and 3-connected have the nice property of being 1-skeletons of
3-polytopes, as proven by Rademacher-Steinitz (see e.g. [11, Theorem 11.6]). We call these
graphs 3-polytopal graphs, or 3-polytopes, or polyhedra interchangeably. These special
planar graphs are uniquely embeddable in a sphere (as observed by Whitney, see e.g. [11,
Theorem 11.5]). Their regions are also called 'faces', and are delimited by cycles (polygons)
[6, Proposition 4.26].

Our starting point is the following question. Let n ≥ 3 and G0 be a 3-polytopal graph
such that for every 3 ≤ i ≤ n, G0 has at least one i-gonal face. What is the minimal number
of faces for G0 ?
In what follows, we will work on the dual problem. Indeed, it is well-known that 3polytopes have a unique dual graph, that is also 3-polytopal (see e.g. [11, Chapter 11]).
Definition 1. A 3-polytope has the property Pn if it has at least one vertex of degree i, for
each 3 ≤ i ≤ n, and moreover it has minimal order (number of vertices) among 3-polytopes
satisfying this condition.
The notation H ≺ G indicates that H is a subgraph of G. Our first result is the following.
Theorem 2. Let n ≥ 3 and G be a 3-polytopal graph with at least one vertex of degree i,
for every 3 ≤ i ≤ n. Then the minimal number p(n) of vertices of G is

Graphs satisfying Pn for 3 ≤ n ≤ 15 are depicted in Figures 8, 9, 1, and 10.
Theorem 2 will be proven in sections 2, 3, and 4. Passing to the duals, we can answer
the original question.
Theorem 2'. If n ≥ 3 and G0 is a 3-polytopal graph with at least one i-gonal face, for every
3 ≤ i ≤ n, then the minimal number p(n) of faces for G0 is given by (1.1) and Table 1.

1.2

A related problem

In our next result, given a 3-polytope H containing vertices of valencies {3, 4, . . . , l},
l ≥ 5, and an integer n > l, we aim to construct a 3-polytope G containing a copy of H
2

as subgraph, and comprising vertices of degrees {3, 4, . . . , n}. We start with the following
definition.
Definition 3. Let n ≥ 5 be odd. We say that a 3-polytope satisfies property Qn if there
is at least one vertex of degree 3, and moreover the polytope contains among its faces the
triangles
Fn;j = {vn;j;1 , vn;j;2 , vn;j;3 }, 1 ≤ j ≤ (n − 3)/2
(1.3)
where
{deg(vn;j;1 ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ (n − 3)/2} ∪ {deg(vn;j;2 ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ (n − 3)/2} = {4, 5, . . . , n} (1.4)
and
vn;j;3 6= vn;i;1 , vn;i;2 ,

∀j, i.

Note that Qn together with minimality w.r.t. order is stronger than property Pn of
Definition 1.
Theorem 4. Let l ≥ 5 be odd, and tl be a 3-polytope satisfying Ql . Fix an integer m ≥ 14,
m ≡ 2 (mod 4), and let n := l + mk, where k is a non-negative integer. Then there exists
a sequence of 3-polytopes
{tn }n=l+mk, k≥1 ,
where each tn satisfies Qn , such that along the sequence, for all  > 0, one has

(1.5)

as n → ∞. Moreover, for all k ≥ 1, it holds that
tl+m(k−1) ≺ tl+mk .

(1.6)

For chosen tl and N ≥ 1, Algorithm 13 constructs tl+mk for 1 ≤ k ≤ N .
Theorem 4 will be proven in section 6.
Remark 5. The order (1.5) of the sequence of polyhedra in Theorem 4 is asymptotically
optimal, in the sense that the leading term is n2 /4 as in (1.1). The coefficient of the linear
term is only slightly larger than the −11n/4 of (1.1). This difference can be taken as small
as we please if m is chosen to be large, with the tradeoff of first constructing an accordingly
large auxiliary graph sm+3 , as detailed in sections 5 and 6.
Remark 6. In Definition 3, we could have supposed instead n even. Then accordingly one
would have taken j ≤ (n − 2)/2 in (1.3), and the set {3, 4, . . . , n} on the RHS of (1.4). This
would have produced similar setup and ideas.

Related literature, notation, and plan of the paper

Related literature. Necessary conditions for the degree sequence of a planar graph were
given in [3, 5]. On the other hand, Eberhard [7] proved that any degree sequence where
q = 3p − 6 (p, q being vertex and edge counts respectively) may be made planar by inserting
a sufficiently large number of 6's. There have been numerous generalisations and extensions
since, see e.g. [1, 2, 9, 10, 13, 14]. In [12], the authors determine the sequences for regular,
planar graphs. This was extended in [15] to sequences with highest and lowest valencies
differing by one or two.

Notation. All graphs that appear contain no loops and multiple edges. The vertex and
edge sets of a graph G are denoted by V (G) and E(G) respectively. The order and size of
G are the numbers |V (G)| and |E(G)|. The degree or valency degG (v) of a vertex v counts
the number of vertices adjacent to v in G. We use the shorthand deg(v) when G is clear.
The degree sequence of G is the set of all vertex valencies.
We write G ∼
= H when G, H are isomorphic graphs, and H ≺ G when H is (isomorphic to)
a subgraph of G.
A graph of order k + 1 or more is said to be k-connected if removing any set of k − 1 or
fewer vertices produces a connected graph.
Regions of a 2-connected planar graph are cycles of length i (i-gons) [6, Proposition 4.26].
For these graphs, the terms 'region' and 'face' are interchangeable. The i-gonal faces will
be denoted by their sets of i vertices. If {a, b, c} is a triangle, we call splitting the operation
of adding a vertex d and edges da, db, dc.

Plan of the paper. Theorem 2 is proven in sections 2 (lower bound (1.1)), 3 (cases
n ≤ 13) and 4 (Algorithm 8 for n ≥ 14). Section 5 is about an application of a similar
flavour, that we can tackle via a minor modification of Algorithm 8. The theory of section
5 will also be useful in section 6 to prove Theorem 4.
Appendix A presents another way to think about Algorithm 8. Appendix B contains figures
of graphs mentioned in sections 3 and 4.

By [3, 5], for any 3 ≤ k ≤ (p + 4)/3, it holds that

To optimise this lower bound for p, the left hand side should contain as many numbers
exceeding 5 as possible. We thus wish to take k = n − 5, and we may do this as long as
3 ≤ n − 5 ≤ (p + 4)/3, i.e.,
n ≥ 8 and p ≥ 3n − 19.
By (2.1), these conditions certainly hold for all n ≥ 8. In this case, equation (2.3) with
k = n − 5 reads
n(n + 1)
− 15 ≤ 2p + 6(n − 5) − 16,
2
and rearranging this inequality we obtain (2.2).

Proof of Theorem 2 for n ≤ 13

The polyhedra up to 8 faces were tabulated in [4] and [8]. For 4 ≤ n + 1 ≤ 8, we are
looking for polyhedra with at least one i-gonal face for each 3 ≤ i ≤ n. We consult [8,
Table I], searching where the 'Faces' column has the maximal n − 2 non-zero entries. It is
5

straightforward to find the ten relevant cases (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 46, and 47
in [8]). Passing to the dual graphs, we obtain the ten 3-polytopes sketched in Figure 8. In
particular, for 3 ≤ n ≤ 7, we have p(n) = n + 1 (cf. Table 1).
Next, we wish to find examples of polyhedra satisfying Pn for 8 ≤ n ≤ 13. We observe
that each graph in Figure 8, save for the tetrahedron and square pyramid, may be obtained
from a previous one via a splitting operation. Our strategy is then to apply repeated splitting
on the faces of r7.1 from Figure 8, to obtain a new graph rn . For 8 ≤ n ≤ 13, the aim is
to obtain a subset of vertices of valencies 4, 5, . . . , n. In the effort to minimise the resulting
graph's order, we split triangles of r7.1 containing the maximal possible number of vertices
of degree 4 or more, ideally all three of them. We thereby construct the graphs of Figure 9.
Their orders match the largest of the lower bounds (2.1) and (2.2) proven in section 2. We
thus complete Table 1.
In the next section, we will combine the above with other ideas to write Algorithm 8,
proving the cases n ≥ 14 of Theorem 2.

4.1

Proof of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 14
Setup
Let r14 be the graph sketched in Figure 1. It is straightforward to check that r14 is a

polyhedron, and that the respective valencies of vj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 11, are
7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 5.
6

The order of this graph is 26, matching the lower bound (2.2) in the case n = 14, and there
are vertices of degree 3 as well. Theorem 2 is hence proven in this case. In the following
we recursively construct the rn , n ≥ 16, of Theorem 2. As for r15 (Figure 10), we obtain it
from r14 via one edge deletion and again applying the ideas of section 3.
We need a preliminary definition, the operation of h-splitting a triangle about a vertex,
for some h ≥ 1 (see Figure 2). To h-split {a, b, c} about c, we begin by splitting it, introducing a new vertex c1 . Then we split {a, b, c1 } inserting c2 , and so on, until we have added
the vertex ch . For instance referring to Figure 8, given the tetrahedron s3 , 1-splitting any
face yields s4.2 , while 2-splitting any face produces s5.2 .

Figure 2: Notation for h-splitting a triangle {a, b, c} about the vertex c.

4.2

The case n ≡ 2 (mod 4)

We now describe the algorithm producing the rn of Theorem 2, starting from the case
n ≡ 2 (mod 4). The remaining cases are covered in section 4.3.
Algorithm 8 (Part I).
Input. An integer N ≥ 16.
Output. A set of graphs {rn : 16 ≤ n ≤ N }, where each rn has property Pn .
Description. For all k ≥ 1, we define the graph pck ('k-th piece') of Figure 3. The
half-lines and numbers in bold represent h-splitting: for instance, face {ak , bk , ek } is split
h = 4k times about the vertex ek . Letting pc0 := r14 , we label u0 , v0 , w0 its vertices of
degrees 10, 8, 6 respectively (v7 , v8 , v9 is Figure 1). The vertex (of degree 3) adjacent to
these three will be denoted by x0 . Note that also in each pck , k ≥ 1, there are vertices
uk , vk , wk of degrees 10, 8, 6, and xk of degree 3 adjacent to them. We define
(n−14)/4

rn := r14 ∪

identifying in each union operation the vertices uk−1 , vk−1 , wk−1 , xk−1 with ak , bk , ck , dk respectively.

Figure 3: The graph pck . Dashed lines are not edges of pck . Half-lines and numbers in bold
represent h-splitting.
Proof of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 14, n ≡ 2 (mod 4). We claim that rn (4.1) has order (1.1) and
satisfies property Pn . We argue by induction. The base case n = 14 has already been
checked. The union (4.1) is still a 3-polytope by construction. By the inductive hypothesis,
the graph
(n−18)/4
[
pck
rn−4 = r14 ∪
k=1

satisfies Pn−4 , and has order
p(n − 4) =

n2 − 19n + 132
.
4

Turning to rn = rn−4 ∪ pc(n−14)/4 , we record that for pck ≺ rn , k ≥ 1, the vertices
ak , bk , ck , dk have respective valencies
degrn (ak ) = 10 + 1 + 4k + 1 + 2 = 4k + 14,
degrn (bk ) = 8 + 1 + 4k + 3 = 4k + 12,
degrn (ck ) = 6 + 1 + (4k − 1) + 2 + 5 = 4k + 11,
degrn (dk ) = 3 + 1 + 1 + (4k − 1) + 7 = 4k + 13.
8

In particular,
degrn (a(n−14)/4 ) = n,

degrn (b(n−14)/4 ) = n − 2,

degrn (c(n−14)/4 ) = n − 3,

degrn (d(n−14)/4 ) = n − 1.

The degree of the remaining vertices of rn−4 has not changed in the union. Moreover,
degrn (u(n−14)/4 ) = 10, degrn (v(n−14)/4 ) = 8, and degrn (w(n−14)/4 ) = 6. As for order,
pc(n−14)/4 introduces 12 new vertices plus those given by the h-splittings, namely 4(n −
14)/4 + 2 + 4(n − 14)/4 − 1 = 2n − 27. It follows that
n2 − 11n + 62
.
4
Therefore, rn does indeed have property Pn . Moreover, it is clear from the construction that
rn−4 ≺ rn .
|V (rn )| = p(n − 4) + 12 + 2n − 27 =

4.3

The cases n ≡ 1, 0, 3 (mod 4)

Algorithm 8 (Part II). Continuing Algorithm 8, for n ≥ 16, n ≡ 1 (resp. ≡ 0) (mod 4),
we start by constructing rn−3 (resp. rn−2 ) as above. We then define
rn := rn−3 ∪ end1;n
(resp. rn := rn−2 ∪ end0;n ) with end1;n (resp. end0;n ) given by Figure 4a (resp. 4b).
For n ≡ 1, in the union rn := rn−3 ∪ end1;n , vertices u(n−17)/4 , v(n−17)/4 , w(n−17)/4 , x(n−17)/4
are identified with a, b, c, d respectively. For n ≡ 0, in the union rn := rn−2 ∪ end0;n , vertices
u(n−16)/4 , v(n−16)/4 , w(n−16)/4 , x(n−16)/4 are identified with ā, b̄, c̄, d ̄ respectively.
Finally, if n ≡ 3 (mod 4), we take
rn := rn−2 ∪ end0;n = rn−5 ∪ end1;n−2 ∪ end0;n ,
identifying d, v, w, x of end1;n−2 with ā, b̄, c̄, d ̄ of end0;n respectively.
Proof of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 16, n ≡ 1, 0, 3 (mod 4). If n ≡ 1, in rn one has deg(a) = n,
deg(b) = n − 1, and deg(c) = n − 2. The remaining valencies ≥ 4 of rn−3 do not change in
the union rn . Moreover, deg(d) = 10, deg(v) = 8, and deg(w) = 6. Lastly, by Theorem 2 in
the already proven case n ≡ 2,
|V (rn )| = p(n − 3) + 9 + (n − 11)/2 + (n − 13)/2 + (n − 15)/2 =

n2 − 11n + 62
4

as required.
Similarly, if n ≡ 0, in rn it holds that deg(ā) = n, deg(b̄) = n − 1, deg(c̄) = 10,
 ̄ = 8, and deg(w̄) = 6. Further,
deg(d)

The relations (1.2) are clear by construction. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.
Remark 9. The time to implement Algorithm 8 is quadratic in n, and this is optimal in
the sense that the order of rn is itself quadratic (1.1). Moreover, constructing rN takes no
more time than obtaining all of
r14 , r18 , . . . , rN −(N mod 4+2) , rN
(cf. (1.2)).

Another application

The ideas of the preceding sections have solved the problem of finding for all n a graph
satisfying Pn of Definition 1. The following lemma constitutes an application of the same
ideas, and it illustrates how a minor modification of Algorithm 8 allows to answer similar
questions. Moreover, the result of the lemma will be needed in section 6.
Lemma 10. Let n ≥ 17, n ≡ 1 (mod 4), and H be an order p polyhedral graph with at
least one vertex of degree i, 3 ≤ i ≤ n, and at least three vertices of degree n − 1. Then its
minimal order is
n2 − 7n + 34
.
(5.1)

10

Proof. Let us show the lower bound first. Similarly to Lemma 7, we begin by imposing
p

n2 − n − 10
−3+
dj ≥

leading to
n2 − n + 14
.
6
Thereby, for n ≥ 17, we certainly have 3 ≤ n − 4 ≤ (p + 4)/3. Applying (2.3) with k = n − 4
yields the inequality
p≥

n + 3(n − 1) +

(n − 2)(n − 1)
− 21 ≤ 2p + 6(n − 4) − 16,
2

and rearranging this inequality and imposing n ≡ 1 (mod 4) we obtain (5.1) as a lower
bound.
To show the upper bound, we will actually construct a graph sn satisfying the assumptions of the present lemma, of order (5.1). We set
sn := rn ∪ end0n

n ≥ 17, n ≡ 1

(mod 4)

(5.2)

where rn was constructed in Algorithm 8 and end0n is depicted in Figure 5.

Figure 5: The graph end0n . Dashed lines are not edges of end0n .
Since n ≡ 1 (mod 4),
sn = rn−3 ∪ end1;n ∪ end0n .
While performing the union, we identify vertices d, v, w, x of end1;n (Figure 4a) with a0 , b0 , c0 , d0
of end0n in this order. Then sn is clearly still a polyhedron. Further, degsn (a0 ) = 10 + 2 + n −
13 = n − 1, degsn (b0 ) = 8 + 4 + n − 13 = n − 1, degsn (c0 ) = 6 + 4 = 10, degsn (d0 ) = 3 + 5 = 8,
and degsn (w0 ) = 6. Since rn has the property Pn , then sn has vertices of each degree i,
3 ≤ i ≤ n. The union with end0n has inserted two more vertices of valency n − 1. Lastly,
|V (sn )| = |V (rn )| + 6 + (n − 13) =

n2 − 7n + 34
n2 − 11n + 62 + 4n − 28
=
.

The proof of Lemma 10 is complete.
11

(5.3)

Remark 11. We record the following property of the graph sn . It plainly has degree 3
vertices, and contains among its faces the triangles
Fn;j = {vn;j;1 , vn;j;2 , vn;j;3 },

1 ≤ j ≤ (n − 1)/2

(5.4)

where deg(vn;1;1 ) = deg(vn;1;2 ) = n − 1,
{deg(vn;j;1 ) : 2 ≤ j ≤ (n − 1)/2} ∪ {deg(vn;j;2 ) : 2 ≤ j ≤ (n − 1)/2} = {4, 5, . . . , n}
and
vn;j;3 6= vn;i;1 , vn;i;2 ,

∀j, i.

This property, stronger than Qn of Definition 3, shall be denoted by Rn . Indeed for sn , Rn
is easily observed by construction. For instance, we may take the pairs
(7, 4), (13, 12), (9, 5), (14, 11),
(4k + 14, 4k + 12), (4k + 11, 4k + 13)

for 1 ≤ k ≤ (n − 17)/4,

(n, n − 1), (n − 2, 10), (n − 1, n − 1), (8, 6)
where the notation (a, b) means that if u, v denote two vertices of one of the triangles Fn;j ,
then deg(u) = a and deg(v) = b.

6.1

Proof of Theorem 4
Premise
We first introduce the main ideas of the proof, via the following lemma.

Lemma 12. Let tl be as in Theorem 4. Then we may construct a sequence of 3-polytopes
{tn }n=l+2k,

k≥1 ,

where tl+m(k−1) ≺ tl+mk for k ≥ 1, and each tn satisfies Qn . Moreover along the sequence,
for all  > 0, one has
n2
+ (−1 + ) n
(6.1)
|V (tn )| ≤
4
as n → ∞.
Here we prove the first statement, relegating the proof of the second one (6.1) to section
6.3. The base case is just the assumption of the lemma. We take the inductive hypothesis
that tl+2(k−1) verifies property Ql+2(k−1) of Definition 3. Suppose that at step k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N ,
we were to perform 2-splitting on each triangle
Fl+2(k−1);j ,

1 ≤ j ≤ (l + 2(k − 1) − 3)/2
12

(1.3) about vertex vl+2(k−1);j;3 . That would raise by 2 the degrees of a set of vertices of
valencies 4, 5, . . . , l + 2(k − 1). However, in the resulting graph, we would not be guaranteed
vertices of degrees 4 and 5. Therefore, the 2-splitting is taken only for
2 ≤ j ≤ (l + 2(k − 1) − 3)/2
(i.e., all these faces save Fl+2(k−1);1 ). We replace Fl+2(k−1);1 with the graph S of Figure 6,
identifying vl+2(k−1);1;1 , vl+2(k−1);1;2 , vl+2(k−1);1;3 with a, b, c respectively.

Figure 6: The graph S.
In this way, the valencies of vl+2(k−1);1;1 and vl+2(k−1);1;2 increase by 2, and they belong
to the new triangle Fl+2k;(l+2k−3)/2 := {a, b, g}. Two vertices of valencies 4 and 5 are
introduced, namely d, e. Moreover, these two belong to a triangle Fl+2k;1 := {d, e, f }. We
also set
00
Fl+2k;j := {vl+2(k−1);j;1 , vl+2(k−1);j;2 , vl+2(k−1);j;3
},

2 ≤ j ≤ (l + 2k − 3)/2 − 1

00
where vl+2(k−1);j;3
is the second of the two vertices introduced in the 2-splitting of Fl+2(k−1);j .
We have thus constructed tl+2k satisfying Ql+2k as claimed.

In section 6.3, it will be shown that the above produces a sequence of graphs tn verifying
(6.1). Our goal is to optimise this method to asymptotically improve this upper bound on
|V (tn )|.

6.2

The algorithm

In section 6.1 we have used the polyhedron S as it has the 2 triangles {a, b, g} and
{d, e, f }, with vertices of appropriate valencies deg(d) = 5 and deg(e) = deg(a) = deg(b) =
4. A refinement of this idea is then to pick m even and use in place of S a polyhedron
containing (m + 2)/2 triangles, where two vertices from each form a set of vertices of degrees
m + 3, m + 2, m + 2, m + 2, m + 1, m, m − 1, . . . , 5, 4.
We have seen in Remark 11 that for m ≥ 14, sm+3 has the desired property Rm+3 .
Algorithm 13.
Input. A 3-polytopal graph tl satisfying Ql , an integer m ≥ 14, m ≡ 2 (mod 4), and a
positive integer N .
13

Output. A set of graphs {tn = tl+mk : 1 ≤ k ≤ N }, each satisfying property Qn , and
tl+m(k−1) ≺ tl+mk . These are the first N entries of a sequence verifying (1.5).
Description. Starting from tl , we perform steps 1 ≤ k ≤ N as follows. The graph
tl+m(k−1) verifies Ql+m(k−1) , i.e. it has (l + m(k − 1) − 3)/2 triangular faces
Fl+m(k−1);j = {vl+m(k−1);j;1 , vl+m(k−1);j;2 , vl+m(k−1);j;3 },

1 ≤ j ≤ (l + m(k − 1) − 3)/2

where
{deg(vl+m(k−1);j;1 ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ (l + m(k − 1) − 3)/2}
∪ {deg(vl+m(k−1);j;2 ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ (l + m(k − 1) − 3)/2} = {4, 5, . . . , l + m(k − 1)}.
At step k, we m-split the Fl+m(k−1);j about vl+m(k−1);j;3 , for j = 2, . . . , (l + m(k − 1) −
3)/2. Next, we replace the remaining triangle Fl+m(k−1);1 with a copy of sm+3 from Lemma
10, identifying vl+m(k−1);1;1 and vl+m(k−1);1;2 with two adjacent vertices of degree m + 2
in sm+3 . This is well defined, since m + 3 ≥ 17, m + 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4), and sm+3 has
property Rm+3 (Remark 11). In this way, we have increased by m the degrees of a set
of vertices of valencies 4, 5, . . . , l + m(k − 1), and we have introduced m new vertices of
degrees {4, 5, . . . , m + 3} (applying Lemma 10). Moreover, these new vertices, together with
vl+m(k−1);1;1 and vl+m(k−1);1;2 , belong pairwise to (m + 2)/2 triangles, by the construction
of sm+3 (Remark 11). We have thus obtained tl+mk satisfying Ql+mk . Relation (1.6) follows
by construction.

6.3

Concluding the proofs of Theorem 4 and Lemma 12

It remains to show (1.5). In Algorithm 13, starting with |V (tl )| vertices, at step k ≥ 1 we
have inserted m of them for each of (l − 3 + m(k − 1))/2 − 1 m-splittings, plus |V (sm+3 )| − 3
for the operation on Fl+m(k−1);1 (i.e. replacing this triangle with a copy of sm+3 ). Therefore,

as required. The proof of Theorem 4 is complete.
Note that m was chosen so that m + 3 ≥ 17 and m + 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4) hold, in order to
minimise the quantity
4|V (sm+3 )| − m2 − 10m − 12
4m
(Lemma 10) so that ultimately the coefficient of n in (1.5) is as small as this method allows.
In Lemma 12, we had fixed instead m = 2, and used the graph S (Figure 6) in place of
sm+3 . Since |V (S)| = 7, we get (6.1). This concludes the proof of Lemma 12.

Future directions. The ideas behind Algorithms 8 and 13 are readily generalisable to
tackle problems of a similar flavour, as shown for instance in section 5. The constructions,
or a slight modification thereof, allow to minimise the total number of vertices of a graph,
where certain valencies have been fixed.

A

Another way to present Algorithm 8

The following construction of rn may be more intuitive than Algorithm 8, albeit less apt
for implementation. We begin by fixing n ≥ 9 and defining a polyhedron A(n) of order n − 5
as follows. Given an initial triangle {v1 , v2 , v3 }, we add in order v4 , v5 , . . . , vn−5 together
with edges
vi vi−1 , vi vi−2 , vi vi−3 ,
i = 4, 5, . . . , n − 5
(splitting operations). The resulting A(n) for n = 14, 21 are illustrated in Figure 7.

(a) A(14)

(b) A(21)

Figure 7: Illustration of the construction A(n).
We note that A(9) ∼
= r3 , A(10) ∼
= r4.2 , A(11) ∼
= r5.2 , and A(12) ∼
= r6.3 from Figure 8.
For all n ≥ 11, the degree sequence of these graphs is
3, 4, 5, 6n−11 , 5, 4, 3

15

where the superscript is a shorthand indicating quantities of repeated numbers, e.g. 6n−11
means n − 11 vertices of degree 6.
Assuming n ≥ 14, we pass from A(n) to another polyhedron B(n) in the following way.
Firstly, we apply the splitting operation to every face of A(n). This has the effect of doubling
all previous vertex degrees, and introducing 2(n − 5) − 4 new ones (A(n) is a triangulation
– it is maximal planar) so that the sequence is now
6, 8, 10, 12n−11 , 10, 8, 6, 32n−14 .
Secondly, we split either of the two faces containing v1 , v4 . This yields in particular a vertex
of degree 4. To obtain one of degree 5, we split the two faces that are adjacent to one
another and that contain v2 , v5 and v3 , v5 respectively. For instance, in Figure 1, inserting
v24 raises the valency of v10 to 4, and inserting v25 , v26 raises the valency of v11 to 5. The
constructed polyhedron shall we denoted by B(n). Its order is
|V (B(n))| = (n − 5) + (2(n − 5) − 4) + 3 = 3n − 16,

(A.1)

7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 12, 12n−14 , 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 32n−13 .

(A.2)

and its sequence
In (A.2), we have purposefully isolated a subset of vertices of degree 12
V 0 := V 0 (B(n)) ⊂ V (B(n)),

(A.3)

with cardinality n − 14, keeping the remaining one aside.
We have B(14) ∼
= r14 (Figure 1). For n ≥ 16 our strategy is outlined as follows. The
vertices in A(n) have been designated to eventually correspond to ones of degree 6 or higher
in rn . Following the ideas of section 3, B(n) has been constructed by splitting faces of
A(n) that contain three of these vertices of high degree. Next, starting from B(n), we split
faces containing two of them. We take four vertices from V 0 of (A.3). Via nine repeated
splitting operations, we aim to raise their degrees to 15, 16, 17, 18. Similarly, the next four
shall become of degrees 19, 20, 21, 22, and so forth 4k + 11, 4k + 12, 4k + 13, 4k + 14. This
procedure ends when there remain either 2, 3, 0, or 5 vertices in V 0 , depending on whether
n ≡ 0, 1, 2, or 3 (mod 4). For n ≡ 2 the algorithm stops here. In the other cases n ≡ 0, 1, 3,
we look to apply further triangle splittings, to obtain vertices of degrees
n − 1, n,

n − 2, n − 1, n,

or n − 4, n − 3, n − 2, n − 1, n

respectively. The details have already been presented in section 4.
