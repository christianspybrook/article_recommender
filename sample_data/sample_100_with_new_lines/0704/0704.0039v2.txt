abstract
the quadratic pion scalar radius hr 2 is  plays an important role for present precise determinations of  scattering recently yndurin using an omns representation of the null
isospini nonstrange pion scalar form factor obtains hr 2 is  075  007 fm2  this value is
larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding muskhelishviliomns equations
hr 2 is  061  004 fm2  a large discrepancy between both values given the precision then
results we reanalyze yndurins method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input  phase shifts a zero in the
form factor for some swave i0 t matrices is then required once this is accounted for
the resulting value is hr 2 is  065  005 fm2  the main source of error in our determination
is present experimental uncertainties in low energy swave i0  phase shifts another
important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase
of the scalar form factor from qcd
introduction
the scalar form factor of the pion  t corresponds to the matrix element
 t  d4 x eiq qx hq   mu xux  md dxdx
qi  t  q   q2 
performing a taylor expansion around t  0
1 2 
 t   0 1  thr is  ot  
where hr 2is is the quadratic scalar radius of the pion
the quantity hr 2 is contributes around 10 1 to the values of the swave  scattering lengths
a0 and a20 as determined in ref1 by employing roy equations and p t to two loops if one
takes into account that this reference gives a precision of 22 in its calculation of the scattering
lengths a 10 of contribution from hr 2 is is a large one related to that hr 2 is is also important
in su2  su2 p t since it gives the low energy constant l4 that controls the departure of f
from its value in the chiral limit 2 3 at leading order correction
based on one loop p t  gasser and leutwyler 2 obtained hr 2 is  055  015 fm2  this
calculation was improved later on by the same authors together with donoghue 4 who solved
the corresponding muskhelishviliomns equations with the coupled channels of  and k k the
update of this calculation performed in ref1 gives hr 2 is  061004 fm2  where the new results
on swave i0  phase shifts from the roy equation analysis of ref5 are included moussallam
6 employs the same approach and obtains values in agreement with the previous result
one should notice that solutions of the muskhelishviliomns equations for the scalar form
factor rely on nonmeasured t matrix elements or on assumptions about which are the channels
that matter given the importance of hr 2 is  and the possible systematic errors in the analyses
based on muskhelishviliomns equations other independent approaches are most welcome in
this respect we quote the works 7 8 9 and yndurins ones 10 11 12 these latter works have
challenged the previous value for hr 2 is  shifting it to the larger hr 2 is  075  007 fm2  from
ref1 the equations
a00  0027r2  a20  0004r2 
give the change of the scattering lengths under a variation of hr 2 is defined by hr 2is  0611 
r2  fm2  for the difference between the central values of hr 2 is given above from refs1 10 one
has r2  023 this corresponds to a00  0006 and a20  0001 while the errors quoted
are a00  0220  0005 and a20  00444  00010 we then adduce about shifting the central
values for the predicted scattering lengths at the level of one sigma
the value taken for hr 2 is is also important for determining the op4  p t coupling l4  the
value of ref1 is l4  44  02 while that of ref10 is l4  54  05 both values are incompatible
within errors
the papers 10 11 12 have been questioned in refs13 14 the value of the k quadratic
2 k
scalar radius hr 2 ik
 031  006 fm2  is not accurate
s  obtained by yndurin in ref10 hr is
because he relies on old experiments and on a bad parameterization of low energy swave i12 k
phase shifts by assuming dominance of the  resonance as a standard breitwigner pole 15 furthermore hr 2 ik
was recently fixed by high statistics experiments in an interval in agreement with
the sharp prediction of 15 based on dispersion relations threechannel muskhelishviliomns
equations from the t matrix of ref16 and twoloop pt 17 from the recent experiments
18 19 one has for the charged kaons 18 hr 2 ik
 0235  0014  0007 fm2  and for the
neutral ones 19 hr 2 ik
 0165  0016 fm2  the prediction of 15 in an isospin limit is
hr 2 ik
 0192  0012 fm2  lying just in the middle of the experimental determinations another
issue is yndurins more sound determination of the pionic scalar radius whose incorrectness is
not settled yet
in this paper we concentrate on the approach of yndurin 10 11 12 to evaluate the quadratic
scalar radius of the pion based on an omns representation of the i0 nonstrange pion scalar form
factor our main conclusion will be that this approach 10 and the solution of the muskhelishviliomns equations 4 with  and k k as coupled channels agree between each other if one
properly takes into account for some t matrices the presence of a zero in the pion scalar form
factor at energies slightly below the k k threshold precisely these t matrices are those used in
10 and favoured in 11 once this is considered we conclude that hr 2 is  063  005 fm2 
the contents of the paper are organized as follows in section 2 we discuss the omns representation of  t and derive the expression to calculate hr 2 is  this calculation is performed
in section 3 where we consider different parameterizations for experimental data and asymptotic
phases for the scalar form factor conclusions are given in the last section
scalar form factor
the pion scalar form factor  t eq11 is an analytic function of t with a right hand cut
due to unitarity for t  4m2  performing a dispersion relation of its logarithm with the possible
zeroes of  t removed the omns representation results
 z 
ds 
 t  p t exp
 4m2 ss  t
here p t is a polynomial made up from the zeroes of  t with p 0   0 in the previous
equation s is the phase of  tp t taken to be continuous and such that 4m2   0 in
ref10 the scalar form factor is assumed to be free of zeroes and hence p t is just the constant
 0 the exponential factor is 1 for t  0 thus
 z 
 t   0 exp
ds 
 4m2 ss  t
from where it follows that
hr 2 is
4m2
ds 
one of the features of the pion scalar form factor of refs4 6 8 as discussed in ref13 is the
presence of a strong dip at energies around the k k threshold this feature is also shared by the
strong swave i0  amplitude t  this is so because t is in very good approximation purely
elastic below the k k threshold and hence neglecting inelasticity altogether in the discussion that
follows it is proportional to sin  ei  with  the swave i0  phase shift it is an experimental
fact that  is very close to  around the k k threshold as shown in fig1 therefore if   
happens before the opening of this channel the strong amplitude has a zero at that energy on
the other hand if    occurs after the k k threshold because inelasticity is then substantial
see eq24 below there is not a zero but a pronounced dip in t  this dip can be arbitrarily
close to zero if before the k k threshold  approaches  more and more without reaching it

figure 1 swave i  0  phase shift  s experimental data are from refs21 25 26 27
because of watson final state theorem the phase s in eq21 is given by  s below the
k k threshold neglecting inelasticity due to 4 or 6 states as indicated by experiments 20 the
situation above the k k threshold is more involved let us recall that
t   e2i  12i 
with 0    1 and the inelasticity is given by 1   2  with  the elasticity coefficient we denote
by s the phase of t  required to be continuous below 4m2k it is given by  s by continuity
close enough to the k k threshold and above it   1 and then we are in the same situation as in
the elastic case as a result because of the watson final state theorem and continuity the phase
s must still be given by s for  sk    sk  4m2k  s does not follow the increasing
trend with energy of  s but drops as a result of eq24 see fig2 for  sk    this is easily
seen by writing explicitely the real and imaginary parts of t in eq24

figure 2 left panel strong phase s eigenvalue phase  s and asymptotic phase as s right
panel integrand of hr 2 is in eq312 for parameterization i dashed line and ii solid line for more
details see the text notice that the uncertainty due to as s is much reduced in the integrand
the imaginary part is always positive   1 above the k k threshold and 11 gev 20 while the
real part is negative for    but in an interval of just a few mev the real part turns positive
as soon as    fig1 as a result s passes quickly from values below but close to  to
the interval 0 2 this rapid motion of s gives rise to a pronounced minimum of  t at
this energy as indicated in ref13 and shown in fig3 the drop in s becomes more and more
dramatic as  sk     with the superscript  indicating that the limit is approached from
values abovebelow respectively and in this limit sk   sk  is discontinuous at sk  this is
easily understood from eq25 let us call s1 the point at which  s1    with s1  sk  close
and above s1  s  0 2 for the reasons explained above and s has decreased very rapidly
from almost  at the k k threshold to values below 2 just after s1  then in the limit s1  s
one has s
k   sk    on the left while on the right sk   sk   2 as a result s
is discontinuous at s  sk  we stress that this discontinuity of s at sk when  sk    
applies rigorously to sk  as well since sk   1 this discontinuity at s  sk implies also that
the integrand in the omns representation for  t develops a logarithmic singularity as
k   sk 
log
with   0  when exponentiating this result one has a zero for  sk  as sk     s
sk   0 and   0  this zero is a necessary consequence when evolving continuously from
 sk    to  sk   1 this in turn implies rigorously that in the omns representation of
 t eq21 p t must be a polynomial of first degree for those cases with  sk   2
p t   0
s1  t
with s1 the position of the zero notice that the degree of the polynomial p t is discrete and thus
by continuity it cannot change unless a singularity develops this is the case when  sk   
changing the degree from 0 to 1 hence if  sk    for a given t  instead of eqs22 and
23 one must then consider
 z 
s1  t
 t   0
exp
ds 
 4m2 ss  t
and
hr 2 is
s1 
4m2
ds 
for those t for which  sk    then s follows  s just after the k k threshold and there
is no drop as emphasized in ref11 see fig2
summarizing we have shown that  t has a zero at s1 when  sk    as a consequence of
the assumption that s follows s above the k k threshold along the lines of ref11 and by
imposing continuity in  t under small changes in  sk    as a result eqs28 and 29
should be used in the latter case instead of eqs22 and 23 valid for  sk    this solution
was overlooked in refs10 11 12 we show in appendix a why the previous discussion on the
zero of  t for  sk    at s1 cannot be applied to all pion scalar form factors in particular
to the strange one
if eq22 were used for those t with  sk    then a strong maximum of  t would
be obtained around the k k threshold instead of the aforementioned zero or the minimum of
refs4 6 as shown in fig3 by the dasheddotted line that is also shown in fig10 of ref22
or fig2 of 13 this is the situation for the  t of refs10 11 and it is the reason why hr 2 is
obtained there is much larger than that of refs4 1 6 that is yndurin uses eqs22 23 for
 sk    instead of eqs28 29 solid line in fig3 the unique and important role played
by  sk  for elastic t below the k k threshold is perfectly recognised in ref11 however in
this reference the astonishing conclusion that  t has two radically different behaviours under
tiny variations of t was sustained these variations are enough to pass from  sk    to
 sk    10 while the t  or smatrix are fully continuous because of this instability of the
solution of refs10 11 under tiny changes of  s we consider ours that produces continuous
 t to be certainly preferred we also stress that our solutions either for  sk    and
 sk    are the ones that agree with those obtained by solving the muskhelishviliomns
equations 4 1 6 and unitary pt 8
it can be shown from eq25 that s
k   sk    here we are assuming   1 for s  sk  which is a
very good approximation as indicated by experiment 20 21
we are focusing in the physically relevant region of experimental allowed values for  sk  which can be larger

figure 3  t 0 from eq22 with  sk    dashedline and  sk    dasheddotted line
the solid line corresponds to use eq28 for the latter case for this figure we have used parameterization
ii defined in section 3 with 1  228 dashed line and 220 dasheddotted and solid lines the
dasheddoubledotted line is the scalar form factor of ref8 that has  sk   
let us now show how to fix s1 in terms of the knowledge of  s with  sk    for this
purpose let us perform a dispersion relation of  t with two subtractions
t2  im s
1 2 
ds 
210
 t   0  hr is t 
 4m2 s2 s  t
from asymptotic qcd 23 one expects that the scalar form factor vanishes at infinity 10 12
then the dispersion integral in eq210 should converge rather fast eq210 is useful because
it tells us that the only point around 1 gev where there can be a zero in  t is at the energy
s1 for which the imaginary part of  t vanishes otherwise the integral in the right hand side
of eq210 picks up an imaginary part and there is no way to cancel it as  0 hr 2 is and t are
all real since im t   t sin  t for t  sk  it certainly vanishes at the point s1 where
 s1    as there is only one zero at such energies this determines s1 exactly in terms of the
given parameterization for  s
one could argue against the argument just given to determine s1 that this energy could be
complex however this would imply two zeroes at s1 and s1  and then the degree of p t would
be two instead of one notice that the degree of the polynomial p t is discrete and thus by
softness in the continuous parameters of the t matrix its value should stay at 1 for some open
domain in the parameters with  sk    until a discontinuity develops physically the presence
of two zeroes would in turn require that s  3 so as to guarantee that  t still vanishes as
1t as required by asymptotic qcd 23 10 this value for the asymptotic phase seems to be
rather unrealistic as s only reaches 2 at already quite high energy values as shown in fig2

with sh  225 gev2  reasons for fixing sh to this value are given below
the main issue in the application of eq311 is to determine s in the integrand below the
k k threshold and neglecting inelasticity one has that s   s 4m2  s  4m2k  this follows
because of the watson final state theorem continuity and the equality 4m2    4m2   0
for practical applications we shall consider the swave i0  phase shifts given by the
kmatrix parameterization of ref20 from its energy dependent analysis of data from 06 gev
up to 19 gev and the parameterizations of ref1 cgl and ref24 py the resulting  s
for all these parameterizations are shown in fig1 we use cgl from  threshold up to 08 gev
because this is the upper limit of its analysis while py is used up to 09 gev because at this
energy it matches well inside the experimental errors with the data of 20 the kmatrix of
ref20 is used for energies above 08 gev when using cgl below this energy parameterization
i and above 09 gev when using py for lower energies parameterization ii we take the parameterizations cgl and py as their difference below 08 gev accounts well for the experimental
uncertainties in   see fig1 and they satisfy constraints from p t the former and dispersion relations both the reason why we skip to use the parameterization of ref20 for lower energies is
because one should be there as precise as possible since this region gives the largest contribution to
hr 2 is  as it is evident from the right panel of fig2 it happens that the kmatrix of 20 that fits
data above 06 gev is not compatible with data from ke4 decays 25 26 we show in the insert
of fig1 the comparison of the parameterizations cgl and py with the ke4 data of 25 26 we
also show in the same figure the experimental points on  from refs20 21 27 both refs20 21
are compatible within errors with some disagreement above 15 gev this disagreement does not
affect our numerical results since above 15 gev we do not rely on data
the kmatrix of ref20 is given by

with units given in appropriate powers of gev in order to calculate the contribution from the
phase shifts of this kmatrix we generate montecarlo gaussian samples taking into account the
errors shown in eq314 and evaluate qh according to eq312 the central value of  sk 
for the kmatrix of ref20 is 305 slightly below  when generating montecarlo gaussian
samples according to eq314 there are cases with  sk    around 30 of the samples note
that for these cases one also has the contribution 6s1 in eq311
the application of watson final state theorem for s  4m2k is not straightforward since inelastic
channels are relevant the first important one is the k k channel associated in turn with the
appearance of the narrow f0 980 resonance just on top of its threshold this implies a sudden
drop of the elasticity parameter  but it again rapidly raises the f0 980 resonance is narrow
with a width around 30 mev and in the region 112  s  152 gev2 is compatible within
errors with   1 20 21 for   1 the watson final state theorem would imply again that
s  s but as emphasized by 13 this equality only holds in principle modulo  the
reason advocated in ref13 is the presence of the region sk  s  112 gev2 where inelasticity
can be large and then continuity arguments alone cannot be applied to guarantee the equality
s  s for s  112 gev2  this argument has been proved in ref11 to be quite irrelevant
in the present case in order to show this a diagonalization of the  and k k smatrix is done
these channels are the relevant ones when  is clearly different from 1 between 1 and 11 gev
above that energy one also has the opening of the  channel and the increasing role of multipion
states
we reproduce here the arguments of ref11 but deliver expressions directly in terms of the
phase shifts and elasticity parameter instead of kmatrix parameters as done in ref11 for
two channel scattering because of unitarity the t matrix can be written as
1   2 ei k 
315
1   2 ei k  2i1 e2ik  1
with k the elastic swave i0 k k phase shift in terms of the t matrix the swave i0 smatrix
is given by
s  i  2it 
316
satisfying ss   s  s  i the t matrix can also be written as
1 12
t  q12 k 1  iq
317
where the kmatrix is real and symmetric along the real axis for s  4m2 and q  diagq  qk 
with q qk  the center of mass momentum of pionskaons this allows one to diagonalize k with
a real orthogonal matrix c and hence both the t  and smatrices are also diagonalized with
the same matrix writing

the eigenvalue phase  satisfies  sk    sk  the expressions above for exp 2i and
exp 2i interchange between each other when tan  crosses zero and simultaneously the sign in
the right hand side of eq319 for sin  changes this diagonalization allows to disentangle two

the  in front of 2  is due to the fact that 2  0 at sk  as follows from its definition in the
equation above since watson final state theorem only fixes the phase of 2 up to modulo  and
the phase is not defined in the zero we cannot fix the sign in front at this stage next 1 has a
zero at s1 when  sk    for this case 1  must appear in the previous equation so as to
 sk 
guarantee continuity of its ascribed phase
pand this is why   1
now when   1 then sin   0 as 1  2 and s is then the eigenvalue phase  
this eigenvalue phase can be calculated given the t matrix for those t matrices employed
here and those of refs10 11 4 13  s follows rather closely s in the whole energy range
this is shown in fig2 and already discussed in detail in ref11 in this way one guarantees
that s and s do not differ between each other in an integer multiple of  when   1
112  s  152 gev2 
for the calculation of qh in eq312 we shall equate s  s for 4m2k  s  152 gev2

324
now eq322 can also be used to estimate the error of approximating s by s in the range
4m2k  s  152 gev2 to calculate i2 and i3 as done in eq323 we could have also used  s
in eq323 however notice that when   1 then s   s and when inelasticity could be
substantial the difference between  s and s is well taken into account in the error analysis
that follows remarkably consistency of our approach also requires s to be closer to s than
to  s the reason is that s for  sk    is in very good approximation the s for
 sk    plus  this is clear from fig2 this difference is precisely the required one in order
to have the same value for hr 2is either for  sk    or  sk    from eq311 however the
difference for  s between  sk    and  sk    is smaller than  indeed we note that
s follows closer s than  s for the explicit form factors of refs8 4
let us consider first the range 112  s  152 gev2 where from experiment 20   1 within

the the ratio 2 1  present in  is not expected to be large since the f0 1300 couples mostly to 4 and
similarly to  and k k and the f0 1500 does mostly to  28
using   08 in the range 112  s  152 gev   1 from the energy dependent analysis of
ref20 given by the kmatrix of eq313 one ends with   03 taking into account that 
is larger than  32 for  sk    in this case     and around 34 for  sk   
see fig2 one ends with relative corrections to  around 6 for the former case and 13 for the
latter although the kmatrix of ref20 eq313 is given up to 19 gev one should be aware
that to take only the two channels  and k k in the whole energy range is an oversimplification
particularly above 12 gev because of this we finally double the previous estimate hence i3 is
calculated with a relative error of 12 for  sk    and 25 for  sk   
in the narrow region between sk  s  112 gev2   can be rather different from 1 due to
the f0 980 that couples very strongly to the just open k k channel however from the direct
measurements of   k k 29 where 1   2 is directly measured4 one has a better way to
determine  than from  scattering 20 21 it results from the former experiments as shown
also by explicit calculations 30 31 32 that  is not so small as indicated in  experiments 20
and one has   06  07 for its minimum value employing   06 in eq328 then   05
taking  around 2 when  sk    this implies a relative error of 30 for  sk    one
has instead    and a 15 of estimated error regarding the ratio of the moduli of form
factors entering in  we expect it to be  1 see appendix a therefore our error in the evaluation
of i2 is estimated to be 30 and 15 for the cases  sk    and  sk    respectively
as a result of the discussion following eq324 we consider that the error estimates done
for i2 and i3 in the case  sk    are too conservative and that the relative errors given for
 sk    are more realistic nonetheless since the absolute errors that one obtains for i2 and
i3 are the same in both cases because i2 and i3 for  sk    are around a factor 2 smaller than
those for  sk    we keep the errors as given above to the previous errors for i2 and i3 due
to inelasticity we also add in quadrature the noise in the calculation of qh due to the error in
t from the uncertainties in the parameters of the kmatrix eqs313 314 and those in the
parameterizations cgl and py
we finally employ for s  225 gev2 the knowledge of the asymptotic phase of the pion scalar
form factor in order to evaluate qa in eq312 the function s is determined so as to match
with the asymptotic behaviour of  t as 1t from qcd the omns representation of the
scalar form factor eqs22 and 28 tends to tq and tq1 for t   respectively here q
is the asymptotic value of the phase s when s   hence for  sk    the function s
is then required to tend to  while for  sk    the asymptotic value should be 2 the way
s is predicted to approach the limiting value is somewhat ambiguous 11 12

table 1 different contributions to hr 2 is as defined in eqs312 and 323 all the units are fm2 
in the value for hr 2 is the errors due to i1  i2  i3 and qa are added in quadrature
bands the values of sas for s  225 gev2 from eq329 considering both signs for n  1
 sk    and 2  sk    we see in the figure that above 1415 gev 196225 gev2 
both s and sas phases match and this is why we take sh  225 gev2 in eq311 similarly
as done in refs10 11 in this way we also avoid to enter into hadronic details in a region where
  1 with the onset of the f0 1500 resonance the present uncertainty whether the  or  sign
holds in eq329 is taken as a source of error in evaluating qa  the other source of uncertainty
comes from the value taken for 2  01  2  035 gev2  as suggested in ref10 from fig2 it is
clear that our error estimate for as s is very conservative and should account for uncertainties
due to the onset of inelasticity for energies above 14  15 gev and to the appearance of the
f0 1500 resonance in the right panel of fig2 we show the integrand for hr 2 is  eq312 for
parameterization i dashed line and ii solid line notice as the large uncertainty in as s is
much reduced in the integrand as it happens for the higher energy domain
in table 1 we show the values of i1  i2  i3  qh  qa and hr 2 is for the parameterizations i and
ii and for the two cases  sk    and  sk    this table shows the disappearance of the
disagreement between the cases  sk    and  sk    from the  and k k t matrix
of eq313 once the zero of  t at s1  sk is taken into account for the former case this
disagreement was the reason for the controversy between yndurin and ref13 regarding the value
of hr 2 is  the fact that the parameterization ii gives rise to a larger value of hr 2 is than i is because
py follows the upper  data below 09 gev while cgl follows lower ones as shown in fig1
the different errors in table 1 are added in quadrature the final value for hr 2 is is the mean
between those of parameterizations i and ii and the error is taken such that it spans the interval
of values in table 1 at the level of two sigmas one ends with
hr 2 is  063  005 fm2 
330
the largest sources of error in hr 2 is are the uncertainties in the experimental  and in the
asymptotic phase as  this is due to the fact that the former are enhanced because of its weight
in the integrand see fig2 and the latter due to its large size
our number above and that of refs1 4 hr 2 is  061  004 fm2  are then compatible on the
other hand we have also evaluated hr 2 is directly from the scalar form factor obtained with the
dynamical approach of ref8 from unitary pt and we obtain hr 2is  064  006 fm2  in perfect
agreement with eq330 notice that the scalar form factor of ref8 has  sk    and we have
checked that it has a zero at s1  as it should this is shown in fig3 by the dasheddoubledotted line
the value hr 2 is  075007 fm2 from refs10 11 is much larger than ours because the possibility
of a zero at s1 was not taking into account there and other solution was considered this solution
however has an unstable behaviour under the transition  sk     0 to  sk     0 and
it cannot be connected continuously with the one for  sk    our solution for  t from
yndurins method does not have this unstable behaviour and it is continuous under changes in
the values of the parameters of the kmatrix eqs313 and 314 this is why from our results
it follows too that the interesting discussion of ref11 regarding whether  sk    or  
is not any longer conclusive to explain the disagreement between the values of refs10 11 and
ref1 for hr 2is 
we can also work out from our determination of hr 2 is  eq330 values for the op4  su2
p t low energy constant l4  we take the two loop expression in p t for hr 2 is 1
 r 
331
hr is  2 2 l4 
8 f
where f  924 mev is the pion decay constant   m 4f 2 and m is the pion mass first
at the one loop level calculation r  0 and then one obtains
l4  47  03 
332
we now move to the determination of l4 based on the full two loop relation between hr 2 is and l4 
the expression for r can be found in appendix c of ref1 r is given in terms of one op6 
p t counterterm res2  and four op4  ones taking the values of all these parameters but for l4 
from ref1 and solving for l4  one arrives to
l4  45  03 
333
this number is in good agreement with l4  44  02 1
ref12 also points out that one loop pt fits to the s p and dwave scattering lengths and
effective ranges give rise to much larger values for l2 and l4 than those of ref1 for more details

conclusions
in this paper we have addressed the issue of the discrepancies between the values of the quadratic
pion scalar radius of leutwyler et al 4 13 hr 2 is  061  004 fm2  and yndurins papers
10 11 12 hr 2 i  075007 fm2  one of the reasons of interest for having a precise determination
of hr 2 is is its contribution of a 10 to a00 and a20  calculated with a precision of 2 in ref1 the
value taken for hr 2 is is also important for determining the op4  pt coupling l4 
from our study it follows that yndurins method to calculate hr 2 is 10 11 based on an
omns representation of the pion scalar form factor and that derived by solving the twothree
coupled channel muskhelishviliomns equations 4 1 6 are compatible it is shown that the
reason for the aforementioned discrepancy is the presence of a zero in  t for those swave i0
t matrices with  sk    and elastic below the k k threshold with sk  4m2k  this zero
was overlooked in refs10 11 though if one imposes continuity in the solution obtained under
tiny changes of the  phase shifts employed it is necessarily required by the approach followed
there once this zero is taken into account the same value for hr 2 is is obtained irrespectively
of whether  sk    or  sk    our final result is hr 2 is  063  005 fm2  the error
estimated takes into account experimental uncertainty in the values of  s inelasticity effects
and present ignorance in the way the phase of the form factor approaches its asymptotic value 
as predicted from qcd employing our value for hr 2 is we calculate l4  45  03 the values
hr 2 is  061  004 fm2 and l4  45  03 of ref1 are then in good agreement with ours

coupled channel dynamics
we take  and k k coupled channels and denote by f1 and f2 their respective i0 scalar form
factors unitarity requires
imfi 
fj j t  sj tji 
where tij
 is the i0 swave t matrix si is the threshold energy square of channel i and
i  qi 8 s with qi its center of mass three momentum
a general solution to the previous equations is given by
f tg f 
where the functions gi t do not have right hand cut this equation is interesting as tells us that
if pion dynamics dominate g1   g2  then f1  g1 t11 and the form factor phase s follows
s as a result like t11  it has a zero at s1 below the k k threshold for  sk    as shown
in section 3 on the other hand if kaon dynamics dominates g2   g1  then f1  g2 t12 and
s follows the phase of t12  that above the k k threshold is clearly above  this is why for
the pion strange scalar form factor there is no zero at s1  sk for  sk    indeed there is a
maximum like that shown in fig3 by the dasheddotted line
as in section 3 we now proceed to the diagnolization above the k k threshold of the renormalized t matrix t  
t   t

t22  sin  ei 
the corresponding diagonal form factors f1 and f2  collected in the vector f   are
cos  1 g1  sin  2 g2 t11
f   c t 12 f  tec t 12 g   n
sin  1 g1  cos  2 g2 e
t22
the previous expressions allow to obtaining f1 directly in terms of the eigenphases and with clean
separation between pion g1  and kaon dynamics g2  from eq322 it follows that
12 12
f1  cos2  1 g1  cos  sin  2 1 g2 e
t11
12 12
 sin  1 g1  cos  sin  2 1 g2 t22 
for  sk    typical values somewhat above the k k threshold are e2i  i e2i  i
and sin   0 for dominance of g1 one has f1 g1  1
1 i  cos 22 while for dominance
12 12
of g2 the result is f1 g2   sin  cos  2 1
 0 the factors g12 do not introduce
any change in s with respect to its value before the opening of the k k threshold since they
are smooth functions in s5 in both cases the phase s is larger than  and f1 follows the
upper trend of phases shown in fig2 note that in this case e
t11 is in the first quadrant though
   now doing the same exercise for  sk    one has the typical values e2i  i
e2i  i and sin   0 for pion dominance then f1 g1  1
1 i  cos 22 and for the kaon
12 12
one f1 g2   sin  cos 2 1
 0 thus in the former case the phase is  2 and follows
the lower trend of phases of fig2 while in the latter is   and follows again the upper trend this
is the case of the strange scalar form factor
the demonstration in section 3 that sk  is discontinuous in the limit  sk     by taking
s1  s
k  cannot be applied in the case of kaon dominance eg pion strange scalar form factor
from eqa5 it follows that
12 12
f1 t   cos  sin 2 1 g2 e
t11  e
t22 
the point is that e
t22 for t  s1 s1  s
k  is of size comparable with that of t11 both tend to zero
and the phase does not follow   this is not the case for pion dominance because for s1  s
eqa5
and
follows
then sin2   0 f1 t  cos2  1
from eqa4 we can also write 2 2   e
t11 tan e
t22  for the case of pion dominance since
typically e
t11 e
t22   1 as shown above for energies somewhat above the k k threshold then
2 1    tan   1 this is why we consider that equating it to 1 in section 3 is a conservative
estimate
due to the adler zeroes this is not necessarily case close to the  threshold
