a transcendental approach to kollrs
injectivity theorem
osamu fujino
abstract we treat kollrs injectivity theorem from the analytic or differential geometric viewpoint more precisely we give
a curvature condition which implies kollr type cohomology injectivity theorems our main theorem is formulated for a compact
khler manifold but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms
on a zariski open set with a suitable complete khler metric we
need neither covering tricks desingularizations nor lerays spectral sequence

in ko1 jnos kollr proved the following theorem we call it
kollrs original injectivity theorem in this paper
theorem 11 cf ko1 theorem 22 let x be a smooth projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic
zero and let l be a semiample line bundle on x let s be a nonzero
holomorphic section of lk for some k  0 then

is injective for every q  0 and every m  1 where kx is the canonical
line bundle of x note that s is the homomorphism induced by the
tensor product with s
the following theorem is the main result of this paper it is an
analytic formulation of kollr type cohomology injectivity theorem
theorem 12 main theorem let x be an ndimensional compact
khler manifold let e he  resp l hl  be a holomorphic vector
resp line bundle on x with a smooth hermitian metric he resp hl 
let f be a holomorphic line bundle on x with a singular hermitian
metric hf  assume the following conditions
i there exists a subvariety z of x such that hf is smooth on
x  z
ii 1f    in the sense of currents where  is a smooth
1 1form on x
iii 1e  ide  f  nak 0 on x  z
iv 1e  ide  f   ide  l nak 0 on x  z for
some positive constant 
here nak 0 means the nakano semipositivity let s be a nonzero
holomorphic section of l then the multiplication homomorphism
s  h q x kx  e  f  j hf   h q x kx  e  f  j hf   l
is injective for every q  0 where j hf  is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the singular hermitian metric hf of f 
the formulation of theorem 12 was inspired by ohsawas injectivity
theorem see o2 although the assumptions in theorem 12 may
look artificial for algebraic geometers our main theorem is useful and
have potentiality for various generalizations as a direct consequence
of theorem 12 we have the following corollary
corollary 13 let x be an ndimensional compact khler manifold
let e he  resp l hl  be a holomorphic vector resp line bundle on x with a smooth hermitian metric he resp hl  let f be a
holomorphic line bundle on x assume the following conditions
a there exists an effective cartier divisor d on x such that
x d  f for some positive integer k
b 1e nak 0
c 1e  ide  l nak 0 for some positive constant
kollrs injectivity theorem
let s be a nonzero holomorphic section of l then the multiplication
homomorphism
s  h q x kx  e  f  j   h q x kx  e  f  j  l
is injective for every q  0 where j  j  k1 d is the multiplier ideal
sheaf associated to k1 d cf definition 28
one of the advantages of our formulation is that we are released from
sophisticated algebraic geometric methods such as desingularizations
covering tricks lerays spectral sequence and so on both in the proof
and in various applications see for example the proof of proposition
41 the main ingredient of our proof of theorem 12 is nakanos
identity see proposition 216
we note that there are many contributors kollr esnaultviehweg
kawamata ambro  to this kind of cohomology injectivity theorem we just mention that the first result was obtained by tankeev
tn proposition 1 it inspired kollr to obtain his famous injectivity
theorem see ko1 or theorem 11 after ko1 many generalizations
of theorem 11 were obtained see the books ev and ko2 kollr
did not refer to e in ko2 however we think that e is the first
paper where kollrs injectivity theorem is proved and generalized by
differential geometric arguments
let us recall enokis theorem e theorem 02 which is a very
special case of theorem 12 for the readers convenience to recover
corollary 14 from theorem 12 it is sufficient to put e  ox  f 
lm  and l  lk  the reader who reads japanese can find f2
useful it is a survey on enokis injectivity theorem
corollary 14 enoki let x be an ndimensional compact khler
manifold and let l be a semipositive holomorphic line bundle on x
suppose lk  k  0 admits a nonzero global holomorphic section s
then
s  h q x kx  lm   h q x kx  lmk 
is injective for every m  0 and every q  0
we recall enokis idea of the proof in e because we will use the
same idea to prove theorem 12
15 enokis proof from now on we assume that k  m  1 for
simplicity it is well known that the cohomology group h q x kx 
ll  is represented by the space of harmonic forms hnq ll   u 
   0 d l u  0
smooth ll valued n qform on x such that u
  we take u  hnq l then
where dll is the formal adjoint of 
 0 because s is holomorphic we can check that dl2 su  0
osamu fujino
by using nakanos identity and the semipositivity of l thus s induces s  hnq l  hnq l2  therefore the required injectivity is
obvious
enokis theorem contains kollrs original injectivity theorem cf theorem 11 by the following wellknown lemma
lemma 16 let l be a semiample line bundle on a smooth projective
manifold x then l is semipositive
proof there exists a morphism f  lm   x  pn induced by the
complete linear system lm  for some m  0 because l is semiample
let h be a smooth hermitian metric on opn 1 with positive definite
curvature then f  h m is a smooth hermitian metric on l whose
curvature is semipositive
remark 17 let x be a complex analytic space and let e be a coherent sheaf on x in order to prove h p x e  0 it is sufficient
to construct a homomorphism   e  f of coherent sheaves on x
such that the induced map h p x e  h p x f  is injective and that
h p x f   0 this simple observation plays crucial roles for various
vanishing theorems on toric varieties see for example f3 and f4
anyway injectivity theorems sometimes are very useful in proving various vanishing theorems see the proof of corollary 47 below
we quickly review kollrs proof of his injectivity theorem in ko2
which is much simpler than kollrs original proof in ko1 for the
readers convenience
18 kollrs proof let x be a smooth projective nfold and let l
be a not necessarily semiample line bundle on x let s be a nonzero holomorphic section of l2  assume that d  s  0 is a
smooth divisor on x for simplicity we can take a double cover  
z  x ramifying along d by the hodge decomposition we obtain
a surjection h q z cz   h q x oz  for every q by taking the antiinvariant part of the covering involution we obtain that h q x g 
h q x l1  is surjective for every q where  cz  cx  g is the
eigensheaf decomposition it is not difficult to see that there exists
a factorization h q x g  h q x l1  ox d  h q x l1 
for every q therefore s  h q x kx  l  h q x kx  l 
ox d is injective by the serre duality in general d is not necessarily
smooth so we have to use sophisticated algebraic geometric methods
such as desingularizations relative vanishing theorems lerays spectral
sequences and so on even when x is smooth and l is free
kollrs injectivity theorem
remark 19 as we saw in 18 thanks to the serre duality the injectivity of h q x kx  l  h q x kx  l  ox d is equivalent to
the surjectivity of h nq x l1  ox d  h nq x l1  however injectivity seems to be much better and more natural for some
applications and generalizations see section 4
roughly speaking kollrs geometric proof in ko2 and esnault
viehwegs proof in ev depends on the hodge decomposition or the
degeneration of the hodge to de rham type spectral sequence so
it works only when e is a unitary flat vector bundle see ko2 917
remark on the other hand our analytic proof and the proofs in e
o2 and tk relies on the harmonic representation of the cohomology
groups we do not know the true relationship between the geometric
proof and the analytic one
110 more advanced topics in f1 we prove a relative version of
theorem 12 in that case x is not necessarily compact when x is
not compact a locally square integrable differential form u on x is not
necessarily globally square integrable so we use ohsawatakegoshis
twisted version of nakanos identity to control the asymptotic behavior
of the l2 norm of u around the boundary of x thus we need much
more analytic methods for the relative setting
in f12 chapter 2 f5 and f11 sections 5 and 6 we develop the
geometric approach see 18 to obtain a very important generalization
of kollrs injectivity theorem in those papers we consider mixed
hodge structures on compact support cohomology groups roughly
speaking the decomposition
hcn x   c 
h q x px log   ox 
pqn
where x is a smooth projective variety and  is a simple normal crossing divisor on x produces a generalization of kollr type cohomology
injectivity theorem the reader can find a thorough treatment of our
geometric approach in f12 chapter 2 we have already obtained
many applications for the log minimal model program in f10 f12
f6 f7 f8 fst f9 f11 and f13
by our experience we know that kollr type injectivity theorems
play crucial roles for the study of base point free theorems and the
abundance conjecture for log canonical pairs cf fk f14 and so
we summarize the contents of this paper in section 2 we fix notation and collect basic results section 3 is the proof of the main
theorem theorem 12 we will represent the cohomology groups by
osamu fujino
the spaces of harmonic forms on a zariski open set with a suitable
complete khler metric we will use l2 estimates for equations
complete khler manifolds see lemma 32 it is a key point of our
proof in section 4 we treat kollr type injectivity theorem esnault
viehweg type injectivity theorem and kawamataviehwegnadel type
vanishing theorem as applications of theorem 12 we recommend the
reader to compare them with usual algebraic geometric ones we note
that we discuss them in a more general relative setting in f1

2 preliminaries
in this section we collect basic definitions and results in algebraic
and analytic geometries for details see for example d4
21 singular hermitian metric let l be a holomorphic line bundle
on a complex manifold x
definition 22 singular hermitian metric a singular hermitian metric on l is a metric which is given in every trivialization   l  c
kk  ex  x     lx 
where   l1loc  is an arbitrary function called the weight of the
metric with respect to the trivialization  here l1loc  is the space
of the locally integrable functions on 
the following singular hermitian metrics play important roles in the
study of higher dimensional algebraic varieties
example 23 let d  j dj be a divisor with coefficients j  n
then ox d is equipped with a natural singular hermitian metric as
follows let f be a local section of ox d viewed as a meromorphic
function such that divf   d  0 we define kf k2  f 2  0  if
gj is a generator of the ideal of dj on an p
open set   x then the
weight corresponding to this metric is   j j log gj  it is obvious
kollrs injectivity theorem
that this metric is a smooth hermitian metric on x d and its curvature
is zero on x  d let l be a holomorphic line bundle on x assume
that lk  m  ox d for some holomorphic line bundle m and an
effective divisor d on x as above ox d is equipped with a natural
singular hermitian metric hd  let hm be any smooth hermitian metric
hdk  note that
on m then l has a singular hermitian metric hl  hm
hl is smooth outside d and hl l  k1 hm m on x  d
24 multiplier ideal sheaf the notion of multiplier ideal sheaves
introduced by nadel nd is very important in recent developments of
complex and algebraic geometries cf l part three
definition 25 quasiplurisubharmonic function and multiplier ideal
sheaf a function u      defined on an open set   cn
is called plurisubharmonic psh for short if
1 u is upper semicontinuous and
2 for every complex line l  cn  ul is subharmonic on   l
that is for every a   and   cn satisfying   da c 
the function u satisfies the mean inequality
z 2
ua 
ua  ei d
2 0
let x be an ndimensional complex manifold a function   x 
  is said to be
s plurisubharmonic psh for short if there exists
an open cover x  ii ui such that ui is plurisubharmonic on ui
 cn  for every i a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic
function  on
  is a positive definite
x is a smooth function on x such that 1 
smooth 1 1form a quasiplurisubharmonic quasipsh for short
function is a function  which is locally equal to the sum of a psh
function and of a smooth function if  is a quasipsh function on a
complex manifold x the multiplier ideal sheaf j   ox is defined
u j   f  ox u f 2e2  l1loc u
for every open set u  x then it is known that j  is a coherent
ideal sheaf of ox  see for example d4 57 proposition
remark 26 by the assumption ii in theorem 12 the weight of
the singular hermitian metric hf is a quasipsh function on every trivialization so we can define multiplier ideal sheaves locally and check
that they are independent of trivializations thus we can define the
multiplier ideal sheaf globally and denote it by j hf  which is an
abuse of notation it is a coherent ideal sheaf on x
osamu fujino
example 27 let x   z  c  z  r for some 0  r  1 and
let l be a trivial line
p bundle on x we consider a singular hermitian
metric hl  exp  log z2  of l thenp
hl is smooth outside the
origin 0  x the weight of hl is    2  log z2 and  is a psh
function on x the lelong number of  at 0 is
lim inf
log z
thus we have j hl   ox by skoda note that  is smooth outside
0 which is an analytic subvariety of x however  does not have
analytic singularities around 0
definition 28 let x be a complex manifold and let d  j dj be
an effective qdivisor on x let gj be a generator of the ideal
p of dj on
an open set   x we put j d  j  where   j j log gj 
since j  is independent of the choice of the generators gj s j d is
a welldefined coherent ideal sheaf on x we call j d the multiplier
ideal sheaf associated to the effective qdivisor d we say
the
q that
divisor d is integrable at a point x0  x if the function gj 
integrable on a neighborhood of x0  equivalently j dx0  oxx0  let
d  be another effective qdivisor on x then j d  j d  d 
for 0    1   q
remark 29 in definition 28 d is integrable at x0 if and only if the
pair x d is kawamata log terminal klt for short in a neighborhood
of x0 cf km definition 234
example 210 let hl be the singular hermitian metric defined in
example 23 then the weight of the singular hermitian metric hl is
a quasipsh function on every trivialization therefore the multiplier
ideal sheaf j hl  is welldefined and j hl   j  k1 d
211 hermitian and khler geometries we collect the basic notion
and results of hermitian and khler geometries see also d4
definition 212 chern connection and its curvature form let x
be a complex hermitian manifold and let e h be a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle on x then there exists the chern connection
d  deh  which can be split in a unique way as a sum of a 1 0
and of a 0 1connection d  deh
 deh
 by the definition of
the chern connection d  deh   we obtain the curvature form
e  eh  h  deh
 the subscripts might be suppressed if
there is no danger of confusion
kollrs injectivity theorem
let u be a small open set of x and let e  be a local holomorphic
frame of eu  then the hermitian metric h is given by the hermitian
matrix h  h  h  he  e  on u we have hu v  t uh v
p u for smooth sections
p u v of eu pthis implies that hu v 
u h v for u 
ei ui and v 
ej vj  then we obtain that
1h e  1h
h and t  1t h eh  1t h eh
on u
definition 213 inner product let x be an ndimensional complex
manifold with the hermitian metric g we denote by  the fundamental
form of g let e h be a hermitian vector bundle on x and u v are
evalued p qforms with measurable coefficients we set
kuk 
u dv  hhu vii 
hu vidv 
where u is the pointwise norm induced by g and h on pq tx  e and
dv  n1  n  more explicitly hu vidv  t uhv where  is the hodge
star operator relative to  and h is the local matrix representation
of h when we need to emphasize the metrics we write ugh and so
let lpq
2 x e l2 x e h be the space of square integrable
evalued p qforms on x the inner product was defined in definition 213 when we emphasize the metrics we write lpq
2 x egh 
where g resp h is the hermitian metric of x resp e as usual
one can view d  and d  as closed and densely defined operators on
the hilbert space lpq
also have
2 x e the formal adjoints d  d
closed extensions in the sense of distributions which do not necessarily
coincide with the hilbert space adjoints in the sense of von neumann
since the latter ones may have strictly smaller domains it is well
known however that the domains coincide if the hermitian metric of
x is complete see lemma 217 below
definition 214 nakano positivity and semipositivity let e h be
a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold x with a smooth
hermitian metric h let  be a home evalued 1 1form such that
t t
 h  t h then  is said to be nakano positive resp nakano semipositive if the hermitian form on tx  e associated to t h is positive
definite resp semidefinite we write  nak 0 resp nak 0 we
note that 1 nak 2 resp 1 nak 2  means that 1  2 nak 0
resp nak 0 a holomorphic vector bundle
 e h is said to be nakano
positive resp nakano semipositive if 1e nak 0 resp nak
0 we usually omit nakanowhen e is a line bundle
osamu fujino
definition 215 graded lie bracket let c  x pq tx  e be the
space of the smooth evalued p qforms on x if a b are the endomorphisms of pure degree of the graded module m   c  x  tx 
e their graded lie bracket is defined by
a b  ab  1deg a deg b ba
let us recall nakanos identity which is one of the main ingredients
of the proof of our main theorem theorem 12
proposition 216 nakanos identity we further assume that g is
khler let
  d  d   d  d 
and
  d  d   d  d 
be the complex laplace operators acting on evalued forms then
     1e 
where  is the adjoint of    
the following lemma is now classical see for example d1 lemme
lemma 217 density lemma if g is complete then c0pq x e is
dense in domd   dom  with respect to the graph norm
   kd  uk
u 7 kuk  kuk
where c0pq x e is the space of the evalued smooth p qforms on
  is the domain of
x with compact supports and domd  resp dom
d resp 
combining proposition 216 with lemma 217 we obtain the following formula
proposition 218 let u be a square integrable evalued n qform on
x with dim x  n and let g be a complete khler
metric on x let 
be the fundamental form of g assume that 1e nak cide  
for some constant c then we obtain that

for every u  domd   dom
the final remark in this section will play crucial roles in the proof
of the main theorem theorem 12 the proof is an easy calculation
cf d1 lemme 33
kollrs injectivity theorem
remark 219 let g  be another hermitian metric on x such that
g   g and   be the fundamental form of g  let u be an evalued
n qform with measurable coefficients then we have u2gh dv 
u2ghdv  where ug h resp ugh is the pointwise norm induced by g 
and h resp g and h if u is an evalued n 0form then u2gh dv 
u2ghdv  in particular kuk2 is independent of g when u is an n 0form
3 proof of the main theorem
in this section we prove the main theorem theorem 12 the idea
is very simple we represent the cohomology groups by the space of
harmonic forms on x  z not on x the manifold x  z is not
compact however it is a complete khler manifold and all hermitian
metrics are smooth on x z so there are no difficulties on x z note
that we do not need the difficult regularization technique for quasipsh
functions on khler manifolds cf d1 thorme 91
proof of theorem 12 since x is compact there exists a complete
khler metric g  on y  x  z such that g   g on y  we sketch the
construction of g  because we need some special properties of g  in the
following proof the next lemma is well known see for example d2
lemma 5
lemma 31 there exists a quasipsh function  on x such that  
 on z with logarithmic poles along z and  is smooth outside z
without loss of generality we can assume that   e on x we
put   log
 then  is a quasipsh function on x and   1
     0
thus we can take a positive constant  such that 1 
on y  letg  be the khler metric on y whose fundamental form is
    we will show that

proof of claim first let x  ii ui be a finite stein cover of x such
that each ui is small we can assume that there is a small stein open
set vi of x such that ui  vi for every i see the proof of lemma 32
we denote this cover by u  ui ii  by cartan and leray we obtain
h q x kx  e  f  j hf    q u kx  e  f  j hf 
where the right hand side is the ech cohomology group calculated
by u let i ii be a partition of unity associated to u we put
ui0 i1 iq  ui0      uiq  then ui0 i1 iq is stein let u  ui0 i1 iq  such

there are various formulations for l2 estimates for equations
which
originated from hrmanders paper h the following one is suitable
for our purpose we used it in the proof of claim 1

then kwk is finite if and only if kwk0 is finite by the wellknown l2

   u and kvk2  c0 kuk2  where c0 is a positive constant
such that v

the proof of the claim
by the above claims the theorem is obvious because
s  hnq e  f   hnq e  f  l
is injective for every q
we close this section with the proof of corollary 13
proof of corollary 13 we put hf  hdk as in example 23 where hd
is the natural
 singular hermitian metric on ox d then hf is smooth
on x d 1f   0 in the sense of currents and j hf   j  k1 d
therefore we can apply theorem 12
4 applications injectivity and vanishing theorems
in this section we treat only a few applications of theorem 12 we
recommend the reader to see the results in tk and the arguments in
nk chapter v 3 for other formulations and generalizations see
also f1 for various applications and generalizations in a more general
relative setting for applications in the log minimal model program
kollrs injectivity theorem
which can not be covered by the results in this paper see f9 f11
f12 and so on
the following formulation is due to kollr cf ko2 1013 theorem
he stated this result for the case where e is a trivial line bundle and
x  is klt that is j   ox 
proposition 41 kollr type injectivity theorem let f  x  y be
a proper surjective morphism from a compact khler manifold x to a
normal projective variety y  let l be a holomorphic line bundle on x
and let d be an effective divisor on x such that f d 6 y  assume
that l  f  m   where m is a nef and big qdivisor on y and 
is an effective qdivisor on x let e he  be a nakano semipositive
holomorphic vector bundle on x then
h q x kx  e  l  j   h q x kx  e  l  ox d  j 
is injective for every q  0 where j  is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the effective qdivisor 
proof by taking p  pic0 x suitably we have l  p q f  m  
we can assume that l q f  m   by replacing l resp e with
l  p resp e  p 1  by kodairas lemma see km proposition
261 we can further assume that m is ample cf definition 28 let
h  mm   y  pn be the embedding induced by the complete linear
system mm for a large integer m then oy mm  h opn 1 we
can take an effective divisor a on pn such that opn a  opn l for
some positive integer l and d   f  h ad is an effective divisor on x
we add d  to d and can assume that d  f  h a under these extra
assumptions we can easily construct hermitian metrics satisfying the
assumptions in theorem 12 see example 23 we finish the proof of
the proposition
remark 42 numerical equivalence in the above proposition we
note that l  f  m   means c1 l  c1 f  m   in h 2 x r
where c1 is the first chern class of qdivisors or line bundles
remark 43 proposition 41 is a generalization of ko2 1013 theorem which is stated for a compact khler manifold however the
proof of ko2 1013 theorem given in ko2 works only for projective
manifolds in ko2 10173 claim we need an ample divisor on x to
prove local vanishing theorems
the following proposition is a reformulation of ev 512 corollary
b from the analytic viewpoint it is essentially the same as proposition 41 in ev e is trivial and j  ox 
osamu fujino
proposition 44 esnaultviehweg type injectivity theorem let x
be a smooth projective variety and let d be an effective divisor on x
let e he  be a nakano semipositive holomorphic vector bundle and
let l be a holomorphic line bundle on x assume that lk d is nef
and abundant that is lk d  lk d for some positive
integer k let b be an effective divisor on x such that
h 0 x lk dl  ox b 6 0
for some l  0 then
h q x kx  e  l  j   h q x kx  e  l  j  ox b
is injective for every q where j  j  k1 d is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the effective qdivisor k1 d
proof let   z  x be a projective birational morphism from a
smooth projective variety z with the following properties i there
exists a proper surjective morphism between smooth projective varieties f  z  y with connected fibers and ii there is a nef and big
qdivisor m on y such that   lk d q f  m for the proof see
ka proposition 21 on the other hand ri  kzx  j  k1   d  0
for i  0 and  kz  j  k1   d  kx  j  k1 d by l theorem
9233 and example 964 we note that   e   he  is nakano semipositive on z so we can assume that x  z without loss of generality it is not difficult to see that f b 6 y by the assumption
that h 0 x lk dl  ox b 6 0 for some l  0 thus this
proposition follows from proposition 41
the referee pointed out that proposition 44 is sharper than ep
theorem 31
remark 45 in this remark we use the notation in ep theorem
31 let k be a positive integer such that k   we take general
members d1      dk of h 0 x a  a and put
d1      dk 
then ld is nef and abundant and ld b is qeffective for some
0    1 by the construction we have j d  j x a  cf l
proposition 9228 therefore by proposition 44 for e  ox  we
obtain that
h i x ox kx lj x a   h i x ox kx lbj x a 
is injective for every i
kollrs injectivity theorem
remark 46 vanishing theorem and torsionfreeness proposition
41 gives some generalizations of kollrs vanishing and torsionfree
theorems we do not pursue them here because we discuss them in a
more general relative setting in f1 we just mention that ko2 1015
corollary holds for kx  e  j  where we use the same notation
as in proposition 41 we note l example 959 when we restrict the
multiplier ideal sheaf j  to a general hypersurface related topics
are in ev 612 corollary and 617 corollary and ep section 3
by combining proposition 41 with serres vanishing theorem we
obtain the next corollary it may be better to be called nadel type
vanishing theorem
corollary 47 kawamataviehweg type vanishing theorem let x
be a smooth projective variety and let l be a holomorphic line bundle
on x assume that l  m   where m is a nef and big qdivisor
on x and  is an effective qdivisor on x let e he  be a nakano
semipositive holomorphic vector bundle on x then h q x kx  e 
l  j   0 for q  1 moreover if  is integrable outside finitely
many points then h q x kx  e  l  0 for q  1
proof we use proposition 41 under the assumption that y  x and
f  idx  we take an effective ample divisor d on x and apply proposition 41 then we obtain that
h q x kx  e  l  j   h q x kx  e  l  j   ox md
is injective for m  0 and q  0 by serres vanishing theorem we
have h q x kx  e  l  j   0 for q  1 when  is integrable
outside finitely many points ox j  is a skyscraper sheaf therefore h q x kx  e  l  ox j   0 for q  1 by combining
it with the above mentioned vanishing result we obtain the desired
result
the final result is a slight generalization of demaillys formulation
of kawamataviehweg type vanishing theorem
corollary 48 cf d3 main theorem let l be a holomorphic line
bundle on an ndimensional projective manifold x assume that some
positive power lk can be written lk  m  ox d where m is
a nef line bundle and d is an effective divisor such that k1 d is integrable on x  b let   m be the numerical dimension of
the nef line bundle m let e he  be a nakano semipositive holomorphic vector bundle on x then h q x kx  e  l  0 for
q  n  minmax l codimb
osamu fujino
sketch of the proof by the standard slicing arguments we can reduce
it to the case where minmax l codimb  dim x we note
that codimb   if and only if b   by kodairas lemma cf km
lemma 260 proposition 261 we can further reduce it to the case
when m is ample we note that if a is a general smooth very ample
cartier divisor on x then
0  kx  e  l  kx  e  l  ox a  ka  ea  la  0
is exact and j  k1 da  j  k1 da  in particular k1 da is integrable
on a  ba  for the details of these reduction arguments see the first
and second steps in the proof of the main theorem in d3 therefore
this corollary follows from the previous corollary corollary 47
