from dyadic  to 
wael abushammala and alberto torchinsky
abstract in this paper we show how to compute the  norm    0
using the dyadic grid this result is a consequence of the description of
the hardy spaces h p rn  in terms of dyadic and special atoms
recently several novel methods for computing the bmo norm of a function
f in two dimensions were discussed in 9 given its importance it is also of
interest to explore the possibility of computing the norm of a bmo function
or more generally a function in the lipschitz class   using the dyadic grid
in rn  it turns out that the bmo question is closely related to that of
approximating functions in the hardy space h 1 rn  by the haar system
the approximation in h 1 rn  by affine systems was proved in 2 but this
result does not apply to the haar system now if h a r denotes the closure
of the haar system in h 1 r
r it is not hard to see that the distance df h 
of f  h r to h is  0 f x dx  see 1 thus neither dyadic atoms
suffice to describe the hardy spaces nor the evaluation of the norm in bmo
can be reduced to a straightforward computation using the dyadic intervals
in this paper we address both of these issues first we give a characterization
of the hardy spaces h p rn  in terms of dyadic and special atoms and then
by a duality argument we show how to compute the norm in  rn    0
using the dyadic grid
we begin by introducing some notations let j denote a family of cubes
q in rn  and pd the collection of polynomials in rn of degree less than or
equal to d given   0 q  j  and a locally integrable function g let pq g
denote the unique polynomial in p such that g  pq g q has vanishing
moments up to order 
for a locally squareintegrable function g we consider the maximal function
mj gx given by
sup
xq qj
gy  pq gy dy

the lipschitz space j consists of those functions g such that mj
g is
in l  kgkj  kmj gk  when the family in question contains all cubes
in rn  we simply omit the subscript j  of course 0  bmo
two other families of dyadic nature are of interest to us intervals in r of
the form ink   k12n  k2n  where k and n are arbitrary integers positive
negative or 0 are said to be dyadic in rn  cubes which are the product of
dyadic intervals of the same length ie of the form qnk  ink1      inkn 
are called dyadic and the collection of all such cubes is denoted d
there is also the family d0  let ink
 k  12n  k  12n  where k and
n are arbitrary integers clearly ink is dyadic if k is odd but not if k is even
now the collection ink
 n k integers contains all dyadic intervals as well
as the shifts k  12  2n1  k 2n  2n1  of the dyadic intervals by their
half length in rn  put d0  qnk  qnk  ink
     ink
 qnk is
called a special cube note that d0 contains d properly
finally given ink
 let ink
 k  12n  k2n  and ink
 k2n  k  12n 
     ink
of the form ink
     ink
the 2n subcubes of qnk  ink
sj  l or r 1  j  n  are called the dyadic subcubes of qnk 
let q0 denote the special cube 1 1n  given   0 we construct a
family s of piecewise polynomial splines in l2 q0  that will be useful in
characterizing   let a be the subspace of l2 q0  consisting of all functions
with vanishing moments up to order  which coincide with a polynomial
in p on each of the 2n dyadic subcubes of q0  a is a finite dimensional
subspace of l2 q0  and therefore by the grahamschmidt orthogonalization
process say a has an orthonormal basis in l2 q0  consisting of functions
p1      pm with vanishing moments up to order  which coincide with a
polynomial in p on each dyadic subinterval of q0  together with each pl
we also consider all dyadic dilations and integer translations given by
nn  l n
p 2 x1  k1      2n xn  kn  
nk x  2

and let
s  pl
nk  n k integers 1  l  m  
our first result shows how the dyadic grid can be used to compute the
norm in  
theorem a let g be a locally squareintegrable function and   0 then
g   if and only if g  d and a g  supps hg pi   moreover
kgk  kgkd  a g 
furthermore it is also true and the proof is given in proposition 21 below that kgk  kgkd0  however in this simpler formulation the tree
structure of the cubes in d has been lost
from dyadic  to 
the proof of theorem a relies on a close investigation of the predual of
  namely the hardy space h p rn  with 0  p    n n  1 in the
process we characterize h p in terms of simpler subspaces hd
 or dyadic h p 
and hs  the space generated by the special atoms in s  specifically we
have
theorem b let 0  p  1 and   n 1p  1 we then have
h p  hd
 hsp 
where the sum is understood in the sense of quasinormed banach spaces
the paper is organized as follows in section 1 we show that individual
h p atoms can be written as a superposition of dyadic and special atoms
this fact may be thought of as an extension of the onedimensional result of
fridli concerning l 1 atoms see 5 and 1 then we prove theorem b
in section 2 we discuss how to pass from d  and d0  to the lipschitz
space  
1 characterization of the hardy spaces h p
we adopt the atomic definition of the hardy spaces h p  0  p  1 see
6 and 10 recall that a compactly supported function a with n 1p  1
vanishing moments is an l2 p atom with defining cube q if suppa  q and
 ax 2 dx

the hardy space
distributions
f that can be
ph r   h consists of those
written as f 
j aj  where the aj s are h p atoms
j p   and the
convergence is in the sense of distributions as well as in h p  furthermore
kf kh p  inf
j p
where the infimum is taken over all possible atomic decompositions of f  this
last expression has traditionally been called the atomic h p norm of f 
collections of atoms with special properties can be used to gain a better
understanding of the hardy spaces formally let a be a nonempty subset
of l2 p atoms in the unit ball of h p  the atomic space ha
spanned by a
consists of those  in h p of the form
j aj  aj  a 
j p   
it is readily seen that endowed with the atomic norm

two families are of particular interest to us when a is the collection
of all l2 p atoms whose defining cube is dyadic the resulting space is hd
or dyadic h  now although kf kh p  kf khdp  the two quasinorms are not
equivalent on hd
 indeed for p  1 and n  1 the functions
fn x  2n 12n 1 x  112n  x 
satisfy kfn kh 1  1 but kfn khd1  n tends to infinity with n
next when s is the family of piecewise polynomial splines constructed
above with   n 1p  1 in analogy with the onedimensional results in
4 and 1 hsp is referred to as the space generated by special atoms
we are now ready to describe h p atoms as a superposition of dyadic and
special atoms
lemma 11 let a be an l2 p atom with defining cube q 0  p  1
and   n 1p  1 then a can be written as a linear combination of 2n
dyadic atoms ai  each supported in one of the dyadic subcubes of the smallest
special cube qnk containing q and a special atom b in s  more precisely

ax  i1 di ai x  l1 cl pl

proof suppose first that the defining cube of a is q0  and let q1      q2n
denote the dyadic subcubes of q0  furthermore let e1i      em
i  denote an
orthonormal basis of the subspace ai of l2 qi  consisting of polynomials in
p  1  i  2n  put
i x  axqi x 
haqi  eij i eij x

and observe that hi  eij i  0 for 1  j  m  therefore i has  vanishing
moments is supported in qi  and

from dyadic  to 
clearly b has  vanishing moments is supported in q0  coincides with a
polynomial in p on each dyadic subcube of q0  and

in the general case let q be the defining cube of a sidelength q  l and
let n and k  k1      kn  be chosen so that 2n1  l  2n  and
q  k1  12n  k1  12n       kn  12n  kn  12n  
then 12n  q2nn  1
now given x  q0  let a be the translation and dilation of a given by
a x  2nnp a2n x1  k1      2n xn  kn  
clearly  moments of a vanish and
ka k2  2nnp 2nn2 kak2  c q1p q12 kak2  c 
thus a is a multiple of an atom with defining cube q0  by the first part of
the proof

the support of each ai is contained in one of the dyadic subcubes of q0  and
consequently there is a k such that
ai x  2nnp ai 2n x1  k1      2n xn  kn 
ai is an l2 p atom supported in one of the dyadic subcubes of q similarly
for the pl s thus

theorem b follows
11 clearly hd
p readily from lemma
conversely let f  j j aj be in h p  by lemma 11 each aj can be written
as a sum of dyadic and special atoms and by distributing the sum we can
 fs in hsp  and
write f  fd  fs  with fd in hd

taking the infimum over the decompositions of f we get kf khdp hsp

the meaning of this decomposition is the following cubes in d are contained in one of the 2n nonoverlapping quadrants of rn  to allow for the
information carried by a dyadic cube to be transmitted to an adjacent dyadic
cube they must be connected the pl
nk s channel information across adjacent dyadic cubes which would otherwise remain disconnected the reader
will have no difficulty in proving the quantitative version of this observation
let t be a linear mapping defined on h p  0  p  1 that assumes values in
a quasinormed banach space x then t is continuous if and only if the
restrictions of t to hd
and hsp are continuous
2 characterizations of 
theorem a describes how to pass from d to   and we prove it next
  d  from theorem b it follows readily that
since h p    and hd
  d  hs   so it only remains to show that hsp  is characterized
by the condition a g  
first note
p that if g is a locally squareintegrable function with a g  
and f  jl cjl pl
nj kj   since 0  p  1
hg f i 
cjl  hg pl
nj kj  i
 a g
cjl p
and consequently taking the infimum over all atomic decompositions of f in
hsp  we get g  hsp  and kgkhsp   a g
to prove the converse we proceed as in 3 let qn  2n  2n n  we begin
by observing that functions f in l2 qn  that have vanishing moments up to
order  and coincide with polynomials of degree  on the dyadic subcubes
of qn belong to hsp and
kf khsp  qn 1p12 kf k2 
hsp  
given l 
for a fixed n let us consider the restriction of l to the space
of l2 functions f with  vanishing moments that are supported in qn  since
lf   klk kf khsp  klk qn1p12 kf k2 
this restriction is continuous with respect to the norm in l2 and consequently
it can be extended to a continuous linear functional in l2 and represented as
f x gn x dx 
lf  
from dyadic  to 
where gn  l2 qn  and satisfies kgn k2  klk qn1p12  clearly gn is
uniquely determined in qn up to a polynomial pn in p  therefore
gn x  pn x  gm x  pm x 
ae x  qminnm 
consequently if
gx  gn x  pn x 
x  qn 
gx is well defined ae and if f  l has  vanishing moments and is
supported in qn  we have
lf  
f x gn x dx
f x gn x  pn x dx
f x gx dx 
moreover since each 2
follows that
nnp l
p 2n  k is an l2 patom 1  l  m  it readily
a g

sup hg 2np pl 2n  ki
1lm nkz
 klk sup kpl kh p  klk 
and consequently a g  klk  and hsp  is the desired space 
the reader will have no difficulty in showing that this result implies the
following let t be a bounded linear operator from a quasinormed space x
into d  then t is bounded from x into  if and only if a t x 
c kxkx for every x  x
the process of averaging the translates of dyadic bmo functions leads to
bmo and is an important tool in obtaining results in bmo once they are
known to be true in its dyadic counterpart bmod  see 7 it is also known
that bmo can be obtained as the intersection of bmod and one of its shifted
counterparts see 8 these results motivate our next proposition which
essentially says that g   if and only if g  d and g is in the lipschitz
class obtained from the shifted dyadic grid note that the shifts involved in
this class are in all directions parallel to the coordinate axis and depend on
the sidelength of the cube
proposition 21   d0  and kgk  kgkd0 
proof it is obvious that kgkd0  kgk  to show the other inequality we
invoke theorem a since d  d0  it suffices to estimate a g or equivalently hg pi for p  s    n 1p  1 so pick p  pl
nk in s  the
defining cube q of pl
and
since

vanishing
moments
