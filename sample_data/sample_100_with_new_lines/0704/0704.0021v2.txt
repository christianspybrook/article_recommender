spatiotemporal pattern formation in a productactivated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual
enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can
develop the analysis based on the meanfield approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered system

molecular machines such as molecular motors ion
pumps and some enzymes play a fundamental role in
biological cells and can be also used in the emerging softmatter nanotechnology 1 a protein machine is a cyclic
device where each cycle consists of conformational motions initiated by binding of an energybringing ligand
2 3 in motors such internal motions generate mechanical work 4 while in enzymes they enable or facilitate chemical reaction events see eg 5 6 much
attention has been attracted to studies of biomembranes
with ion pumps and molecular motors where membrane
instabilities and synchronization effects have been analyzed 7 8 9 here a different class of distributed active molecular systems  formed by enzymes  is considered the catalytic activity of an allosteric enzyme
protein is activated or inhibited by binding of small regulatory molecules the role of such regulatory molecules
can be played by products of the same reaction 10 previous investigations of simple productregulated enzymic
systems 11 12 and enzymic networks 13 in small spatial volume with full diffusional mixing have shown that
spontaneous synchronization of molecular turnover cycles
can take place there external molecular synchronization of enzymes of the photosensitive p450 dependent
monooxygenase system by periodic optical forcing has
been experimentally demonstrated 14
in this letter spatiotemporal pattern formation in enzymic arrays is investigated in such systems immobile
enzymes are attached to a solid planar support immersed
into a solution through which fresh substrate is supplied
and product molecules are continuously removed product molecules released by an enzyme diffuse through the
solution and activate catalytic turnover cycles of neighbouring enzymes in the array
a simple stochastic model 12 of an enzyme as a cyclic
machine a stochastic phase oscillator shown in fig 1
is used binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme i
initiates an ordered internal conformational motion described by the conformational phase coordinate i  the
initial state corresponds to the phase i  0 the catalytic conversion event takes place and the product is
released at the state p inside the cycle after that the

fig 1 color online a sketch of the model
conformational motion continues until the equilibrium
state of the enzyme i  1 is finally reached initiation of a turnover cycle is a random event occurring
at a certain probability rate we assume that substrate
is present in abundance and its concentration is not affected by the reactions conformational motion inside
the cycle is modeled as a stochastic
diffusional drift pro
cess described by equation i  v  i t where v is the
mean drift velocity and i t is an internal white noise
with hi tj t i  2ij t  t  where  specifies intensity of intramolecular fluctuations
allosterically activated enzymes possess a site on their
surface where regulatory molecules can become bound
binding of a regulatory molecule leads to conformational
change that enhances catalytic activity of the enzyme a
regulatory molecule binds to an enzyme with rate constant  and dissociate from it with rate constant  binding of a regulatory molecule at an enzyme raises its probability to start a cycle from 0 to 1  we assume that
a regulatory molecule can bind to an enzyme only in its
rest state and this molecule is released when the cycle
is started the role of regulatory molecules is played
by product molecules of the same reaction immobile
enzymes are randomly distributed in space with concentration c product diffuses at diffusion constant d and
undergoes decay at rate constant  the characteristic
diffusion length of product molecules is ldif f  d
in our stochastic 2d simulations the medium was discretized into spatial cells up to 256  256 each con

taining a number of enzyme molecules the cells were
so small that diffusional mixing of product molecules in
a cell within the shortest characteristic time of the reaction could always take place each enzyme was described
by the stochastic model given above diffusion of product
molecules was modeled as a random walk over a discrete
cell lattice the mean cycle time   1v was chosen as
the time unit   1 systems including up to 655 360
enzymes were used in the simulations
figure 2ab see also videos 1 and 2 in ref 15 shows
two typical examples of stochastic 2d simulations here
spatial distributions of product molecules are displayed
waves of product concentration are propagating through
the medium in a peak of a wave many locally present
enzymes are simultaneously releasing product molecules
since product release can take place only at a certain
stage inside the cycle this means that the cycles of enzymes are locally synchronized not only regular wave
structures such as rotating spiral waves or target patterns fig 2a but also complex regimes of wave turbulence fig 2b have been observed
to understand and interpret stochastic simulation results an analytical study of the system in the meanfield
approximation which holds in the limit of high enzyme
concentrations has been performed in this approximation the system is characterised by three continuous variables n0 r t n1 r t and mr t which represent local
concentrations of enzymes in the rest state without or
with regulatory molecules attached n0 and n1  and local
concentration of the product m for simplicity internal
fluctuations in enzymes are neglected   0 thus all
enzymes which have started their cycles at some time t
would release their products at a definite time tp with
p  p v and finish their cycles returning to the rest
state at time t    therefore the system is described
by a set of three reactiondiffusion equations with time
 mn0  n1  1 n1
 mn0  n1  0 n0  0 n0 t   
1 n1 t   
 mn0  n1  1 n1  m  0 n0 t  p 
1 n1 t  p   d2 m
the system always has a uniform stationary state
with certain concentrations n0  n1 and m which can be
found as solutions of the respective algebraic equations
this state corresponds to the absence of synchronization
however it may become unstable if allosteric activation
is strong enough to analyze stability small perturbations n0  n1 and m are added to the stationary state
equations 1 are linearized and their solutions are sought
as n0  n1  m  exp q t  iqx with q  q  iq 
thus each spatial mode with wavevector q is characterized by its frequency q and its rate of growth q  the
properties q and q are given by the roots of a characteristic equation which is determined by the linearization
matrix of equations 1 the steady state becomes unstable when at least one spatial mode with some wavenumber q0 starts to grow q0  0
as the bifurcation parameter coefficient  can be chosen if regulatory molecules cannot bind to enzymes
  0 feedback is absent and instabilities are not possible on the other hand allosteric activation becomes
strong if regulatory molecules can easily bind and in this
case emergence of oscillations and wave patterns can be
expected our bifurcation analysis reveals that depending on the parameters of the system it can exhibit either a hopf or a wave bifurcation 16 as a result of
the hopf bifurcation uniform oscillations with q  0 develop because of the presence of delays in equations 1
the characteristic equation is nonpolynomial in terms of
 and generally a number of oscillatory solutions with
different frequencies  are possible physically such solutions correspond to formation of several synchronous
enzymic groups this effect has been previously extensively investigated for similar systems in small spatial
volumes with full diffusional mixing 11 and we shall
not further discuss it here the most robust uniform
oscillations which we consider are characterized by the
frequency   2 and correspond to the singlegroup
synchronization as the result of a wave bifurcation also
known as the hopf bifurcation with a finite wave number
17 the first unstable modes are traveling waves with
a certain wavenumber q0  figure 3 shows the bifurcation diagram in the parameter plane p   note the
presence of a codimension2 bifurcation point where the
boundaries of the hopf and the wave bifurcations join
to investigate nonlinear dynamics of the system numerical simulations of equations 1 have been performed

hopf bifurcation near the codimension2 point more
complex behavior was found this included rippled oscillations fig 4b selforganized pacemakers fig 4c
and modulated traveling waves fig 4d the observed
patterns are similar to those previously found in reactiondiffusion systems with the wave bifurcation 18 in the
right upper corner of the diagram in fig 3 higher frequency oscillations with several synchronous groups take
place
twodimensional simulations of reactiondiffusion
equations 1 with time delay have been performed for
selected parameter values in 2d simulations spontaneously developing concentric waves target patterns
and spiral waves have been observed target patterns
were however unstable and evolved into pairs of rotating spiral waves fig 2c and video 3 15 complex
wave regimes which can be qualitatively characterized
as turbulence of standing waves have also been observed
fig 2d and video 4 15
the meanfield approximation is based on neglecting statistical fluctuations in concentrations of reacting
species 11 and therefore it should hold in the high
concentration limit in fig 4 two upper panel rows
display spatiotemporal patterns which are observed in
stochastic simulations with parameter values corresponding to the respective meanfield simulations to compare
meanfield simulations with different enzyme densities
the following property of equations 1 can be used introducing relative concentrations n
e0  n0 c n
e 1  n1 c
and m
e  mc it can be noticed that they obey the same
equations but with a rescaled coefficient e  c thus
essentially the same patterns are observed as long as
the parameter combination c remains constant in the
stochastic simulations in fig 4 the coefficient  has been
increased to compensate for a decrease in the enzyme
concentration for larger enzyme concentrations good
agreement between meanfield predictions and stochastic simulations has been found in the meanfield equations 1 intramolecular fluctuations are not taken into
account   0 and therefore each turnover cycle has
the same fixed duration   stochastic simulations have
been however also performed when such fluctuations
were present synchronization waves could still be found
even at internal noise levels which corresponded to the
mean relative dispersion  of turnover times of about 10
with    2

although the emphasis in this letter is on the phenomena in twodimensional enzymic arrays analogous effects
should be expected for threedimensional systems representing aqueous enzymic solutions the linear stability
analysis yielding hopf and wave bifurcation boundaries
see fig 3 is valid also for the 3d geometry we have
performed preliminary stochastic simulations for thin solution layers with high enzyme concentrations and could
observe synchronization patterns similar to those found
for the enzymic arrays
a product molecule released by an enzyme diffuses
in the solution until it either binds as a regulatory
molecule to another enzyme or undergoes a decay here
it should be taken into account that a regulatory molecule
can bind to an allosteric enzyme only at a certain binding site of characteristic radius r using the theory of
diffusioncontrolled reactions the average time ttransit
after which a regulatory product would find a binding
site of one of the enzymes can be roughly estimated
11 as ttransit  1cdr if enzymes are uniformly distributed inside the reaction volume with concentration
c therefore binding typically occurs within the dis12
tance lcorr  dttransit 
 cr
from the point
where a molecule is released obviously it can only
take place if the product molecule has not undergone
decay until that moment ie if ttransit  1 this
condition puts a restriction on the enzyme concentration
c which must be higher than the critical concentration
c  dr choosing   103 s1  d  105 cm2 s1
and r  107 cm the critical enzyme concentration is
c  1015 cm3  106 m a similar estimate can be
obtained when enzymes are immobilized on a plane immersed into a reactive solution in this case the mean distance between the enzymes on the plane should be less
than lc  rldif f 
22 although the required enzyme concentrations are relatively large they are within
the range characteristic for biological cells glycolytic enzymes are present 19 in a cell at even higher concentration of more than 105 m the characteristic temporal
period of developing patterns is determined by the enzyme turnover time   which typically varies from milliseconds to seconds the characteristic length scale of
developing wave patterns is determined by the diffusion
length ldif f  which can vary under these conditions from
a fraction of a micrometer to tens of micrometers
our analysis shows that spontaneous molecular synchronization of allosteric productactivated enzymes can
be observed in enzymic arrays artificial arrays formed
by immobilized protein machines molecular motors are
already used in experiments on active nanoscale transport see 20 many enzymes in biological cells are
membranebound thus forming natural enzymic arrays
similar phenomena are possible in dense enzyme solutions in the study by petty et al 21 traveling waves
of nadph and proton concentrations with the wavelength of about a micrometer were observed inside neutrophil cells these metabolic waves had the temporal
period of about 300 ms which is by two orders of magnitude shorter than the characteristic period of glycolytic
oscillations in the cells and lies closer to the time scales
of turnover cycles of individual enzymes an intriguing
question requiring further detailed analysis is whether
molecular synchronization waves may have already been
seen in these experiments
molecular synchronization waves are principally different from classical concentration waves in reactiondiffusion systems under synchronization conditions
internal conformational states of individual enzyme
molecules in their turnover cycles become strongly correlated in optics a similar situation is found when a
transition to coherent laser generation has taken place
our theoretical analysis may open a way to the investigations of a new class of spatiotemporal pattern formation
in chemically active molecular systems
