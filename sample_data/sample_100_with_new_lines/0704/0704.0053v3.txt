introduction
in finsler geometry all geometric objects depend not only on positional coordinates as in riemannian geometry but also on directional arguments in riemannian
geometry there is a canonical linear connection on the manifold m while in finsler
geometry there is a corresponding canonical linear connection due to e cartan
which is not a connection on m but is a connection on  1 t m the pullback of
the tangent bundle t m by   t m  m the pullback approach moreover in
riemannian geometry there is one curvature tensor and one torsion tensor associated
with a given linear connection on the manifold m whereas in finsler geometry there
are three curvature tensors and five torsion tensors associated with a given linear
connection on  1 t m
most of the special spaces in finsler geometry are derived from the fact that
the tensor fields torsions and curvatures associated with the cartan connection
satisfy special forms consequently special spaces of finsler geometry are more
numerous than those of riemannian geometry special finsler spaces are investigated
locally using local coordinates by many authors m matsumoto 16 18 15 14
and others 6 19 8 7 on the other hand the global or intrinsic free from
local coordinates investigation of such spaces is very rare in the literature some
considerable contributions in this direction are due to a tamim 24 25
in the present paper we provide a global presentation of the theory of special
finsler manifolds we introduce and investigate globally many of the most important
and most commonly used special finsler manifolds  locally minkowskian berwald

hisotropic of scalar curvature of constant curvature of pscalar curvature of spscurvature
the paper consists of two parts preceded by a preliminary section 1 which
provides a brief account of the basic concepts of the pullback approach to finsler
geometry necessary to this work for more detail the reader is referred to 1 3 5
and 24
in the first part 2 we introduce the global definitions of the aforementioned
special finsler manifolds in such a way that when localized they yield the usual
local definitions current in the literature see the appendix the definitions are
arranged according to the type of the defining property of the special finsler manifold
concerned
in the second part 3 various relationships between the different types of the
considered special finsler manifolds are found many local results known in the
literature are proved globally and several new results are obtained as a byproduct
of some of the obtained results interesting identities and properties concerning the
torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced which in turn play
a key role in obtaining other results
among the obtained results are a characterization of riemannian manifolds a
characterization of s v recurrent manifolds a characterization of p symmetric
manifolds a characterization of berwald manifolds in certain cases the equivalence
of landsberg and general landsberg manifolds under certain conditions a classifica2
tion of hisotropic c h recurrent manifolds and a presentation of different conditions
under which an r3 like finsler manifold becomes a finsler manifold of sps curvature
the above results are just a nonexhaustive sample of the global results obtained in
this paper
it should finally be noted that some important results of 8 9 11 13 19
20etc obtained in local coordinates are immediately derived from the obtained
global results when localized
although our investigation is entirely global we conclude the paper with an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions
of the special finsler spaces considered this is done to facilitate comparison and to
make the paper more selfcontained
1 notation and preliminaries
in this section we give a brief account of the basic concepts of the pullback
formalism of finsler geometry necessary for this work for more details refer to 1 3
5 and 24 we make the general assumption that all geometric objects we consider
are of class c   the following notations will be used throughout this paper
m a real differentiable manifold of finite dimension n and of class c  
fm the ralgebra of differentiable functions on m
xm the fmmodule of vector fields on m

p   1 t m  t m  the pullback of the tangent bundle t m by 
p    1 t  m  t m  the pullback of the cotangent bundle t  m by 
xm the ft mmodule of differentiable sections of  1 t m
elements of xm will be called vector fields and will be denoted by barred
letters x tensor fields on  1 t m will be called tensor fields the fundamental
vector field is the vector field  defined by u  u u for all u  t m the
lift to  1 t m of a vector field x on m is the vector field x defined by xu 
u xu the lift to  1 t m of a 1form  on m is the form  defined by
u  u u
the tangent bundle t t m is related to the pullback bundle  1 t m by the
short exact sequence
0   1 t m  t t m   1 t m  0
where the bundle morphisms  and  are defined respectively by   t m  d and
u v  ju v where ju is the natural isomorphism ju  tm v m  tu tm v m
let  be a linear connection or simply a connection in the pullback bundle
 1 t m we associate to  the map
k  t t m   1 t m  x 7 x 
called the connection or the deflection map of  a tangent vector x  tu t m
is said to be horizontal if kx  0  the vector space hu t m  x  tu t m 
kx  0 of the horizontal vectors at u  t m is called the horizontal space to m
at u  the connection  is said to be regular if
tu t m  vu t m  hu t m
u  t m
if m is endowed with a regular connection then the vector bundle maps
   1 t m  v t m
ht m   ht m   1 t m
kv t m   v t m   1 t m
are vector bundle isomorphisms let us denote   ht m  1  then
idht m  on htm
o  id1 t m  
on vtm
for a regular connection  we define two covariant derivatives  and  as follows
for every vector 1form a we have
 ax y   x ay  
 ax y   x ay 
the classical torsion tensor t of the connection  is defined by
tx y   x y  y x  x y   x y  xt m
the horizontal hh and mixed hhv torsion tensors denoted respectively by q
and t  are defined by
qx y   txy  t x y   tx y   x y  xm
the classical curvature tensor k of the connection  is defined by

theorem 11 25 let m l be a finsler manifold there exists a unique regular
connection  in  1 t m such that
a  is metric  g  0
b the horizontal torsion of  vanishes  q  0
c the mixed torsion t of  satisfies gt x y  z  gt x z y 
such a connection is called the cartan connection associated to the finsler manifold m l
one can show that the torsion t of the cartan connection has the property that
t x   0 for all x  xm and associated to t we have
definition 12 25 let  be the cartan connection associated to m l the
torsion tensor field t of the connection  induces a tensor field of type 0 3
called the cartan tensor and denoted again t  defined by 
t x y  z  gt x y  z
for all x y  z  xt m
it also induces a form c called the contracted torsion defined by 
cx  t ry 7 t x y 
for all x  xt m
definition 13 25 with respect to the cartan connection  associated to m l
we have
 the horizontal and vertical ricci tensors rich and ricv are defined respectively by
rich x y   t rz 7 rx zy 
for all x y  xt m
ricv x y   t rz 7 sx zy 
for all x y  xt m
 the horizontal and vertical ricci maps rich0 and ricv0 are defined respectively by
grich0 x y   rich x y 
for all
x y  xt m
gricv0 x y   ricv x y 
for all
x y  xt m
 the horizontal and vertical scalar curvatures sch  scv are defined respectively by
sch  trrich0

where r and s are respectively the horizontal and vertical curvature tensors of 
proposition 14 12 let m l be a finsler manifold the vector field g determined by ig   de is a spray called the canonical spray associated to the energy
e where e  21 l2 and   ddj e
one can show in this case that g  o and g is thus horizontal with respect
to the cartan connection 
theorem 15 26 let m l be a finsler manifold there exists a unique regular
connection d in  1 t m such that
a d is torsion free
b the canonical spray g  o is horizontal with respect to d
c the vhvtorsion tensor pb of d vanishes
such a connection is called the berwald connection associated to the finsler
manifold m l

3 relationships between different types of special
finsler spaces
this section is devoted to global investigation of some mutual relationships
between the special finsler spaces introduced in the preceding section some consequences are also drawn from these relationships
we start with some immediate consequences from the definitions
a a locally minkowskian manifold is a berwald manifold
b a berwald manifold is a landsberg manifold
c a landsberg manifold is a general landsberg manifold
d a berwald manifold is c h recurrent resp p  finsler
e a p  manifold is a landsberg manifold
f a creducible resp c2 like manifold is semicreducible
g a semicreducible manifold is quasicreducible
h a finsler manifold of constant curvature is of scalar curvature
the following two lemmas are useful for subsequent use
lemma 31 25 for every x y  xm we have
a p  xy  0
b p x y  0
c p x y    t x y 
lemma 32 if  is the vector form defined by
x  x  l1 lx or   i  l1 l  
where l is the form given by lx  l1 gx  then we have
a x y   gx y 
d t r  n  1
b   0
e x   0
c  o   
f x   0
as we have seen a landsberg manifold is general landsberg the converse is
not true nevertheless we have
proposition 33 a creducible general landsberg manifold m l is a landsberg
manifold
proof since m l is a creducible manifold then by definition 24 lemma 32
the symmetry of  and the nondegeneracy of g we get
t x y  
x y c  cxy   cy x
where c is the vector field defined by gc x  cx taking the hcovariant
derivative z of both sides of the above equation we obtain
z t x y  
z x y c  x y z c  cxz y  
z cxy   cy z x  z cy x
from which by setting z   and taking into account the fact that z   0 and
that z   0  lemma 32 we get
x y  c cxy  cy x
 t x y  
now under the given assumption that the m l is a general landsberg manifold
then  c  0 definition 28 and hence  c  0 hence  t  0 and the
result follows 
also a berwald manifold is landsberg the converse is by no means true
although we have no counterexamples finding a landsberg manifold which is not
berwald is still an open problem nevertheless we have
proposition 34 25 a creducible landsberg manifold m l is a berwald
manifold
combining the above two propositions we obtain the more powerful result 
proposition 35 a creducible general landsberg manifold m l is a berwald
manifold
summing up we get
theorem 36 let m l be a creducible finsler manifold the following assertion
are equivalent 
a m l is a berwald manifold
b m l is a landsberg manifold
c m l is a general landsberg manifold
we retrieve here a result of matsumuoto 15 namely
corollary 37 if the hcurvature tensor r and hvcurvature tensor p of a creducible manifold vanish then the manifold is locally minkowskian
remark 38 15 it may be conjectured that a finsler manifold will be minkowskian
if the hcurvature tensor r and hvcurvature tensor p vanish as above seen the
conjecture is verified already under somewhat strong condition  creducibility
theorem 39 let m l be a finsler manifold then we have 
a a creducible manifold is p reducible
b a p reducible general landsberg manifold is landsberg
proof
a since m l is creducible then by definition 24 we have
t x y z 
sxyz x y cz
applying the hcovariant derivative w on both sides of the above equation taking
into account the fact that w t x y z  gw t x y  z and that
w   0 we obtain
sxyz x y w cz
from which by setting w   and noting that p x y    t x y 
the result follows
gw t x y  z 
b since m l is a p reducible manifold then by definition 211 taking into
account the fact that g is nondegenerate we obtain
p x y   xy   y x  x y  
where  is the vector field defined by g x  x
since   0 then t ry 7 y x  x y    2x taking
the trace of both sides of 32 using the fact that p x y    t x y 
lemma 31 and that t ry 7  t x y    cx we get
 cx
now from equations 32 and 33 we have
sxyz x y  cz
according to the given assumption that the manifold is general landsberg then
 c  0 therefore from 34 we get p x y   0 and hence the manifold
is landsberg 
gp x y  z 
proposition 310
a a c h recurrent manifold is a p  finsler manifold
b a general landsberg p  finsler manifold is a landsberg manifold
proof the proof is straightforward and we omit it
proposition 311 a c2 like finsler manifold is a berwald manifold if and only if
the tensor field c is horizontally parallel
cxcy cz
proof let m l be c2 like then t x y z  cc
from which t x y   cc cxcy c taking the hcovariant derivative of
both sides we get
z t x y  
z cc
cxcy c 
z cxcy c 
z cy cxc 
cxcy z c
in view of this relation z t  0 if and only if z c  0 hence the result 
corollary 312 a c2 like general landsberg manifold is a landsberg manifold
in view of the above theorems we have
corollary 313 the two notions of being landsberg and general landsberg coincide
in the case of creducibility p reducibility c2 likeness or p  finsler
as we know a creducible landsberg manifold is a berwald manifold proposition 34  moreover a c2 like finsler manifold is a berwald manifold if and only
if the tensor field c is horizontally parallel proposition 311 we shall try to
generalize these results to the case of semicreduciblity
theorem 314 a semicreducible finsler manifold is a berwald manifold if and
only if the characteristic scalar  and the tensor field c are horizontally parallel
proof firstly if m l is semicreducible then
t x y z 
sxyz x y cz 
cxcy cz
taking the hcovariant derivative of both sides noting that x   0 we get
w t x y z 
sxyz x y w cz  w cz 
 2 sxyz w cxcy cz 
w   w cc
cxcy cz
now if the characteristic scalar  and the tensor field c are horizontally parallel then w t  0 and m l is a berwald manifold
conversely if m l is a berwald manifold then x t  0 and hence x c 
0 x c  0 these together with the above equation give
sxyz x y cz  2 cxcy cz  0
which implies immediately that w   0 
the following lemmas are useful for subsequent use
lemma 315 for all x y  xm we have 
a x y   x y  y x
b x y   p y  x  y x  x y  t x y 
c x y   rx y   x y  y x
lemma 316 for all x y z w  xm and w  xt m we have 
a gw t x y  z  gw t x z y 
b gsx y z w   gsx y w z
proof
a from the definition of the covariant derivative we get
gw t x y  z  gw t x y  z  gt w x y  z 35
gt x w y  z
now we have
gw t x y  z  w  gt x y  z  gt x y  w z
 w  gt x y  z  gt x w z y 
similarly
gt x w y  z  w  gt x z y   gw t x z y 
substituting these two equations into 35 noting the property that gt w x y  z
 gt w x z y  cf 1 the result follows
b follows directly from the general formula which can be easily proved
gkx y z w   gkx y w z  0
by setting x  x and y  y  where k is the classical curvature tensor of the
cartan connection as a linear connection in the pullback bundle cf 1 
proposition 317 let m l be a c h recurrent finsler manifold x t  0 xt 
then we have
a if ko  o   0 then the hvcurvature tensor p is expressed in the form
p x y z w   o zt x y w   o w t x y z
and the vhvtorsion pb vanishes
b if ko 6 0 then the vhvtorsion tensor pb is recurrent
ko b
z pbx y   o z  z
p x y 
proof
a the hvcurvature tensor p can be written in the form 25
p x y z w   gz t x y  w   gw t x y  z
gt x z pbw y   gt x w  pbz y 
then by using pbx y    t x y  lemma 31 and the c h recurrence
condition we get
p x y z w   o zt x y w   o w t x y z
o gt x w  t y z  gt x z t y w 
 o zt x y w   o w t x y z  o sx y z w 
now if o   0 then a follows from the above relation
b if ko  o  6 0 then by lemma 31 and the recurrence condition we have
from which
pbx y   ko t x y 
z pbx y   z ko  ko o zt x y 
then b follows from the above two equations
theorem 318 assume that m l is c h recurrent then the vcurvature tensor s
is recurrent with respect to the hcovariant differentiation  x s  xs where
 is a form of order one
proof one can easily show that  for all x y z  xt m
sxyz kx y z  x ty z  tx y z  0
setting x  x y  y and z  z in the above equation we get
sx y z  y t x z  x t y z  z tx z 
tx y z  ty x z  tx y  z
using lemma 315 and the fact that tx z  0 the above equation reduces
sx y z  y t x z  x t y z
t x t y z  t y t x z
from which since gt x y  z  gt x z y  we have
gsx y z w   gy t x z w   gx t y z w 
gt x w  t y z  gt y w  t x z
similarly
gsx y w z  gy t x w  z  gx t y w  z
gt x z t y w   gt y z t x w 
the above two equations together with lemma 316 yield
gx t y z w   gy t x z w 
by 36 and 37 we obtain
sx y z w   gt x w  t y z  gt y w  t x z 38
now using the given assumption that the manifold is c h recurrent equation
38 implies that
x sy z v w   x sy z v w  
sx y z v w   sy x z v w  
sy z x v w   sy z v x w 
 x gt y w  t z v   x gt z w  t y v  
gt x y w  t z v   gt z w  t x y v  
gt y w  t x z v   gt x z w  t y v  
gt y w  t z x v   gt z w  t y x v  
gt y x w  t z v   gt z x w  t y v 
 gx t y w  t z v   gt y w  x t z v  
gx t z w  t y v   gt z w  x t y v 
 2o xsy z v w   xsy z v w 
hence the result follows
corollary 319 in the course of the proof of theorem 318 we have shown that
equations 37 and 38 
a x t y z  y t x z
b sx y z w   gt x w  t y z  gt y w  t x z
corollary 320 let m l be a c2 like finsler manifold then the the vcurvature
tensor s vanishes
proof substituting t x y  
get the result 
cxcy
c in corollary 319b we
corollary 321 let m l be a creducible manifold then
a the vcurvature tensor s has the form
sx y z w

c the vertical scalar curvature scv has the form

theorem 322 a finsler manifold m l is p symmetric if and only if the
vcurvature tensor s satisfies the equation  s  0
proof one can show that for all x y z  xt m
sxyz z kx y   kx y z  kx y  z  0
setting x  x y  y and z  z in the above equation we get
z sx y w  y p z xw  x p z y w 
sx y z w  p z y x w  p z xy w 
kx y  zw  ky z xw  kz x y w  0
by using lemma 315 the above relation reduces to
z sx y w   y p z x w   x p z y w

p t y z xw  p t x z y w  0
setting z   in the above equation taking into account lemma 31 and the fact
that t x   0 and that x p  y z  p x y z we get
p x y z  p y xz   sx y z
the result follows immediately from 311
311
according to 311 and lemma 31 we have 
corollary 323 let pbx y   p x y  and tbx y    t x y 
then the tensor fields pb and tb are symmetric
theorem 318 and theorem 322 give rise the following result
theorem 324 assume that a finsler manifold m l is c h recurrent and p symmetric if  6 0 then the vcurvature tensor s vanishes identically
now we shall prove the following lemma which provides some important and
useful properties of the torsion tensor t and the vcurvature s 
lemma 325 for every x y z and w  xm we have
a t x y   t y x
b t  x  0
c sxyz sx y z  0
d gsx y z w   gsz w x y 
e s xy  0  sx y 
f x s y z  sx y z x s x  0 
g sx y z   12 dx t y  z  dy t x z
consequently s vanishes if and only if dx t y  z  dy t x z
proof
a from corollary 319a we have
x t y z  y t x z
setting z   and using the fact that t x   0 and that k o   idxm  
the result follows
b follows from a together with the relation t x   0
c setting x  x y  y and z  z in 39 and using lemma 315 we
get
sxyz x sy z w   0
again setting w   in the above equation and using the fact that sx y  
0 and that k o   idxm   the result follows
d follows from corollary 319b noting that t is symmetric
e and f are clear
g from the relation dx y  x y  t x y  27 we get
dx t y z  x t y zt x t y zt t x y  zt y t x z
dy t x z  y t x zt y t x zt t y x zt x t y z
the result follows from the above two equations using corollary 319 and the symmetry of t  
as a direct consequence of the above lemma we have the
corollary 326 a p2 like finsler manifold is p symmetric
proposition 327 assume that m l is c v recurrent then the vcurvature tensor s is vrecurrent  x s  xs  being a 1form consequently s
vanishes identically
proof taking the vcovariant derivative of both sides of the relation in corollary
319b and then using the assumption that x t  0 xt  we get
x sy z v w   2o xsy z v w   xsy z v w 
which shows that s is vrecurrent
now setting v   in the last equation using the properties of s and noting
that k o   idxm   we conclude that s  0 
the following result gives a characterization of riemannian manifolds in terms
of c v recurrence and c 0 recurrence
theorem 328
a a c v recurrent finsler manifold is riemannian
b a c 0 recurrent finsler manifold is riemannian
proof a since m l is c v recurrent then x t y  z  o xt y  z from
which by setting x   and noting that  t  t  we get
t y  z  o t y  z
312
but since x t y z  y t x z corollary 319 then o xt y z 
o y t x z hence
o t y  z  0
313
then the result follows from 312 and 313
b can be proved similarly 
theorem 329 for a finsler manifold m l the following assertions are
equivalent 
a m l is s v recurrent
b the vcurvature tensor s vanishes identically
c m l is s v recurrent of the second order
proof
a  b  if m l is s v recurrent then by definition 27a we have
w sx y z  w sy xz
from which by setting z   taking into account the fact that sx y   0
and that ko  id1 t m   the result follows
b  a  trivial
b  c  trivial
c  b  if the given manifold m l is s v recurrent of the second order then
by definition 27b we get
2 2
x y sz v w   sy x z v w 
 y x sz v w   y x sz v w 
x sy z v w   x sz y v w 
x sz v y w 
by substituting z    w in the above equation and using lemma 325 and the
fact that sx y   0 we get
sx y z  sz y x and sx y z  sx zy
from this together with the identity sxyz sx y z  0 the vcurvature
tensor s vanishes identically 
in view of the above theorem we have 
corollary 330
a an s v recurrent resp a second order s v recurrent manifold m l is s3 like
provided that dim m  4
b an s v recurrent resp a second order s v recurrent manifold m l is s4 like
provided that dim m  5
theorem 331 if m l is a p2 like finsler manifold then the vcurvature tensor
s vanishes or the hvcurvature tensor p vanishes in the later case the hcovariant
derivative of s vanishes
proof as m l is p2 like then p x y   w   t x y  w   o t x y  w 
and hence
314
pbx y   o t x y 
now setting w   into 310 we get
hence
y pbz x  x pbz y   p z xy  p z y x
pbt x z y   pbt y z x  0
gy pbz x w   gx pbz y  w   p z x y w 
p z y x w   gpbt x z y  w   gpbt y z x w   0
from which together with 314 and definition 210 taking into account the relation
y pbz x  y o t z x  o y t z x we obtain
gy o t z x  o y t z x w   gx o t z y 
o x t z y  w   xt z y  w   w  t z y x  y t z x w 
w  t x y z  got t x z y  w   got t y z x w   0
therefore using corollary 319
y t x z w   x t y z w   o sx y w z
it is to be observed that the lefthand side of the above equation is symmetric in
the arguments z and w while the righthand side is skewsymmetric in the same
arguments hence we have
o sx y w z  0
315
y t x z w   xt y z w   0
316
where  is the form defined by y   y 
now if  6 0 it follows from 316 that there exists a scalar function  such that
t x y z   xy z consequently t x y    xy 
where g x  x from which
sx y z w   gt x w  t y z  gt y w  t x z
  xy zw g    xy zw g   0
on the other hand if the vcurvature tensor s 6 0 then it follows from 315
that   0 and   0 hence   0 and the hvcurvature tensor p vanishes in
this case it follows from the identity 310 that x s  0 
proposition 332 a p2 like finsler manifold m l is a p  finsler manifold
proof as m l is p2 like then from 314 we have pbx y   o t x y  using
lemma 31 we get  t x y   0 t x y  from which by taking the trace
gb cc
 hence the result 
 c  0 t  where 0 
the next definition will be useful in the sequel
definition 333 a tensor field  is positively homogenous of degree r in the
directional argument y symbolically hr if it satisfies the condition
   r  or d   r 
lemma 334 let m l be a finsler manifold then we have
a the finsler metric g the angular metric tensor  is homogenous of degree 0
b the vcurvature tensor s is homogenous of degree 2
c the hvcurvature tensor p is homogenous of degree 1
d the hcurvature tensor r is homogenous of degree 0
e the hhvtorsion tensor t is homogenous of degree 1
f the vhvtorsion tensor pb is homogenous of degree 0
b is homogenous of degree 1
g the vhtorsion tensor r

deicke theorem 4 can be formulated globally as follows
lemma 336 let m l be a finsler manifold
equivalent
the following assertions are
a m l is riemannian
b the hhvtorsion tensor t vanishes
c the form c vanishes
theorem 337 let m l be finsler manifold which is hisotropic of scalar k0 
and c h recurrent of recurrence vector 0  then m l is necessarily one of the
following
a a riemannian manifold of constant curvature
b a finsler manifold of dimension 2
c a finsler manifold of dimensions n  3 with vanishing scalar k0 and
x o y   y o x
proof for a c h recurrent manifold one can easily show that
1 1
1 1
 t x y z w    t y x z w  
 x o y   y o xt z w   x y t z w 
from which taking into account lemma 335 we obtain
x y t z w   t rx y z w   t z rx y w 
rx y t z w    rxy
 t z w 
now as m l is hisotropic of scalar k0  then the hcurvature tensor r has the form
rx y z  k0 gx zy  gy zx  n  3
from the above two equations we get
x y t z w   k0 gx zt y w   k0 gy zt x w   k0 gx w t z y 
k0 gy w t z x  k0 gx t z w y  k0 gy t z w x
k0 gx y t z w   k0 gy x t z w 
317
setting y   noting that t is h1 and g   l  we get
x t z w   k0 g zt x w   k0 g w t z x  k0 t x z w  
k0 gx t z w   k0 l2 x t z w 
from which we have
gy x t z w   k0 gy g zt x w   k0 gy g w t z x
k0 gy t x z w   k0 gy gx t z w 
k0 l2 gy x t z w 
318
whereas
gx y t z w   k0 gx g zt y w   k0 gx g w t z y 
k0 gx t y z w   k0 gx gy t z w 
k0 l2 gx y t z w 
319
now from 317 318 and 319 we obtain
t z w l2x y   gy x   gx y  
 uxy k0 l2 x zt y w   x w t y z  y  t x z w 
taking the trace of both sides of the above equation we get
czl2 x y   gy x   gx y  
 2k0 l2 x zcy   y zcx
320
setting z  c taking into account the fact that x c  cx the above
equation reduces to
ccl2 x y   gy x   gx y   0
now if cc  gc c  0 then c  0 and so c  0 consequently by
lemma 336 m l is a riemannian manifold of constant curvature
on the other hand if m l is not riemannian then we have
l2 x y   gy x   gx y   0
from which together with 320 we get
k0 x zcy   y zcx  0
321
if k0 6 0 then by 321 x zcy   y zcx setting y  c
we get x z  c12 cxcz which implies that dim m  2
if k0  0 then r  0 and 317 yields x y   0 which means that
x o y   y o x 
now we focus our attention to the interesting case c of the above theorem in
b  0
this case the hcurvature tensor r  0 and hence the vhtorsion tensor r
therefore the equation deduced from 39
x ry z w   y p z x w   z p y x w 
p z p y xw  rt x y  zw  sry z xw 
p y p z xw  rt x z y w  0
reduces to
y p z x w   z p y x w 
p z pby xw  p y pbz xw  0
setting w   we get
y pbz x  z pby x  pbz pby x  pby pbz x  0
322
since m l is c recurrent then by proposition 317 the vhvtorsion tensor
pb satisfies the relations z pbx y   ko o z  z ko t x y  and
pbx y   o t x y   ko t x y  from these together with 322
we get
ko o y   y ko t z x  ko o z  z ko t x y 
ko2 t z t x y   ko2 t y t x z  0
hence by corollary 319
ko2 sy z x w   uyz ko o y   y ko t x z w 
as sy z x w  is skewsymmetric in the arguments x and w while the
righthand side is symmetric in the same arguments we obtain
ko2 sy z x w   0
uyz ko o y   y ko t z x w   0
it follows from 323 and  that
323
324
p x y z w   o zt x y w   o w t x y z
on the other hand if ko 6 0 then the vcurvature tensor s vanishes from 323
next it is seen from 324 that if vy   ko o y   y ko 6 0 then there
t xyzt yzw 
exists a scalar function   t xzw
such that
t xyw 2 vz3
t x y w    vxvy vw 
summing up we have
theorem 338 let m l be a finsler manifold of dimensions n  3 if m l is
hisotropic and c h recurrent then
a the recurrence vector o satisfies  x o y   y o x
b  0
b the hcurvature tensor r  0 and the vhtorsion tensor r
c the hvcurvature tensor p has the property that
p x y z w   o zt x y w   o w t x y z
d the vhvtorsion tensor pbx y   ko t x y 
moreover if ko 6 0 then
e the vcurvature tensor s vanishes
f the hhvtorsion tensor t satisfies  t x y w    vxvy vw 
by definition 210 and theorem 338 we immediately have 
corollary 339 a finsler manifold m l of dimension n  3 which is hisotropic
and c h recurrent is necessarily p2 like
now we define an operator p which aids us to investigate the r3 like manifolds
definition 340
a if  is a tensor field of type 1p then p   is a tensor field of the same
type defined by 
p  x1   xp   x1  xp 
where  is the vector form defined by 31
b if  is a tensor field of type 0p then p   is a tensor field of the same
type defined by 
p  x1   xp   x1  xp 
remark 341 since x  x for every x  xm lemma 32
then the operator p is a projector ie p  p    p  
definition 342 a tensor field  is said to be indicatory if it satisfies the
condition  p    
the following result gives a characterization of the indicatory property for certain
types of tensor fields 
lemma 343
a a vector 2 form  is indicatory if and only if x   0   x
and gx y    0
b a scaler 2 form  is indicatory if and only if x   0   x
proof
a let  be a vector 2 form by definition 340a and taking into account 31
we get
p  x y   x y 
 x  l1 lx y  l1 ly 
 x y   l1 ly x 
l1 lx y   l2 lxly  
 x y   l2 gx y    l1 ly x 
l1 lx y   l2 lxly  
325
now if x   0   x and gx y    0 then 325 implies
that p  x y   x y  and hence  is indicatory
on the other hand if  is indicatory then x y   x y 
from which setting x   resp y   and taking into account the fact that
  0 lemma 32 we get  y   0 resp x   0 from this together with px y   x y  equation 325 implies that l2 gx y   
0 consequently gx y    0
b the proof is similar to that of a and we omit it 
proposition 344 for a finsler manifold m l the following tensors are
indicatory 
a the tensor field 
b the mixed torsion tensor t 
c the vcurvature tensor s
d the angular metric tensor 
e the tensor field p   for every tensor field 
now we define the

following tensor fields

326
remark 345 one can show that m mo  a and b are indicatory and h  0
proposition 346 if m l is an r3 like finsler manifold then the tensor field
f can be written in the form
f x y   mx y   lxay   ly bx  c lxly 
327
proof the proof follows from definitions 214 and 340b taking into account
equations 31 and 326 in more details 
p  f x y   f x y 
 f x  l1 lx y  l1 ly 
 f x y   l1 ly f x

l1 lxp  f a y   l1 ly f    l2 lxly f  
 f x y   lxay   ly bx  c lxly  
remark 347 one can show that the tensor fields a and b satisfy the following
relations
f a x  lax  c lx
328
f b x  lbx  c lx
proposition 348 in an r3 like finsler manifold m l we have 
a rx y z  gx zfoy f x zy gy zfoxf y zx
b rx

c hy   l2 fo y   c l2 y  gy fo  f y

consequently
e rx

f hy   l2 mo y   c y 
proof
a since m l is an r3 like manifold then by definition 214 we have
rx y  z w  gx zf y  w   gy  zf x w 
 gy  w f x z  gx w f y  z
from which using the fact that gfo x y   f x y  and that the finsler
metric g is nondegenerate the result follows
b follows from a by setting z  
c follows from b by setting x  
d by 327 and 326 we get
gfox y   gmox y ga y  lxl1 bxg y c l1 lxg y 
hence the result follows from the nondegeneracy of g
e follows by substituting fo x from d and f b x from 328 into b
f follows from e by setting x   taking into account remark 345 and the
fact that l  l 
remark 349 in view of 326 and lemma 32 definition 213a can be reformulated as follows
a finsler manifold m l is of scaler curvature if the tensor field h satisfies the
relation hx  l2  x where  is a scalar function on t m
definition 350 a finsler manifold m l is said to be of perpendicular scalar
or of pscalar curvature if the hcurvature tensor r satisfies the condition
p  rx y z w   ro x zy w   x w y z 329
where ro is a function called the perpendicular scalar curvature
definition 351 a finsler manifold m l is said to be of sps curvature if m l
is both of scalar curvature and of pscalar curvature
proposition 352 if mo x  t x then an r3 like finsler manifold is a
finsler manifold of sps curvature
proof under the given assumption and taking into account proposition 348f we
have
hx  l2 x with   t  c
thus the considered manifold is of scalar curvature
now we prove that the given manifold is of pscalar curvature applying the
projection p on the hcurvature tensor r of an r3 like manifold we get
p  rx y z w   rx y  z w 
 gx zp  f y w   gy  w p  f x z
gy  zp  f x w   gx w p  f y z
 gx zmy w   gy  w mx z
gy  zmx w   gx w my z
330
since
gx y   gx y  l1 ly   gx y   l1 ly gx 
 x y   l1 ly x   x y 
then by using again the given assumption mo  t   m  t equation 330
reduces to
p  rx y z w   x zmy w   y w mx z 
y zmx w   x w my z
 2tx zy w   y zx w 
therefore by taking ro  2t we have
p  rx y z w   ro x zy w   y zx w 
consequently the given manifold is of pscalar curvature
theorem 353 if an r3 like finsler manifold m l is of pscalar curvature then
it is of sps curvature
proof since the considered manifold is r3 like then by the same procedure as in
the proof of proposition 352 we have
p  rx y z w   x zmy w   y w mx z
331
y zmx w   x w my z
on the other hand since the considered manifold is of pscalar curvature then the
hcurvature tensor satisfies
p  rx y z w   ro x zy w   y zx w  332
now from equations 331 and 332 we obtain
uxy ro x zy w   x zmy w   y w mx z  0
using 326 and the nondegeneracy of the metric tensor g the above equation
reduces to
uxy ro x zy   x zmo y   mx zy   0 333
since the tensor fields  m and mo are indicatory then
t ry 7 x y z  gx z  x z
t ry 7 x y mo z  mx z
t ry 7 mx y z  mx z
consequently if we take the trace of both sides of equation 333 making use of
lemma 343 we get
n  2ro x z  n  3mx z  n  1t x z  0
where t  n1
t rmo  from which using 326 and lemma 32 we get
n  2ro   n  3mo  n  1t   0
334
again taking the trace of the above equation we obtain
n  1n  2ro  2t  0
substituting the above relation into 334 we get mo  t  hence by proposition
352 the result follows 
theorem 354 if an r3 like finsler manifold m l is of scalar curvature then it
is of sps curvature
proof since the given manifold is r3 like then the tensor h is given by cf
proposition 348
hx  l2 mo x  c x
335
and since the considered manifold is of scalar curvature then
hx  l2 x
336
from equations 335 and 336 we deduce that mo x  cx  tx
hence by proposition 352 the result follows 
now let us define the tensor field
uxy gx zrichy w 
x y z w   rx y z w   n2
gy w richx z  rgx zgy w 
337
where r  n1 sc  from definition 214 and 337 we immediately obtain
theorem 355 an r3 like finsler manifold is characterized by
x y z w   0
the tensor field  in the above theorem being of the same form as the weyl
conformal tensor in riemannian geometry we draw the following
theorem 356 an r3 like riemannian manifold is conformally flat
remark 357 it should be noted that some important results of 8 9 11 13
19 20etc obtained in local coordinates are retrieved from the above mentioned
global results when localized
