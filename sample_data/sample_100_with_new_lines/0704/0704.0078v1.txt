introduction
an important aspect in any geometric gravitational theory is the analysis of how to match
two spacetimes this is true in particular for general relativity and its perturbation
theory despite the relevance and maturity of the matching theory one often finds papers
where the matching conditions are not properly used most of the difficulties arise from
the fact that the matching conditions are imposed in specific coordinate systems in a
manner which is not completely coordinate independent more specifically matching two
spacetimes requires identifying the boundaries pointwise and sometimes this identification
is done implicitly by fixing spacetime coordinates without paying enough attention to the
fact that solving the matching involves finding an identification of the boundary and that
this should not be fixed a priori
in perturbation theory this problem also arises and it gets complicated by the fact
that the fields to be matched as the perturbed metric are gauge dependent so in
addition to a priori choices of identifications of the boundary there is also the problem
that particular gauges are often used it may be argued that the matching theory must
be gauge independent and therefore it can be performed in any gauge this is true but
only when due care is taken to ensure that the choice of gauge does not restrict a priori
the perturbed identification of the boundaries
a complete description of the linearized matching conditions has been achieved only
recently by carter and battye 5 and independently by mukohyama 6 to second order
the matching conditions have been recently found in 7 despite these papers we believe
that some confusion still lingers in the field in particular with respect to the existing gauge
invariant formulations the aim of this paper is to try to clarify these issues in order
to do that we will critically discuss some of the approaches proposed in the literature
trying to make clear which are the implicit assumptions made and to what extent are
they justified
the first papers discussing the perturbed matching theory are as far as we know
the classic papers by gerlach and sengupta 2 3 however as explained below their
description of the perturbed matching theory contains imprecisions and we will therefore
start discussing their approach pointing out the difficulties they encounter a first attempt
to justify the claims in 2 3 is due to martngarca and gundlach 4 who propose a
different but nevertheless closely related set of linearized matching conditions pointing
out the implicit assumption made by these authors will also help us to try to explain the
subtleties inherent to the perturbed matching theory
in 6 the linearized matching conditions are described for arbitrary backgrounds
perturbations and matching hypersurfaces and then applied to the case of two background
spacetimes with a high degree of symmetry namely those which admit a maximal group of
isometries acting on codimension two spacelike submanifolds eg spherically symmetric
spacetimes in order to simplify the matching conditions mukohyama derives a set of
matching conditions for socalled doubly gauge invariants however a gap arises in his
final conclusions as the presented set of conditions for doubly gauge invariant quantities
for the linearized matching of spacetimes are only shown to be necessary conditions
analysing sufficiency touches directly on the issue we are trying to emphasize in this
paper so we devote one section to clarify this point where we show how these conditions
are stricktly speaking not sufficient since the matching conditions in terms of doubly
gauge invariants are widely used in the literature we consider important to close this
gap moreover the constructions of gauge invariant quantities using spherical harmonic
decompositons leaves out the l  0 and l  1 sectors we will discuss this issue and its
consequences
the paper is organized as follows we start by summarising the perturbed matching
conditions in section 2 where we also describe the gauge freedom involved then the
procedures used in the classic papers 2 3 together with the justifications and further
developments in 4 are reviewed in section 3 section 4 focuses on the consequences of
the existence of symmetries in the background configuration which will have relevance
in our final discussion section 5 has three subsections the first one is devoted to
present briefly the procedure and results discussed in 6 particularised to the case of
spherically symmetric backgrounds in the second subsection we analyse the sufficiency
of the doubly gauge invariant matching conditions in 6 the last subsection is devoted
to the study of the freedom left in the perturbation of the matching hypersurface once
the metric perturbations have been fixed at both sides we finish with an appendix where
explicit expressions for the discontinuities of the perturbed second fundamental forms in
the spherical case are given some of these expressions are used in the main text
linearized matching
in this section we describe the gauge freedom involved in the linearised spacetime matching
and summarise the perturbed matching conditions
gauge freedom
the purpose of the matching theory is to construct a new spacetime out of two spacetimes
m  with boundary by finding a suitable diffeomorphism between the boundaries which
allows for their pointwise identification in particular the matched spacetime cannot
be thought to exist beforehand another aspect to bear in mind is that the matching
conditions involve exclusively tensors on the identified boundary  and hence any coordinate system in m  is equally valid this is wellknown but it is still source of confusion
sometimes
in perturbed matching theory not only the metrics are perturbed but also the matching hypersurfaces may be deformed furthermore as for the metric the deviation of the
matching hypersurface is also a gauge dependent quantity this can be best understood
by viewing perturbations as derivatives at   0 of a oneparameter family of space
times m  g  with boundary 
  it is convenient to embed m within a larger manifold
without boundary v to clarify the discussion a priori the manifolds m  g  are
completely distinct so it makes no direct sense to talk about derivatives it is necessary
to identify first the different manifolds so that a single point p refers to one point on each
of the manifolds obviously there are infinite ways to identify the manifolds all of them
equally valid a priori this freedom leads to the gauge dependence of the perturbed metric and of any other geometrically defined tensor the identification above may or may
not map the boundaries 
 among themselves a priori a point in 0 may be mapped
for  6 0 to a point on 
  to a point interior to m or to a point exterior to m within
the extension v  which is not part of the manifold how can we then take derivatives
with respect to  at those later points since only derivatives at   0 are needed restricting to infinitesimal values of  entails no loss of generality then if for some small
 a point q  
0 is mapped to the exterior of m  it follows from differentiability with
respect to  that q is mapped for the reverse value  to a point interior to m  thus
perturbations can be defined at the boundary by taking one sided derivatives ie to take
limits   0 with a sign restriction on  cf 7 for an alternative discussion
however an important issue remains how do we describe the deformation of the
boundary 
0  as a set of points each boundary  maps with the above identification
into a hypersurface of the background spacetime which we call 
  in general this
and
may
well
touch
cross
it this gives us
hypersurface will not coincide with 
an idea of how the boundary is deformed but only as a subset not pointwise in order
to know how the boundary actually moves within the background we need to prescribe a
priori a pointwise identification of 
0 with   this identification is completely different
and independent from the one described above involving spacetime points and involves
only the points on the boundaries as before there are infinitely many ways to identify the
boundaries and this defines a second gauge freedom which involves objects intrinsically
defined on the boundary this gauge freedom will be referred as hypersurface gauge as
opposed to the usual spacetime gauge described above
with both identifications chosen the deformation of the boundary within the background can already be described fix a point q on the background boundary 
0  the
for
each
the
spacetime
idenidentification of the boundaries defines a point q on 
tification takes this point q and maps it into a point q of the background m0 perhaps
after a sign restriction on  obviously q belongs to the perturbed hypersurface 
  we
have therefore not only a deformation of the background hypersurface as a set of points
but also pointwise information it only remains to take the tangent vector of the curve
   dq 0 which encodes completely the deformation of the matching
q at   0 ie z
hypersurface as seen from the background spacetime two final remarks are in order
  is defined exclusively on 
i z
0  no extension thereof is defined or required and ii
 depends on both the spacetime and hypersurface gauges since its defining curve is
   qn 0  t   where
constructed using both identifications however decomposing z
  is tangent to it it turns
n0 is the unit normal of 
assumed
nonnull
anywhere
and
out that q depends on the spacetime gauge but not on the hypersurface gauge this
is because changing the hypersurface gauge reorganizes the points within each 
  but
cannot modify any of them as a set of points
tensors defined intrinsically on the boundaries 
 are completely unaffected by the
spacetime identification and are therefore invariant under spacetime gauge transformations recall that the matching conditions involve only objects intrinsic to the matching hypersurfaces since the perturbed matching conditions are formally just their derivatives it follows by construction that the perturbed matching conditions must be
gauge invariant under spacetime gauge transformations this may seem surprising at first
sight since the matching conditions must involve the perturbed metric which is obviously
gauge dependent however the conditions turn out to be gauge independent because they
   which is spacetime gauge dependent this vector
also involve the deformation vector z
is therefore of fundamental importance and must be taken into account in any sensible
approach to the problem as we shall see next
matching conditions
let m0  g0  be ndimensional spacetimes with nonnull boundaries 
0  matching them
requires an identification of the boundaries ie a pair of embeddings   0  m0
with  0   
0  where 0 is an abstract copy of any of the boundaries let 
i j     1     n  1 be a coordinate system on 0  tangent vectors to 0 are obtained
      0     n  1 there are also unique up to orientation unit
by e
normal vectors n  to the boundaries we choose them so that if n  points towards
m  then n  points outside of m  or viceversa the first and second fundamental are
simply q 0 ij   e
k 0 ij   n e
i ej g   
i  ej  the matching conditions
in the absence of shells require the equality of the first and second fundamental forms

q 0 ij   q 0 ij   k 0 ij   k 0 ij  
under a perturbation of the background metric gpert

in these equations q and t  are a priori unknown quantities and fulfilling the
  exist such that 2 are satisfied
matching conditions requires showing that two vectors z
  a priori
the spacetime gauge freedom can be exploited to fix either or both vectors z
but this should be avoided or at least carefully analysed if additional spacetime gauge
choices are made in order not to restrict a priori the possible matchings regarding the
hypersurface gauge this can be used to fix one of the vectors t  or t   but not both
as already stressed the linearized matching conditions are by construction spacetime
gauge invariant in fact each of the tensors q 1 ij   k 1 ij  is moreover the set of
conditions 2 are hypersurface gauge invariant provided the background is properly
matched since 6 under such a gauge transformation given by the vector  on 0  q 1 ij
transforms as q 1 ij  l q 0 ij  and similarly for k 1 ij 
on previous spacetime gauge invariant formalisms
the first attempt to derive a general formalism for the matching conditions in linearized
gravity is to our knowledge due to gerlach and sengupta 2 their approach is based
on the description of the matching hypersurface  as a level set of a function f defined
on the spacetime assuming the level sets f  const to be timelike a field of spacelike
unit normals is defined as n  g  f f 12 f  the unperturbed matching conditions
correspond to the continuity everywhere in particular across  of the tensors
k  q  q   n 
q  g  n n 
which are the spacetime versions of the first and second fundamental forms introduced
above being f defined everywhere it makes sense to perturb it in order to describe the
variation of the matching hypersurface obviously by perturbing f one also perturbs n 
the perturbed matching conditions proposed in 2 read
q  q  q   q  q  q  
q  q  k   q  q  k  
where q  is the projector onto   stands for perturbation and  and  denote the
quantities as computed from either side of the matching hypersurface  these expressions involve the projections of the perturbations of q and k onto  the need of
we will abuse slightly the notation and refer to vectors on 0 and their images on spacetime with
the same symbol the meaning should be clear from the context
considering only the projected components is justified in 2 since the matching conditions need to be intrinsic to the matching hypersurfaces however gerlach and sengupta
themselves note that conditions 6 are not gauge2 invariant
since the main interest in 2 3 refers to spherically symmetric backgrounds this
ambiguity is fixed in that case by finding suitable gauge invariant combinations of
the linearized matching conditions which turn out to give a correct set of necessary
perturbed matching conditions in spherical symmetry it should be stressed however that
the authors consider these gauge invariant subset to be sufficient also with no further
justification
we know from the discussion in sect 21 above that 6 cannot be correct as it leads
to a set of gauge dependent conditions since on the other hand the proposal 6 may
look plausible it is of interest to point out where and in which sense it fails to be correct
the first source of problems comes from assuming that the matched spacetime is given
beforehand indeed q and k are spacetime tensors and they can only exist and be
continuous once the matched spacetime is constructed but this is precisely the purpose
of the matching conditions so the conditions become circular another aspect of the same
problem is that one can only talk about continuity once the pointwise identification of
the boundaries is chosen but a level set of a function defines only a set of points and not
the way those points must be identified a third instance of the same issue is that tensor
components must be expressed in some basis eg a common coordinate system covering
both sides of  but again this cannot be assumed a priori it needs to be constructed
let us however mention that once the pointwise identification of the boundaries is
chosen the use of spacetime tensors is allowed provided they are finally projected onto
the hypersurface in that sense and when properly used using spacetime indices may
simplify some calculations notably see carter and battye 5 where this notation is used
to derive the perturbed matching conditions
besides this aspect which already affects the background matching the perturbed
equations 6 suffer from one extra problem the perturbations q p and k p
at a point p in the background can be defined by taking derivatives at fixed p and   0
of the corresponding tensors defined by g  and f  for each value of  the matching
conditions impose the continuity of q  and k  everywhere with the caveat already
mentioned regarding the identification of the boundaries however continuity of q 
and k  at p would only follow if derivatives of continuous functions with respect
to an external parameter were necessarily continuous in our case the derivative with
respect to  which is not true in general a trivial example is given by the function
u x  x   whith x  r for each  this function is continuous however the
derivative with respect to  does not even exist at x  0   0 this reflects the fact that
subtracting continuous tensors at a fixed spacetime point p leads to objects that need not
be continuous this is in fact the main problem of 6 as linearized matching conditions
an immediate question arises why is the gauge invariant subset of matching conditions found in 2 3 for spherically symmetric backgrounds correct in order to understand
this let us rewrite 6 using the formalism of section 22 first of all since n n  will
contain at least one free n  we have
q  q  q   q  q  g 1  
throughout this section gauge will refer to spacetime gauge hypersurface gauges will only appear
briefly towards the end of the section
1 0
moreover a simple calculation gives  n    n   s n
 0 0
g 1 n n
and q  
 g 0 n n  n0 n  these together with standard properties
of the projector lead to
  1 0 
q  q  k   a0
where a  n0  n  in general these expressions do not agree with 3 and 4
   0 then f  0 on  because
however when the gauges are chosen so that z
the matching hypersurface is unperturbed as seen from the background consequently
 f   n on  which implies n   hn for some function h imposing n to
 0 0
be unit for all  fixes h  2 g 1 n n  inserting into 8 the matching conditions 6
become
 q  q  g 1  
q  q  g 1 
 1  0 0
  1 0 
g 1 n0
n n k  q  q  s n0
 n k  q q s n
which agree with 2 with the exception that 9 refers to spacetime tensors and 2 are
defined on  since gerlach and sengupta derive a subset of gauge invariant matching
conditions out of 6 in the spherically symmetric case and their conditions are correct in
one gauge it follows that the invariant subset is correct in any gauge this is the reason
why the results in 2 3 involving spherically symmetric backgrounds turn out to be fine
substantial progress in the linearized matching problem was made by martngarca
and gundlach 4 these authors pointed out the lack of justification in 2 3 for the choice
of 6 as matching conditions it was also argued that for spacetimes with boundary it
only makes sense to define perturbations by using gauges where the perturbed matching
hypersurface is mapped onto the background matching hypersurface perturbations in this
gauge called surface gauge not to be confused with hypersurface gauge are denoted
  and its defining property is f
   0 the idea was to write down the matching
by 
conditions in this gauge and then transform into any other gauge if necessary as noticed
by the authors the surface gauge is not unique since there are still three degrees of freedom
left which correspond to the three directions tangent to 
a relevant observation made in 4 was that the continuity of tensorial perturbations
may depend on the index position in the tensors the authors argue that the tensors
truly intrinsic to the hypersurfaces are q   k  with indices upstairs and propose the
following perturbed matching conditions
     q
    
     k
    
which are demonstrated to become exactly 9 this shows the equivalence of both proposals in the surface gauge as explicitly stated in 4 this justifies partially the validity of
both approaches in the surface gauge however the justification is not complete because
of the issue we discuss next
indeed conditions 10 still carry one implicit assumption that needs to be clarified
as already stressed the perturbed matching conditions have two inherent and independent
degrees of gauge freedom the approach by martngarca and gundlach involves only
spacetime objects and therefore can only notice the spacetime gauge freedom this leads
to an incorrect statement in 4 as it is not true that the linearized matching conditions
read 10 in any surface gauge conditions 10 will only be valid when the spacetime
gauge maps pairs of background points identified via the background matching to pairs
of points on the perturbed boundaries 
 which are also identified through the matching
notice that not all surface gauges have this property in explicit terms this means that
  must i only have tangential components so that we are in surface gauge
the vectors z
and ii have the same components when written in terms of an intrinsic basis of 0  in
  and z
  are the same
less precise but more intuitive terms condition ii states that z
vector ie that the gauges in both regions are chosen such that the displacement of
one fixed point of the background hypersurface is identical in both regions the displaced
point of course stays on the unperturbed hypersurface due to the choice of surface
gauge observe finally that if q  0 and t   t   then the linearized matching
conditions 2 truly reduce to conditions 9 once the latter are projected on  this
shows the correctness of the approaches by gerlach and sengupta and martngarca and
gundlach in special gauges
freedom in matching due to symmetries
we devote this section to the study of the consequences of the existence of background
symmetries on perturbed spacetime matchings
the existence of symmetries in the background configuration introduces two issues
which are important to take into consideration the first corresponds to the freedom introduced by the matching procedure when preserving the symmetries at the background
level 9 cf 10 for an application the second issue corresponds to the consequences
that the symmetries in the background configuration may have on the perturbation of the
matching
it must be stressed here that the arbitrariness introduced by the presence of symmetries
in the background configuration is completely independent from both the hypersurface and
spacetime gauge freedoms however that arbitrariness is gauge dependent and therefore
a gauge choice can be made to remove it as we will show an isometry in the background
implies that there is a direction along which the difference t   t   t  cannot be
determined by the perturbed matching equations but as we have discussed at the end
of section 2 one could eventually choose part of the spacetime gauges if there is any
freedom left to fix t  note finally that a change of hypersurface gauge leaves t 
invariant
isometries
we shall now consider the presence of isometries in the background configuration so
let us assume that one of the sides say m0  g 0  admits an isometry generated by
the killing vector field  tangent to the boundary 
0  the commutation of the lie
derivative and the pullback implies 9
l q 0 ij   e
i ej l g  0  0
which means that  is a killing vector of 0  q 0 ij   this implies from expression 3
that q 1 ij  is invariant under the transformation t   t    0 
as for k 1 ij   from its expression 4 it is again clear that the previous transformations of t  will leave k 1 ij  invariant provided l k 0 ij   0 but this is precisely the
case since  is a killing vector orthogonal to n  which implies l n  0  0 and
hence
l k 0 ij   e
i ej l n  0  ei ej  l n  0  0
of course all this discussion also applies to the  side
the combination of the invariance of q 1 ij  and k 1 ij  leads to the fact that the
first order perturbed matching conditions are invariant under a change of the vectors
t  along the direction of any isometry of the background configuration preserved by
the matching then as expected when symmetries are present the linearized matching
conditions cannot determine the difference t  completely they leave undetermined the
relative between the two sides deformation of the hypersurface along the direction of
the symmetry note that still the shape of the perturbed hypersurface is completely
determined since that is driven by q 
the overall picture is as follows at the background level we have the arbitrariness of
the identification of 
0 with 0 9 which can be seen as a sliding between 0 and
0  the perturbation adds to this an arbitrary shift of the deformation of the matching
hypersurface at each side along the orbits of the isometry group as an example in
the description of stationary and axisymmetric compact bodies discussed in 10 9 the
background sliding corresponds to an arbitrary constant rotation of the interior with
respect to the exterior note that in that case this rotation is only relevant because
the exterior is taken to be asymptotically flat as a result two identical interiors can
in principle give rise to two exteriors that differ by a constant rate rotation 10 the
shift of the surface deformation would in principle lead to an arbitrary constant rotation
along the axial coordinate of the surface deformation of the body likewise two identical
perturbations in the interior of the body may produce two different perturbations in the
exterior which may differ by a relative constant rate rotation a choice of spacetime
gauge could be used to relate the deformations inside and outside however this may
interfere with other gauge fixings that may have been made
ndimensional spherically symmetric backgrounds
in this section we shall revisit mukohyamas theory for linearized matching in the special
case of spherical symmetry similar results 6 hold for backgrounds admitting isometry
groups of dimension n1n22 acting on nonnull codimensiontwo orbits of arbitrary
topology strictly speaking the orbits need to be compact
the approach of mukohyama
concentrating on one of the two spacetimes to be matched either  or  we consider a
spherically symmetric background metric of the form
g dx dx  ab dxa dxb  r 2 ab da db 
where ab a b   0 1 is a lorentzian twodimensional metric depending only on xa 
r  0 is a function of xa  and ab da db is the n  2 dimensional unit sphere metric
with coordinates a  a b     2 3     n  1
a general spherically symmetric background hypersurface can be given in parametric
form as
0  x0  z 00  x1  z 01  a  a 
where  i   a  is a coordinate system in 0 adapted to the spherical symmetry
the tangent vectors to 0 read
e  z  0 0 x0  z  0 1 x1
ea  a 0 
where dot is derivative wrt  with n 2  e a e b ab 0  so that   1   1
corresponds to a timelike spacelike hypersurface the unit normal to 0 reads
 det    0 1 0
z dx  z  0 0 dx1
where the sign choice of n corresponds to the choice of orientation of the normal the
background induced metric and second fundamental form on 0 read
q 0 ij d id j  n 2 d2  r 2 0 ab 0 da db 
k 0 ij d i d j  n 2 kd2  r 2 k0 ab 0 da db 
where
k  n 2 e a e b a nb 
k  n0a xa ln r
it follows that the background matching conditions 1 are
n2  n2 
 0  r
 0 
k  k 
k  k 
using 3 and 4 we could now compute the first order perturbations q 1 ij and k 1 ij in
 or equivalently q and t  cf eqs 45 and 46
terms of the above quantities and z
in 6 let us recall see subsection 22 that while the individual tensors q 1 ij and k 1 ij
are not hypersurface gauge invariant their respective differences from the  and  sides
ie the linearized matching conditions are those tensors depend of the hypersurface
gauge through the tangent vectors t  and t   which under a gauge change transform
simply by adding the gauge vector it follows that only their difference t  can appear
in the linearized matching conditions consequently there are three degrees of freedom
that cannot be fixed by the equations but can be fixed by choosing the hypersurface
gauge for instance to set t   thus the linearized matching conditions can be looked at
as equations for the difference t  as well as for q and q  ie for five objects if these
equations admit solutions then the linearized matching is possible and it is impossible
otherwise
mukohyama emphasizes the convenience to look for doubly gauge invariant quantities
to write down the linearized matching conditions however the matching conditions are
already gauge invariant both for the spacetime and hypersurfaces gauges looking for
gauge invariant combinations on each side amounts to writing equations where the difference vector t  simply drops indeed in many cases knowing the value of such vector
in a specific matching is not interesting in that sense using doubly gauge invariant
quantities is useful as it lowers the number of equations to analyse however we want to
stress that this is not related to obtaining gauge invariant linearized matching equations
it is just related to not solving for superfluous information in fact a set of equations
where also q and q have disappeared would be even more convenient from this point
of view provided one is not interested in knowing how the hypersurfaces are deformed in
the specific spacetime gauge being used
since the use of doubly gauge invariant matching conditions is used extensively let us
recall its main ingredients in order to discuss if they really are equivalent to the full set
of linearized matching equations and in which sense
to that aim mukohyama 6 decomposes the perturbation tensors q 1 ij and k 1 ij in
terms of scalar y  vector va and tensor harmonics tab on the sphere as3

where all the scalar coefficients depend only on  each coefficient in the decomposition
has indices l and m which have been dropped for notational simplicity notice that
each coefficient  and  is defined in the range of ls appearing in the corresponding
summatory by construction each of the  and  are spacetimegauge invariant but
not hypersurfacegauge invariant for l  2 they can even be written down 6 explicity
in terms of spacetimegauge invariant quantities in a similar way the doubly gaugeinvariant quantities presented in 6 are only defined for l  2 except kt 0  which is also
defined for l  1 and read
f00  00  2n n 1  
f  y   n 2  r 2 0 
k 2 ll

kll  ll  kll 
ky   y   ky   n 2 r 2 0  k
kt   t   kt  
the ranges of ls are not made explicit in 6 in order to include also noncompact homogeneous
spaces where the index l is continuous however to discuss sufficiency of the equations we need to be
precise on the range of validity of each equation
where kl2  ll  n  3 and
  l0  r 2 0  r 20 ll 
the orthogonality properties of the scalar vector and tensor harmonics imply that
the equalities of the coefficients  and  for each l and m is equivalent to the equality of
the perturbation tensors 18 and 19 at both sides of 0  thus recalling the notation
f   f  0  f  0  the equations
00   y    0
l0   t 0   0
t    lt    ll   0
00   y    0
l0   t 0   0
t    lt    ll   0
are equivalent to 2 and therefore correspond exactly to the linearized matching conditions in this setting notice that each of the equalities in 21 and 22 is in fact one
equation for each l and m in the appropriate range we will however refer to them simply
as equations
the full linearized matching conditions obviously imply the following equalities in
terms of the doublygauge invariant quantities 20
f00   f   f0   ft    0
kt 0   0
k00   ky    kl0   kll   klt    kt    0
whether these equations can be regarded as the full set of linearized matching conditions
or not requires studying their sufficiency ie whether they imply 2122 or not this
point was not mentioned in 6 and in fact the answer turns out to be negative although
in a mild way as we discuss in the next subsection
on the sufficiency of the continuity of the doublygauge invariants
  such that
let us recall that fulfilling the matching conditions requires finding two z
2122 are satisfied the key issue for the matching is therefore to show existence of
  so that all the equations hold
deformation vectors z
a plausibility argument in favour of the sufficiency of 2324 comes from simple
equation counting indeed as already discussed the linearized matching conditions are
spacetime and hypersurface gauge invariant and therefore can only involve the difference
vector t  ie three quantities since constructing double gauge invariant quantities on
each side eliminates this vector the number of equations should be reduced exactly by
three if they are to remain equivalent to the original set this is precisely what happens
as we go from the original forteen equations in 2122 down to eleven equations in
2324 this argument however is not conclusive both because it is not rigorous and
because each equation in those expressions is in fact a set of equations depending on l
and m and the range of ls changes with the equations let us therefore analyse this issue
in detail in particular we need to discuss what are the consequences of the nonexistence
of doubly gaugeinvariant variables for l  0 and l  1 except for kt 0 which exists for
l  1 something not mentioned in 6
let us start by finding explicit expressions for s valid in the whole range of ls as
in 6 we decompose g 1 in harmonics as
g 1  dx dx 
hab y dxa dxb  hy  ty ab da db 
2ht a vt a  hla vla dxa da
ht  tt ab  hlt  tlt ab  hll tllab da db 
 as
and z
z dx
za y dx 
zt  vt a  zl vla da
qy n
z y e 
zt  vt a  zl vla da 
which implies t dx  l0 n 2 z y e   l1 zt  vt a  zl vla da  inserting
these expressions into 2 and expanding in spherical harmonics it is straightforward to
find
00   0  h   2qn 2 k  2n n 1 z   0
l0   0  z   hl   r 2 0  r 2 0 zl   0

k 2 zl   0

lt    0  zt    hlt    0
t    0  ht    0
where h  hl  etc denote e a e b hab  e a hla  etc later on we will also write
down the explicit expressions for 22 but they are not needed in this subsection
it is obvious by the form of f s and s 20 that the set of equations 2122 are
equivalent to 2324 together with
l0   lt    ll   0
l  0 1 
00   y    0
l0   t 0   0
l  0 1 
00   y    0

sufficiency of mukohyamas doubly gauge invariant matching conditions would follow if
these equations serve exclusively to determine the discontinuity t  ie z  for l  0
and zt   zl  for l  1 now the explicit expressions 27 29 28 show that 30
determine uniquely z  zt   and zl  for l  2 so restricted to the sector l  2
mukoyamas doubly gauge invariant matching conditions can be regarded as equivalent
to the full set of matching conditions taking all ls into account however the equations
turn out not to be sufficient to show this it is enough to display one equation involving
the discontinuity of the background metric perturbations and q but not t  which holds
as a consequence of the full set of matching conditions 2122 but not as a consequence
of 2324 using the fact that each l  1 expression refers to n  1 objects one for
each m the number of equations in 3132 is 7n  3 while the number of unkowns in
t  not yet determined by 30 ie z  for l  0 1 and zt   zl  for l  1 is 3n  2
which is smaller it is to be expected therefore that 31 32 imply conditions where
these variables do not appear this can be made explicit for instance by combining
00 l0  0 with y  l0  0 which yields
h   2qn k  2n
hy    2qr 0 k
 r 2 0 
whenever  r 2 0  6 0 if  r 2 0   0 it is enough to consider y  l0  0 this
relation is enough to show that the continuity of the doublygauge invariant variables of
mukohyama is not sufficient to ensure the existence of the perturbed matching of course
this does not invalidate mukohyamas approach in any way which remains interesting
and useful it only means that when using this approach to solve linearized matchings
one still needs to look more carefully into the l  0 and l  1 sector to make sure that
the remaining equations 31 and 32 hold
on the other hand equations 31 32 do not completely determine t  the variable
zt  l1 only appears in t 0 l1  0 in the term  r 2 0 zt   as a result the
matching conditions do not fix zt  l1 completely but up to a constant factor times
r 2 0 for each m recalling that vt a da for l  1 correspond to the three killing
vectors on the sphere this arbitrary constant for each m accounts for the addition to
t  of an arbitrary killing vector of the sphere this is in accordance with the discussion
in section 4 we devote the following subsection to complete the study of the freedom
left in the matching
freedom in the matching
as already emphasized solving the linearized matching amounts to finding perturbation
  and z
   assume now that a linearized matching between two given backvectors z
grounds and perturbations has been done it is natural to ask what is the most general
  and z
matching between those two spaces ie what is the most general solution for z
of the matching conditions geometrically this means finding all the possible deformations of the matching hypersurface 0 which allow the two spaces to be matched
since this problem is of interest not only when the full matching conditions are imposed
but also in situations where layers of matter are present eg in braneworld or shell
cosmologies so that jumps in the second fundamental forms are allowed we will analyse
this issue in two steps first we will study the equations involving the perturbed first
fundamental forms and will determine the freedom they admit on a second step we
will write down the extra conditions coming from the equality of the second fundamental
forms
thus let us consider two perturbation configurations of the same background matching
and denote their respective sets of difference variables on 0 as f  and f  for any given
variable f  now we will define the difference between the two configurations as  f 
f   f  for any variable f  the assumption that the perturbation on each side is fixed
once and for all implies  g 1  0 we are assuming that the linearized matching
conditions are satisfied in each case and so we can subtract them linearity implies that
the differences of the linearised matching equations become equations for the difference
  the general solution of these equations clearly determines the freedom in
vector  z
the deformation of the hypesurface
the difference of the equations in 21 for the two configurations using  g 1  0
give the following set of equations
 00  0   q  n 2 k  n n 1  z   0
l  1   l0  0   z  r 0  r 0  zl   0
l  2   ll  0   zl  0
l  0   y   0  2  q  r 0 k  n  z   r 0 
kl2  zl  0
l  1   t 0  0   r 2 0  zt    0
l  2   lt   0   zt   0
l  2   t   0  0  0
expressions 35 and 38 readily determine  zl l2  zt  l2  0 which substituted in 34 give  z l2  0 as a result 36 for l  2 lead to  q l2  0
clearly all the equations for l  2 are now satisfied we now concentrate on the l  1
equations equation 37 implies that  zt  l1  ar 2 0  where a is a constant for each
m combining equations 33 34 and 36 for l  1 we obtain the following equation
for r 2 0  zl l1 
k2 r 2 0  zl l1   2k  k ln r0   k ln n  r 2 0  zl l1 
 2 r 2 0  zl l1  0
while 34 and 33 determine  z l1 and  q l1 respectively provided k 
6 0
which occurs generically the two equations for l  0 can be rearranged onto
k n 1  z l0   n 1  z l0 k lnr0   0
plus the equation 33 for l  0 which determines  q l0 
summarizing we have found that the freedom in the deformation of the hypersurface
compatible with the linearized matching conditions involving the first fundamental form
   z
 q  y n0  n 2  z  y e
am vtm  r 2 0  zl l1m v
where r 2 0  zl l1m  satisfy 39  z l0 satisfy 40 and the rest of the
variables are completely determined as described above the term in am corresponds
to adding killing vectors on the sphere something already discussed in section 4 the
rest of terms involve combinations with functions of the conformal killing vectors on
the sphere and tangential vectors along  notice that the coefficients of the conformal
killing ie  zl l1m  determine all the rest of the l  1 coefficients in particular
when  zl l1m vanishes then all the l  1 terms vanish and the freedom becomes
radially symmetric
we now add to the analysis the difference of the equations in 22 due to the fact
  vanish for l  2 we only need to consider the equations for
that all coefficients in  z
l  0 1 ie 32 we refer the reader to appendix a for the explicit expressions of 32
 for the sake of completeness we also include
in terms of the metric perturbations and z
all the explicit expressions of 22 in appendix a the difference of equations 32 see
4446 whenever  g 1  0 read

it can be checked that in general these equations overdetermine the previous equations
ie 39 and 40 although there may be particular cases for which they are compatible
therefore generically they will imply that  zl l1m  0 and  z l0  0 and
thence all the rest of the variables vanish  z l1m  q l1m  0  z l0 
q l0  0 so that the only freedom left is given by
   z
  am v
finding in which particular cases equations 3943 are compatible is straightforward
but tedious and will not be carried out explicitly here
