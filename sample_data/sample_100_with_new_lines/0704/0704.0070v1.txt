the fractional aharonovbohm oscillation fabo of narrow quantum rings with two electrons
has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way the evolution of the period and
amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described furthermore the dipole transition
of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies their difference appears as an
oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly a number of equalities relating
the observables and dynamical parameters have been found

in addition to the oscillations in eo and jo  the oscillation in the optical properties is noticeable1617  in this
paper a new kind of oscillation found in the dipole transition of twoelectron 2e narrow rings is reported the
emitted absorbed photon of the dipole transition of the
gs was found to have essentially two energies their difference is exactly equal to hjo  where h is the plancks
constant in other words the difference of the two photon
energies appears as an oscillation which matches exactly
the oscillation of jo  this finding is approved by both
numerical calculation and analytical analysis as follows
the narrow 2e ring is first considered as onedimensional then the effect of the width of the ring is
further evaluated afterward the hamiltonian reads
h  t  v12  hzeeman
gi  j  2  g 
2m r2
where m the effective mass j the azimuthal angle of the j  th electron   r2 b0  where b
is a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the
ring v12 the ee coulomb interaction hzeeman 
sz  the well known zeeman energy where sz is
g b
the zcomponent of the total spin s and   r
where g  is the effective gfactor and b is the bohr
magneton
the interaction is adjusted as 7 v12 
e2 2 d2  r2 sin2 1  2 21  where  is the dielectric constant and the parameter d is introduced to
account for the effect of finite thickness of the ring
we first perform a numerical calculation so that all
related quantities can be evaluated quantitatively m

a set of basis functions k1 k2  eik1 1 k2 2  2 is introduced to diagonalize the hamiltonian where k1 and
k2 must be integers to assure the periodicity the sum of
k1 and k2 is just the total orbital angular momentum l
k1 k2 must be further antisymmetrized when s  01
when about three thousand basis functions are adopted
accurate solutions at least six effective digits can be obtained the lowlying spectrum is plotted in fig1 where
the oscillation of the gs energy and the transition of the
gs angular momentum lo can be clearly seen

following points
i separability the separability of onedimensional
ring is well known5  however for the convenience of the
following description it is briefly summarized as follows
each eigenenergy e can be exactly divided as a sum of
three terms
e  12 gl  22  eint  sz 
where the first term is the kinetic energy of collective
motion eint is the internal energy 
since the basis functions can be rewritten as

the spatial part of each eigenstate  is strictly separable as   12 eil c int where the first part describes
the collective motion while int is a normalized internal
state depending only on  in particular both eint and
int do not depend on b or

three of each type are shown the higher state has more nodes

fabo region when  is positive lo is negative the numbers by the curves are lo 
ii classification of int  when l is even odd k2 
k1 2 is an integer halfinteger thus the period of  as
shown in 4 is 2 4 therefore the periodicity of the
internal states have two choices in fact the difference in
the periodicity is closely related to the dependence of the
domains of the new variables c and  this point has
been discussed in detail in ref1415 let q  1l 
then the four cases q s  10 10 11 and 11

and d  respectively
the internal states of type a
are denoted as a  a     and the associated internal

due to the ee repulsion a dumbbell shape db ie
  180  is advantageous in energy because the two
electrons are farther away from each other meanwhile
however a rotation of this geometry by  is equivalent
to an interchange of particles these operations will create the factors 1l and 1s  respectively from the
wave function therefore the equivalence leads to a constraint accordingly the db is allowed only for the states
with l  s even ie only for type a and c otherwise the states would have an inherent node at the db
and therefore be higher in energy as shown in table 1
where ea  eb  ec  ed  and ea  ec  in fig2
the patterns of type a are onetoone similar to type c
 they all have a peak at the db on the contrary all
those of type b andd have the inherent node at the
db it is noticeable that type b and c are not continuous
at   0 and 2 due to their periods are not equal to 2
it was found that the internal states of all the gss are
either a or c without exceptions because the favorable
db is allowed in them when the dynamical parameters vary in reasonable ranges the qualitative features of
fig2 remain the same
according to 3 an appropriate lo would be chosen to
minimize the gs energy when  increases lo will undergo evenodd transitions repeatedly and become more
negative as shown in fig1 correspondingly the total
spin so undergoes singlettriplet transitions and a and
c appear in the gs alternatively however due to the
zeeman effect when  is larger than a critical value crit
 only so  1 states will be dominant and accordingly
only c will appear in the gs the region    crit
is called the fabo abo region
iii persistent current  let j1 be the current of the
particle e1  the expression of j1 is well known5 however
since it does not depend on the azimuthal angle it equals
to its average over 1  thus the total current j  j1 j2

d1 d2  i  1 i  2 2cc
where g  m r2  using the arguments c and 
and making use of the separability the integration over

where f  and o denote the final and initial states
respectively the signs  are associated with lf

let the initial state be the gs with lo  then int

 hint o1 int i  f   o1  o1  12  where
f  implies that the final state must be b d  if   a
c otherwise the amplitude is zero thus due to the additional rule of selection eq7 the dipole strength of the
gs is completely concentrated in two final states having
lf   lo  1 and both having the same internal state
specified by eq7 accordingly only the photons with

this equation demonstrates explicitly the mechanism
of the oscillation of the persistent current it is caused
by the stepbystep transition of l during the increase
of  examples of j are shown in fig3 where each
stronger oscillation associated with a l odd and s  1

fig 3 the oscillation of the persistent current and the two
photon energies of the ground states against 0 in the
fabo region the unit of current is 105 cr where c
is the velocity of light in the lowest panel the black square

iv relations among the internal states define
om  eim1 c   eim2 c   2 cosm2 by analyzing the numerical data we found
 o1 a   b  a and  o1 c   d  c
where  is the operator of normalization both a and
c are very small functions and depend on the dynamical
parameters very weakly eg when r varies from 30 to
90 the weights of a and c vary from 00004 to 00002
they are so small that in fact can be neglected since
o1 contains a node at the db it must cause a change of
type from a to b or from c to d thus it is not surprising
that 7 holds since o1 is the operator of the dipole
transition see below eq7 provides an additional rule
of selection as discussed later

can be emitted absorbed where   eb  ea or
ed  ec depending on   a or c the oscillation
of  is plotted in the lowest panel of fig3 it turns
out that  g depends on r very weakly thus  is
nearly proportional to r2  accordingly a smaller ring
will have a larger probability of transition with a higher
energy
vi fabo region the oscillation in this region is complicated as shown in fig1 and 3 it is noted that the gs
energy 3 persistent current 6 and the photon energies 9 all contain the factor lo  2 thus their fabo
are completely in phase and have the same mechanism
caused by the transition of lo against  in fig1 the
abscissa  can be divided into segments in each the
gs has a specific lo and the gs energy is given by a
piece of a parabolic curve the segment is called an
even odd segment if lo is even odd at the border of
two neighboring segments the two gs energies are equal
from the equality and based on 3 the right and left
boundaries of the segment with lo can be obtained as
right lo   12g2 1  1ec ea g2 
2lo 1lo 2ec ea lo 12g4
lef t lo   1  2g2 1 1  ec  ea g2 
2lo  1lo 2ec  ea   lo  12g4
where lo  0 and right lo   lef t lo  1  arises
from the hzeeman  the length of the segment reads
dlo  right lo   lef t lo   1  2g2 1 1 
1lo 2ec  ea   lo g2
crit  lef t lcrit 
once   crit  lo remains odd and the system keeps
polarized let ix be the largest even integer smaller
than g  2ec  ea  it turns out from eq12
that lcrit  ix  1 with our parameters lcrit  19
and accordingly crit  9003  refer to fig1 both
lcrit and crit depend on r very weakly but sensitively
on the effective mass m 
in the abo region   crit  eqs10 to 12 do not
hold instead we have right  lo  12 lef t 
lo  12 and dlo  1 thus the normal abo recovers evaluated from 6 the magnitude of current is
from g2 to g2 for a comparison it is from g4
to g4 for 1e rings from 9 the photon energies 
is from c  g2 to c  3g2 at the same time 
is from c  3g2 to c  g2
viii relations between the photon energies and other
physical quantities due to 7 the emitted absorbed
dipole photon has only two frequencies  therefore it is
meaningful to define       directly from
9 and 6 we have
  hjo
where h is the plancks constant and jo is the persistent current of the gs to compare with 1e rings the
latter has   2hjo q14 demonstrates that the oscillation of  and the oscillation of jo are matched
with each other exactly they keep strictly proportional
to each other during the variation of 
the maxima of  measured in the abo and fabo
regions respectively read
 ab
max  2g
max  2glo  2right 
obviously 15 provides a way to determine g m can
be thereby obtained 16 can be rewritten as
ec ea  glo 22g4g f
max
this equation can be used to determine ec  ea  furthermore we define
       g  2
once g has been known 18 can be used to determine
eb ea and ed ec  since the spectrum can be generated
from the internal energies via 3 the evolutions of the
spectrum and the persistent current against  can be
understood simply by measuring the photon energies
hj0 and difference of photon energies mev
which is related to the period of the fabo when 
increases the magnitude of lo would increase since lo
is negative it is clear from eq12 that the length of even
odd segments would become shorter longer when 
increases
the location of a segment with a given lo can be
known from the inequality lef t lo     right lo 
once the relation between lo and the segments of  is
clear every details of the fabo can be analytically and
exactly explained via the eq3 6 and 9 in particular the extrema in each segment can be known by giving
  right or lef t  for an example the maximal current is glo  2right 2 incidentally the minimum of
the gs energy in a segment is emin  ec 2 8glo2
if so  1 or just equal to ea if s0  0
it is noted that ec  ea cf table 1 and g it
is 00554 in our case are both small when  is small
the magnitude of lo  would be also small  in this case
eq12 leads to dlo  12 ie the period is a half of
the one of the normal abo in fact 12 provides an
quantitative description of the variation of the period of
the fabo
vii abo region when  becomes sufficiently large
lo will become very negative the even segments will
disappear due to their lengths dlo  0  we can define a critical odd integer lcrit so that dlcrit 1  0
while dlcrit 1  0 thereby the critical flux separating
the fabo and abo region can be defined as

fig 4 evolution of hjo solid line and  dotted line

ix effect of the width we now consider a twodimensional model in which the two electrons are strictly
confined in an annular region by a potential u r which
is zero if ra  r  rb or is infinite otherwise under
this model we have performed numerical calculation to
obtain  and hjo  where jo is now the total angular
current inside the ring from ra to rb  the result is
shown in fig4 where ra  50 and rb  120 are assumed
and the two quantities are slightly different from each
other however when the width becomes smaller say
rb  ra  30 the two curves overlap thus 14 works
not only for onedimensional but also for twodimensional
narrow rings
let us define r   m  ab
max 
for onedimensional rings and from 15 we have r r
where r is the radius of the ring for twodimensional
rings it was found from our numerical calculation that
r  rb  ra 2 if rb  ra  30 eg when rb  100
and ra  70 r 8503 when rb  100 and ra  90 r
9500 thus 15 works also well for twodimensional
narrow rings if the r in g is replaced by the average
radius
it is noted that the bandstructure and related optical
properties of 2e rings have already been studied in detail by wendler and coauthors18  they classify the eigenstates according to their radial motion relative angular
motion and collective rotation in our paper the relative
angular motion is further classified into four types according to the inherent nodal structures and periodicity
of their wave functions ie according to whether the db
shape is allowed and whether the wave function is continuous at   2 the dbaccessibility turns out to be important because it affects the eigenenergies decisively in
fact the classification of states based on inherent nodal
structures was found to be crucial in atomic physics19
this would be also true in twodimensional systems furthermore the rule of selection for the dipole transition
has been proposed in ref18 in our paper an additional rule namelyeq7 is further proposed based on
the possible transition of internal structures this rule
would affect the dipole spectrum seriously because the
emission absorption is thereby concentrated into two
frequencies the difference of these two frequencies turns
out to be proportional to the persistent current therefore the measurement of this difference can be used to
determine the magnitude of the current
in summary we have studied the fabo both analytically and numerically the analytical formalism provides not only a base for qualitative understanding but
also provides a number of formulae for quantitative description the domain of  is divided into segments
each corresponds to a lo  this division describes exactly how lo would transit against p hi which causes
directly the fabo thereby the variation of the period
and amplitude of the oscillation of the gs energy persistent current and the frequencies of dipole transition in
the fabo region can be described exactly a number of
equalities to relate the physical quantities and dynamical
parameters have been found in particular a new oscillation namely the oscillation of  was found to match
exactly the oscillation of jo  since the photon energies
can be more accurately measured other observables and
parameters can be thereby determined via the equalities since the separability of the hamiltonian and the
existence of inherent nodes are common the above description can be more or less generalized to n electron
rings this deserves to be further studied
