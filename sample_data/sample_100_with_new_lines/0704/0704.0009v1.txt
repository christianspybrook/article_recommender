we discuss the results from the combined irac and mips c2d spitzer legacy
observations of the serpens starforming region in particular we present a set of
criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects ysos from the extensive
background contamination by extragalactic objects we then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of ysos we find 235 such objects in
the 085 deg2 field that was covered with both irac and mips an additional
set of 51 lower confidence ysos outside this area is identified from the mips
data combined with 2mass photometry to understand the properties of the
circumstellar material that produces the observed infrared emission we describe
two sets of results the use of colorcolor diagrams to compare our observed source
properties with those of theoretical models for stardiskenvelope systems and
our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be well represented
by a stellar photosphere plus circumstellar disk these objects exhibit a very
wide range of disk properties from many that can be fit with actively accreting
disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks we find
that the luminosity function of ysos in serpens extends down to at least a
few 103 l or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc the lower limit may
be set by our inability to distinguish ysos from extragalactic sources more
than by the lack of ysos at very low luminosities we find no evidence for

variability in the shorter irac bands between the two epochs of our data set
t  6 hours a spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally lessevolved
ysos are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extragalactic population can be fit by the same twopoint correlation function as
seen in other extragalactic studies we also present a table of matches between
several previous infrared and xray studies of the serpens yso population and
our spitzer data set the clusters in serpens have a very high surface density
of ysos primarily with seds suggesting extreme youth the total number of
ysos mostly class ii is greater in the region outside the clusters

introduction
the serpens starforming cloud is one of five such large clouds selected for observation
as part of the spitzer legacy project from molecular cores to planetforming disks c2d
evans et al 2003 previous papers in this series have described the observational results in
the serpens cloud as seen with irac harvey et al 2006paper i and mips harvey et al
2007 as well as some of the other clouds jorgensen et al 2006 rebull et al 2006 in this
paper we examine how the combination of the irac and mips data together with other
published results on this region can be used to find and characterize a highly reliable catalog
of young stellar objects ysos in the surveyed area with the combination of broad
wavelength coverage and amazing depth of spitzers sensitivity we are able to probe to both
extremely low luminosity limits for ysos and to cover a very wide range in dust emission
both in optical depth and in range of emitting temperatures the spitzer wavelength region
is particularly well tuned for sensitivity to dust at temperatures appropriate for solarsystem
size disks around young stars
the region of the serpens cloud mapped in our survey is an area rich in star formation eiroa djupvik  casali 2007 have extensively reviewed studies at a variety of
wavelengths of this area there is evidence from previous observations of strong clustering testi et al 2000 testi  sargent 1998 dense submm cores casali eiroa  duncan
1993 enoch et al 2007 and highvelocity outflows ziener  eisloffel 1999 davis et al
1999 prespitzer infrared surveys of the cloud have been made by iras zhang et al 1988
zhang laureijs  clark 1988 and iso kaas et al 2004 djupvik et al 2006 as well as the
pioneering groundbased surveys that first identified it as an important region of star formation strom vrba  strom 1976 using mips and all four bands of irac the c2d program
has mapped a 085 deg2 portion of this cloud that includes a very wellstudied cluster of in
frared and submillimeter sources eiroa  casali 1992 hogerheijde van dishoeck  salverda
1999 hurt  barsony 1996 harvey wilking  joy 1984 testi  sargent 1998 at its
distance of 260  10 pc straizys cernis  bartasiute 1996 this corresponds to an area of
about 25  9 pc in paper i we identified at least two main centers of star formation as
seen by spitzer in this cloud that we referred to as cluster a and b cluster a is the very
wellstudied grouping also commonly referred to as the serpens core cluster b was the
subject of a recent multiwavelength study by djupvik et al 2006 who referred to it as
the serpens g3g6 cluster
the 235 ysos with high signaltonoise that we have catalogued constitute a sufficiently
large number that we can examine statistically the numbers of objects in various evolutionary
states and the range of disk properties for different classes of ysos we characterize the
circumstellar material with colorcolor diagrams that allow comparison with other recent
studies of starforming regions and we model the energy distributions of the large number
of ysos that appear to be starcircumstellar disk systems we are able to construct the
yso luminosity function for serpens since we have complete spectral coverage for all the
sources over the range of wavelengths where their luminosity is emitted and we are able to
characterize the selection effects inherent in the luminosity function from comparison with
the publicly available and signicantly deeper swire survey surace et al 2004 we find
that the population of ysos extends down to luminosities below 102 l  and we discuss the
significance of this population our complete coverage in wavelength and luminosity space
also permits us to discuss the spatial distribution of ysos to an unprecedented completeness
level we note also that unlike the situation discussed by jorgensen et al 2006 for perseus
in serpens there do not appear to be any very deeply embedded ysos that are not found
by our yso selection criteria
in 2 we briefly review the observational details of this program and then in 3 we
describe in detail the process by which we identify ysos and eliminate background contaminants in 4 we describe a search for variability in our dataset we compare our general
results on ysos with those of earlier studies of the serpens starforming region in 5 we
discuss in 6 the yso luminosity function in serpens and in particular the low end of this
function we next analyze the spatial distribution of star formation in the surveyed area
and compare it to the distribution of dust extinction as derived from our observations in
7 in 8 we construct several colorcolor diagrams that characterize the global properties
of the circumstellar material and show modeling results for a large fraction of our ysos
that appear to be stardisk systems finally 9 discusses several specific groups of objects
including the coldests ysos and a previously identified disappearing yso we also mention several obvious highvelocity outflows from ysos that will certainly be the subject of
further study
observations
the parameters of our observations have already been described in detail in paper i for
irac and in a companion study harvey et al 2007 for mips we summarize here some
of the issues most relevant to this study
we remind the reader that the angular resolution of the spitzer imaging instruments
varies widely with wavelength since spitzer is diffraction limited longward of   10m in
the shorter irac bands the spatial resolution is of order 2  while from 24160m it goes
from roughly 5 to 50  the area chosen for mapping was defined by the av  6 contour
in the extinction map of cambrsy 1999 and by practical time constraints evans et al
2003 with the exception of a small area of 004 deg2 on the northeast edge of the irac
map all of the area mapped with irac was also covered with mips at both 24 and 70m
and most of it at 160m as described by harvey et al 2007 some substantial additional
area was observed with mips without matching irac observations in this current paper
we restrict our attention to only the area that was observed from 36 to 70m 085 deg2 
this entire region was observed from 36 to 24m at two epochs with a time separation of
several hours to several days but at only one epoch at 70m we also specifically do not
include the 160m observations in our discussion because they did not cover the entire area
and because most of the ysos in serpens are too closely clustered to be distinguishable in
the large beam of the 160m data harvey et al 2007 discuss briefly the extended 160m
emission in this region and the four pointlike sources found at 160m figure 1 shows the
entire area mapped with all four irac bands and mips at 24 and 70m and also indicates
the locations of several areas mentioned in the text
in addition to this area of the serpens cloud defined by relatively high av  we also
observed small offcloud regions around the molecular cloud with relatively low av in order
to determine the background star and galaxy counts the area of combined iracmips
coverage of these offcloud regions however was relatively small and so these observations
are not discussed further in this paper as detailed below we have used the much larger
and deeper swire surace et al 2004 survey to understand the characteristics of the most
serious background contaminants in our maps the extragalactic objects
yso selection
paper i described a process for classifying infrared objects into several categories those
whose energy distributions could be wellfitted as reddened stellar photospheres those that
had a high likelihood of being background galaxies and those that were viable yso candi

dates we have refined this process by combining mips and irac data together as well as
by producing an improved comparison catalog from the swire surace et al 2004 survey
trimmed as accurately as possible to the c2d sensitivity limits as shown by the number
counts versus wainscoat models of the galactic background toward serpens in paper i
nearly all the sources observed in our survey are likely to be background stars because of
the high sensitivity of irac channels 1 and 2 relative to both 2mass and to irac channels
3 and 4 most of the more than 200000 sources extracted from our serpens dataset do not
have enough spectral coverage for any reliable classification algorithm in particular only
34000 sources had enough spectral information from a combination of 2mass and irac
data to permit a test for consistency with a stellar photosphereplusextinction model and
nearly 32000 of these objects were classified as reddened stellar photospheres these normal
stellar objects are not considered further in our discussion and are not plotted on the various
color and magnitude diagrams the details of this classification process and the criteria for
fitting are described in detail by evans et al 2007
in order to pursue the classification process for ysos beyond that described in paper
i we added one more step to the data processing described there this final step was
bandfilling the catalog to obtain upper limits or low sn detections of objects that were
not found in the original source extraction processing this step is described in detail
in the delivery documentation for the final c2d data delivery evans et al 2007 in short
though it involved fixing the position of the source during an extraction at the position of an
existing catalog source and fitting the image data at that fixed position for two parameters
a background level and source flux assuming it was a point source for this processing step
the fluxes of all the originally extracted sources were subtracted from the image first in the
case of the data discussed in this paper the most important contribution of this bandfilling
step is to give us flux estimates for the yso candidates and extragalactic candidates at
24m because our knowledge of the true psf is imperfect and because the 24m psf is
so much larger than the irac ones it was also necessary to examine these results carefully
to be sure a bandfilled 24m flux was not simply the poorly subtracted wings of a nearby
bright source that in fact completely masked the source being bandfilled for the purposes
of this paper all upper limits are given as 5 values
three of the sources eventually selected as ysos by the process described below had
24m fluxes that were obviously saturated these are the objects in table 2 numbered 127
137 and 182 for these three objects we derived the 24m flux from a fit to the wings of the
source profiles rather than a fit to the whole profile as is done by the standard c2d source
extraction
constructing a control catalog from deep extragalactic swire
observations
we use the irac and mips images of the elais n1 field obtained by the swire team
as a control field for understanding the extragalactic population with colors that mimic those
of ysos present in our serpens field this swire field expected to contain no extinction
from a molecular cloud and no ysos has coverage by both irac and mips of 531 deg2
and has a limiting flux roughly a factor of four below that of our observations of serpens
the analysis described below is designed to produce a resampled version of the swire field
as it would have been observed with the typical c2d sensitivity and as if it were located
behind a molecular cloud with the range of extinctions observed in serpens the process of
simulating these effects is discussed in detail in the final c2d data delivery documentation
evans et al 2007 but the steps are summarized here
to avoid effects that may result from differences in data processing the bcd images for
this swire field were processed by our pipeline in exactly the same way as our own observations once a bandmerged catalog of swire sources was constructed we first simulated
the reddening of sources that would occur if serpens had been in the foreground of this field
this reddening was accomplished by randomly applying extinction to each swire source
according to the extinction profile of serpens shown in figure 2 for example 23 of
swire sources were randomly selected and visual extinctions in the range 65  av  75
were applied 19 of sources were extincted by extinctions in the range 75  av  85
and so forth the extinctions were applied to each of the infrared bands according to the
extinction law appropriate for molecular clouds and cores huard et al in prep
second we degraded the sensitivity of the reddened swire photometry to match that
of our serpens observations this was accomplished by matching the detection rates as a
function of magnitude in each of the bands the 90 completeness limits of the serpens
observations are approximately 166 156 150 166 162 152 134 and 96 mag at j h
k 36 45 58 80 and 24 respectively thus for each band all reddened swire
sources brighter than the completeness limit in serpens would be detectable by c2dlike
observations and are identified as such in the resampled swire catalog most but not all
sources fainter than the completeness limit will not be detected by c2dlike observations we
randomly select which sources to identify as detections in a given band in such as way as to
reproduce the empirically determined shape of the completeness function this resampling
process is performed for each band resulting in those sources fainter than the completeness
limits in some bands being detected or not detected with the same probabilities as those for
similar sources in serpens the photometric uncertainties of all sources in the resampled
catalog of reddened swire sources are reassigned uncertainties similar to those of serpens
sources with similar magnitudes
finally each source in the resampled swire catalog is reclassified based on its degraded photometry eg star ysoc galc  the magnitudes colors and classifications of sources in this resampled swire catalog are then directly comparable to those
in our serpens catalog and may be used to estimate the population of extragalactic sources
satisfying various color and magnitude criteria at this level of the classification the terms
ysoc and galc imply candidate classification status
classification based on color and magnitude
in paper i we described a simple set of criteria that basically categorized all objects that
were faint and red in several combinations of irac and mips colors as likely to be galaxies
after removal of normal reddened stars in our new classification we have extended this
concept to include the color and magnitude spaces in figure 3 together with several additional
criteria to compute a proxy for the probability that a source is a yso or a background galaxy
figure 3 shows a collection of three colormagnitude diagrams and one colorcolor diagram
used to classify the sources found in our 36 to 70m survey of the serpens cloud that
had sn  3 in all the spitzer bands between 3 and 24m and that were not classified as
reddened stellar photospheres in addition to the serpens sources shown in the left panels
the comparable set of sources from the fullsensitivity swire catalog are shown in the
center panels and the sources remaining in the extinctedsensitivityresampled version of
the swire catalog described above are shown in the right panels the exact details of
our classification scheme are described in appendix a basically we form the product of
individual probabilities from each of the three colormagnitude diagrams in figure 3 and
then use additional factors to modify that total probability based on source properties
such as its k  45 color whether it was found to be extended in either of the shorter
irac bands and whether its flux density is above or below some empirically determined
limits in several critical bands table 1 summarizes the criteria used for this class separation
the cutoffs in each of the colormagnitude diagrams and the final probability threshold to
separate ysos from extragalactic objects were chosen 1 to provide a nearly complete
elimination of all swire objects from the yso class and 2 to maximize the number
of ysos selected in serpens consistent with visual inspection of the images to eliminate
obvious extragalactic objects such as a previously uncatalogued obvious spiral galaxy at
ra  18h 29m 574s  dec  00 31 41 j2000 
the cutoffs in colormagnitude space were constructed as smooth exponentially decaying probabilities around the dashed lines in each of the three diagrams sources far
fig 2 the distribution of visual extinctions found toward the roughly 50000 sources
classified as stars in our serpens observations
 10 
below the lines were assigned a high probability of being extragalactic contamination with
a smoothly decreasing probability to low levels well above the lines in the case of the 24
versus 8024 relation the probability dropped off radially away from the center of the
elliptical segment shown in the figure after inclusion of these three colormagnitude criteria
we added the additional criteria listed in table 1 these included 1 a factor dependent
on the k  45 color p robk  45 to reflect the higher probability of a source being an
extragalactic galc contaminant if it is bluer in that color 2 a higher galc probability
for sources that are extended at either 36 or 48m where our survey had the best sensitivity
and highest spatial resolution 3 a decrease in galc probability for sources with a 70m
flux density above 400 mjy empirically determined from examination of the swire data
and 4 identification as extragalactic for any source fainter than 24  100 again we
emphasize that these criteria are based only on the empirical approach of trying to characterize the swire population in colormagnitude space as precisely as possible not on any
kind of modeling of the energy distributions
figure 4 graphically shows the division between ysos and likely extragalactic contaminants the number counts versus our probability are shown for both the serpens cloud
and for the resampled swire catalog normalized to the serpens area this illustrates
how cleanly the objects in the swire catalog are identified by this probability criterion
in the serpens sample there are clearly two wellseparated groups of objects plus a tail of
intermediate probability objects that we have mostly classified as ysos since no such tail
is apparent in the swire sample
our choice of the exact cut between yso and xgal in figure 4 is somewhat arbitrary because of the low level tail of objects in serpens in the area of logprobability 
15 since the area of sky included in our swire sample is more than six times as large
as the mapped area of serpens we chose our final probability cut logp   147 to
allow two objects from the full not resampled swire catalog into the yso classification bin thus aside from the vagaries of smallnumber statistics we expect of order 0  1
extragalactic interlopers in our list of serpens ysos the right panels in figure 3 which
use the resampled version of the swire catalog show that the effects of sensitivity and
especially the extinction in serpens make our cutoff limits particularly conservative in terms
of likelihood of misclassification we examined all the yso candidates chosen with these
criteria both in terms of the quality of the photometry and their appearance in the images
a significant number  50 candidates were discarded because of the poor quality of the
bandfilling process at 24m due to contamination by a nearby brighter source or because
of their appearance in the images it is possible that a small number of these discarded
candidates are in fact true ysos in the serpens cloud we also manually classified one
source as yso  75 in table 2 that may be the exciting source for an hhlike outflow in
 11 
cluster b see also discussion of this region by harvey et al 2007 but which was not so
classified because of its extended structure in the irac bands table 2 lists the 235 ysos
that resulted from this selection process
another test of the success of our separation of background contaminants is to simply
plot the locations of the ysos and likely galaxies on the sky figure 5 shows such a plot
in addition to a plot of visual extinction discussed later there is clearly a very uniform
distribution of background contaminants and a quite clustered distribution of ysos see
further discussion in 7
there is one additional kind of contaminant that is likely to appear in our data at a
relatively low level agb stars the iso observations by for example van loon et al 1999
and trams et al 1999 show that the range of brightnesses of agb stars in the lmc covers a
span equivalent roughly to 8  80  12 with colors generally equivalent to 4580  1
very compact protoplanetary nebulae are generally redder but even brighter at 8m see
eg hora et al 1996 for typical galactic agb stars between 5 and 15 kpc from the sun
this would imply 3  80  9 the offcloud fields when normalized to the same area as
the serpens data provide the best handle on the degree of contamination from agb stars
in paper i we saw one object classified as a yso candidate in the offcloud panel of figure 9
with 80  9 therefore based on the ratio of areas mapped in serpens versus the offcloud
observations we expect the number of agb stars contaminating the yso candidate list in
the serpens cloud to be of order a half dozen as a further check we have examined the
entire set of offcloud fields for such objects in this combined area of 058 deg2  there are
only 3 such yso candidates finally mern et al 2007 have classified four agb stars by
their spitzerirs spectra in the serpens cloud these are identified in the diagrams of figure
3 by black open diamonds and obviously are not included in our final list of highprobability
ysos statistically then it is possible that a couple of our brightest ysos are in fact agb
stars in fact mern et al 2007 have obtained modest sn optical spectra of a number of
our ysos they find five objects whose estimated extinction seems inconsistent with their
location in the serpens cloud and which suggests they might be background objects at much
larger distances with modest circumstellar shells like agb stars we have indicated these
five objects in table 2 with a footnote b
it is also interesting to ask the reverse question to what extent have our criteria successfully selected objects that were known ysos from previous observations alcal et al
2007 have used the same criteria to search for ysos in the c2d data for chamaeleon
ii they conclude that all but one of the known ysos in that region are identified in
5 we discuss the comparison of our results with several previous studies of serpens that
searched for ysos our survey found counterparts to all the previously known objects in

 15 
our observed area that had sn  5 in those studies but we did not classify many of them
as ysos because of the lack of significant excess in the irac or mips bands most of
these were indeed suggested only as candidate ysos by the authors so we do not consider
this fact to be a problem for our selection criteria we again emphasize the fact that our
selection criteria for youth are based solely on the presence of an infrared excess at some
spitzer wavelength
the total number of objects classified as ysos in the iracmips overlap area of the
serpens cloud is 235 from the statistics of our classification of the swire data we expect
of order 1  1 of these are likely to be galaxies on the other hand as we discuss in 6
some of the faint red objects in figure 3 below the dashed line may also be young substellar objects for example we note the case of the young brown dwarf bdser 1 found by
lodieu et al 2002 that was not selected by our criteria because of its relative faintness of
these 235 198 were detected in at least the h and ks bands of the 2mass survey at better
than 7 the number of ysos in each of the four classes of the system suggested by lada
1987 and extended by greene et al 1994 is 39 class i 25 class flat 132 class ii
and 39 class iii using the flux densities available between 1 and 24m because we require
some infrared excess to be identified as a yso the class iii candidates were necessarily
selected by some measurable excess typically at the longer wavelengths 8 or 24m an
obvious corollary is that objects identified as young on the basis of other indicators eg
xray emission lithium abundance but without excesses in the range of 1  24m are not
selected with our criteria
ysos selected by mips
harvey et al 2007 found 250 yso candidates in the entire area mapped by mips
at 24m in serpens an area of 18 deg2  51 of these are outside the iracmips overlap
area and are listed in table 3 we can make a comparison of those statistics with the yso
counts here in two ways first in the area covered by both irac and mips24 there are
197 objects that satisfy the criteria of harvey et al 2007 ie ks  14 ks  24  2
24  10 and 24m sn  5 of these 184 satisfy our more restrictive criteria in this study
based on the combination of 2mass irac and mips data or 93 we would classify the
other 13 as likely background galaxies secondly of the 235 ysos found in this study 200
have sufficient data to be classifiable by the mips only criteria above but only 167 or 84
actually meet the mipsonly yso criteria in other words 33 objects have been classified
as high quality ysos in this paper in the mipsirac overlap region that did not meet
the criteria based only on mips and 2mass data if these ratios can be extrapolated to
 16 
the larger area covered only by mips then we would expect harvey et al 2007 to have
missed 16 8 or 9 of the ysos but to have included 7 3 or 4 that would not meet
our combined iracmips criteria with these corrections we might have expected to find
235  56  291 ysos in the entire 18 deg2 area covered by mips if we had matching irac
observations finally in light of our earlier discussion of agb contaminants it is possible
that 6  9 of these ysos would actually be found to be background agb stars
search for variability
the fact that our data were taken in two epochs separated by 6 hours or more gives
us the opportunity to search for variability over that time scale rebull et al 2006 and
harvey et al 2007 have performed similar tests for variability of the 24m emission from
sources in the c2d observations of perseus and serpens and found no reliable evidence for
variability at that wavelength there is however substantial evidence for short term variability in the nearinfrared for ysos we therefore performed a similar investigation in
the two shortest irac bands 36 and 45m no clear evidence was found at the level of 
25 for any sources in the field over the 6hour time scale of our multiepoch observations
comparison with previous studies of serpens
we have crosscorrelated our source catalog with those from previous studies of serpens
that searched for ysos we chose three studies that covered much of cluster a at both nearir iso and xray wavelengths eiroa  casali 1992 kaas et al 2004 preibisch 2003 and
one recent iso study of cluster b djupvik et al 2006 table 4 lists the sources from each
of these previous studies and the bestmatching spitzer source from our complete catalog
in brief we find good matches for essentially all the previous irselected ysos that had
sn  4 in the earlier studies and which were included in our mapped area in detail
however a number of yso candidates from the earlier studies were not classified as ysos
in our study the reasons for this are different for the various catalogs from the xray
catalog of preibisch preibisch 2003 in cluster a we only identified 17 of the 45 xray
sources as ysos on the basis of their infrared excesses the xray sources that were not
identified as ysos included both many objects that were wellfitted as reddened stellar
photospheres 21 sources and objects with some likely infrared excess but too little to fit
our criteria aimed at eliminating extragalactic interlopers the situation with the infrared
catalogs is somewhat different examining our nonmatches from the groundbased study of
eiroa  casali 1992 we find that a large fraction of their ysos are classified as such by
 17 
our criteria but not all from the iso surveys kaas et al 2004 djupvik et al 2006 we
typically identify 5060 as ysos the ones that we do not classify as such are typically
those with low sn in the iso observations or where the amount of infrared excess was not
large enough to satisfy our test of whether the object could not be fitted as an extincted
stellar photosphere as described by evans et al 2007
luminosities
the yso luminosity function in serpens
one of the most important physical parameters for any star is its mass for premainsequence stars this is problematic because the determination of mass depends on the
placement of the star on an hr diagram and the use of model evolutionary tracks for which
there is significant uncertainty at the level of at least a factor of 15  2 in the literature
hillenbrand  white 2004 stassun et al 2004 for young stars in a cluster a poor but
still useful proxy for mass is the stellar luminosity since it is possible that most of the stars
have formed more or less simultaneously with all these caveats in mind we display in figure
6 the histogram of total luminosities for the 235 ysos found in serpens in our survey with
the assumed distance of 260 pc we remind the reader that these objects were selected
specifically on the basis of infrared excess emission so this list is limited to ysos that show
substantial ir excess at least somewhere in the range of 35  70m for example as we
discussed in 5 a comparison of our list of ysos with the list of xray sources in cluster a
preibisch 2003 showed that more than half the xray sources were not classified as ysos
by our infrared excess criteria in some sense then it is likely that the irselected and xrayselected samples are complementary in selecting lessevolved and moreevolved samples
of ysos respectively the luminosity function of our irexcessdefined yso sample peaks
at roughly 2  102 l and drops off steeply below 102 l  this is interestingly equal
to the luminosity of objects at the hydrogenburning limit of 0075 m in the models of
baraffe et al 2002 for objects with ages of 2 myr a common estimate for the age of the
serpens star forming event kaas et al 2004 djupvik et al 2006 of course an important
question to ask is to what extent this luminosity distribution in figure 6 is influenced by
selection effects
we can estimate the selection effects in our sample from the statistics in the swire
samples discussed above the completeness limits of the full catalog are nearly 2 magnitudes
fainter than the trimmed version so we assume for simplicity that the full catalog is 100
complete down to the faintest magnitudes of interest for this test in the c2d serpens data
set figure 7 shows the number counts as a function of luminosity all sources assumed
 18 
to be at 260 pc for three versions of our c2dprocessed swire catalog 1 the fulldepth
catalog 2 the catalog cutoff with c2d sensitivity limits but without added extinction and
3 the catalog corrected for both c2d sensitivity levels and extinction in the serpens cloud
the ratio of the second to the first version serves as a good proxy for a completeness function
since it includes the effects of c2d sensitivity only the lower panel of figure 7 then shows
this ratio as our estimate of the completeness function at the range of luminosities of serpens
ysos observed in figure 6 in figure 6 then we also indicate how the yso luminosity
function might be adjusted to account for this estimate of our survey completeness with an
assumed completeness of 100 at the bright end although substantial adjustments must
be made to the number counts at fainter luminosities the general conclusion remains intact
that the luminosity function peaks around f ew  102 l and drops to both lower and
higher luminosities interestingly if our completeness estimates are valid there may still be
a substantial population of ir excess sources down to luminosities of 103 l as was already
suggested in paper i for example as noted earlier in 32 the young brown dwarf found by
lodieu et al 2002 was not selected as a yso with our criteria because it was faint enough
that its colors placed it into the color and magnitude ranges where extragalactic objects
begin to be prominent
the lowest luminosity sources
there are 37 ysos with total luminosities 1  70m less than 2  102 l  without
any correction for selection effects in either our observations or our selection criteria figure
5 presented in 32 shows the spatial distribution of the low l  2  102 l  and high
l  2  102 l  luminosity ysos in serpens there does not appear to be any significant
difference between these two distributions likewise figure 8 shows the distribution of spectral slopes  for the low luminosity sample relative to two higher luminosity samples and
table 5 lists the average and standard deviation for the spectral slopes for three luminosity samples again there is no obvious difference in the distributions within the statistical
uncertainties of the samples see also discussion in 81 these two facts suggest that
the mechanisms and timing of formation of these two luminosity groups may not be very
different finally figure 9 shows the distribution of extinction for stars nearby each yso
for this analysis we selected all objects within 80 of each yso that were classified as star
by the process described earlier we averaged the fitted extinction values for these stars
the number of stars contributing to the average ranged from 5 to 48 this figure shows that
the lower luminosity ysos have at least as much typical extinction as the higher luminosity ones a fact that would be unlikely if they were misclassified background extragalactic
objects

spatial distribution of star formation
we have already noted in 1 that the serpens starforming region has been identified
as one displaying strong evidence of clustering of the youngest objects we also showed
in figure 5 that the spatial distribution of our high quality yso candidates was highly
clustered a number of authors have attempted to quantify the degree of clustering as
a function of spatial scale using the twopoint correlation function johnstone et al 2000
enoch et al 2006 simon 1995 gomez  lada 1998 bate clarke  mccaughrean 1998
typical results have found a steep slope   d2 on small spatial scales implying a rapid
decrease in clustering on scales out to  10000 au and a substantially shallower slope
  d05 beyond that simon 1995 gomez  lada 1998 figure 10 shows the twopoint
correlation function w for the ysos in our serpens catalog and the sample of objects
classified as extragalactic background sources the serpens samples are divided into two
groups those with spectral slopes  that place them in the class i or flat categories
of greene et al 1994 and those whose slopes imply class ii or iii although our range
of good sampling only extends down to  1000 au equivalent to 4 our data suggest
that the slope for separations under 104 au is of order 05 and drops steeply for the more
embedded and likely youngest class i and flatsed objects beyond 104 au the nominally
more evolved objects in class ii and iii exhibit a lower level of clustering and more uniform
slope in the twopoint correlation function these results are consistent with the appearance
of the source distributions as shown for example in figure 13 of paper i as shown in
figure 10 the slope and magnitude of the correlation for our sample of background extragalactic objects is consistent with that found by for example maddox et al 1990 for a
bright sample of galaxies
the total surface density of young stellar objects in a cluster is an indicator of the
richness of star formation in the cluster allen et al 2006 have computed surface densities
for ysos identified by infrared excess in a sample of 10 young clusters they find typical
peak surface densities of 500  1000 pc2 and average values of order 100  200 pc2  the
peak surface density in cluster a of our ysos identified by ir excess is comparable to these
of order 103 pc2  and a factor of about two less in cluster b the average values are about a
factor of 4 less than the peak in both clusters in particular if we define the cluster edges by
the av  20 contour for comparison with other c2d clusters we obtain the values in table 6
for the number of stars per solid angle and per square parsec we have compared the values
for clusters a and b with those for the rest of the cloud and for the total cloud surveyed
the surface densities of ysos are 10 to 20 times higher in the clusters as in the rest of the
cloud as shown by allen et al 2006 cluster a in serpens is particularly striking in terms
of the contrast between the peak surface density and how quickly within 1 pc the density
drops to very low values  f ew  pc2  in terms of volume density though even cluster
 24 
a has a substantially lower volume density of star formation than such rich clusters as the
trapezium 5000 pc3  or mon r2 9000 pc3  elmegreen et al 2000
figure 5 also shows the spatial distribution of visual extinction in the cloud as derived
from our data these extinction values were derived from the combination of 2mass and
spitzer data for sources that were well fit as reddened stellar photospheres as described in
detail by evans et al 2007 as already noted in our previous studies of the irac data
alone harvey et al 2006 and the mips data alone harvey et al 2007 there is clearly
a striking correspondence between the areas of high extinction and the densest clusters of
ysos particularly those containing class i and class flat sources
disk properties
the properties of the circumstellar dust surrounding young stars can be estimated from
the overall energy distributions of the objects in a variety of ways these properties include
the overall amount of dust the density distribution as a function of radial distance from
the central star the morphology of the circumstellar disks which probably represent the
configuration of many of these circumstellar distributions and to some extent the degree
of evolution of the dust from typical interstellar dust to larger and more chemically evolved
grains likely to represent some stage in the formation of planetary systems we discuss
several approaches to classifying the dust emission in this section beginning with the use of
infrared colors
colorcolor diagrams
numerous authors have shown how combinations of colors in the infrared can provide
significant diagnostic information on the configuration and total amount of circumstellar
material around young stars whitney et al 2003 modelled a wide range of disk and
envelope configurations and computed their appearance in a number of infrared colorcolor
and colormagnitude diagrams particularly relevant to spitzers wavelength range similarly
allen et al 2004 have published irac colorcolor diagrams for another set of models of
objects with circumstellar disks andor envelopes recently robitaille et al 2007 have
computed a very large grid of models to extend the predictions from those of whitney et al
2003 to a much larger parameter space observationally lada et al 2006 have used
irac and mips colors from spitzer observations to classify the optical thickness of disks
around premainsequence stars in ic 348 using the terms anemic disks and thick disks

 26 
to point to objects roughly in the class iii and class ii portions of the ubiquitous class
system lada 1987 greene et al 1994
figure 11 shows three colorcolor diagrams and one colormagnitude diagram for the
235 serpens ysos compared to the density of models from robitaille et al 2007 for a
model cluster at the distance of serpens with brightnesses limited to those appropriate for
our sensitivity levels for two of the diagrams the figure also indicates the approximate
areas where most of the models fall for the three physical stages i ii and iii described
by robitaille et al 2007 that roughly correspond to the observational classes iflat
ii and iii these diagrams display first of all that ysos come in a wide range of colors
and brightnesses large areas of all the diagrams are occupied in a general way we find
objects located in these diagrams where the models of whitney et al 2003 allen et al
2004 and robitaille et al 2007 would predict for premainsequence stars with a range
of evolutionary states as well as general agreement with the locations of young objects found
in ic348 by lada et al 2006 for example consistent with our finding in paper i that the
bulk of the ysos are class ii objects we see a strong concentration in the area around 5880 08 364505 where both allen et al and whitney et al predict such sources
should be located additionally there is structure in the 80 vs 3680 color magnitude
diagram for the distribution of serpens ysos that is also evident in the density of models
of robitaille et al 2007 there are however some interesting differences the stage ii
area from robitaille et al 2007 includes a smaller fraction of our nominal class ii objects
than might be expected there is also a larger number of very red objects in several of the
diagrams than is predicted by the density of models in those areas considering that the
faintest grey levels correspond to a probability equal to 104 of the maximum probability
some of this may be due to effects of reddening but it suggests that the models may also
need some refinement despite their rough agreement with the distribution of observed colors
these data can also be examined to see if there is any correlation between luminosity
and infrared excess eg the 80 vs 3680 color magnitude diagram for example if
higher luminosity young objects had higher levels of multiplicity eg lada 2006 then it is
possible this would be manifested in less massive disks with perhaps large inner holes figure
11 shows no such correlation in fact if anything there appears to be a lack of relatively blue
colors for the brightest objects figure 8 that displays the distribution of spectral slopes and
the accompanying table 5 also show no measurable effect within the scatter for a dependence
of spectral slope on luminosity

spectral energy distribution modeling
in order to go beyond the general conclusions possible from colorcolor and colormagnitude plots we have modelled the large fraction of our sources for which enough data
are available to characterize them as likely starplusdisk objects for this analysis we have
selected all class ii and class iii ysos we expect these objects to have a reddened photosphere plus an infrared excess coming from the circumstellar material most likely in a disk
configuration for completeness we show without modeling the seds of the remaining
ysos figures 12 to 20 show the seds of all class i class flat class ii and class iii
sources the open dots are the observed fluxes and generally include 2mass j h and
k fluxes followed by the four irac fluxes at 36 45 58 and 80 m and by the mips
fluxes at 24 and 70 m when available for the class iis and iiis we characterize the
emission from the disk by comparing the energy distribution with that of a lowmass star
for this we have computed the extinction from the jk colors assuming a k7 underlying
star and then we have dereddened the observed fluxes with the interstellar extinction law
of weingartner  draine 2001 with rv  55 to fit the dereddened seds to a nextgen
hauschildt et al 1999 model of a k7 stellar photosphere in the plots the filled dots are
the dereddened fluxes and the grey line is the photospheric emission from the star each
sed is labeled with the identification number in table 2 the parameters of the model fits
are listed in tables 7 and 8
two main assumptions are used in this approach the first is that the star is a lowmass
star this is reasonable given the fact that the luminosity function discussed earlier peaks at
l  f ew  102 l  in addition oliveira et al 2007 have found that 30 of the 39 ysos
they observed out of our sample had spectral types of k or m the second assumption is
that there is no substantial excess in the near infrared bands where we consider all flux to
be photospheric this assumption is obviously only correct for those stars in the sample
without strong ongoing disk accretion cieza et al 2005 have demonstrated that nearir excesses as short as jband can be seen in some actively accreting t tauri stars and
they give an observed range of jband excesses of 01  10 mag for their sample of sources
in taurus the effect of this excess on the computed parameters implies that the stellar
luminosities for the class ii objects are upper limits and therefore the disk luminosities are
lower limits more specifically neglecting an excess flux in the jband of 11 magnitude in
one object would reduce its ldisklstar ratio by 12  and modify the disk emission sed
diminishing its excess mostly at the shorter wavelengths that would only happen however
to the fraction of objects that are strongly accreting oliveira et al 2007 found strong
h emission indicative of active accretion in only 12 out of 39 serpens ysos observed we
ran a test removing these objects from the final statistics and this did not change the overall
picture
 29 
the dashed line in the sed plots is the median sed of t tauri stars in taurus
hartmann et al 2005 normalized to the dereddened jband flux of our seds it represents the typical sed of an optically thick accreting disk around a classical t tauri star
and is shown here to allow a qualitative estimation of the presence of disk evolution and
dust settling based on similarity to this median sed we define as t an sed which is
identical to it within the errors as l an sed with lower fluxes at some wavelengths and h
an object with larger fluxes than the median t tauri sed we have labeled the objects with
these codes and use them to interpret the state of disk evolution we interpret the ltype
objects as thin disks which could perhaps result from dust grain growth and settling to the
midplane similar to the anemic disks in lada et al 2006 objects 3 and 5 are good
examples of ttype objects numbers 11 and 18 are ltype stars and number 8 is a htype
object also we have labeled as lu objects that have photospheric fluxes up to around 8m
but then a sudden jump at longer wavelengths to the levels of a ttauri disk we believe
these objects may have large inner holes in their still optically thick disks number 19 is one
example of these
out of the 171 sources in the sample that are class ii or class iii 44 26  are ttype so equivalent to a classical t tauri star 125 73  are ltype so show evidence
of some degree of disk evolution and finally 2 1  show larger fluxes than the median
sed of taurus this latter category is generally the result of imperfect fitting to the stellar
photosphere due to lack of nearir data and will not be considered further
the numbers above indicate that there are many young stars in serpens with disks
that are virtually identical to those in taurus this points to a very similar origin of the
disk structure across star forming regions within the uncertainties in our modeling process
discussed above however we see a majority of ltype objects 73  in serpens this
suggests that the disks in serpens may be generally more evolved or flattened that those in
taurus also interestingly the number of lutype objects or those with large inner holes
amounts to 14 11  of the ltype objects and only 6  of the total yso sample including
class i and f sources this very small incidence indicates that either the process producing
these large inner holes is a very fast transitional phase in the disk evolution or that only
a small number of systems undergo that phase we examine this issue below in order to
put firmer limits on these numbers it will be necessary to get optical spectral types for the
stars and optical photometry in order to produce more accurate photospherediskextinction
models
the seds also allow a rough study of the disk properties across the surveyed area for
this purpose we integrated the stellar and total fluxes to calculate a ratio between the stellar
and the disk fluxes the corresponding distribution is shown in figure 21 again the solid
 30 
line is the whole class ii and iii sample and the dotted line corresponds to the ttype seds
to guide the eye we have marked the approximate regimes of these ratios measured in debris
disks ldisklstar  002 passive disks 002  ldisklstar  008 kenyon  hartmann
1987 and accretion disks ldisklstar  01 respectively the figure illustrates well the
large variety of disk evolutionary phases that we observe in serpens as well as the large
majority of massive accreting disks in the region
in order to study the disk evolution in the cloud there is need for a better characterization of the full sample with optical spectroscopy that work is in progress and will
be published elsewhere here we explore further the shapes of the seds to test another
evolutionary diagnostic of the disk status we have found that the more commonly used
evolutionary metrics eg spectral slope  bolometric temperature tbol  or the class system discussed earlier do not seem to capture the full range of phenomena apparent in our
distribution of seds for young stellar objects we therefore use excess and excess  two
new secondorder sed parameters presented in cieza et al 2006 that will be discussed in
more detail in a separate paper in short excess is the last wavelength where the observed
flux is photospheric and excess is the slope computed as dlogf dlog starting from
excess  the first parameter gives us an indication of how close the circumstellar matter is
to the central object and the latter one a measure of how optically thick it is given the
assumptions above for the fitting process our values are upper limits for excess  and correspondingly lower limits for excess for the class iis we assume good stellar fits for the class
iii sources
figure 22 shows both values for a sample of classical t tauri stars ctts from
cieza et al 2005 weaklined t tauri stars wtts from cieza et al 2006 debris disks
from chen et al 2005 and our sample of ysos in serpens cieza et al 2006 found that
excess is well correlated with evolutionary phase and also as seen in figure 22 that  is
observed over wider ranges for later evolutionary phases this suggests a large range of
possible evolutionary paths for circumstellar disks objects could either evolve to the lower
right side of the diagram which could be interpreted as a sign of dust grain growth and
settling to the disk midplane they could also move to the right and up from creation of a
large inner hole in their disks while retaining a massive outer disk and also as this diagram
shows all intermediate pathways in between both extremes

the coldest objects
table 9 lists the 15 ysos that display the coldest energy distributions these are the
objects whose ratio of f70 f24  8 six of these are in cluster a the core and four in
cluster b two are in a small grouping about 02 northeast of cluster b and the remaining
three appear as isolated cold objects though in areas with other moderately red objects
all of these except for two of the isolated cold objects ids 105 and 148 are associated
with dense clumps of millimeter emission as seen by enoch et al 2007 as discussed in the
following section two in cluster a and one in cluster b are associated with high velocity
outflows as has been noted already by padgett et al 2004 and rebull et al 2006 it is
striking how many of these coldest most obscured ysos are located in compact clusters
together with objects that are substantially more evolved in the nominal system of classes
eg class ii and iii
outflow sources
a number of recent spitzer studies have found that highvelocity shocked outflows from
young stars are visible in irac images typically strongest at 45m noreigacrespo et al
2004 we have examined our images for such outflows as well as for correspondance with the
lists of published hh objects in the region ziener  eisloffel 1999 table 10 summarizes
the results of this effort two strong obvious jetlike features are seen in cluster a and
one in cluster b in addition as shown in table 10 we find small extended features at the
positions of most of the known hh objects in serpens that were within our covered area the
two jets in cluster a appear to originate from two of the most deeply embedded objects in
this cluster that are associated with the submm sources smm1 and smm5 testi  sargent
1998 both these outflows are aligned roughly in the nwse direction and are visible on
both sides of the central 24m likely exciting sources in cluster b there is one obvious
jetlike feature extending mostly south of yso  75 there is also probably faint emission
visible 30 to the north of the embedded source as well harvey et al 2007 discuss the
cluster b jet and several nearby spitzer sources in more detail figures 23 and 24 show
3color images of clusters a and b with the color tables chosen to make these jets most
visible in addition to the optical hh objects in the serpens clouds there are a number
of highvelocity molecular outflows that have been mapped in cluster a davis et al 1999
these maps present a confusing picture of outflows and because of the relatively larger
beamwidth of the mm observations and close packing of infrared sources in this cluster it is

very difficult to associate the radio outflows unequivocally with particular spitzer sources
other objects
horrobin casali  eiroa 1997 reported on the disappearance of a bright nearinfrared
source in serpens from the earlier study of ec92 table 4 shows that we also see no obvious
source at the position of ec9281 other than a low sn singleband detection of a source
moderately distant from the nominal position interestingly though this area marked in
figure 23 appears to contain several small knots of emission that may represent shocked gas
for example there are two small knots visible in our 45 and 80m images that have no 36
or 24m counterparts and therefore not classified as ysos these two knots at ra  18
29 567 dec  01 13 19 j2000 are only 12 south of the position of ec9281 therefore
it is possible that the original source was a small clump of excited gas that has moved or
dissipated since the original study of ec92 and perhaps these spitzer knots are related to
that earlier source in some way
overall results on star formation
the overall picture of star formation in serpens is summarized in table 6 as noted
earlier the surface density of young stars is much higher in clusters a and b than in the
rest of the cloud by factors of 10 to 20 on the other hand the majority of ysos 74
are not in the clusters but in the rest of the cloud if we assume a mean mass for the stars
of 05 m and assume that star formation has been proceeding for 2 myr we can estimate
the rate at which the clusters and the whole cloud are converting mass into stars these
values are also given in table 6 the serpens cloud that we have surveyed is turning nearly
60 m into stars per myr the rates for the clusters are probably underestimates because
they are probably younger than 2 myr a typical duration for the class ii sed of course a
significant number of the older objects outside the clusters may have in fact formed in these
or earlier clusters a 1 km s1 random motion of a yso relative to its birthplace results in
1 pc of movement in 106 yr or nearly 14 degree at the distance of serpens
the distribution of ysos over class supports the younger age for the clusters than for
star formation in general in serpens while the ratio of the number of class i and flat
spectrum sources to the number of class ii and class iii sources is 037 for the whole cloud
similar to other clouds surveyed by c2d evans et al in prep the same ratio is 30 for
cluster a and 14 for cluster b these high ratios strongly suggest that cluster a is too

young for most ysos to have reached the class ii stage in contrast this ratio is 014 for
the rest of the cloud outside the clusters which is strongly dominated by class ii and class
iii objects
summary
we have identified a highconfidence set of 235 ysos in serpens by a set of criteria
based on comparison with data from the spitzer swire legacy program this is a large
enough number that we can draw important statistical conclusions about various properties
of this set if we assume that the class system of lada 1987 and greene et al 1994
represents an evolutionary sequence then the relative numbers of ysos found in each of
the first three classes i flat and ii suggests that the class ii phase lasts substantially
longer than the combined total of the class i and flat phases based on the overall cloud
statistics the clusters however show more ysos in the class i and flat phases than
in class ii indicating that they are very young the majority of ysos mostly class ii
are outside the clusters and probably represent a somewhat older epoch of star formation
compared to the intense star formation now going on in the clusters the surface density of
ysos in the clusters exceeds that of the rest of the cloud by factors of 10 to 20 table 6
the luminosity function for the serpens ysos is populated down to luminosities of
3  103 l  it may extend even lower but our ability to distinguish low luminosity ysos
is severely restricted by the large population of background galaxies at these flux levels the
lower luminosity ysos l  2  102 l  exhibit a similar spatial distribution and sed
slope distribution to those of their higher luminosity counterparts this is consistent with
the conclusion that they have formed in similar ways

leiden is supported by a nwo spinoza grant and a nova grant bm thanks the fundacin
ramn areces for financial support this publication makes use of data products from the
two micron all sky survey which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts
and the infrared processing and analysis centercalifornia institute of technology funded
by nasa and the national science foundation we also acknowledge extensive use of the

yso selection process
the procedure we use to select ysos and deselect extragalactic background sources
is based on the colormagnitude diagrams shown in figure 3 we construct probability
functions for each of the three colormagnitude diagrams based on where a source falls relative
to the black dashed lines in each diagram these three probabilities are multiplied and then
additional adjustments to the probability are made based on several additional properties
of the source fluxes and whether or not they were found to be larger than pointlike in the
source extraction process
in the 45 vs 4580 color magnitude diagram the probability function is
pi2i4  07  1  exp12  05m45  d3 
where
d  1305 for m45  m80  14
 145 for 05  m45  m80  14 and object was found to be pointlike in all irac bands
 125 for 05  m45  m80  14 and object was found to be extended at 36 or 45m
 145 for m45  m80  05
in the 24 vs 8024 color magnitude diagram the probability function is
pi4m1  expm8  m24  35172  m24  922 
and pi4m1 is set to a minimum of 01
in the 24 vs 4580 color magnitude diagram the probability function is
pi24m1  07  1  expm45  m8  08  10  m24 18
and pi24m1 is set to a minimum of 0
the combined probability is then
ptot  pi2i4  pi4m1  pi24m1
additionally the following factors influence modifications to ptot 
ptot
 k  45
ptot  2 for sources that are extended at 36 or 45m
ptot  01 where 24  10 ie assumed galc
ptot  01 where f70  400 mjy and source detected at 588 and 24m
 49 
based on the distribution of ptot shown in figure 4 we chose the dividing line between
ysos and extragalactic sources to be log10 ptot   147
