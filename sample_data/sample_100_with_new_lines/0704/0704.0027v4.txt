we describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the inplane optical phonon at the point
in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the interlandaulevel transitions in
this material the effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode associated with the gband
in graphene raman spectrum is in resonance with interlandaulevel transitions 0   1 and
 1  0 at a magnetic field b0  30t it can be used to measure the strength of the electronphonon coupling directly and its fillingfactor dependence can be used experimentally to detect
circularly polarized lattice vibrations

in metals and semiconductors the spectra of phonons
are renormalized by their interaction with electrons
some of the best known examples include the kohn
anomaly 1 in the phonon dispersion which originates
from the excitationdeexcitation of electrons across the
fermi level upon the propagation of a phonon through
the bulk of a metal and a shift in the longitudinal optical phonon frequency in heavily doped polar semiconductors 2 however despite the transparency of theoretical
models the observation of such effects is often obscured
by the difficulty to change the electron density in a material whereas in semiconductor structures containing twodimensional 2d electrons the density of which can be
varied the influence of the latter on the phonon modes is
weak due to a negligibly small volume fraction occupied
by the electron gas in this context a unique opportunity
arises in graphenebased fieldeffect transistors 3 where
the density of carriers in an atomically thin film monolayer 4 5 6 or a bilayer 7 can be continuously varied
from 1013 cm2 ptype to 1013 cm2 ntype several raman experiments have already been reported 8 9 where
the variation of carrier density in graphene changes the
optical phonon frequency in agreement with theoretical
expectations 10 11 12
when graphene is exposed to a quantizing magnetic
field its electronic spectrum quenches into discrete landau levels lls 13 then the optical phonon energy in
graphene may coincide with the energy of one of the interll transitions a condition known as magnetophonon
resonance 14 15 recently ando has suggested 16
that in undoped graphene the magnetophonon resonance
enhances the effect of the electronphonon coupling on
a spectrum of the inplane optical phonons  the e2g
modes attributed to the gband in the raman spectra
in refs 8 9 17 18 19 in this paper we investigate
a rich structure of the anticrossing experienced by such
lattice modes when a magnetic field makes their energy
equal to the energy of one of the valleyantisymmetric
interband magnetoexcitons 20 most saliently the difference between circular polarization of various interll
transitions 21 22 makes the magnetophonon resonance
distinguishable for lattice vibrations of different circular
polarization which makes the number of split lines in
the fine structure acquired by a phonon and the value of
splitting dependent on the electronic filling factor 
the inplane optical phonons in graphene relative displacement u  ux  uy  of sublattices a and b have

a generic form of the phononmagnetoexciton anti

n in undoped graphene ie   0 is illustrated in fig 2a
such an anticrossing and mode mixing is simlar to that
described by ando 16 it can manifest itself in raman
spectroscopy in a fine structure acquired by the gline
earlier attributed 8 9 17 18 19 to the inplane optical phonon at the point e2g mode at the magnetophonon resonance conditions the effect is the strongest
for the resonance n0  0 between the phonon and
magnetoexciton based upon  1  0 and 0   1 transitions when approaching the resonance by sweeping a
magnetic field the phonon line becomes accompanied by
a weak satellite moving towards it and increasing its intensity exactly at the magnetophonon resonance where
both the upper mode a

consist of an equalweight superposition of the phonon
and the resonant exciton with cos   sin   1 2

then coupling and therefore splitting of the  and polarized modes coincide g  g  thus giving rise to a
pair of peaks at the energies    0  g sketched
in part i in fig 2b for the magnetic field value
b0  30 t and g  028ev 12 we estimate this splitting

fig 2 a coupled phonon and magnetoexcitons as a function
of the magnetic field energies are in units of the bare phonon
energy  dashed lines indicate the uncoupled valleysymmetric
modes with ga  0 b mode splitting as a function of the filling
factor as may be seen in raman spectroscopy with the resonance
condition n0  0  for   0 in i 0    2 in ii and
  2 in iii the absolute intensity of the modes is in arbitrary
units but the height and the width reflect the expected relative
intensities c mode splitting for n  0 as a function of the filling
factor  d same as in c for n  1
is because a higher lower occupancy of the n  0 ll
reduces enhances the oscillator strength of the polarized transition due to the availability of filled and empty
states in the involved lls whereas the same change in
the electron density has the opposite effect on g  as
a result for an arbitrary filling factor 2    2
we predict that in the vicinity of magnetophonon resonance the phonon mode and therefore gband in raman spectrum should split into four lines part ii in fig
2b with 
  g for polarized and     g
for polarized phonons in the quantum hall state at
filling factor   2 the transition  1  0 becomes successively blocked and no longer affects the frequency of a
polarized phonon whereas the transition 0   1 acquires the maximum strength thus increasing the coupling parameter g  this leads to the magnetophonon
resonance fine structure consisting of three peaks with
an even larger splitting between side lines as sketched in
part iii in fig 2b interestingly this may enable one
to directly observe lattice modes with a definite circular polarization a further increase of the electron filling
factor reduces the sideline splitting which should completely disappear at   6 after the transition 0   1
becomes blocked by a complete filling of the  1 ll fig
2c the same arguments hold for pdoped graphene
though in this case the roles of  and polarized modes
are interchanged
magnetophonon resonances with other possible interll transitions n 
 1 occur at much lower magnetic
fields bn  b0  n n  12  for example a resonant
phonon coupling with the magnetoexciton aas 1 is expected to occur at b1  5t its description remains qualitatively similar though for n  0 the mode splitting is
less pronounced because of the bfield dependence of the
coupling constants in eq 3 one finds that g  g
for   22n  1 at   22n  1 filling of the nth ll starts changing which reduces splitting of the polarized mode and gives rise to the fourpeak structure
at   22n  1 where the  n ll becomes completely
filled splitting of the polarized phonon vanishes thus
resulting in the threepeak fine structure part iii in fig
2b that would persist up to   22n  3 this is
because the splitting of the polarized modes remains
constant up to the filling factor   22n  1 above
which population of the  n  1 ll starts to suppress
the value of g  until the latter vanishes at   22n  3
see fig 2d
in conclusion we have predicted a fillingfactor dependence of the fine structure acquired by the inplane e2g 
optical phonon in graphene when the latter is in resonance with one of the interll transitions in this material the effect is expected to be most pronounced
when the phonon is resonantly coupled to the 0   1
and  1  0 transitions which requires a magnetic field
b0  30t the predicted mode splitting may be used
to measure directly the strength of the electronphonon
coupling and also to distinguish between circularly leftand right hand polarized lattice modes

erratum
in the previous version v3 of this letter we have
underestimated the numerical value of the mode splitting of the magnetophonon resonance see paragraph after eq 5 by a factor of 2 the text above takes into
account the corrected parameters this
 is a result of
two mistakes first there is a factor of 2 which finds
its origin in an erroneous normalization of the circular
polarized phonons
 they should indeed be defined as
u  ux  iuy  2 and u  ux  iuy  2 and not
as u  ux  iuy and u  ux  iuy as incorrectly
assumed on page 1 second column such that the associated phonon operators ba obey the usual commutation
relations ba
 ba   aa  with a    this yields
a factor of 2 in the definition of the effective coupling
constants eq 3 which read in the corrected form
g n  g 1  n0  n1  n 
g n  g 1  n0  n  n1 
as a consequence the zerofield dimensionless coupling
constant  defined in the first column page 3 of our
letter
 is multiplied by a factor of 2 and becomes  
2 3gt2 
second we also underestimated the numerical value of
the
 electronphonon coupling constant g by a factor of
2 indeed g defined in our work see eq 1 is related
to hg2 ip
f  00405 ev computed by piscanec
p et al 2
as g  2hg if  028 ev and not as g  hg2 if  02
ev as incorrectly assumed in our letter in addition
there is a substantial uncertainty in the precise value of
the constant g in a tightbinding model the latter may
be related to the derivative of the hopping amplitude t
as a function ofthe carboncarbon distance a as g 
dtda  32 m  1 harrisons phenomenological
law t  1a2 then implies that g  026 ev experiments
in graphene 3 and 4 in zero magnetic field give for the
dimensionless coupling constant  the values 44  103
and 53103 respectively this determines g in between
03 ev and 036 ev where we take into account that the
value of t lies between 27 and 3 ev in the end we have
to take g in the range between 026 and 036 ev instead
of g  02 ev and therefore the dimensionless coupling
constant becomes   28 to 53  103 instead of  
103 
as a result of the two factors of 2 the numerical
estimate for the mode splitting 2ga at   0 and b  30
t at the discussed resonance  1  0 and 0   1 see
second column of page 3 becomes 2ga  15 mev  120
cm1  for g  026 ev and 2ga  20 mev  160 cm1 
for g  036 ev instead of 2ga  8 mev the effect
is therefore twice larger than initially predicted the
conclusions of our work remain unaltered
we would like to thank c faugeras and m potemski
for having drawn our attention on the underestimated
value of the mode splitting see also their recent preprint
