we use a hybrid k  p theory  tight binding hkptb model to describe interlayer coupling simultaneously
in both bernal and twisted graphene structures for bernalaligned interfaces hkptb is parametrized using
the full slonczewskiweissmcclure swmcc hamiltonian of graphite1  which is then used to refine the commonly used minimal model for twisted interfaces23  by deriving additional terms that reflect all details of the
full swmcc model of graphite we find that these terms introduce some electronhole asymmetry in the band
structure of twisted bilayers but in twistronic multilayer graphene they produce only a subtle change of moir
miniband spectra confirming the broad applicability of the minimal model for implementing the twisted interface coupling in such systems
introduction
the discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer
graphene tblg48 has renewed interest in multilayer
graphene with one918 or multiple2022 twisted interfaces exploring topological and correlateddriven phases918  various
theoretical approaches including continuum model232328 
tightbinding2733 and density functional theory dft3337 
have established a link between these phenomena and the
existence of nearly flat bands for a twist angle   11 
known as magic angle38  these nearly dispersionless bands
were theoretically predicted for twisted bilayers3 and recently
observed with arpes39  a detailed analysis in twistronic
graphene structures involving fewlayer graphene flakes requires refinement of theoretical models for their dispersion in
particular one may wonder how well the use of the full set of
interlayer couplings for bilayers or trilayers with bernal stacking which affect the miniband dispersion at low energies
comply with the minimal interlayer coupling hamiltonian describing the hybridization across the twisted interface23 
to answer the above question we develop a hybrid k  p
tightbinding hkptb model and relate its parameters to
the slonczewskiweissmcclure swmcc hamiltonian for
graphite4042  the conventional minimal model23 is based
on the twocentre approximation2324 tca which constructs
the interlayer coupling integral from sitetosite hopping in
hkptb approach we express bloch states as planewaves localised in the vertical direction with the interlayer coupling
in zdirection implemented using the framework of tightbinding model we derive additional terms in the twistronic
graphene hamiltonian which account for linearinmomentum
corrections proportional to v3 and v4 swmcc parameters
stackingdependent onsite potentials and nextnearest layer
hoppings 2 and 5 
the analysis below is structured as follows in sec ii we
describe the approach set notations and then apply it to bilayer graphene with an arbitrary lateral offset between the lattices of the two layers which enables us to fully parametrise
our calculations in sec iii we use that parametrization to
derive the hamiltonian for tblg highlighting corrections be
yond the minimal model in sec iv we compute the band
structure of tblg and discuss the influence of the correcting
terms and in sec v we analyse minibands in twisted trilayer

here l  t b labels the top and bottom layers respectively ew
is the work function of the state lk in graphene and vl r z
is the potential created by carbon atoms in the layer l for a
bilayer this transforms into singleparticle schrdinger equation

where c is a column matrix made of coefficients clk with different quasimomentum and layer index i is the unit matrix
and s contains the overlap integrals between pairs of eigenstates in the upper and lower layers

the following two subsections are devoted to training the
hkptb approach with two systems monolayer graphene and
bernal bilayer graphene using the known lowenergy band
structure we quantify the input parameters in the hkptb description and use them to describe the coupling across the
twisted interface
monolayer kp basis
a monolayer graphene has carbon atoms sitting at the sites
of a planar hexagonal lattice which divides into two bravais
sublattices with a lattice constant of a see fig 1a around
the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone we use bloch

n is the number of unit cells and
k j  kcos2 j3  sin2 j3
with j  0 1 2   1 being the valley index and k  43a
in eq 8 we also introduce orbital functions   near the
fermi level the energy bands primarily stem from the outofplane pz orbitals of the carbon atoms affected by a trigonal
directionality towards the closest neighbours on the honeycomb lattice this is implemented in our theory by mixing the
swave symmetric pz orbital with a small f wave symmetric
component

we now expand the bloch functions in eq 8 around k0

where a   b   and r  x y  rcos  sin  is the

notice that the functions f and f the fourier transform of
f and f  with respect to r respectively are expressed as a
function of the modulus square of the wavevector this allows
us to ease the functional form for the expansion around k j

where we used expansion in ak fi 1 and the prime symbol on
f and f represents the derivative with respect to k 2 
the orbital wave functions belonging to the same sublattice are orthonormalized ie h0

however the overlap between orbital wave functions of different sublattices does not vanish to the first order in k it is
given by

with   k x  iky  to ease the notation here and subsequently we omit the valley index  in the subscript of bloch
functions as it is a good quantum number terms proportional
to  have been left out since the orbital mixing is assumed
small in the hilbert space spanned by 0
 we introduce the
overlap matrix analogue to that in eq 4

where v  ew s0  is the dirac velocity here we neglect
intrasublattice hopping strictly speaking due to the nonvanishing overlap matrix s the band structure is not given by
the eigenvalues of the matrix 0  but by those of  however
in this case the anticommutator in eq 7 contributes with a

interlayer coupling across one twisted
interface
in twisted bilayer graphene the crystallographic axes of the
two constituting layers form an angle  for small angles the
hamiltonian of one electron in such system can be constructed
with the same methodology as in the previous section but using a spatially modulated toplayer shift r0     r where 
is the unit vector in the vertical direction as a result the interlayer hybridisation acquires periodic coordinate dependence
for the minimal model which corresponds to taking into account only the first term in each matrix element in eq 25

compare it with the spectra computed using the minimal

at this angle the first valence and conduction bands span just
a few mev which results in a strong enhancement of the density of states the additional terms introduced by the full set

qualitatively this picture yet they push other dispersive bands

bernal bilayer as compared to twisted bilayers for trilayer
graphene the swmcc hamiltonian contains an additional
2  2 blocks that accounts for tunnelling between the topmost layer and the bottommost layer404252  in case of bernal
graphite such couplings are accounted for by 5 and 2 hopping parameters which distinguish the nextnearest layer coupling for electrons on the lower graphene sites that appear under the carbon dimer sites with 5  or the empty center of
hexagon nondimer sites with 2  in the layer above the
above mentioned difference reflects on the influence of the
middle layer on the electron tunnelling between the outer layers in eg bernal trilayer for a twistronic trilayer we also
account for such difference by distinguishing the couplings
between a and b sublattice bloch states in the bottom layer of
bernal bilayer with the plane wave states in the top twisted
layer which results in the overall trilayer hamltonian

while the numerical values of these two parameters for
twistronic trilayers as well as the variations of onsite energies for the dimer and nondimer sites may differ from those
in bulk graphite of bernal bilayers for example due to a small
variation of mean interlayer spacing we expect their relative
size to be similar hence we use the values from bernal
graphite literature to assess the influence of these additional
couplings on the miniband spectra of twistronic trilayers
the computed spectra of moir minibands are shown in the
leftmost panel of figs 4 a and b for   2 and   11 
respectively in comparison with the minibands computed using the minimal model the comparison of the two spectra
shows that the influence of the additional terms accounting
for the full set of swmcc couplings is weak suggesting that
minimal model for the twisted interface coupling can be safely
combined with the most detailed description of the bernalstacking part of twistronic fewlayer graphene for the analysis
of flat bands in such systems101153 
summary
in this report we construct the interacting hamiltonian between two twisted graphene layers first decomposing bloch
functions into planewaves confined in the perpendicular direction and then evaluating explicitly the matrix elements of
singleparticle hamiltonian we find that the zerothorder expansion of the resulting coupling yields the wellknown continuum model used in the literature in turn we find a contribution linear in momentum which unlike existing models
recovers the skew coupling for the limiting case of   0 and
bears new features to the band structure such as the electronhole asymmetry and the formation of gaps for structures that
combine both twisted and aligned interfaces the first order
contribution represents a small correction this suggests that
the simultaneous use of the minimal model for twisted interfaces and the full swmcc description in the bernal fewlayer
part of multilayer twistronic structure provides a reliable description of the band structure
