abstract
we present a new groundbased optical transmission spectrum of the ultrahot jupiter wasp103b
teq  2484 k our transmission spectrum is the result of combining five new transits from the
access survey and two new transits from the lrgbeasts survey with a reanalysis of three archival
geminigmos transits and one vltfors2 transit our combined 11transit transmission spectrum
covers a wavelength range of 39009450  with a median uncertainty in the transit depth of 148 partspermillion which is less than one atmospheric scale height of the planet in our retrieval analysis
of wasp103bs combined optical and infrared transmission spectrum we find strong evidence for
unocculted bright regions 43 and weak evidence for h2 o 19 hcn 17 and tio 21
which could be responsible for wasp103bs observed temperature inversion our optical transmission
spectrum shows significant structure that is in excellent agreement with the extensively studied ultrahot
jupiter wasp121b for which the presence of vo has been inferred for wasp103b we find that
vo can only provide a reasonable fit to the data if its abundance is implausibly high and we do not
account for stellar activity our results highlight the precision that can be achieved by groundbased
observations and the impacts that stellar activity from ftype stars can have on the interpretation of
exoplanet transmission spectra

1 introduction
ultrahot jupiters teq  2000 k are becoming increasingly targeted for studies of their atmospheres eg
haynes et al 2015 evans et al 2016 2017 2018 nugroho et al 2017 sheppard et al 2017 arcangeli et al
2018 hoeijmakers et al 2018 lothringer et al 2018
lothringer  barman 2019 hoeijmakers et al 2019 fu
et al 2020 gibson et al 2020 changeat  edwards
2021 in part this is due to their high temperatures
leading to large atmospheric scale heights and relatively
cloudfree atmospheres as condensation is suppressed
this latter point makes hotter planets particularly favorable for atmospheric studies as the majority of studied
exoplanets show muted features due to clouds and hazes
eg sing et al 2016 wakeford et al 2019 however
the amplitudes of water features decrease as equilibrium
temperatures rise above 2500 k due to the thermal dissociation of water and impact of h opacity eg arcangeli et al 2018 lothringer et al 2018 parmentier
et al 2018 gao et al 2020
recently several ultrahot jupiters have revealed a
plethora of atomic absorption in highresolution transmission spectra eg hoeijmakers et al 2018 2019
2020 sing et al 2019 yan et al 2019 cabot et al
2020 ehrenreich et al 2020 gibson et al 2020 nugroho et al 2020 borsa et al 2021 yan et al 2021
these planets also show the strongest evidence for temperature inversions among exoplanet atmospheres such
as in wasp121b evans et al 2017 mikalevans et al
2020 wasp33b haynes et al 2015 nugroho et al
2017 wasp18b sheppard et al 2017 arcangeli et al
2018 wasp76b fu et al 2020 and wasp103b
kreidberg et al 2018 however of these exoplanets
only wasp121b wasp33b and wasp76b show evidence for tio or vo albeit in some cases this evidence
is disputed eg merritt et al 2020 borsa et al 2021
which have long been predicted to be responsible for hot
jupiter temperature inversions eg hubeny et al 2003
fortney et al 2008 spiegel et al 2009
in this paper we present a new optical transmission
spectrum of wasp103b that reveals tentative evidence
21 for tio in its atmosphere which may be responsible for the planets observed temperature inversion kreidberg et al 2018

wasp103b discovered by gillon et al 2014 is
an ultrahot jupiter m  151  011 mj  r 
16230051
0053 rj  teq  2484  67 k delrez et al 2018
its high equilibrium temperature owes to the fact that it
orbits its f8v host star in 093 days gillon et al 2014
delrez et al 2018 because of its very high temperature wasp103b has a large scale height of 600 km
which contributes 152 ppm to the transit depth assuming the parameters from delrez et al 2018 and a mean
molecular weight of 23 amu
wasp103b has been the target of atmospheric studies on several previous occasions southworth et al
2015 presented a transmission photometry study of the
planet using transits acquired in seven different photometric bands from g 0 to z 0  they found a steep slope
gradient   190  15 in their transmission spectrum rising towards their bluest wavelength bins and
extending over 10 atmospheric scale heights southworth et al 2015 concluded unocculted starspots were
unlikely to cause the observed slope due to the lack of the
host stars photometric variability gillon et al 2014
and the temperature of the host teff  6110 k which
they suggested was too hot for significant spotinduced
activity
southworth  evans 2016 subsequently revisited
the earlier transmission spectrum of southworth et al
2015 after new highresolution photometry revealed
the presence of a blended background star wllert 
brandner 2015 ngo et al 2016 while correcting for
this third light source did reduce the gradient of the
slope in their data to   112  09 it remained significantly steeper than expected for rayleigh scattering
  4
turner et al 2017 extended the observations of
wasp103b to the nearuv with groundbased observations of the planet in the u band the transit depth
they derived was consistent with the bluest bin of southworth  evans 2016 indicating that the optical slope
may not continue to rise into the nearuv
the presence of a slope in the optical transmission
spectrum of wasp103b was challenged by lendl et al
2017 who presented results using the multiobject
spectrograph gmos on the gemininorth telescope
they found no signs of the strong slope reported by
southworth et al 2015 and instead found the atmosphere to be cloudfree with absorption from sodium and
potassium
following these studies in transmission cartier et al
2017 presented hstwfc3 secondary eclipse observations of wasp103b their nearir emission spectrum was featureless to a precision of 175 ppm finding
an access  lrgbeasts transmission spectrum of wasp103b
the planets atmosphere to be approximately isothermal
over the wavelength range probed 1117 m however they also noted that a thermally inverted atmosphere and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with
co  1 were consistent with their data
delrez et al 2018 presented 16 new groundbased
secondary eclipses of wasp103b in the z 0 and ks
bands and combined these with the hstwfc3 results of cartier et al 2017 they found the z 0 and
hstwfc3 observations to be best fitted with a vertically isothermal atmosphere however they detected
an anomalously deep eclipse in the ks band which suggested the presence of a thermal inversion but they
noted that the ks band is not expected to contain
strong spectral features and so could not explain this
feature they additionally reanalyzed the transit data
from southworth et al 2015 finding consistent results
indicating that the slope seen by southworth  evans
2016 is inherent to the data and not dependent on the
data reduction method
kreidberg et al 2018 presented phase curve measurements of wasp103b observed with hstwfc3
and spitzerirac they found the phase curves to show
large amplitudes and negligible hot spot offsets indicating poor circulation of heat from the day side to the
nightside of the planet in the wfc3irg141 bandpass 1117 m kreidberg et al 2018 found the
phaseresolved spectra to be consistent with blackbodies with brightness temperatures ranging from 1880 k on
the nightside to 2930 k on the day side however they
observed a significantly higher brightness temperature
in the spitzer 45 m band that is likely due to co in
emission indicating a thermal inversion in the planets
atmosphere as a result kreidberg et al 2018 speculated that either tio vo or feh may be present in the
planets upper atmosphere by running atmospheric retrievals on their infrared data they found wasp103b
to have a 2329
13  solar metallicity atmosphere but did
not detect water which they attributed to its dissociation
most recently wilson et al 2020 presented new
vltfors2 data of wasp103b covering the wavelength region of 40006000  by running retrievals on
the combined vlt gemini and hst transmission spectrum they found the optical transmission spectrum to
be featureless with evidence for na at 2 but they did
detect h2 o at 4 confidence
given the contrasting results regarding wasp103bs
optical transmission spectrum and the potential for a
previously undetected species at optical wavelengths
giving rise to the planets temperature inversion we
present here a new optical transmission spectrum of
wasp103b our new transmission spectrum combines five transits from the access survey on magellanbaade jordn et al 2013 rackham et al 2017
bixel et al 2019 espinoza et al 2019 mcgruder et al
2020 weaver et al 2020 2021 and two transits from
the lrgbeasts survey on the william herschel telescope kirk et al 2017 2018 2019 louden et al 2017
alderson et al 2020 we combine these new transit
observations with a reanalysis of the published geminigmos data lendl et al 2017 and vltfors2
data wilson et al 2020 and include these with
the published hstwfc3irg141 and spitzerirac
transmission spectrum of kreidberg et al 2018 for our
retrieval analyses
this paper is organized as follows we describe the
observations in section 2 the data reduction in section 3 our light curve fitting procedures in section 4
and our corrections for thirdlight and nightside contamination in section 5 we present the transmission
spectrum of wasp103b in section 6 and interpret it
using the petitradtrans and poseidon retrieval
frameworks in section 7 and section 8 respectively we
discuss our results in section 9 and finally summarize
our conclusions in section 10
2 observations
21 access
we observed five transits of wasp103b in the 2015
2017 observing seasons with the inamorimagellan areal
camera and spectrograph imacs dressler et al
2011 on the 65m magellan baade telescope at las
campanas observatory our observation design largely
mirrored that of previous access observations jordn
et al 2013 rackham et al 2017 bixel et al 2019 espinoza et al 2019 mcgruder et al 2020 weaver et al
2020 2021 for each observation we used the f 2 camera of imacs in multiobject spectroscopy mode with
22 binning 04 00 pixel1  conditions were clear for all
observations except the first two nights access n1
and access n2 for which passing clouds impacted
the data quality during the 26hr transit for 1 hr and
025 hr respectively further details of these observations are provided in table 1
we used a custom multislit mask with large slits 10 00
wide by 21 00 long for collecting spectra of wasp103
and six comparison stars simultaneously after the first
three observations we redesigned the mask so that each
spectrum would only be dispersed across a single chip
the second mask includes six comparison stars as well
four of which are repeated from the first mask table 2
we designed the two science masks for use with the 300
linemm and 150 linemm grisms respectively though
kirk et al
the second is also compatible with the 300 linemm
grism over a narrower wavelength range for each science mask we also made a mask with narrow 05 00  slits
for wavelength calibration after the first two unfiltered
observations we began using the wb56009200 filter
to block any potential contribution from secondorder
light for our final magellanimacs observation we
used the gg495 filter for increased sensitivity at bluer
optical wavelengths
we selected exposure times to provide a maximum
count rate of 35000 analogtodigital units adu in
order to remain within the linear regime of the imacs
ccds see section 38 of bixel et al 2019 we used
the turbo readout mode for the first three transits
and opted for the slightly slower and less noisy fast
readout mode for latter transits
for each observation we collected a series of quartz
lamp flats with the same mask disperser and binning
as the science frames immediately before or after the
science observations we also collected a series of exposures of hearne lamps through the narrowslit calibration mask to aid with wavelength calibration
22 lrgbeasts
the lrgbeasts transits of wasp103b were observed on the nights of 1 jun 2016 referred to as lrgbeasts n1 hereafter and 26 jun 2016 referred to
lrgbeasts n2 both transits were observed with
the lowresolution r  300 grism spectrograph acam
benn et al 2008 on the 42m william herschel telescope wht in la palma this is the same instrument
as has been used in the previous five lrgbeasts
studies kirk et al 2017 2018 2019 louden et al 2017
alderson et al 2020
unlike imacs acam is a longslit spectrograph for
both of the lrgbeasts nights we used the wide
76 0  40 00 slit allowing us to simultaneously observe the
spectrum of wasp103 and a comparison star through
the same slit while a wide slit is useful to avoid differential slit losses between the target and the comparison
it does mean that other stars can fall within the slit
and whose light can contaminate both the target and
comparison1  we therefore had to balance our desire to
have a comparison star with a similar magnitude and
color to the target while avoiding both possible contaminating stars and the edges of the detector for our
lrgbeasts observations of wasp103 we selected
the bright hd 149891 as our comparison star which has
we note that the blending of the background star detected by
wllert  brandner 2015 and ngo et al 2016 is unavoidable
at the spatial resolution of the spectrographs used here
a v magnitude of 87 and b v color of 11 by comparison wasp103 has a v magnitude of 121 and b  v
color of 06
given the brightness of the comparison we had to use
short 9 second exposures to avoid saturation in order
to reduce the overhead we used a fast readout mode
and we windowed the ccd into two windows 530800
11003100 for the target and 13021572 11003100 for
the comparison which reduced the overhead to 5 s
on the first night we acquired 1400 spectra of the
target with an airmass varying between 140  108 
143 the moon did not rise during our observations on
this night on the second night we took 1068 spectra of
the target with an airmass varying between 109  108
 170 with a moon illumination of 58 at a distance
of 108 from the target biases tungsten lamp flats sky
flats and cuar plus cune arc spectra were taken at the
start and end of both nights
23 geminigmos and vltfors2 transits
three transits of wasp103b were observed with the
gemini north gmos multiobject spectrograph on 27
jun 2015 gmos n1 10 jul 2015 gmos n2 and 3
may 2016 gmos n3 a single transit of wasp103b
was observed using vltfors2 on 1 may 2017 this
was the same transit as observed by access n5 for
all gmos and fors2 transits two comparison stars
were observed in addition to wasp103 we refer the
reader to lendl et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020
for a description of these observations
3 data reduction
31 access
we reduced the magellanimacs data using our custom pythonbased pipeline described previously jordn
et al 2013 rackham et al 2017 bixel et al 2019
espinoza et al 2019 mcgruder et al 2020 weaver
et al 2020 2021 the pipeline performs standard
procedures for multiobject spectroscopy including bias
and flat calibration badpixel and cosmicray correction sky subtraction spectral tracing and extraction
and wavelength calibration it outputs for each observation sets of wavelengthcalibrated 1d spectra for the
target and comparison stars and arrays of state parameters useful for detrending systematics these include

timately chose not to apply a flatfield correction to
extract the 1d spectra the access pipeline uses standard aperture photometry for all nights we used a
15pixelwide aperture corresponding to 6 00  which we
selected to limit the impact of seeing variations while
also leaving adequate space in the spatial direction for
estimating the sky background
the extracted wavelengthcalibrated meanaveraged
spectra for each access observation of wasp103 are
shown in figure 1
32 lrgbeasts
to reduce the lrgbeasts longslit data we used
the same custommade python scripts as used in kirk
et al 2017 2018 2019 and alderson et al 2020 and
we refer the reader to those papers for a more in depth
description of the process
in brief the pipeline performs bias removal tracing
of the target and comparison spectra standard aperture photometry using a linear polynomial interpolated
across the stellar spectra in the spatial direction to
estimate the sky background cosmicray removal and
wavelength calibration
master biases were created for each night and subtracted from the science data before extraction for the
first night 257 bias frames were mediancombined to cre

flatfield correction in a testrun on lrgbeasts n1
we found that the use of a flatfield led to an identical
transmission spectrum but with uncertainties  10 
larger than without the use of the flatfield
we experimented with our choice of aperture width to
extract the stellar spectra finding an aperture width of
26 pixels to be optimal for night 1 and 40 pixels for night
2 owing to the poorer seeing conditions the optimal
aperture width was determined as the aperture width
that produced the minimum standard deviation following a fit of an analytic transit light curve with a cubic in
time polynomial to the resulting white light curve we
note that the plate scale of acam is 025 00 pixel1 
the extracted wavelengthcalibrated lrgbeasts
spectra of wasp103 are shown in figure 1
33 geminigmos and vltfors2 data
for the geminigmos and vltfors2 transits we
used the stellar spectra as reduced by lendl et al 2017
and wilson et al 2020 importantly we followed the
approach of both lendl et al 2017 and wilson et al
2020 in using only one of the two comparison stars
observed in those studies this was due to the second
comparison star leading to an increase in the noise in
the data
34 binning scheme and light curve creation
given the number of different transits used in our
analysis and the subsequently different wavelength coverage we opted for a straightforward binning scheme
comprised of 150 wide wavelength bins from 3900
9450  the bins and nightly meanaveraged spectra of
wasp103 from all 11 transits are shown in figure 1
we note that we excluded the four bins of the geminigmos data that included chip gaps
given lendl et al 2017s finding of strong sodium
and potassium in the atmosphere of wasp103b in

observed on each of the 11 nights used in our analysis
grouped by instrument and with an offset applied for clarity the different spectral shapes are a result of the different
instrument throughputs the dashed vertical lines indicate
the edges of 37 150wide bins we used to generate the
spectroscopic transit light curves
20 wide bins we additionally constructed separate
20 wide bins centered on the sodium doublet and each
of the two absorption lines in the potassium doublet
using our 150  and 20 wide wavelengths bins we
then created the spectroscopic light curves by integrating the spectra of the target and comparison stars over
these wavelength ranges the white light curves were
created by integrating over the full wavelength range
used for each night
for the lrgbeasts gmos and fors2 data the
targets light curves were divided by the comparisons
light curves at this point to correct for telluric absorption however the access light curves were treated
differently due to the principal component analysis used
in the access fitting routine section 41
the white light curves for all 11 transits are shown in
figure 2
4 light curve fitting
here we describe the different procedures we used
to fit the access lrgbeasts and archival light
curves for both access and lrgbeasts these
surveys have custom pipelines gptransspec for access gppm fit for lrgbeasts written independently in python to perform the fitting we refer the
reader to the previous papers in the access and lrgbeasts series for more detail in section 65 we com
pare the outputs of the two procedures on an identical
data set and find excellent agreement between the two
approaches
we note that we treated the system parameters
in two separate ways for all of our light curve fits
with gptransspec and gppm fit firstly we fixed the
planets orbital period p  09255456 scaled semimajor axis ar  2999 and inclination i  873 to
the values of southworth et al 2015 these were the
system parameters used by kreidberg et al 2018 for
their ir transmission spectrum of wasp103b and our
choice of a consistent set of system parameters allows
for more accurate stitching of multiepoch transmission
spectra for our later retrieval analysis we refer to this
set of fits as our fixed system parameters fits however
we also ran fits to our light curves with these system parameters as free parameters which allows us to report
updated system parameters we refer to this set of fits
as our free system parameters fits
41 fitting the access light curves
411 model setup
we extracted transmission spectra from the magellanimacs datasets with the procedure introduced by
espinoza et al 2019 and detailed further in subsequent
access studies weaver et al 2020 mcgruder et al
2020 we refer here to this procedure and the code
implementing it as gptransspec
in short we model the target light curve in magnitude
space as a linear combination of the transit signal and
nuisance signals introduced by instrumental systematics and observing conditions we model the transit
signal using the analytic expressions of mandel  agol
2002 as implemented in batman kreidberg 2015 the
systematics on the other hand are modelled as a sum
of two components the first component is a set of
basis signals obtained by performing principal component analysis pca on a set of comparison stars see
jordn et al 2013 espinoza et al 2019 for details and
thus the raw light curves are modelled directly not the
differential light curves the second component comes
from a gaussian process gp eg gibson et al 2012
where we use external parameters as regressors the
motivation for this twocomponent systematic modelling
is that the pca signals inform our modelling of common systematics to both the target and the comparison stars due to eg atmospheric conditions while
the gp component allows us to incorporate systematics which are particular to our target lightcurve eg
positiondependent systematics spectral profile fluctuations etc

include a best fit model middle panel the detrended light curves following the removal of the systematics model the gray

the number of basis signals n obtained from our pca
analysis equals the number of comparison stars by the
very definition of pca however typically only a subset n  n of those basis signals is actually informative
for explainingreconstructing the comparison and target star lightcurves with basis signals having larger
eigenvalues being the most important for this reconstruction while in jordn et al 2013 the number
of basis signals was decided via crossvalidation in espinoza et al 2019 bayesian model averaging was used
instead where models using the n  1 2  n most important basis signals were fitted to the data with the
transit lightcurve parameters on each of these fits being
later weighted by their logevidences to report the final
modelaveraged parameters we use this same technique here in order to account for the uncertainty on the
number n of optimal basis signals
we incorporate the gp in our modelling framework
using the george python package foremanmackey
et al 2017 in each of our fits we use a multidimensional squaredexponential kernel using as regressors the airmass x position of the trace y position of
the trace fullwidth at half maximum fwhm sky
background and time as input variables we assume a
quadratic limbdarkening law for our transit lightcurve
rather than fitting directly for the linear and quadratic
coefficients u1 and u2 gptransspec uses the change
of variables introduced in kipping 2013 u1  q1
kirk et al
u2  q2 in this way gptransspec treats both limb
darkening coefficients as free parameters with uniform
priors to prevent unphysical values
in total for each access white light curve fit
gptranspec fits for n coefficients which weigh the pcaretrieved basis signals and 13 free parameters for both
the transit lightcurve and the gp component the latter parameters are the limbdarkening coefficients q1
and q2 the six inverse length scales of our squared exponential gp kernels 1 6  the amplitude of the gp
a a white noise term which accounts for an underestimation of the photometric error bars in the light curves
 2  time of midtransit tc  the scaled planetary radius rp r  and a normalization factor f  to account
for imperfect normalization of the light curves
we used a wide uniform prior in log space for a between 1010 and 001 and used a gamma prior on
the gp length scales with shape parameter unity following the approach of eg gibson et al 2012 and
evans et al 2015 finally we also placed a wide uniform prior on  2  bounded by 1010 and 001 in millimagnitudes2 mmag2  which corresponds to 001  100
mmag bounds on the uncertainty in the photometric error bars we used wide uniform priors on the transit
parameters to prevent unphysical values
for the free system parameters white light curve fits
where we wanted to refine the system parameters but
which are not used in our final transmission spectra we
additionally fitted for the scaled semimajor axis ar 
and the inclination of the planets orbit i
to explore the parameter space gptransspec uses
nested sampling via the pymultinest package buchner
et al 2014 with 1000 live points
412 application of the model
prior to fitting the access light curves we inspected
the differential targetcomparison light curves for each
comparison star for all access nights this enabled us
to remove significant outliers from our photometry and
to check whether all the comparison stars had similar
noise characteristics to the target star and thus would
be useful for inclusion in our gptransspec fitting for
all access nights we ended up using 5 of the 6 available
comparison stars with the same comparison stars used
for nights that had a common slit mask table 1
we removed any data points from the light curves that
were taken at airmasses greater than 2 and those that
corresponded to cloudy conditions these were defined
as frames where wasp103s flux dropped below 80 
of its nightly maximum for access n1 a significant
portion 30  of the transit was contaminated by clouds
and clipped before fitting figure 2 for access n2
10  of the transit was cloudy for the remaining three
access nights no data points were clipped we note
that we compared the results of fitting the light curves
with and without this data clipping step and find the
resulting transmission spectra to be consistent but the
data clipping leads to greater precision
following the fits to the access white light curves
we used the bestfitting systematics model from each
night to remove the common mode systematics in the
spectroscopic light curves prior to fitting this reduces
sources of noise that are common among the spectroscopic light curves and provides greater precision in the
resulting transmission spectra we then fitted the spectroscopic light curves with gptransspec but this time
holding the time of midtransit tc  fixed to the nightly
bestfitting value
42 the lrgbeasts procedure
421 model setup
like accesss gptransspec lrgbeastss
gppm fit simultaneously fits quadratically limbdarkened transit light curves mandel  agol 2002
via the batman python package kreidberg 2015 together with a gaussian process also using the george
python package ambikasaran et al 2015 to model
correlated noise in the data
unlike gptransspec gppm fit uses markov chain
monte carlo mcmc to perform the sampling of parameter space via the emcee python package foremanmackey et al 2013 it also fits the differential light
curves unlike gptransspec which fits the raw stellar
light curves in its pca
while gppm fit also uses quadratic limb darkening
we instead hold the quadratic limb darkening coefficient
u2 fixed to a theoretical value calculated by the limb
darkening toolkit ldtk parviainen  aigrain 2015
to calculate these values we used the stellar parameters
of delrez et al 2018 we then only fitted for the linear
coefficient u1 for which we used a uniform prior to
prevent unphysical values
to fit the systematics in the light curves we used a
combination of squared exponential gp kernels taking
various ancillary data airmass fwhm etc as input
variables we specify which variables were used for each
night in the following subsections these kernels each
had a separate length scale   but shared a common
amplitude a we additionally included a white noise
kernel defined by the variance  2  to account for white
noise not captured by the photometric error bars we
fitted for the natural logarithm of these values and fitted
for the inverse length scale following previous studies
an access  lrgbeasts transmission spectrum of wasp103b
eg gibson et al 2012 2017 evans et al 2017 2018
kirk et al 2019 alderson et al 2020
prior to fitting the data the input variables were
standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by
the standard deviation following the procedure of eg
evans et al 2017 2018 kirk et al 2019 and alderson et al 2020 this gives each input variable a mean
of zero and standard deviation of unity and helps the
gp determine the inputs of importance for describing
the noise characteristics
similar to gibson et al 2017 and alderson et al
2020 we placed truncated uniform priors in log space
on the gp hyperparameters the amplitude a was
bounded between 001 and 100 the outoftransit variance and the length scales were bounded between the
minimum spacing and twice the maximum spacing of
data points of the standardized variables for the white
noise term we placed wide uniform priors in log space
bounded by 108 and 25  107  which corresponds to
1005000 ppm bounds on the uncertainty in the photometric error bars
prior to fitting the white and spectroscopic light
curves with gppm fit we fit a transit model multiplied
by a cubic polynomial using a neldermead algorithm
nelder  mead 1965 to remove  4 outliers from our
light curves this typically clipped at most 12 points
per light curve
to find the starting values for the gp hyperparameters we optimized the gp model to the outoftransit
data prior to fitting each light curve the mcmc chains
were subsequently started with a small scatter around
these values following the george documentation2 
gppm fit runs two sets of chains for each light curve
with the second set of chains started with a smaller scatter around the bestfitting values from the first chain
for all our light curve fits with gppm fit the number
of walkers equalled 6  np where np is the number of
free parameters for 10000 steps each split across the
first and second runs as explained above
422 application of the model
prior to fitting the lrgbeasts white and spectroscopic light curves we binned the data from both nights
to a time resolution of 60 s this reduced the number
of data points to be fitted for all lrgbeasts light
curves from 1400 to 337 for night 1 and from 1068 to
255 for night 2 we did this for computational reasons
as gps scale as on3  for n data points
for lrgbeasts night 1 we used five gp kernels
each taking one of airmass fwhm x position of the
httpsgeorgereadthedocsioenlatesttutorialsmodel
trace y position of the trace and sky background as
input variables due to the additional noise in lrgbeasts night 2 figure 2 we additionally included
time with a sixth gp kernel for the analysis of these
light curves in total for the lrgbeasts white light
curve fits there were 10 free parameters tc  rp r 
u1 a 1 5   2  for night 1 and 11 for night 2 with
the addition of the time kernel
similar to the access procedure we then removed
the common noise models from the spectroscopic light
curves prior to fitting we also again fixed tc to the
bestfitting values from the white light curve fits
43 fitting the gmos and fors2 light curves
to fit the geminigmos and vltfors2 light
curves we used the same gppm fit code as we used
to fit the lrgbeasts light curves for the gmos
data we again used 5 squared exponential gp kernels to
fit the systematics in the data with each taking one of
airmass fwhm position angle y position of the trace
and sky background as input variables for the vlt
data we followed the approach of wilson et al 2020
in modelling the systematics with a single gp kernel
taking time as the input variable combined with a linear in time polynomial the white light curve fits to the
gmos and fors2 data are shown in figure 2
as with the access and lrgbeasts transits we
removed the common noise systematics model from the
spectroscopic light curves prior to fitting as we show
in section 63 our resulting gmos and fors2 transmission spectra are in good agreement with the initial
analyses of lendl et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020
giving us confidence in the repeatibility of our results
44 comparing gptransspec with gppm fit
as an additional test of our light curve fitting routines
we generated a set of access differential light curves
by dividing each night by the single best comparison
star as shown in figure 2 the best comparison star
was chosen as the comparison star that lead to the smallest median absolute deviation in the outoftransit flux
we then ran these light curves through the same procedure as described in section 42 the results of this test
are presented in section 65 and show excellent agreement between gptransspec and gppm fit
5 correcting for thirdlight and
nightside contamination
due to the presence of the blended contaminant within
the wasp103 spectra we had to correct our resulting transmission spectra for this to perform this correction we followed a similar process to that used in

feh  006 dex delrez et al 2018 and contaminant
teff  4400  200 k cartier et al 2017 and scaled
these to have the correct jband magnitudes cartier
et al 2017 we then calculated the ratio of the contaminants flux to the targets flux for each of our wavelength bins as defined in section 34
figure 3 shows the contamination ratios we calculate as compared with those measured by wllert 
brandner 2015 ngo et al 2016 southworth  evans
2016 cartier et al 2017 lendl et al 2017 delrez
et al 2018 and wilson et al 2020 this figure shows
the good agreement between our calculated flux ratios
and these previous studies the thirdlight correction
factors for our wavelength bins are given in table 4
to apply these flux corrections to our resulting transmission spectra we used the following equation eg
kreidberg 2018
dcorr  dobs 1  fcont fw103 
where dobs are the observed transit depths fcont  is
the flux of the contaminant fw103 is wasp103s flux
and dcorr are the corrected transit depths
in addition to correcting for the contamination of the
nearby star we also considered dilution of the transit depth by the planets nightside flux given the high
equilibrium temperature of the planet eg kipping 
tinetti 2010 while the effect is small in the optical it
08 10
wavelength  m
figure 4 the correction factors due to the emission from
wasp103bs nightside blue crosses these were calculated using a 1700 k blackbody for the planets nightside
also shown are the correction factors calculated by kreidberg et al 2018 for their hst wfc3 and spitzer irac
wavelength bins red circles
can lead to a significant change in the infrared as shown
by kreidberg et al 2018 for wasp103b
kreidberg et al 2018 used their spitzer phase curve
observations to measure the nightside temperature of
wasp103b finding it to be 1700 k we then used a
phoenix model for the star and a blackbody at the
nightside temperature to calculate the flux dilution in
each of our wavelength bins from the nightside of the
planet
the nightside flux corrections were applied to our resulting transmission spectra using the following equation
eg kipping  tinetti 2010 kreidberg 2018
dcorr 
dobs
1  fn s fw103 
where fn s  is the flux from the nightside of the
planet figure 4 shows our calculated correction factors
the denominator in equation 2 along with those used
by kreidberg et al 2018 this figure demonstrates
that the effect of the planets nightside is significantly
larger in the infrared as compared to the optical in
the wavelength range covered by our optical data the
maximum correction factor corresponding to the reddest wavelength bin leads to a 13 ppm change in the
transit depth while we have applied this correction to
our final transmission spectra this correction is only 8 
of the typical error in the transit depths of our combined
transmission spectrum and thus is negligible
6 results
61 white light fits
an access  lrgbeasts transmission spectrum of wasp103b
table 3 lists the system parameters we derive from
the free system parameters fits to our 11 white light
curves we note again that these results were not the
ones used for our final transmission spectra where we
instead used the parameters of southworth et al 2015
as used by kreidberg et al 2018
the rp r values in table 3 are those after correcting
for the thirdlight contamination and planetary nightside flux section 5 this shows that while there is good
overall agreement there is scatter in each of these parameters we plot the rp r derived from each of our
transits from both the fixed and free system parameters fits along with the values of southworth  evans
2016 lendl et al 2017 delrez et al 2018 and wilson et al 2020 in figure 5 this demonstrates that
while there is some variation in rp r  each of our 11
transits are within 12 of the weighted mean we note
that access n5 and vltfors2 are observations of
the same transit epoch
63 transmission spectrum
in figure 6 we show the transmission spectra resulting from all 11 of our groundbased transits following the correction for the thirdlight contamination and
planetary nightside flux the nightly transmission spectra in the top panels of figure 6 have had offsets applied
to ensure they have the same nightly mean rp r as
the weighted mean rp r from all 11 nights as discussed in section 62 the nightly transmission spectra
for all instruments are given in tables 6 and 7 in the
appendix
figure 6 shows there is good overall agreement between each of the transits transmission spectra the
most notable difference comes in the lrgbeasts
transmission spectra where the spectra diverge at blue

the results of our fits to the white light curves are
shown in figure 2 we note that we also include the
differential access light curves in figure 2 which correspond to the targets light curve divided by the best
comparisons light curve for ease of comparison with the
other 6 transit light curves however we did not actually fit the differential access light curves but instead
fit the raw stellar light curves as described in section 41
as the number of transits and wavelength bins resulted in over 322 spectroscopic light curves we only include example fits to our access and lrgbeasts
data in the appendix figs 16 and 17 the rest of our
light curve fits can be found online3 
figure 5 the reported white light rp r values from
literature studies black triangles along with our newly derived values when holding the remaining system parameters
fixed to southworth et al 2015 orange points and leaving these as free parameters blue points the plot symbols
for our newly analyzed data are shared among transits that
have a common wavelength range and comparison star the
dashed horizontal lines show the weighted means from our
newly analyzed data to which our transmission spectra figure 7 were normalized
wavelengths although they are still consistent within
1 other than in the bluest bin
we also note that the na signal is much deeper in the
first lrgbeasts night as an additional check we
performed light curve fits to five 30 wide bins centered
on na to see whether this was caused by systematics related to the 20  bin being too narrow in this case we
found the central na bin to remain deep but a neighbouring bin to be anomalously shallow giving us reason
to question the authenticity of the deep lrgbeasts
n1 bin this behaviour did not occur for any of the 11
other transits we analysed we are unsure of the causes
of this deep na bin however we tried different treatment
of the stellar limb darkening fixed vs free coefficients
gp inputs and gp kernels matrn 32 vs squared exponential and the use of a flat field and found these
made no difference to the depth of the bin
notably however our final 11 transitcombined transmission spectrum changes by fi1 regardless of whether
the second lrgbeasts night or the lrgbeasts
na result is included this is the advantage of combining 11 data sets as a result we do not exclude the
lrgbeasts data from our final transmission spectrum

table 3 the resulting system parameters from our white light curve fits with these as free parameters in all cases we held
the period fixed to 09255456 d as found by southworth et al 2015 and used by kreidberg et al 2018 we note that these
parameters were not used in the fitting of our spectroscopic light curves and hence our transmission spectrum we also include

in figure 6 we also plot the geminigmos and
vltfors2 transmission spectra as derived by lendl
et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020 this shows the
good agreement between our reanalysis of these data
sets and the previously published analyses we believe that the small differences between our analysis of
the geminigmos data as compared to the analysis of
lendl et al 2017 could be due to the different system
parameters used and different systematics modelling approaches used
in figure 7 we show the weightedmean transmission
spectra for each instrument and the 11transit weightedmean combination in this figure all the spectra have
been corrected for the thirdlight contamination as described in section 5
figure 7 shows an excellent agreement between all four
instruments this also highlights the precision we have
achieved in our combined transmission spectrum with
a median uncertainty on the transit depth of 148 ppm
the transmission spectrum shows considerable structure with an upwards slope from  4000 to 5200  before dropping towards 5600  and rising again towards
6200  there is also a bump in the spectrum at around
7000  and a deeper transit centered on the na doublet at 5893  which we discuss in more detail in the
following subsection
64 significance of the na bin
in order to estimate the significance of the sodium
detection in our combined transmission spectrum figure 7 we fitted a straight line across the neighbouring
bins between 5625 and 6075  where the continuum is
rising this is the same process used to estimate the
significance of sodium as used in eg nikolov et al
2016 carter et al 2020 and alderson et al 2020
comparing the difference between our na bin and the
fitted continuum we find the na bin is higher at 31
confidence
at face value this appears significant however when
we exclude the lrgbeasts na bin from our combined transmission spectrum which we believe could be
affected by systematics figure 6 the significance of
na by this method drops to 28 while the inclusion
of the lrgbeasts na bin changes the transmission
spectrum by  1 owing to the fact we are combining
11 data sets we favour our conservative 28 evidence
for na considering to the possible systematics affecting
the lrgbeasts na bin wilson et al 2020 detect
na at 20 confidence while lendl et al 2017 find signs
of strong na absorption based on our analysis we cannot claim a significant detection of na in wasp103bs
atmosphere
65 comparing the access  lrgbeasts fitting
pipelines
as an additional check of our results we also fitted
the access light curves with the lrgbeasts fitting code gppm fit section 42 figure 8 shows the
comparison between our final transmission spectra from
both methods prior to applying the thirdlight correction this shows the excellent agreement between the
two fitting routines despite the different approaches to
an access  lrgbeasts transmission spectrum of wasp103b

66 impact of thirdlight correction
as described in section 5 we had to correct our transmission spectrum for the flux of the blended contaminant 4400  200 k cartier et al 2017 in figure 9 we
plot the pre and postthirdlightcorrected transmission
spectra we additionally include in dotted lines the
impact of the contamination assuming the effective temperature of the contaminant  the 1 and 2 uncertainties reported by cartier et al 2017 which shows that
the uncertainty in the contaminant does not result in a
significant change in the transmission spectrum this
was also found by lendl et al 2017
figure 9 demonstrates that while the thirdlight correction has a significant impact over a broad wavelength
range changing the transmission spectrum from gently
sloping down towards red wavelengths to sloping upwards it has a minor impact on the more localised features such as the dip at 5600  the na bin and the
bump at 7000  we explore the impact this correction
has on our retrievals in section 8

trans that included only tio vo and feh as optical opacity sources we assumed a cloudfree isothermal atmosphere at the equilibrium temperature of the
planet 2489 k and took the planets surface gravity
and stellar radius from delrez et al 2018 for these
exploratory forward models we assumed atmospheric
mass fractions for tio vo and feh of 01  importantly as we discuss later these initial tio and vo
forward models use the plez 1998 1999 line lists as is
the default for petitradtrans
the forward models of tio and vo are shown in figure 10 along with a flat line we do not include the feh
model owing to the poor fit to the shape of the spectrum these exploratory models show that while none
of these models provide an acceptable 2  both tio and
vo can fit the downturn in the transmission spectrum
we observe in the blue while only vo is able to replicate
the downturn seen at 5600 
in order to test this hypothesis further we also ran a
retrieval using petitradtrans we used an mcmc

to our transmission spectrum assuming a k5 contaminant
with an effective temperature of 4400  200 k cartier et al
2017 the blue points correspond to the precorrection data

dashed lines show the 1 and 2 uncertainties on the corrected

the parameter space with 240 walkers each with 4200
steps we fitted for the abundances of co h2 o ch4 
nh3  co2  h2 s na k tio vo and feh we also fitted for the surface gravity and reference pressure following the petitradtrans retrieval example4  we also
fitted for 6 parameters that defined the temperaturepressure profile although we note that these were poorly
constrained the abundances of ir species were also
poorly constrained however the retrievals did constrain the volume mixing ratio vmr of vo to be
565046
064 dex which is about 10  the solar abundance woitke et al 2018 the tio abundance was
unconstrained instead bumping up against the lower
boundary of the uniforminlogspace prior 10 dex
this agreed with our forward model analysis that the
transmission spectrum is better matched with vo than
tio when using the plez line lists the retrieved model
using the plez line lists is also shown in figure 10
motivated by our retrievals run with poseidon

between the orange and green models in figure 10 is
just the choice of vo line list all other parameters were
equal this demonstrates how the choice of vo line list
used makes a significant difference to the gradient of the
slope in the blue and to a lesser extent the shallower
transit depths seen around 5600  however we note
that the goodness of fit is unaffected by the choice of
line list
8 retrievals with poseidon
we additionally conducted a retrieval analysis of
wasp103bs transmission spectrum with the poseidon atmospheric retrieval code macdonald  madhusudhan 2017
while our petitradtrans retrieval section 7 focused on our optical transmission spectrum our poseidon analysis further considers the addition of the nearinfrared hst wfc3 and
spitzer irac observations from kreidberg et al 2018
our poseidon retrievals also include a prescription
for unocculted stellar heterogeneity which is a potential
source of bias in exoplanet transmission spectra eg
mccullough et al 2014 oshagh et al 2014 rackham
et al 2017 2018 2019
our poseidon retrievals consider a wide range of
atmospheric and stellar properties we include the following chemical species with both prominent absorption
features over our wavelength range and an expectation of
occurrence in hot giant planet atmospheres eg sharp
 burrows 2007 madhusudhan et al 2016 na k h
tio vo alo crh feh h2 o co co2  and hcn in
our initial exploratory retrievals we also included opacity from li fe fe ti ti h3  sio tih sih
ch4  nh3  n2 o no2  and no but found these to be
unconstrained and so did not include them in our final
analysis
besides the line absorption from these species poseidon also includes collisioninduced absorption from
h2 h2 and h2 he pairs and rayleigh scattering we
allow for inhomogenous clouds and hazes following the
prescription in macdonald  madhusudhan 2017 we
assume an isothermal temperature profile given the
quality of the present observations rocchetto et al
2016 our treatment of unocculted starspots or fac
an access  lrgbeasts transmission spectrum of wasp103b
ulae is based on the parametrization of pinhas et al
2018 in short the heterogeneity contamination factor rackham et al 2017 is computed by interpolating stellar models from the castellikurucz 2004 atlas
castelli  kurucz 2003 using the pysynphot package
stsci development team 2013
in total our poseidon retrievals have a maximum
of 22 free parameters the planetary atmosphere is defined by the volume mixing ratios xi  of the 12 chemical
species listed above the terminator temperature t 
a reference radius at 10 bar rp 10 bar  and the fourparameter cloud and hazes prescription from macdonald  madhusudhan 2017 the stellar heterogeneity
contribution is described by the covering fraction of the
active regions on the stellar disc fhet  and the temperatures of the active regions t het  and stellar photosphere t phot  respectively for retrievals including
the data from kreidberg et al 2018 we opted to fit for
a relative offset rel  between our optical transmission
spectrum and the ir transmission spectrum noting that
instrumental offsets in the optical data were taken care
of in section 62 we ascribe uniforminthelogarithm
priors on the mixing ratios 1016 to 101  and uniform
priors on t 400 to 3000 k rp 10 bar 085  115 rp 
fhet 0 to 05 t het 065 to 12 t photapriori  and
rel  1000 ppm since the stellar photosphere temperature is wellknown a priori we place an informative
gaussian prior on t phot mean 6110 k standard deviation 160 k  gillon et al 2014 the cloud and haze
priors are as in macdonald  madhusudhan 2017
we ran poseidon on four combinations of our new
optical dataset and the ir transmission spectrum of
kreidberg et al 2018 the optical data alone following
the application of the thirdlight correction ground
corrected the optical data alone prior to the application of the thirdlight correction ground uncorrected the hst and spitzer data without the optical data and the thirdlightcorrected optical data combined with the hst and spitzer data for each dataset
we conducted bayesian parameter estimation and model
comparisons via the nested sampling algorithm multinest feroz  hobson 2008 feroz et al 2009 2019
buchner et al 2014 with 4000 live points per retrieval
we report the results from our retrievals in table 5
the main result is that the optical data reveals tentative evidence for tio  2 while also showing strong
evidence of contamination from unocculted stellar heterogeneities we discuss these results in more detail in
the following subsections
81 on the optical data alone
our retrieved spectra for both the thirdlight corrected and uncorrected optical data are shown in figure 11 top panels prior to the thirdlight correction
section 5 there is a gentle upwards slope towards blue
wavelengths which is best fit by unocculted cool active
regions following the thirdlight correction the spectral morphology changes into a steep downwards slope
best explained by unocculted hot active regions which
we interpret as faculae quantitatively the evidence for
stellar activity increases from 15 to 40 following the
thirdlight correction see table 5 clearly the thirdlight correction makes a significant impact on the conclusions about stellar activity
we additionally infer tentative evidence for atmospheric tio absorption from our optical data this tio
inference persists for both the uncorrected and thirdlight corrected data changing from 23 to 17 following
the thirdlight correction the tio mixing ratio however is poorly constrained from the optical data alone
no other chemical species are favored by our bayesian
model comparisons with poseidon with 2  upper
limits on their mixing ratios reported in table 5 the
nondetection of na despite the 20bin centered on
the na dlines being 3 deeper than the surrounding continuum section 64 is likely due to the lack of
pressurebroadened na wings in the surrounding data
points eg nikolov et al 2018 alam et al 2021
the tentative evidence for tio from poseidon is an
interesting contrast with our earlier petitradtrans
retrieval section 7 which instead inferred vo without
the need for tio to better understand this discrepancy we ran additional retrievals with both codes varying properties such as the prior ranges on the vmrs
and the top of atmosphere pressure ultimately this
made little difference the most notable difference we
identified is that poseidon uses updated exomol line
lists for vo and tio resulting in considerably different
optical band shapes compared to the petitradtrans
vo and tio cross sections see figure 10 however
as we discuss in section 91 we cannot be certain that
this is the cause the disagreement indeed our 4 preference for unocculted faculae with poseidon for the
corrected data automatically considered vo as an alternative explanation via the bayesian evidence computations therefore we believe that the inclusion of
stellar heterogeneity in our poseidon retrievals is the
more likely cause of the disagreement
82 on the ir data alone
our ironly retrievals on the hstwfc3 and
spitzerirac data from kreidberg et al 2018 weakly
favor unocculted faculae and h2 o we find a lower
kirk et al
detection significance for faculae than that from the
opticalonly corrected spectrum 24 vs 40 this is
expected since the influence of unocculted stellar heterogeneities is largest at short wavelengths eg rackham et al 2018 2019 the retrieved heterogeneity parameters from the ir data are consistent with those from
our ground corrected retrieval table 5 giving us
added confidence in this interpretation our inference
of h2 o is marginal at best 17 and notably less significant than that found by wilson et al 2020 40
we believe this discrepancy is due to our consideration
of stellar heterogeneities which were not included in the
retrieval analyses of wilson et al 2020 finally we
note that tio is not inferred from our ironly retrievals
though the upper limit on its abundance is consistent
with the ground corrected retrieval in all these consistent findings between each portion of the transmission spectrum strengthen the conclusions derived from
the combined optical and ir data set
83 on the combined optical and ir data
our retrieval of the combined opticalir data shown
in figure 11 bottom panel identifies strong evidence
of unocculted faculae 43 and tentative evidence for
tio 21 h2 o 19 and hcn 17 the inferred
faculae are  350 k hotter than the stellar photosphere
with a coverage fraction of 2212
9  the fitted offset
between the optical and ir data is 21083
85 ppm consistent with the 1 uncertainties in our optical transmission spectrum due to the weak evidence for individual
molecules we also derived the combined significance of
tio  h2 o  hcn from a bayesian model comparison
with all three species excluded we find that the significance of at least one of tio h2 o or hcn is 28
therefore we conclude there is moderate evidence for
molecular opacity from wasp103b alongside the stellar faculae contamination
we illustrate the contributions of each chemical
species and the unocculted faculae to our bestfitting
poseidon model in figure 12 this figure demonstrates that unocculted faculae still induce a slight
downward slope between the red and blue ends of the
hstwfc3irg141 bandpass explaining why our
ironly retrievals also favor unocculted faculae unlike
our retrievals with petitradtrans we see that poseidon does not fit the dip in the transmission spectrum around 055 m which may be due to the exomol line lists used figure 10 or the inclusion of faculae  we discuss this more in section 91 we note
that the minimal model shown in this figure uses only
those parameters required to fit the combined optical
 ir data ie without unconstrained chemical species
or cloud parameters this 9parameter model achieves
a minimum reduced chisquare of 2  136 which we
consider an excellent fit to our transmission spectrum
of wasp103b the full posterior corresponding to this
bestfitting model is shown in figure 13 with the parameter constraints also given in table 5 we caution
however that our recommended atmospheric and stellar properties are those from the full optical  ir retrieval see table 5 since the full retrieval accounts for
marginalization over the entire parameter space
our inferred atmospheric properties for wasp103b
are summarized in table 5 we find a tio mixing ratio
of 731214
206 dex broadly consistent with expectations
for a solar abundance atmosphere at wasp103bs equilibrium temperature woitke et al 2018 the retrieved
h2 o mixing ratio 328146
408 dex spans a wide range
from supersolar to subsolar abundances the latter is
consistent with the suggestion by kreidberg et al 2018
of h2 o dissociation in wasp103bs atmosphere we
suggest that wilson et al 2020s tighter constraint on
the h2 o abundance of 40 solar without subsolar
solutions may arise from the absence of marginalization over unocculted faculae in their retrievals a hint
of hcn near 16 m see figure 12 emerges only from
our combined optical  ir retrievals though the abundance is poorly constrained with the present data future observations of wasp103b can serve to confirm
the presence of tio h2 o andor hcn while strengthening their abundance determinations
9 discussion
91 the optical transmission spectrum of wasp103b
as shown in section 7 our petitradtrans retrievals that do not include stellar activity favor vo albeit with an implausibly high volume mixing ratio figure 10 however retrievals that do include the impacts
of stellar activity significantly favor stellaractivity contamination with tentative evidence for tio section 8
this may be due to the different opacity at bluer wavelengths the plez 1999 vo line list used by petitradtrans leads to a steeper drop off than the exomol line
list used by poseidon figure 10 as a result the
poseidon retrievals with the exomol line list necessitate unocculted faculae to fit the downwards trend we
observe at blue wavelengths figure 12
in order to place wasp103b into context we compare our transmission spectrum with that of another ultrahot jupiter wasp121b delrez et al 2016 wasp121bs equilibrium temperature of 2358  52 k is 130 k
cooler than wasp103bs and it orbits an f6 dwarf
compared to wasp103 which is an f8 dwarf

sphere evans et al 2017 mikalevans et al 2019 2020
daylan et al 2019 bourrier et al 2020 it has been suggested that vo is responsible for this temperature inversion evans et al 2017 2018 mikalevans et al 2020
daylan et al 2019 bourrier et al 2020 although the
presence of this molecule is debated at highresolution
benyami et al 2020 cabot et al 2020 hoeijmakers et al 2020 merritt et al 2020 borsa et al 2021
leading to suggestions that neutral fe may instead explain wasp121bs temperature inversion gibson et al
2020
given the similarity between the lowresolution transmission spectra of wasp103b and wasp121b vo
seems a plausible explanation if present vo could also
be responsible for wasp103bs temperature inversion
kreidberg et al 2018
the comparison to wasp121b is strengthened when
taking our transmission spectrum with the nearuv
data point of turner et al 2017 as this resembles the
same rise in the transmission spectrum towards the uv
as seen in wasp121b figure 14 if this rise does indeed hold then this would be evidence of a planetary
atmospheric contribution and not unocculted faculae
which would continue trending downwards towards the
uv however we caution that due to the small variations in rp r seen in our own analysis figure 5 any
rise in wasp103bs transmission spectrum towards the
uv should be confirmed with future hst observations
that cover a broad wavelength range
in section 7 we suggested that the different line lists
used by petitradtrans and poseidon could be
responsible for the different interpretations of wasp103bs transmission spectrum however in evans et al
2018 the authors used the atmo retrieval code which
uses the exomol line list for vo goyal et al 2018 like
poseidon despite this evans et al 2018 still find
strong evidence for vo this may be because of their
greater spectral resolution median wavelength bin size
of 97  their coverage of the uv and the fact that
atmo does not fit for stellar activity taken together
it is unclear to what extent the choice of line list impacts
our conclusions
while the comparison between wasp121b and
wasp103b is evidence for their similar atmospheric

figure 13 posterior distribution from the bestfitting poseidon retrieval of wasp103bs transmission spectrum this
posterior corresponds to the fit in figure 12 and the final column in table 5 the marginalized histograms for each parameter
are overlaid with the median retrieved value and 1 confidence levels blue error bars the retrieved parameters indicate
strong evidence of unocculted faculae t het  t phot  a bounded constraint on wasp103bs tio abundance suggestive but
weak constraints on the h2 o and hcn abundances and a 200 ppm relative offset between the optical and infrared datasets
chemistry in the absence of stellar contamination we
caution that the very high vo abundances derived from
our petitradtrans retrievals are implausible section 7
however the retrievals run with poseidon section 8 favor tio although with only marginal significance given the updated line lists that poseidon
uses and the plausible  solar tio abundances it finds

nparam  ndata  we include this retrieval for comparison with the opticalonly and optical  infrared retrievals while the
minimal model provides the bestfit via the evidence or reduced chisquare the full models include marginalization over
a wider range of parametersaccounting for overlapping absorption features and other degeneraciesso our recommended
atmospheric and stellar parameters are the full optical  infrared parameters highlighted in bold  5th column
for both the optical and ir data it is perhaps more likely
that tio is present in wasp103bs atmosphere if confirmed by followup studies this would make wasp103b more similar to wasp33b and wasp76b for
which tio and temperature inversions have been observed haynes et al 2015 nugroho et al 2017 fu et al
2020
further highresolution observations are needed of
wasp103b to search for tio and vo via crosscorrelation techniques in any case the tentative evidence for these species in our transmission spectrum
is suggestive that they could be responsible for wasp103bs temperature inversion as postulated by kreidberg
et al 2018
912 on stellaractivity contamination
if instead stellar contamination is the cause of some
structures in wasp103bs transmission spectrum then
we can also compare with wasp121b wasp103 is
an f8 dwarf gillon et al 2014 while wasp121 is an
active f6 dwarf delrez et al 2016
in the case of wasp121 it shows no photometric
modulation above the 1 mmag threshold of the wasp
photometry no emission in the ca ii h and k line
cores and no spotcrossing events during transit delrez
et al 2016 however it does show significant rv jitter delrez et al 2016 conclude that this scenario for
wasp121 can be explained if the star is dominated by
plage the chromospheric counterpart to photospheric
active regions with a covering fraction of 8  this
is significantly larger than the typical facular coverage
of f6 dwarfs estimated from the variability of kepler
stars rackham et al 2019 however under this assumption wasp121bs transmission spectrum would
likely also be contaminated ultimately though the rise
in wasp121bs transmission spectrum at wavelengths
shorter than 4000  cannot be caused by unocculted faculae which would lead to a continued decrease in transit
depth towards bluer wavelengths eg rackham et al
2017 2019
in the case of wasp103 it shows a photometric modulation of 5  1 mmag in c14 automated imaging telescope data from fairborn observatory kreidberg et al
2018 gillon et al 2014 do not report any activity in
wasp103s rv data but staab et al 2017 measure
wasp103s log rhk as 457 consistent with other active exoplanet host stars such as wasp19 sing et al
2016 and wasp52 hbrard et al 2013 our retrievals that include activity suggest unocculted faculae  350 k hotter than the surrounding photosphere
with large covering fractions of 1812

figure 14 our transmission spectrum of wasp103b grey
hexagons compared to the hststis transmission spectrum of wasp121b from evans et al 2018 red circles
the transmission spectra have both been scaled to their respective scale heights 152 ppm for wasp103b and 239 ppm
for wasp121b derived from delrez et al 2016 we also include the nearuv photometric data point from turner et al
2017 green hexagon
table 5 our retrieved faculae temperatures are consistent with solar faculae topka et al 1997 while the
relatively large uncertainties in the covering fractions
would only make wasp103 a 15 outlier as compared
to the kepler sample rackham et al 2019 however
as delrez et al 2016 and rackham et al 2019 discuss estimates based from photometric modulation do
not necessarily reveal the underlying activity coverage
particularly in the case of bright regions therefore
we do not rule out the large covering fractions of faculae our retrievals with poseidon derive particularly
given wasp103s high log rhk staab et al 2017 uv
spectra are needed to determine whether wasp103b is
indeed contaminated by unocculted faculae or instead
follows the same trend as wasp121b
92 comparison with previous optical transmission

et al 2017 lendl et al 2017 and wilson et al
2020 in all cases the transmission spectra have been
corrected for the thirdlight contamination we note
that in this figure we applied an offset in rp r of
000065 and 00021 to the transmission spectra of lendl
et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020 respectively so
that their median rp r is equal to the median of our

et al 2017 blue circles and wilson et al 2020 green
squares
newly derived transmission spectrum we believe the
larger offset for the wilson et al 2020 data is because
those authors used a gaussian prior on rp r and took
the mean and standard deviation from southworth et al
2015 who did not account for the third light contamination section 5 we have not applied an offset to the
transmission spectrum of southworth  evans 2016
where a steep slope is found nor to the single wavelength
bin of turner et al 2017
this figure demonstrates the improved precision that
we achieved by combining our 11 transits it also
shows the slight disagreement between our new transmission spectrum and some of the geminigmos and
vltfors2 bins of lendl et al 2017 and wilson et al
2020 which highlights the benefits of combining many
transits to form our transmission spectrum
additionally we do not see the blueward rise as observed by southworth  evans 2016 however other
than southworth  evans 2016s bluest photometric
data point our results are roughly consistent to 1 additionally turner et al 2017s nearuv photometric
band indicates a rise towards wavelengths bluer than
our spectroscopic coverage however we caution against
reading too much into this due to the different system
parameters used and the offsets in rp r needed to
bring the spectroscopic data in agreement
10 conclusions
we have presented a new groundbased optical transmission spectrum of the ultrahot jupiter wasp103b
we have combined 5 new transits from the access sur
vey and 2 new transits from the lrgbeasts survey
with a reanalysis of 3 published geminigmos transits
and 1 vltfors2 transit our 11transit combined
transmission spectrum has a median uncertainty in the
transit depth of 148 ppm  1h which is of hst quality and is one of the most precise groundbased transmission spectra to date
our optical transmission spectrum shows evidence for
sodium in a 20 wide bin at 28 and significant structure with a downwards slope towards blue wavelengths
our transmission spectrum is in excellent agreement
with wasp121b another ultrahot jupiter of comparable temperature for which the presence of vo has been
inferred in our analysis of wasp103bs optical transmission spectrum using the petitradtrans retrieval
software we find that vo can provide a good fit to the
planets spectral features but only if we ignore stellar
activity and use implausibly high vo abundances
in our separate opticalonly retrievals with poseidon which include unocculted stellar heterogeneity
contamination and updated vo and tio line lists we
find strong evidence for unocculted faculae 40 an
absence of vo and tentative evidence for tio 17
at roughly solar abundances given wasp103s high
log rhk  this is our favored conclusion
when we combine our optical transmission spectrum
with the previously published hstwfc3irg141
and spitzerirac transmission spectrum we find a
slightly higher evidence for unocculted faculae 43
and tio 21 and weak evidence for h2 o 19
and hcn 17 if tio is confirmed by future highresolution observations in the optical and hst observations in the uv this would make wasp103b the fourth
planet for which evidence of tio and a temperature inversion have been observed in the same exoplanet
our result highlights the precision that groundbased
transmission spectroscopy can reach in addition to the
need for a careful treatment of stellar activity contamination for exoplanets orbiting ftype stars
