abstract
a finitedimensional quantum system is in contact with a reservoir which has
a stationary state but otherwise dissipative dynamics we give an expansion of the
propagator of the systemreservoir interacting dynamics as a sum of a main part
plus a remainder the main part consist of oscillatory and decaying terms with
explicit frequencies and decay rates the remainder is small in the systemreservoir
coupling constant uniformly for all times our approach is based on mourre theory
for the spectral analysis of the generator of the full dynamics this allows for weak
regularity of admissible interaction operators and has important consequences in
applications
setup and assumptions
we consider a bipartite hilbert space
h  hs  h r 
where dim hs   and a family of selfadjoint operators
l  l0  i
where both l0 and i are selfadjoint   r and l0 is of the form
l0  ls  1lr  1ls  lr 
this is the setup describing the composition of a system s plus reservoir r arrangement in which ls and lr generate the free non interacting dynamics of the individual
components i is an interaction operator and  is a coupling constant
we suppose that l0 has finitely many eigenvalues e of finite multiplicity me  possibly
embedded in continuous spectrum which can cover parts or all of r the set of eigenvalues
e of l0 is denoted by e0 and the associated orthogonal eigenprojection is pe  we are going
to impose a regularity condition cf a1 below which implies the following picture for
small  all eigenvalues of l lie inside an o neighbourhood of e0  moreover within
such a neighbourhood around any given e  e0  either l does not have any eigenvalues for
 6 0 we say e is unstable or l does have some eigenvalues with summed multiplicity
m0e not exceeding me we say e is stable if m0e  me  and partially stable if 0  m0e  me 
in the analytic perturbation theory of isolated eigenvalues the summed multiplicity m0e
would always equal me  but for embedded eigenvalues it is generically strictly less than
me 
fig 1 an eigenvalue e of l0 splits into eigenvalues ee  s  1     m0e  of l 
fig 1 gives a graphical depiction of the situation the main goal of this paper is to find
an expression of probability amplitudes in the quantum mechanical sense that is of
overlaps
f t  h eitl i
for suitable vectors    h in particular we try to elucidate the effect of the instability
of eigenvalues on the dynamics the key phenomenon we will uncover is this the overlaps
split into
f t  f qsta t  f diss t  rt
where f qsta t is a quasistatic contribution f diss t is a dissipative contribution decaying
as f diss t  c1  t2  and the remainder satisfies rt  c14 for all t  0 we
find the detailed structure of f qsta t it consists of oscillating terms and terms decaying
at rates  12  see theorem 21
let us now introduce the assumptions and discuss their meaning we start with an
assumption to simplify the bookkeeping it is not essential for our method to work and
could be removed at the cost of a more cumbersome presentation
a1 for  6 0 small enough all eigenvalues of l are simple
we call these eigenvalues ee  with s  1     m0e  me  and
s  1     m0e 
lim ees   e
the next assumption is a key characteristic for the physical situation we want to
describe we assume that the reservoir dynamics has a single stationary state and that
the coupled dynamics is dissipative on the orthogonal complement of this state
a2 the reservoir dynamics has a unique stationary state r  hr  that is kerlr 
cr  we denote
pr  1ls  r ihr 
and
pr  1lh  pr 
on the orthogonal complement the full coupled dynamics is dissipative in the sense
that there exists a   0 and a dense set d  h such that  with 0    
and    d
max sup zj h rzpr i
 c1

here c  z  c  imz  0 is the open lower complex half plane and
rzpr   pr l pr  z1 ranpr
is the reduced resolvent in 18 19 c1 is well defined finite on d  d
discussion of assumption a2
i the estimate 19 is of technical nature but the estimate 18 is key as it implies
that the dynamics generated by l  pr l pr ranpr is dissipative meaning that
limt h eitl i  0 more precisely it follows from 18 with 0  j  2 replaced
by 0  j  k that
h eitl i 
110
1  t2 k2
provided l  i  d and l  i  d specifically 18 implies time decay
 t2 k  2 of overlaps 110 we prove 110 at the end of this section
ii we argue that 18 is a natural assumption namely 18 for   0 is implied by
max sup zj h lr  z1 pr ihr  c1    
0j2 zc
111
where we understand here cf 17 pr  r ihr  pr  1lr  pr  this is
readily seen by writing
pse  lr  e  z1 pr 
rzpr 0  l0  z1 pr 
ee0
where pse is the spectral projection of ls associated to e so that ee0 pse 
1ls  in turn 111 is a natural assumption on the dynamics of a reservoir since
that dynamics should be dissipative away from the stationary state in concrete
applications one starts with 18 for   0 and then proves its validity for small
 6 0 by perturbation theory 19
iii in some recent works on the dynamics on open quantum systems 15 18 the assumption 18 is replaced by the condition that z 7 h rzpr i have a meromorphic continuation from z in the lower complex plane across the real axis into the
upper plane this is a much stronger condition than 18 in applications to open
quantum systems this difference means that the reservoir correlation function has
to decay exponentially quickly in time for the meromorphic situation while under
the present assumption the decay only needs to be polynomial cf 19
iv without loss of generality we may assume that c1    c1   and that
c1    c1 pr  pr  in 18 19
as is well known see eg proposition 41 of 6 if a is a selfadjoint operator and for
each vector  in some dense set there exists a constant c such that
lim inf sup h a  x  i1 i  c
0 xab
then the spectrum of a in the interval a b is purely absolutely continuous thus the
estimate 18 with j  0 implies that the spectrum of pr l pr acting on ranpr is
purely absolutely continuous and for   0 this implies that the spectrum of l0 reduced
to ranpr is purely absolutely continuous on the finite dimensional part ranpr 
 hs 
the operator l0 is identified with ls which has pure point spectrum e0  therefore l0
has absolutely continuous spectrum except for the eigenvalues e0  the same as those of
ls and the eigenprojection pe of l0 associated to e is given by
pe  pse  1lr pr  pse  pr 
112
where pse is the eigenprojection associated to e as an eigenvalue of ls 
instability of embedded eigenvalues and how to track them if e is an isolated
eigenvalue of l0 then by standard analytic perturbation theory 13 l has eigenvalues
ee  close to e for  small those eigenvalues coincide with the eigenvalues of the
operator
epe  pe ipe  2 pe il0  e1 pe ipe  o3 
113
each term in the expansion 113 is selfadjoint if e is an embedded eigenvalue of l0
then the reduced resolvent l0  e1 pe in 113 is not defined as a bounded operator
however its regularization l0 ei1 pe certainly is for any   0 we may hope that
in a sense the perturbation expansion 113 stays valid also for embedded eigenvalues
upon regularizing the resolvent and taking   0  but due to the regularization the
operator l0  e  i1 pe is not selfadjoint any longer so according to 113 the
second order corrections to the embedded eigenvalue would become complex numbers
this is however not compatible with l being selfadjoint we may then intuit that for
small nonzero  the number m0e of eigenvalues of l close to e might be strictly reduced
m0e  me  and that this reduction is accounted for by the existence of complex eigenvalues
of the socalled level shift operator
e  pe ipe l0  e  i0 1 ipe 
114
here l0  e  i0 1 is the limit of l0  e  i1 as   0  taken in the sense of
the operator norm in the expression 114 this mechanism has the following precise
formulation
let q be an orthogonal projection on h and set q  1l  q the feshbach map
applied to an operator a on h is defined by
fa q  q a  aq q aq ranq 1 a q
115
where it is assumed that q aq ranq is invertible the feshbach map satisfies the
following isospectrality property let a  c be in the resolvent set of the operator
q aq ranq  so that fa  a q is well defined then the isospectrality property
says that a is an eigenvalue of a if and only if zero is an eigenvalue of fa  a q the
redeeming quality of this mapping is that fa  a q acts on ranq a space smaller than
h reduction in dimension consider now for z  c 
116
fl  z pe   pe e  z  i  2 irzpe pe i pe 
where rzpe   pe l pe  z1 ranpe is the reduced resolvent the isospectrality is
not of any good use to analyze the spectrum of l directly since rzpe  is not defined
for real z however one can show see theorem a1 of 14 and also theorem 31 below
that the condition a2 together with the assumption that
ipe is a bounded operator and ranipe  d
117
imply that the derivatives of order up to two of
z 7 pe irzpe pe ipe
are bounded uniformly in z  c  rez  e  g2 here
g  min e  e0   e e0  e0  e 6 e0  0
118
119
denotes the minimal gap of the eigenvalues of l0 which is the same as that of ls  the
feshbach map 116 is then well defined by continuity for z  r z  e  g2 now
the isospectrality property can be extended to real values of z namely one can show
see theorem 51 below and also 7 2 14 that any e  r is an eigenvalue of l if and
only if zero is an eigenvalue of fl  e pe  and that
dimkerl  e  dimker fl  e pe  
120
due to 116 eigenvalues of fl  e pe  are located in an o neighbourhood of e0 
and hence by isospectrality so are those of l  the multiplicity of e as an eigenvalue of
l is controlled by 120 we assume now
pe ipe  0
121
as this condition does not alter the emergence of complex eigenvalues because pe ipe is
selfadjoint we could dispense with the condition 121 by a simple modification of our
arguments according to 114 116 121
fl  e pe   e  epe  2 e  o3 
122
as it acts on the me dimensional space ranpe  the operator e has me generally complex
eigenvalues since e it is a dissipative operator meaning that
ime  lim pe i
ipe  0
l0  e2  2
123
its eigenvalues have nonnegative imaginary parts1 the isospectrality of the feshbach
map 120 and the expansion 122 show that for each eigenvalue ee  of l  there is
an eigenvalue ae  r of e such that
ees   e  2 as
e  o 
124
however e may have real eigenvalues without l having any eigenvalues close to e for
 small nonzero this is so since the o3  term in 122 may cause the spectrum of
122 to be nonreal in this case l does not have any eigenvalues close to e according
to 120 to simplify the analysis we do not consider this higher order effect instead
we assume that the real eigenvalues of e are in bijection with the eigenvalues ee  of
l close to e one way to ensure this is to impose the condition
the eigenvalues of e are simple and e has exactly m0e real eigenvalues
we recall that m0e  defined before 16 is the number of distinct and simple eigenvalues
of l close to e for small  6 0 assuming e to have purely simple spectrum is done for
it is sometimes useful to note that the real eigenvalues of e are automatically semisimple as they
lie on the boundary of the numerical range of e  see eg proposition 32 of 7
convenience of the presentation this restriction can be removed easily and our approach
still works as long as e is diagonalizable in some models it can happen though that
e is not diagonalizable at socalled exceptional points of parameters one then expects a
qualitatively different behaviour of the dynamics jordan blocks of e cause polynomial
corrections to exponential decay in time we do not further explore this interesting
aspect here
the condition a5 without the simplicity assumption is also called the fermi golden
rule condition it ensures that stability or instability of eigenvalues of l is detected at
the lowest order 2  in the perturbation in terms of dynamical properties the condition
a5 means that metastable states have lifetimes of o2  as shown in theorem 21
how to link stable and unstable eigenvalues to the dynamics we have seen
above that the partially stable eigenvalues of l are the real eigenvalues of the level shift
operators e and that the e may have eigenvalues ae with strictly positive imaginary
part we introduced the level shift operators e as the second order 2  contributions in
the feshbach map 122 the isospectrality property of the feshbach map then linked
e to the spectrum of l  as it turns out the feshbach map is also an ingredient in
the block decomposition of an operator h acting on h  ranq  ranq  where q is
an orthogonal projection more precisely one can readily verify that for any operator h
such that fh q exists the following identity holds see section 5 in particular 55
fh q
1l qhq rzq
125
q hq
rzq q hq 1l
the first component in the 2  2 decomposition of 125 is that of ranq the second
one that of ranq  choosing in 125 q  pe and h  l  z for z  cr gives the
decomposition
l  z1  fl  z pe 1  bz  rzpe 
126
where bz is a term of o see 33 the first term on the right side is the inverse of
the feshbach map an operator acting on ranpe and the last term acts on ranpe  the
resolvent 126 is linked to the propagator via the fourierlaplace transform for w  0
itl
eitz l  z1 dz
127
2i riw
using 126 in 127 provides a link between the feshbach map and the dynamics we
then expand the inverse of the first term on the right side of 126 fl  z pe  
e  z  2 e  o3  2 z  e for z close to e this links fl  z pe 1 to
e  z  2 e 1  which has poles z  e  2 ae at the eigenvalues of e  2 e  upon
integration around those poles in accordance with 127 one can extract the dynamical
2 s
factors eite ae   this procedure works locally that is for z close to a fixed e so we
will subdivide the integration contour in 127 into regions close to e  e0  for each e
and apply the feshbach map with the appropriate pe  on the complement where z is
away from all eigenvalues of l0  a similar analysis is done using the feshbach map with
projection pr  this is the outline of the idea and we refer to section 3 for the detailed
analysis

application of our result to the reduced system dynamics 19
discussion of theorem 21
i the projection operators qe in 23 satisfy qe pe  pe qe  qe  where pe 
pse  pr  see 112 the overlaps h qe i thus give the dynamics of the states
  projected onto the finitedimensional space ranp  the dynamics on the
infinitedimensional ranpr is simply given by eitpr l pr 
ii on the finitedimensional part there are terms oscillating in time  eitee  
2 s
and terms decaying in time  eite ae   the decay is exponential with rates
2 s
2 imae  0 since eite ae    e timae  on the infinitedimensional part the
dynamics is also decaying but only at a polynomial rate 1t2  as per 110
iii the asymptotic dynamics for times larger than all the life times 2 imae 1 and
large enough so that the dissipative term h pr eitpr l pr pr i  t2 has decayed
cf 110 is given by h eitl i  es eitee h qe i  o14  where the
sum is over all eigenvalues ee  of l  if ee   0 is the only eigenvalue of l 
then the dynamics relaxes to the final state qe modulo an error o14 
iv the quasistatic and dissipative parts mentioned in 15 are the sums and the
term h pr eitpr l pr pr i of 23 respectively the picture 15 is reminiscent of
properties of solutions to dispersive partial differential equations which split into a
dispersive wave plus a part converging towards an invariant manifold 20 23 in
our case after the decay of the dissipative term the dynamics first approaches the
quasistatic manifold spanned by the qe for all e s the orbits stay close to the
quasistatic manifold for times up to  12  after which the dynamics moves to
the final invariant manifold spanned by the qe with e  e0 and s  seosc 
v the approach we take to prove theorem 21 is similar to 14 in that paper an
expansion of overlaps of the form 14 was given as a sum of a main part plus a
remainder similar to 23 the remainder of 14 converges to zero in the limit of
large times but it is not shown to be small in  in the current work the remainder
is small in  for all times 24 but it does not converge to zero for large times
this means incidentally that the main term of the current work is simpler the one
of 14 indeed the current main term is a second order approximation 2  of that
of 14 the result of 14 is not suitable for proving the validity of the markovian
approximation but the current result here is
uncorrelated initial states for vectors of the form   s  r    s  r
we have k   ks k ks k see 215 below the term h pr eitpr l pr pr i in 23
vanishes and the inner product in h qe i can be seen as that of the system hilbert
space alone because the qe act on ranpr  hs  cr which is identified with hs  we
introduce the operators
m

e  2 as

where each me acts on ranpse  the eigenspace of ls associated to the eigenvalue e again
the operator m  is viewed as an operator acting on the system hilbert space hs alone
by construction the operators m  and ls commute and m 0  ls  the functional
calculus gives

we then obtain the following result directly from 23

hs  r  eitl s  r ihs hr  hs  eitm  s ihs  c14 ks k ks k
this corollary is the starting point for a proof that the markovian approximation is valid
for all times which we give in 19 we show that m  gives rise to a completely positive
tracepreserving semigroup acting on system density matrices which coincides with the
wellknown gorinikossakovskisudarshanlindblad semigroup 1 4 18
parameter dependence we take some care in estimating c0  c and k appearing
in theorem 21 and corollary 22 in terms of various parameters as we explain now the
analysis is based on a perturbation theory  small and the corrections of the spectrum
are governed by the level shift operators e  whose spectral decomposition is given in
21 to quantify the perturbation theory we introduce the quantities

we also define
1  max c1 im  r  in  r  
212
where c1   is given in 18 and where m dim
is an orthonormal eigenbasis of ls 
the parameter 1 is well defined since due to 117 the vectors im  r are in d we
combine all these constants and the spectral gap g of l0 see 119 into the following
two effective constants

furthermore for vectors    d such that l  l   d with l  pr l pr  we
define

in 215 we use the notation

for any function e of  and 
216
proposition 23 parameter dependence of c0  c k the constants c0  c of theo43
rem 21 and corollary 22 can be written as c0  c0 0 and c  c 0 0  where c0  c 0 do
not depend on  g a    and 0  0 are given in 214 and 213 respectively the
constant k in 24 which is a function on d  d is given by 215
remark the parameter 1  212 is defined in terms of the function c1  18 the
latter describes the dissipative nature of the interacting dynamics and a priori depends
on  however the dissipation is due to the nature of the environment alone and so in
applications one can bound 1 uniformly in  for small enough  see 19 see also the
point ii in the discussion of condition a2 above in this sense 1 and thus 0  are
independent of 
connections with earlier work it is intuitively plausible that eigenvectors of
l0 associated to an unstable eigenvalue e describing bound states of a quantum system
for   0 turn into almostbound states for small  6 0 this mechanism is known
as metastability in the theory of schrdinger operators where the hilbert space would
not have the structure 11 but rather l0 would be the kinetic energy operator of n
particles and i would be an interaction potential in that setup initial states close to
the original eigenstate stay bound eg spatially localized for a long time but eventually
decay for large times see eg 22 10 11 and references therein
more recently a dynamical resonance theory for metastability has been developed for
open quantum systems 16 14 15 18 this is the setup described by 1113 and
l0 is the generator of dynamics of an uncoupled systemreservoir complex for instance a
few spins qubits for the system plus a field of oscillators for the reservoir eigenstates
of the uncoupled system become typically unstable when the spins start to interact with
the bosonic excitations the coupling leads to irreversible effects such as decoherence
and thermalization the dynamics of open quantum systems is an important topic in
the study of quantum theory and the literature on phenomenological models used in
physics chemistry and biology is huge and constantly growing 3 21 often the analysis
of open systems is analyzed by perturbation theory in which the control of the remainder
is not mathematically controllable say the born markov rotating wave approximations
for the markovian approximation the approach of 16 14 15 18 is mathematically
rigorous it is based on the algebraic and spectral framework of 12 2 9 17 developed
for a proof of return to equilibrium the realization that this framework can be used
to give a detailed analysis of the evolution of the reduced densty matrix beyond the
asymptotic property of convergence to equilibrium came in 16 later in 14 15 18 is
was shown that one can extract the main term of the dynamics and show that it is a
completely positive trace preserving semigroup techniquewise the paper 14 is closest
to the present work however as explained in discussion point iv after theorem 21
the results of 14 cannot be used to show the markovian approximation on the other
hand the validity of the markovian approximation was proven in 15 18 but only under
an analyticity assumption as explained in discussion point iii after assumption a2
above in the present work we make a substantial change to the methods of 14 to
develop a somewhat general timedependent perturbation theory which allows us to show
in 19 the validity of the markovian approximation under the weak regularity condition
a2 this improvement was mentioned before in 18 it is important as it allows for the
treatment of reservoirs with polynomially decaying correlations instead of exponentially
decaying ones as was needed in 15 18
proof of theorem 21
we are presenting the core strategy in section 31 it involves estimates which we derive in
sections 33 and 34 we then collect the estimates and implement the outlined strategy
in section 35 as we explained after theorem 21 our approach is similar to that of
14 however in order to be able to show that the remainder is small in  for all times
24 we need to substantially modify the analysis of 14 the main alteration is the
introduction of two new energy scales  and  which allow for a more detailed estimation
of the resolvent see also fig 2 and fig 4
notational convention for x y  0 we write x  y to mean that there is a
constant c independent of the coupling constant  as well as the parameters g a   
such that x  cy  recall the definitions 119 28211 of those parameters
strategy
given an orthogonal projection q on h we set q  1l  q and we denote the resolvent
and reduced resolvent operators by
rz   l  z1
and
rzq   q l q  z1 ranq 
the resolvent representation of the propagator is
itl

2i riw
valid for any w  0 if either of  or  belong to doml see 8 given an orthogonal
projection q the resolvent has a decomposition into a sum of three parts2 a part acting
on ranq one acting on ranq and one part mixing these subspaces this decomposition
reads for z  cr
rz   fz1  bz  rzq 
here f is the feshbach map 115
fz  fl  z q  ql  z  lq rzq lq
reminiscent of  est omnis divisa in partes tres  5
the operator bz in 33 is given by
bz  fz1 qlrzq  rzq lqfz1  rzq lqfz1 qlrzq 
here and in what follows it is convenient to simply write rzq for rzq  the existence of
fz1 is automatic this operator equals qrz q see 33 it is elementary to establish
the relation 33 see section 5 for more detail
our strategy is to partition the integration contour in 32 into segments and apply
33 with suitable projections q on each segment to describe the partition fix an
  0 it will be chosen as a certain positive power of  later on so  is a small
parameter relative to the eigenvalue gap g of l0  119 for every eigenvalue e of l0
define the segment see also fig 2

and set g  x  iw  distx e0    
where w  0 is the parameter in 32 and e0 is the set of all eigenvalues of l0

on ge we will apply the feshbach map with projection q  pe  112 and on g we
use the projection q  pr  17 accordingly it is important that we have dissipative
bounds on the reduced resolvents ie the following local limiting absorption principles
which follow from the global ones given in 18 19

the combination of 332 and 334 gives 327
 next we consider a term in 325 with s  seosc  we have to modify the above
argument since it used that the imaginary part of ae was strictly positive which is not
the case any more now by the isospectrality of the feshbach map there is exactly one
eigenvalue ee  of l with

we estimate the last fraction in 337 by using 417 as

where the last relations holds since 2 4  1 see 319 estimates 338 and 416

the first two terms of the right side of 372 when used in 371 are estimated by
taking into account that the second factor on the right side of 371 is  1 due to 338
however the last term on the right side of 372 has a singularity in z which must be
removed by integrating over ge  to do this we write

next by 416 38 and again by the argument of 370 the last two terms on the right

in the last line we use the notation l  pr l pr ranpr 
proof of proposition 33 consider two adjacent eigenvalues e  e0 of ls and set

386
we introduce a new small parameter   0 and set d1  x  iw  e    x  e

for the gap g we estimate the term in 389 involving the resolvent rzpr as follows

by 42 we have kpe irzpr ipe  pe irepr 0 ipe k  1 z  e   thus taking into

we have
kpe irzpr ipe  e k  1 z  e   
391
the reason for introducing the new small parameter  see fig 4 is that for z  d1  the
right hand side of 391 is bounded above by 1      it then follows from 391
and 390 that z  d1

next we find a bound for the integral on the left side of 392 with d1 replaced by

kls  z1 pr irzpr ipr ls  z1 k  1   2  consequently since d2   g2 we
get

estimating d20 of 387 our main etimate is given in 3102 according to 35

proof of theorem 31 and properties of aez 
regularity of the resolvent proof of theorem 31
in this section we simply write rzq for rzq  we also identify the range of pr with hs 
cf 17 so that an operator pr apr is viewed as an operator on hs  for any    hs 
z  c  k  0     3 we have recall that the m are an orthonormal eigenbasis of ls  see

sup k pr irzpr ipr k  1 
proof of theorem 31
the proof follows 14 where it is shown that the suprema in 38 39 and 311 are
finite without giving a specific bound 310 the key idea is to relate rzpe and rzpr 
introducing a new operator k  pe lpe  ipe we have
rzpe  pe k  z1 pe 
an application of the feshbach map 54 with projection q  pr yields
  1
1l pe ipr rzpr
k  z 
0 rzpr
rzpr pr i pe 1l
where pe  pe pr  1lls 6 e  pr  the operator fz and its inverse are given by use
that pe pr  pr and pr pe  0 so rzpr  pr kpr  z1 ranpr 
fz  i  zpe  pe ls  z  2 pr irzpr ipr pe
 i  z1 pe  pe ls  z1
1l  2 pr irzpr ipr ls  z1 pe 
combining 43 with 44 yields four terms when estimating h rzpe i those terms
arise when we multiply out the matrices in 44 one of the terms is h f1
z i for
z  e  g2 and since kpr irzpr ipr k  1 by 42 we obtain from 45 that
kf1
z k  max1 1g
h f1
z i  max1 1gkk kk
provided 2 1 g  1 thus
another term we have to estimate is
h rzpr i pe f1
z i   kfz k kk max c1  im  r 
  max1 1gs kk max c1  im  r 
a third term is of similar form and has the same upper bound 49 the fourth term to
estimate is
h rzpr i  2 h rzpr i pe f1
z pe irz i
 c1    2 max1 1g max c1  im  r c1  im  r 
410
collecting the estimates 48 49 410 shows the bound 38 for j  0 to get a
bound for the derivatives zj h rzpe i we again use the representation 43 and 44
and the reduced resolvents rzpr in 44
the z derivatives are affecting the terms f1
the derivatives of rz are controlled using 18 the derivatives of f1
z are dealt with
a repeated application of the formula z f1
then
using 47 and
z z
j 1
kz fz k  1   1  1 we get kz fz k  max1 1g  the bound 38 for all j
then readily follows
to prove the bound 39 we proceed in the same manner using 43 and 44
the  derivative of the resolvent rzpr is controlled by 19 and we use cf 45
k fz k  kpe irzpr i pe  2 pe i rzpr i pe k    2 1  1 the bound 39
follows
finally to show 311 we use the feshbach representation 54 with q  pr  we
proceed in the same way as above in this proof to get the result
the operators ae z 
for every e  e0 and z  c we set cf 316

413
where the integral is over the straight line linking z and  let zn be a sequence in c
with zn  e  g2 converging to some x  r so x  e  g2 then by 413
ae zn   is cauchy and thus converges to a limit which we call ae x  using 413
it is easy to see that the limit ae x  is independent of the sequence zn  we note
that the level shift operator 114 equals e  ae e 0 similarly to 413 we derive
kae z   ae z 0k  2 1 2 and hence
kae z   e k  2 z  e   
414
the bound 414 is the starting point for conventional perturbation theory recall the
definitions of the spectral gap of the level shift operators  and the maximal operator
norm  given in 210 and 211 respectively
lemma 41 suppose that z  c and z  e  
min1 1 then
1 all eigenvalues of ae z  are simple call them ae z  s  1     me  each
aes z  satisfies aes z   ae   2 for exactly one eigenvalue ae of e  in
particular we have the diagonal form
ae z  
e z qe z 
415
where the eigenvalues ae z  are simple and the riesz rank one eigenprojections
are denoted by qe z 
2 on the domain of z  determined by the constraint stated at the beginning of the
lemma the functions ae z  and qe z  are analytic in z and differentiable in

lemma we have

419
the previous result leads readily to the fact that one can extend the eigenvalues and
eigenprojections as functions of z continuously to the real axis
corollary 42 the maps z 7 qe z  and z 7 ae z  extend by continuity to
z  x  r provided x  e   2  min1 1 moreover the estimates 416 and
417 are valid if either or both of z z 0 are real
proof of corollary 42
let zn be a sequence in c with zn  e 
qe zn  
min1 1
and zn  x  r then 416 shows that
is a cauchy sequence so it converges
next again by 416 kqe z   qe x k  limn kqe z   qe zn  k exists and
is  3 z  x if z  x0  r then approximate it by zn0  c and the above argument
works the same the argument is also the same for the ae x 
proof of the lemma 41 proof of 1 it follows from 21 that

420

where d  denotes the distance function for z  e    dspec
series
421
e  ae z  e  1
ae z   1  e  1
converges so the  satisfying d spece   2 z  e   belong to the resolvent
set of ae z  moreover 421 gives the bounds
ae z   1 
422
d spece 
2 2
ae z   1  e  1  z  e  
423
d spece 2
let ce be the circle centered at ae with radius 2 then d spece   2 for   ce
and so ce belongs to the resolvent set of ae z  thus the following integral is well
defined and equals the spectral projection

we have

425
since z e  2 2  by standard perturbation theory 13 the ranks of qe z 
and qe are the same both  1 by assumption a5 and hence ae z  has exactly one
eigenvalue inside ce  this shows point 1
we now give a proof of 2 using 412 and 422 we obtain

we finally prove point 3 the relation 429 yields

the bound on the second derivative given in point 3 now follows from 412 430

in the case o  h  z for a selfadjoint h like h  l  and z 6 r we have indeed that
d  q h  zq ranq is invertible also a  bd1 c  fh  z q and hence the
sum of x y z and w give the right hand side of 33
theorem 51 weak isospectrality of the feshbach map let h be a selfadjoint
operator and let e  r and suppose that the function z 7 qhq rzq q hq is continuously differentiable on z  c  e denote the value of fh  z q at z  e by
fh  e q then we have the following
1 e is an eigenvalue of h if and only if zero is an eigenvalue of fh  e q
2 if h  e then   q satisfies fh  e q  0
3 if fh  e q  0 then the limit of rzq q hq as z  c  z  e exists
denote it by re
q hq then     re
q hq satisfies h  e
note it is easy to see that the correspondence    in theorem 51 is a bijection
between the kernels of h  e and of fh  e q
proof of theorem 51 the implication  in 1 together with 2 is not hard to prove
see proposition b2 of 14 we give now a proof of  in 1 and 3 one may write the
resolvent using the above components in matrix form as
1l qhq rzq
fh  z q
h  z 
rzq q hq 1l
rzq
where rzq  q hq  z1 ranq  this relation can actually be verified simply by
multiplying out the matrices as the two outside matrices in 54 are both invertible we
obtain for z  c such that rzq exists
1l qhq rzq
fh  z q
h z 
q h  zq
rzq q hq 1l
fh  z q  qhp  rzq p  hq
qhq
q hq
q h  zq
to discuss domain questions assume for simplicity that dim q   and that qhq
is bounded then the relation 55 holds when applied to vectors of the form
with   domq hq  moreover each single product operation of the matrices in the
threefold matrix product in 55 makes sense individually is well defined when the right
side is applied to vectors of the indicated form
due to the assumption of the theorem qhq rzq q hq has a limit when z  e  i
with   0  call this limit qhq h  e1 q hq the overlined h indicates that h
is restricted to the range of q  then lim0 fh  e  i q  qh  e  hq h 
e1 q hq  fh  e q where the last symbol is again a definition suppose that
  q is such that fh  e q  0 for   0 define   q rei
q hq then
applying equation 55 with z  e  i gives
h  e  i     fh  e  i q  0 as   0 
we show below that  has a limit  as   0  it then follows from 56 that lim0 h
e     0 since h is a closed operator the vector    is in the domain of h and
h  e    0
we now show that  is cauchy this part of the analysis is inspired by dj theorem
38 denote by p the spectral projection of fh  e q associated to the eigenvalue 0 in
particular p   since fh  e q is a dissipative operator and 0 is on the boundary
of its numerical range 0 is a semisimple eigenvalue and p is the orthogonal projection onto
the kernel of fh  e q in particular p  p first we show that z 7 phrzq hp is a
continuously differentiable function of z  c c e note qhrzq hq without the
restriction to the range of p is not even continuous at e because the limits coming from
c and c do not coincide we point out that z 7 qhq rzq q hq is continuously
differentiable on z  c  e which follows by taking the adjoint in the assumption of
the theorem next we have pfh  e qp  0 and hence ph  ep  phrei0
and taking the adjoint gives ph  ep  phrei0 hp so we have
phrei0
hp  phrei0
hp  ph  ep
which shows that z 7 phrzq hp is continuous at z  e and its value at z  e is selfadjoint next let     1 1 be a smooth curve in c e which is tangent to the
point e  c satisfying 0  e and  0 0  1 then  7 phr
 hp is continuously
differentiable at   0 and d  0 im phr  hp  im phrei0  hp on the other
hand this last derivative has to be equal to zero for the following reason for all  we have
im phr
 hp  0 and from 57 im phr  hp  0 at   0 if d  0 im phr  hp
was  0 or  0 this would contradict the fact that im phr
 hp  0 since this
derivative vanishes we get im phrei0  hp  0 so phrei0 2 hp is selfadjoint
which means that phrei0
2 hp  phrei0
2 hp so z 7 phrzq hp is continuously
differentiable on c  c  e
we now use this regularity property to show that  converges let  0  0 we have
rei  rei0 hq   qhrei  rei0 rei  rei0 hq 
from the resolvent identity rei

 rei
0  and similarly for the
i0 
other three terms on the right side of 58 therefore also using that pq  qp  p

since z 7 phrzq hp is a continuously differentiable function of z  c  c  e the
right hand side of 510 converges to zero as  0  0 thus  converges
