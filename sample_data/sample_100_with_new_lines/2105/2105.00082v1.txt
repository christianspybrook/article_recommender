abstract
it remains an open question how to determine the
winner of an election given incomplete or uncertain
voter preferences one solution is to assume some
probability space for the voting profile and declare
the candidates having the best chance of winning
to be the cowinners we refer to this as the most
probable winner mpw in this paper we propose an alternative winner interpretation for positional scoring rules  the most expected winner
mew based on the expected performance of the
candidates this winner interpretation enjoys some
desirable properties that the mpw does not we
establish the theoretical hardness of mew over incomplete voter preferences then identify a collection of tractable cases for a variety of voting profiles an important contribution of this work is to
separate the voter preferences into the generation
step and the observation step which gives rise to
a unified voting profile combining both incomplete
and probabilistic voting profiles
introduction
voting is a mechanism to determine winners among the candidates in an election by aggregating the preferences of voters in classical voting theory each voter gives a complete
preference most frequently a ranking of all candidates
how voter preferences are aggregated is determined by a voting rule a prominent class of voting rules which assign
scores to candidates based on their positions in the ranking
of each voter and then sum up the scores for each candidate
are positional scoring rules on which we focus in this paper
in practice voter preferences may well be incomplete and
represented by partial orders since voting rules are defined
over complete rankings the solution is to replace each partial order with all of its linear extensions each of which is
a completion or a possible world1 of the partial order the
preferences of all voters are referred to as a voting profile
a voting profile of complete rankings is a complete voting
profile while that of incomplete preferences is an incomplete
we use completion and possible world interchangeably
voting profile voters are assumed to cast their preferences independently a completion of an incomplete voting profile is
a complete voting profile obtained by replacing each voters
partial order with one of its completions
there have been various interpretations of winners proposed for this setting the most thoroughly studied are the
necessary and possible winners konczak and lang 2005
a candidate is an necessary winner nw if she wins in every
possible world she is a possible winner pw if she wins in at
least one possible world the nw and pw semantics are simple but they have shortcomings that make them impractical
the requirement for nw is so strict that there are often no
winners available in a voting profile under this interpretation
while the requirement for pw does not differentiate between
a candidate who only wins in one possible world and another
candidate who only loses in one possible world
bachrach et al 2010 assume that an incomplete voting
profile of partial orders represents a uniform distribution over
its completions and prefer the candidates who enjoy victory
in more possible worlds we refer to this winner semantics as
most probable winner mpw while this semantics is well
defined under any voting rule and while it can be extended
in a straightforward way to incorporate the probability of a
completion of a voting profile into the computation computing a winner under mpw is known to be intractable already
under plurality bachrach et al 2010
hazon et al 2012 also investigates mpw but under a different setting where voter preferences are specified explicitly
by rankings and their associated probabilities they proved
that it is phard to compute the candidate winning probabilities under plurality kapproval borda copeland and bucklin and provided an approximation algorithm
in this paper we propose the most expected winner
mew as an alternative winner interpretation for incomplete
voter preferences under positional scoring rules like mpw
it adopts the possible world semantics of incomplete voting
profiles however in contrast to mpw that determines a winner by a weighted count of the possible worlds in which she
wins mew follows the principle of scorebased rules that
highscoring candidates should be favored specifically an
mew is the candidate who has the highest expected score in
a random possible world
mew and mpw are similar in that they both aggregate
election results over all possible worlds and give a balanced
voter

table 1 a probabilistic voting profile for voters x and y each
voter casts her vote independently of the other leading to 4 possible worlds listed with their probabilities pr1  3 035
pr1  4 035 pr2  3 015 and pr2  4 015 under
the plurality rule candidate a is the mpw with a winning probability of pr1  3  pr1  4 07 while candidate b is the mew
with expected score pr2  x pr3  y030508
evaluation of the candidates their difference lays in the aggregation methods which will be discussed in detail in section 32 in practice mew and mpw yield the same result often but not always table 1 gives an example where
mew and mpw select different winners in an election with
two voters and three candidates under the plurality rule in
this election each voter produces a full ranking drawn from
a probability distribution over 1  ha b ci 2  hb a ci
3  hb c ai 4  hc b ai with probabilities of each ranking for each voter given in table 1 since the voter preferences are probabilistic distributions of rankings the corresponding voting profile is named a probabilistic voting profile let prx  y  denote the probability that voter x and y
cast ranking x and y  assume there is no correlation between voters x and y then prx  y   prx  x  pry 
y eg pr1  3   07  05  035 this voting profile
effectively generates 4 possible worlds as in the caption of
table 1 the plurality rule rewards a candidate with 1 point
every time she is ranked at the top of a ranking in the profile
so in the possible world of pr1  3  candidates a obtains 1
point from 1 and b obtains 1 point from 3  and both of them
become cowinners in this possible world after enumerating all 4 possible worlds we find that candidate a is the mpw
with probability 07 to be a cowinner while candidate b is
the mew with expected score of 08 point
by the way if applying the borda rule that rewards a candidate with the number of candidates ranked after her in a
ranking every time in the possible world of pr1  3  candidate a would obtain 2 points from 1  while candidate b
would obtain 1 point from 1 and 2 points from 3  candidate b would be the only nw of this profile and she would
also be the mew with an expected score of 28 points
the main technical contribution of this paper is an investigation of computational complexity of mew the problem
statement is given formally in section 33 another contribution is the modeling of uncertain voter preference for
two distinct sources the first is uncertainty in the preferences themselves a voter may not feel strongly about the
relative ordering of some pair of candidates or more generally their preference may be drawn from some probability
distribution marden 1995 we refer to this as uncertainty
in preference generation the second is uncertainty in the
observation a voting mechanism eg approval ballots or
a ranking of at most k  m candidates may not allow the
voters to fully reveal their preferences with this understanding in section 2 we will classify voting profiles into prob
table 2 examples of positional scoring rules
abilistic profiles uncertainty during generation incomplete
profiles uncertainty during observation and combined profiles this classification gives us a framework within which
to study the complexity of identifying mew by computing
expected scores of the candidates recall that fpp is a class
of functions efficiently solvable with an oracle to some p
problem a function f is fpp hard if there is a polynomialtime turing reduction from any fpp function to f  while
it turns out that the mew problem is fpp complete under
plurality veto and kapproval rules for the general case of
uncertain profiles section 4 we will also identify interesting cases where it is tractable to compute the expected scores
and determine the mew section 5
uncertain voting profiles
we now propose a novel framework for representing uncertainty in voter preferences and introduce a unified voting profile that explicitly models different types of uncertainty that
can arise in preference generation and elicitation
voting preliminaries let us denote by c  c1      cm 
a set of candidates or items2  by v  v1      vn  a set of
voters and by p  1      n  a complete voting profile
where i is a ranking over c by voter vi  ranking  is a bijection between candidates and ranks where  i is the candidate at rank i and  1 c is the rank of candidate c in  
positional scoring rules are arguably the most thoroughly
studied voting rules let rm  rm 1  rm m denote
a positional scoring rule where 1  i  j  m rm i 
rm j and rm 1  rm m it assigns a score rm i to the
candidate at rank i table 2 lists several popular positional
scoring rules
the performance of a candidate c is the sumpof her scores
across the entire voting profile sc p  
 p sc  
where sc    rm  1 c candidate w is a cowinner
if her score is no less than the score of any other candidate
uncertainty in voter preferences in classical voting theory voters give complete rankings over candidates however
in practice only partial preferences may be observed due to
the voting mechanism eg when approval ballots or a ranking of at most k  m candidates are elicited the uncertainty
in preferences themselves marden 1995 or both figure 1
represents uncertainty as two distinct steps preference generation figure 1a and preference observation figure 1b
important special cases of voting profiles are discussed next
candidates are used in the context of voting while items are for
general preference analysis in this paper they are interchangeable
uncertainty in profile generation the most general form
of voter preferences over rankings is a nonparametric probability distributions such as that given in table 1 let p m 
m1      mn  denote a probabilistic voting profile where mi
is the ranking model of voter vi  a possible world of p m is
a complete voting profile p  1      n  where each i is
sampled from mi  it is assumed that the voters
qn cast their ballots independently ie prp  p m   i1 pri  mi 
so p m represents a probability distribution of its possible
worlds p m   p1      pz 
let sc m and sc p m  denote the scores assigned to
candidate c by model m and the probabilistic voting profile
p m  respectively note that they both are random variables
partial voting profiles are a special cases of probabilistic
voting profiles since they are based on the assumption that all
completions are equally likely below are a few other cases
a uniform voting profile denoted by p u  is a trivial case
where no voter has any preference between any two candidates each voters preferences are sampled from the uniform
distribution over the rankings of all candidates we list this
special case for convenience of discussion
there are specific important ranking models that we will
describe in section 5 the mallows model mallows 1957
is the best known and it is further generalized by the
repeated insertion model rim doignon et al 2004
and the ranking version of the repeated selection model
rsm chakraborty et al 2020 voting profiles consisting
of mallows rims and rsms ranking version are denoted
by p mal  p rim  and p rrsm  respectively we will see that
when the generation step is based on these models we have a
computational advantage for computing the mew
uncertainty in profile observation a partial voting profile denoted by p po  consists of partial orders and represents
a uniform distribution of its completions what follows are
its special cases
a partitioned voting profile denoted by p pp  records preferences in the form of partitions linear orders of item buckets with no preference among the items in the same bucket
a partial chain voting profile denoted by p pc  records
preferences in the form of partial chains a partial chain is
a linear order of a subset of items and there is no preference
specified with regard to the remaining items
a truncated voting profile denoted by p tr  records preferences in the form of truncated rankings let  tb denote
a truncated ranking with t items at the top and b items at the
bottom no preference information is specified for the middle part of the ranking the  tb is a special case of the
partitioned preferences with t  b  1 partitions
combined voting profiles most research works have assumed that a partial voting profile represents a uniform distribution over its completions however the assumption that all
completions are equally likely may not hold in practice we
propose combined voting profiles p mp  where each voter
is associated with both her original incomplete preferences
p and a ranking model m the ranking model m is her
prior preference distribution eg obtained from historical
data but after observing new evidence p  the probabilities of

b observation step
figure 1 the venn diagrams of voting profiles the voter preferences in their mind are the ranking models in the generation step
then we observe incomplete voting profiles that are essentially samples of the probabilistic voting profiles
rankings that violate p collapse to zero while the rest rankings that satisfy p have the same relative probabilities among
each other formally speaking the preferences of this voter
become the posterior distribution of m conditioned on p 
in another sense the combined voting profiles are also the
most general form of voting profiles same as p m  that unify
all voting profiles so far for example a partitioned voting
profile p pp is essentially p upp  and a rim voting profile
p rim is essentially p rim where  means that the partial
orders are the empty ones
among the tractable cases in section 5 there are also combined voting profiles which means that applying combined
voting profiles not only gains theoretical benefits of more customized ranking distributions but also becomes practical for
certain combination of profiles
most expected winner
given a general voting profile p m and a positional scoring
rule rm  the performance of a candidate can be quantified by
the expectation of her score in a random possible world
definition 1 mew given a voting profile p m and a positional scoring rule rm  candidate w is a most expected winner if and only if esw p m   maxcc esc p m 
let mewrm  p m  be the set of most expected winners
alternative interpretations
to gain an intuition for most expected winner mew we
will now give two winner definitions that are equivalent to
mew note that the proofs of all theorems in this section
are presented in the appendix
least expected regret winner
the mew can also be regarded as the candidate who minimizes the expected regret in a random possible world the
concept of regret is borrowed from lu and boutilier 2011
let regretw p  denote the regret value of choosing w 
c as the winner given a complete voting profile p 
regretw p   max sc p   sw p 
accordingly the regret value regretw p m  over a probabilistic voting profile becomes a random variable
eregretw p m  
regretc p   prp  p m 
p p m 
candidate w is a least expected regret winner if and only
if she minimizes the expected regret eregretw p m 
theorem 1 the mew and the least expected regret winner
are equivalent
metaelection winner
recall that a voting profile p m represents a probability distribution of possible worlds p m   p1      pz  the
metaelection winner is defined as the candidate who wins a
meta election with a large meta profile pm  p1      pz 
where rankings in pi are weighted by prpi  p m 
theorem 2 the mew and the metaelection winner are
equivalent
comparing mew and mpw
the difference between mew and mpw can be interpreted
as different aggregation approaches across possible worlds
recall that p m   p1      pz  is the set of possible
worlds of p m  each possible worldp
pi is associated with a
probability pi  prpi  p m  and i1 pi  1 now lets
see how the performance of a candidate c is aggregated across
possible worlds let 1 be the indicator function
 mew esc p m   i1 sc pi   pi
 mpw prc wins  i1 1c wins  pi   pi
mew estimates the average performance of a candidate
while mpw estimates the probability that she wins as a
result mpw ignores the possible worlds if she cannot win
problem statement
the mew is determined based on the expected performance
of the candidates so the winner determination problem of
mew can be reduced to the problem of calculating the expected scores of candidates that is given a voting profile
p m  a positional scoring rule rm  and a candidate c  c
calculate esc p m  the expected score of c we name this
problem expected score computation esc
theorem 3 the problem of determining mew can be reduced to the esc problem
hardness of esc
this section investigates the complexity of the esc problem
we first prove the hardness of two closely related problems
the fixedrank counting problem and the rank estimation
problem then we demonstrate that the esc problem is hard
as well the proofs to the theorems and lemmas in this section
are presented in the appendix
fixedrank counting problem
counting the number of linear extensions of a partial order
is wellknown to be pcomplete brightwell and winkler
1991 the fixedrank counting problem fcp is interested
in the number of linear extensions where an item is placed at
a specific rank let  denote the set of linear extensions
of  and n cj   denote the number of linear extensions
in  where item c is placed at rank j
definition 2 fcp given a partial order  over m items
an item c and an integer j  1 m calculate n cj  
the number of linear extensions of  where item c is placed at
rank j
loof 2009 discussed this problem in his doctoral dissertation section 421 he proposed both exact and approximate algorithms but did not provide a proof of complexity
theorem 4 the fcp is pcomplete
the hardness of fcp facilitates the hardness proofs for the
rank estimation problems
rank estimation problem
now we move on to the rank estimation problem rep
this problem can be regarded as the probabilistic version
of the fcp it calculates the probability that a given item is
placed at a specific rank but the rep is generalized from
partial orders to arbitrary ranking distributions
definition 3 rep given a ranking model m over m items
an item c and an integer j  1 m calculate prcj  m
the probability that item c is placed at rank j by m
for the convenience of discussions in the rest of this section we also define two special cases of the rep where items
are placed at the top and bottom of the linear extensions
definition 4 rept given a ranking model m of m items
and an item c calculate prc1  m the probability that
item c is placed at the top of a linear extension by m
definition 5 repb given a ranking model m of m items
and an item c calculate prcm  m the probability that
item c is placed at the bottom of a linear extension by m
lerche and srensen 2003 proposed an approximation
for the rep over partial orders but did not provide a formal complexity proof bruggemann and annoni 2014
and de loof et al 2011 also worked on a related problem
calculating the expected rank of an item in the linear extensions of a partial order these works focused on approximation lacking complexity proofs as well
with the help of theorem 4 it turns out that the rep and
its two variants are all fpp complete over partial orders
lemma 1 if the ranking model m is a partial order 
that represents a uniform distribution of  the rept is
fpp complete
lemma 2 if the ranking model m is a partial order  of
m items that represents a uniform distribution of  the
repb is fpp complete
theorem 5 if the ranking model m is a partial order  that
represents a uniform distribution of  the rank estimation problem is fpp complete
complexity of esc
the esc problem is closely related to rep first of all esc
is no harder than rep over general voting profiles theorem 6 which lays the foundation of the identification of
tractable cases in section 5
theorem 6 given a voting profile p m and a positional scoring rule rm  the esc problem can be reduced to the rep
theorem 7 the rep is equivalent to the esc problem over
a collection of kapproval rules where k  0     m
theorem 7 provides an insight into the relation between
rep and esc in terms of computational complexity there
may be cases where the esc problem is more tractable than
the rep problem but if a solver is available for the esc
problem over a collection of kapproval votes this solver is
computationally equivalent to the rep solver note that theorem 7 is not limited to partial voting profiles
theorem 8 given a partial voting profile p po  a distinguished candidate c and plurality rule rm  the esc problem
of calculating esc  p po  rm  is fpp complete
theorem 9 given a partial voting profile p po  a distinguished candidate c and veto rule rm  the esc problem of
calculating esc  p po  rm  is fpp complete

the esc problem over partial voting profiles under plurality veto and kapproval respectively in particular esc is

tractable cases
the problem of determining mew can be reduced to the esc
problem by theorem 3 then further reduced to the rep by
theorem 6 this section will solve the mew problem for
general positional scoring rules for a variety of voting profiles
by solving the rep
incomplete voting profiles
section 4 has proved that calculating the expected scores of
candidates given partial voting profiles is hard even under
plurality rule but it turns out that the mew problem has efficient algorithms for all special cases of partial voting profiles
in figure 1b including partitioned voting profiles covering
truncated voting profiles and partial chain voting profiles
theorem 11 given positional scoring rule rm  a partitioned
voting profile p pp  1pp      npp  and candidate w determining w  mewrm  p pp  is in omn
proof any  pp  p pp defines a set of consecutive ranks
in the linear extensions of  pp for each of its partitions of
candidates any candidate is equally likely to be positioned
at these consecutive ranks so the rep can be solved in o1
for any candidate thus the mew problem can be solved in
onm2  by calculating the expected scores of all candidates
it takes onm2  to obtain the expected scores of all candidates and to determine whether w is a mew
probabilistic voting profiles
while the problem of mew determination is hard in general
it is tractable over specific ranking models such as the mallows mallows 1957 and its generalizations rim doignon
et al 2004 and rsm chakraborty et al 2020
rim denoted by rim  is a generative model that
generalizes not only mallows but also the generalized mallows fligner and verducci 1986 and multistage ranking
models fligner and verducci 1988 it is parameterized by
a reference ranking  and a probability function  where
i j is the probability of inserting the ith item i at the
j th position 1  j  i during ranking construction the insertion procedure starts with an empty ranking   hi then
insert items in order of  where i is placed at the j th position of  with probability i j
example 1 rimha b ci  generates  hc a bi as follows initialize 0 hi when i  1 1 hai by inserting a
into 0 with probability 1 1 when i  2 2 ha bi by inserting b into 1 at position 2 with probability 2 2 when
i  3  hc a bi by inserting c into 2 at position 1 with
probability 3 1 overall pr  ha b ci 1 1

theorem 13 given positional scoring rule rm  a rim voting
profile p rim  rim1      rimn  and candidate w determining w  mewrm  p rim  is in onm4 
proof given any rim  p rim and any candidate c the
p rcj  rim for j  1     m can be calculated by algorithm 1 in om3  algorithm 1 is a variant of rimdp kenig
et al 2018 rimdp calculates the marginal probability of a
partial order over rim via dynamic programming dp algorithm 1 is simplified rimdp in a sense that algorithm 1
only tracks a particular item c while rimdp tracks multiple
items to calculate the insertion ranges of items that satisfy the
partial order note that algorithm 1 calculates all m different values of j simultaneously so it takes onm  m3  
onm4  to obtain the expected scores of m candidates over
n rims to determine the mew
the complexity of mew determination over rsm voting
profiles is onm4  as well due to space restrictions please
refer to section 82 in appendix for more details
combined voting profiles
it is usually harder to compute the expected scores over combined voting profiles below are some cases where this problem is tractable the first case is the rims combined with
truncated rankings

proof given any rim  tb   p rimtr  candidate c and
rank j if c is in the top or bottom part of  tb  its rank
has been fixed which is a trivial case if c is in the middle
part of  tb  we just need to slightly modify algorithm 1
to calculate prcj  rim  tb  line 5 in algorithm 1
enumerates values for j from 1 to i the constraints made by
 tb limits this insertion range of item i if i is in
the top or bottom part of  tb  its insertion position has been
fixed by  tb and the inserted items of the top and bottom
parts of  tb should be recorded as well by the state  0  if
i is in the middle part of  tb  i can be inserted into
any position between the inserted top and bottom items
theoretically the algorithm needs to track as many as
t  b  1 items but the t  b items are fixed which makes
c the only item leading to multiple states during dp the complexity of calculating prcj  rim  tb  for all j values is
om3  it takes onm4  to calculate the expected scores of
all candidates across all voters to determine the mew
another tractable case is the mallows combined with partitioned preferences let mal  where 0    1 denote a mallows model mallows 1957 it defines a probability distribution of rankings reference ranking  at the

cp denote the set of candidates in the same partition with c
in  pp  the relative orders between c and items out of cp
are already determined by  pp  that is to say for a nontrivial j value p rcj     pp  is proportional to the
exponential of the number of disagreed pairs within cp  so
we can construct a new mallows model mal0  0   over
cp  it has the same  as mal and its reference ranking  0 is
shorter than but consistent with  the p rcj  mal0   pp 
for all nontrivial j values can be calculated in ocp 3  
om3  by algorithm 1
the mew problem can be solved in onm4  by calculating the expected scores of all candidates across all voters to
determine whether w is a mew
summary
table 3 summarizes the tractable cases combining this table with figure 1 we can obtain more conclusions for a large
number of specialized voting profiles for example the mallows voting profile p mal is not listed in the table but its
mew complexity is bounded by onm4  since it is a special
case of p rim  an interesting observation is that the mew
complexity over p rimpp is not tractable but its special case
p malpp has a polynomial complexity although this table
demonstrates that evaluating mew over probabilistic voting
profiles has higher complexities than that over incomplete
voting profiles eg onm4  for p malpp but only onm2 
for p pp  the tractability results over a collection of probabilistic and combined voting profiles still give the mew a
computation advantage as a feasible option in practice
concluding remarks
we embarked on two tasks 1 modeling the uncertainty in
voter preferences and 2 determining the winners accordingly
distinguishing between uncertainties in preference generation and preference observation provides a powerful framework to describe and unify incomplete and probabilistic voting profiles then we proposed the most expected winner for
positional scoring rules established its theoretical hardness
and identified a collection of tractable cases
our work can be used as a starting point for future studies
for example the hardness of esc is proved over only plurality veto and kapproval which calls for investigation over
other positional scoring rules such as borda when the mew
is intractable it is often necessary to develop approximate
solvers such as the amp sampler for mallows posteriors over
partial orders lu and boutilier 2014 the mew can also
be extended to other scorebased rules such as the simpson
rule and the copeland rule
another direction is to consider voter preferences represented by additional ranking models marden 1995 such as
the plackettluce pl model luce 1959 plackett 1975
noothigattu et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 have studied preference aggregation over pl models which is closely related
to the mew over voting profiles of pl models and we plan
to investigate this connection in the future

additional proofs
t heorem 1 the mew and the least expected regret winner are equivalent
proof the expected regret of a candidate w can be rewritten
as follows
eregretw p m 
regretc pi   prpi  p m 
max sc pi   sw pi   prpi  p m 
max sc pi   prpi  p m   esw p m 
the first term i1 maxcc sc pi   prpi  p m  is
a constant value when p m and the voting rule are fixed
thus eregretw p m  is minimized by maximizing
esw p m  the expected score of the candidate w
t heorem 2
are equivalent
the mew and the metaelection winner
proof let p m denote a general voting profile with
p m   p1      pz  and pm  p1      pz  denote
the large meta profile where rankings in pi are weighted by
prpi  p m  according the definition of the metaelection
winner sw pm   maxcc sc pm  as a result for any
candidate c
esc p m  
sc p   prp  p m   sc pm 
p p m 
her expected score in p m are precisely her score in pm  the
two winner definitions are optimizing the same metric
t heorem 3 the problem of determining mew can be
reduced to the esc problem
proof by solving the esc problem m times for m candidates the expected scores of all candidates are available to
further determine the mew
t heorem 4 the fcp is pcomplete
proof first we prove its membership in p the fcp is the
counting version the following decision problem given a partial order  an item c and an integer j determine whether 
has a linear extension    where c is ranked at j this
decision problem is obviously in np meaning that the fcp is
in p
then we prove that the fcp is phard by reduction recall that counting  the number of linear extensions
of a partial order  is pcomplete brightwell and win this problem can be reduced to the fcp by
kler 1991p
  j1 n cj  
in conclusion the fcp is pcomplete
l emma 1 if the ranking model m is a partial order 
that represents a uniform distribution of  the rept is
fpp complete
proof first we prove that the rept is in fpp  recall
that  is the linear extensions of a partial order  and
n c1   is the number of linear extensions in  where
candidate c is at rank 1 then prc1    n c1 
 consider that counting n c1   is in p theorem 4 and counting  is pcomplete brightwell and
winkler 1991 so prc1   is in fpp 
in the rest of this proof we prove that the rept is phard by reduction from the pcomplete problem of counting
let c denote an item that has no parent in  let c
denote the partial order of  with item c removed if we are
interested in the probability that c is placed at rank 1 we can
write prc 1    n c 1   the item c has
been fixed at rank 1 so any placement of the rest items will
definitely satisfy any relative order involving c  that is to
say the placement of the rest items just need to satisfy c 
which leads to n c 1    c 
for example let  0  c1  c4  c2  c4  c3  c4  then
n c1 1   0   c
  c2  c4  c3  c4 
then we rewrite prc 1    n c 1   
c  the oracle for prc 1   manages
to reduce the size of the counting problem from  to
c  this oracle should be as hard as counting 
thus calculating prc 1   is fpp hard
in conclusion the rept is fpp complete
l emma 2 if the ranking model m is a partial order 
of m items that represents a uniform distribution of  the
repb is fpp complete
proof this proof adopts the same approach as the proof of
lemma 1
for the membership proof that the repb is in fpp 
let n cm   denote the number of linear extensions
in  where candidate c is at the bottom rank m then
prcm    n cm   consider that
counting n cm   is in p theorem 4 and counting
 is pcomplete brightwell and winkler 1991 so
prcm   is in fpp 
in the proof of lemma 1 item c is an item with no parent
in the partial order  in the current proof item c is set to be
an item with no child in  the c still denotes the partial
order of  but with item c removed then the probability that
item c at the bottom rank m is prc m    n c m 
  c  the oracle for prc m 
 manages to reduce the size of the counting problem again
from  to c  thus this oracle is phard and
calculating prc m   is fpp hard
in conclusion the repb is fpp complete
p rcj  mi  for all m candidates and n voters which leads
to the complexity of on  m  t
t heorem 5 if the ranking model m is a partial order
 that represents a uniform distribution of  the rank
estimation problem is fpp complete
t heorem 8 given a partial voting profile p po  a distinguished candidate c and plurality rule rm  the esc problem
of calculating esc  p po  rm  is fpp complete
proof first we prove that the rep is in fpp  recall
that  is the linear extensions of a partial order  and
n cj   is the number of linear extensions in 
where candidate c is at rank j then prcj   
n cj   consider that counting n cj 
 is pcomplete theorem 4 and counting  is
pcomplete brightwell and winkler 1991 as well so
prcj   is in fpp 
lemma 1 demonstrates that rept a special case of rep
is fpp hard thus rep is phard as well
in conclusion rep is fpp complete
proof firstly we prove the membership of the esc problem
as a fpp problem consider that the rep is fpp complete
over partial orders theorem 5 and the esc problem can be
reduced to the rep theorem 6 so the esc problem is in
fpp for partial voting profiles
secondly we prove that the esc problem is fpp hard
even for plurality rule by reduction from the rept that is
fpp hard lemma 1
let  denote the partial order of the rept problem recall
that the rept problem aims to calculate prc1   for a
given item c let p  denote a voting profile consisting of just
this partial order  the answer to the rept problem is the
same as the answer to the corresponding esc problem ie
prc1    esc  p   plurality so the esc problem
is fpp hard even for plurality voting rule
in conclusion the esc problem is fpp complete under
plurality rule
t heorem 6 given a voting profile p m and a positional
scoring rule rm  the esc problem can be reduced to the rep
proof recall that the mew w maximizes the expected
score ie
sw p m   max esc p m 
the voting profile p m contains n ranking distributions
m1      mn  so
esc p m  
esc mi 
where esc mi  is the expected score of c from voter vi 
esc mi  
p rcj  mi   rm j
where cj denotes candidate c at rank j and rm j is the
score of rank j
let t denote the complexity of calculating p rcj  mi 
the original mew problem can be solved by calculating
t heorem 7 the rep is equivalent to the esc problem
over a collection of kapproval rules where k  0     m
proof the esc problem has be reduced to the rep theorem 6 this proof will focus on the other direction ie
reducing the rep to the esc problem
let prcj  m denote the probability of placing candidate c at rank j over a ranking distribution m let p m denote
a singlevoter profile consisting of only this ranking distribution m then the rep can be reduced to solving the esc
problem twice under japproval and j  1approval rules
prcj  m  esc  p m  japproval
 esc  p m  j  1approval
t heorem 9 given a partial voting profile p po  a distinguished candidate c and veto rule rm  the esc problem of
calculating esc  p po  rm  is fpp complete
proof this proof adopts the same approach as the proof of
theorem 8
firstly the membership proof that the esc is in fpp is
based on the conclusions that the rep is fpp complete over
partial orders theorem 5 and that the esc can be reduced
to the rep theorem 6 so the esc is in fpp for partial
voting profiles
secondly we prove that the esc is fpp hard under veto
voting rule by reduction from the repb that is fpp hard
lemma 2
let  denote the partial order of the repb problem recall that the repb problem aims to calculate prcm  
algorithm 2 rep solver for rrsm
input item c rank k rrsm 
output prck

generate a new state h0   0 i  h  1 i

end if
if   0 then
generate a new state h0   0 i  h   1i
pi addh0   0 i

end for

hipk1 qk1 h i  k   1
for a given item c let p  denote a voting profile consisting of just this partial order  the answer to the esc indirectly solves the repb ie prcm    1  esc 
p   veto so the esc problem is fpp hard under veto
rule
in conclusion the esc is fpp complete under veto rule
t heorem 10
given a partial voting profile p po 
a distinguished candidate c and kapproval rule rm  the
esc problem of calculating esc  p po  rm  is fpp complete
proof first the proof that the expected score computation
esc is in fpp is the same as the proof of theorem 8
now we prove that the esc problem is fpp hard under kapproval rule rm  by reduction from the rept problem that
is fpp hard lemma 1
let  denote the partial order of the rept problem recall
that the rept problem aims to calculate prc1   for a
given item c let  denote a new partial order by inserting
k  1 ordered items d1      dk1 into  such that item
dk1 is preferred to every item in  such placement of items
d1      dk1  is to guarantee that all linear extensions of
 start with d1      dk1 and these linear extensions
will be precisely the linear extensions of  after removing
d1      dk1 
let p  denote a voting profile consisting of just this partial order   the answer to the esc problem for item c is
esc  p   kapproval since there is only one partial
order  in the voting profile esc  p   kapproval 
j1 prcj    recall that the first k  1 items in
any linear extension of  starts with d1      dk1  so
1  j  k  1 prcj     0 which leads to esc 
p   kapproval  prck    since  is constructed
by inserting k  1 items before items in  prck    
prc1   so esc  p   kapproval  prc1  
the answer to the rept problem has been reduced to the
esc problem so the esc problem is fpp hard under kapproval rule
in conclusion the esc problem is fpp complete under
kapproval rule
mew tractability over rsm voting profiles
rsm chakraborty et al 2020 denoted by rsm p  is
another generalization of the mallows it is parameterized by
a reference ranking  a probability function  where i j
is the probability of the j th item selected at step i and a probability function p  1  m  1  0 1 where pi is the
probability that the ith selected item preferred to the remaining items in contrast to the rim that randomizes the item
insertion position the rsm randomized the item insertion order in this paper we will use rsm as a ranking model ie
p  1 such that it only outputs rankings this ranking version
is named rrsm and denoted by rrsm 
example 2 rrsm  with   ha b ci generates
 hc a bi as follows initialize 0 hi when i  1 1 hci
by selecting c with probability 1 3 which making the remaining   ha bi when i  2 2 hc ai by selecting a
with probability 2 1 which making the remaining  
hbi when i  3  hc a bi by selecting b with probability
3 1 overall pr   1 3  2 1  3 1
theorem 16 given a positional scoring rule rm  a rsm voting profile p rrsm  rrsm1      rrsmn  and candidate w
determining w  mewrm  p rrsm  is in onm4 
proof given any rrsm  p rrsm  candidate c and rank j
the p rcj  rrsm is computed by algorithm 2 in a fashion that is similar to algorithm 1 this is also a dynamic
programming dp approach the states are in the form of
h i where  is the number of items before c and  is
that after c in the remaining  for state h i there are
  1   items in the remaining  algorithm 2 only runs
up to i  k  1 in line 3 since item c must be selected at
step k and the rest steps do not change the rank of c any more
each step i generates at most i  1 states corresponding to
0     i items are selected from items before c in the original
 the complexity of algorithm 2 is bounded by om2  it
takes onm4  to obtain the expected scores of all candidates
and to determine the mew
example 3 let rrsm  denote a rsm where  
h1  2  3  4 i and   01 03 04 02 02 05 03
03 07 1 assume we are interested in pr2 3   
the probability of rrsm  placing 2 at rank 3
 before running rsm there is 0  1 item before 2
and 0  2 items after 2 in  so the initial state is
h0  0 i  h1 2i and q0 h1 2i  1
 at step i  1 the selected item can be either from 1 
or 3  4  so two new states are generated here
 the 1 is selected with probability 1 1 
01 which generates a new state h0 2i and
q1 h0 2i  q0 h1 2i  1 1  01
 an item   3  4  is selected with probability
1 3  1 4  06 which generates a new
state h1 1i and q1 h1 1i  q0 h1 2i  06  06
so p1  h0 2i h1 1i and q1  h0 2i 7
01 h1 1i 7 06
 at step i  2 iterate states in p1 
 for state h0 2i the selected item must be from
the last two items in remaining reference ranking
a new state h0 1i is generated with probability
2 2  2 3  08
 for state h1 1i the selected item is either the first
or last item in remaining reference ranking a new
state h0 1i is generated with probability 2 1 
01 and another state h1 0i is generated with probability 2 3  03
so p2  h0 1i h1 0i and
 q2 h0 1i  q1 h0 2i  08  q1 h1 1i  01 
01  08  06  01  014
 q2 h1 0i  q1 h1 1i  03  06  03  018
 at step i  3 item 2 must be selected to meet the requirement for each state h i  p2  the rank of 2
is   1 in the corresponding remaining ranking so
pr2 3     q2 h0 1i  3 1  q2 h1 0i
