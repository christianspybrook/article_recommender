i i ntroduction
imevarying electromagnetic devices exhibit frequency conversion ie the generation of spectral content
not existing in an applied excitation historically timevarying
elements have been commonplace within circuit systems used
to perform up or downconversion more recently spatiotemporally spacetime modulated materials have been applied
to bring about similar frequency conversion phenomena in
distributed systems the analytic study of spacetime materials
has so far been largely driven by methods involving homogeneous media 13 the polarizability of single particles
4 guided wave systems 5 planar structures 615 or
systems with inherent cylindrical symmetry 16 17
many of these analytic studies explicitly or implicitly
apply conversion matrix techniques 18 commonly used in the
study of timevarying circuits to analyze harmonic generation
within this framework linear timevarying components or
materials act as coupling elements between otherwise decoupled linear timeinvariant physical problems at multiple
frequencies recently this approach was integrated with the
method of moments as an alternative to the finite difference
time domain fdtd method for the analysis of arbitrary
timevarying electromagnetic systems 19 20 despite the
flexibility of fdtd and other numerical methods as computational tools for studying timevarying systems analytic
or quasianalytic methods remain attractive due to their low
computational cost and their ability to accurately model many
problems based on canonical geometries
in this work we develop an analytic solution for the fields
scattered by a dielectric sphere coated with a thin shell of

timevarying conductivity this study is motivated by the possible implementation of timevarying surfaces through dense
networks of lumped timevarying components eg switches
or through the modulation of inherently surfacebased materials eg carbon nanostructures 11 the solution leverages
aspects of both classical mie scattering theory 21 as well
as conversion matrix 18 methodologies it shares many
features with the solution of analogous problems involving
static impedance boundary conditions 22 23 timevarying
planar and cylindrical structures 16 17 24 timevarying
dielectric spheres 25 and spheres constructed from nonlinear media 26 27 though the formulation and examples
studied here are unique to the spherical shell configuration
in an effort to establish connections between the timevarying shell geometry and other scattering problems both
simpler and more complex we carry out this analysis by
several means each with a unique engineering perspective
generality and adaptability to other problems we begin by
approaching the problem via classical mie theory for the
special case of plane wave incidence using explicit forms
of all field components we then generalize the approach
to arbitrary external excitation to arrive at a transition t
matrix formulation compatible with general external excitation
and multiscatterer systems 28 finally we adapt the tmatrix formulation into a transmission line problem giving
rise to a conversion matrix form of the reflection coefficient
observed at an impedance interface several examples are then
discussed and validated against numerical methods namely
conversion matrix method of moments cmmom trends
in farfield scattering and nearfield focusing behavior are
explored through supplementary examples

and dn described by a basis of monochromatic signals we
may interpret all terms in the above boundary conditions as
diagonal operators with the exception of the convolution terms
which naturally give rise to cross frequency coupling as
expected we see that the te and tm excitation coefficients
are fully decoupled

again with respect to a basis of monochromatic signals
the operator an is always diagonal whereas the operator
bn associated with the surface conductivity is in general
not diagonal from this reduced operator expression we
immediately recognize simplifications arising from several
important special cases first when the surface conductivity is
identically zero the operator bn vanishes yielding the classical
tm scattering coefficients for a dielectric sphere similarly if
the surface conductivity is purely static not varying in time
the operator bn becomes diagonal 22 additionally if the
inner medium has the same material properties as the external
medium ie r  r  1 then an becomes the identity
operator two special cases reduce the above system to one of
a pec sphere either t   for all time or r  j

and the frequency dependence of gn  an  bn  cn  and dn
has been suppressed due to multiplication in time mapping

conditions in 16 and 17 is more complex reading
the preceding formulation involves integral operators
whose kernels depend on the frequency domain representation
of the surface conductivity  in order to systematically
solve these equations we consider the special case in which
the timevariation of the surface conductivity is periodic the
aim of this simplification is to recast 28 and 30 as matrix

fig 2 schematic of transmission line scattering model the left and right
transmission lines represent the exterior and interior regions respectively
while the shunt conductance represents the surface conductivity
admittance matrix has off diagonal elements which account
for frequency conversion due to the timevarying conductivity
additionally since the incident wave is represented by a
standing bessel wave whose nominal propagation direction is
chosen outward the sign of the magnetic field is the same for
all wave components so the numerator and denominator
both appear as subtractions lengthy manipulations outlined
in app b demonstrate an equivalence between the result in
79 and that obtained via transition matrix formulation in 67
the intuitive construction of the equivalent circuit in fig 2
suggests that the study of more complex systems eg layered
media or shells may be facilitated through the use of similar
transmission line methods

where the convolution term in 57 is represented by crossfrequency offdiagonal terms in the conversion matrix 
interpreting 56 and 75 as the voltage and current boundary conditions at a transmission line junction it is clear that the
surface of the sphere appears as a timevarying conductance
in parallel with the input admittance looking into the core
this configuration is depicted in fig 2 where a compressed
notation is used to depict wave impedances in each region
because of the orthogonality of vector spherical harmonics
no mode conversion occurs at the surface of the sphere but
the timevarying boundary condition does result in frequency
conversion thus while each harmonic frequency satisfies
72 independently 75 relates multiple harmonic frequencies
simultaneously and cannot be separated into an independent
equation for each frequency
we now set out to derive the scattered modal voltage v
using classical transmission line techniques let
  v
where  is a multifrequency reflection coefficient matrix
that relates the incident and scattered wave amplitudes in the
 mode at all frequencies by combining 56 75 and 76
and eliminating v
 we obtain

where the input admittance conversion matrix looking into the
combined coreshell structure at each frequency is

the expression for the multifrequency reflection coefficient
matrix in 79 has the same form as that arising from an lti
transmission line interface with the major distinction that 79
represents a multiharmonic system with conversion between
frequencies again we note that the incident and outwardgoing wave admittances are diagonal matrices while the input

matrix method of moments cmmom technique 20 developed for the study of conducting structures loaded with

excitation p  0 harmonic far outweighs scattering in upand downconverted p 6 0 harmonics both methods agree
to within 4 in all reported quantities for small electrical
sizes ka  5 more significant discrepancies appear for larger
electrical sizes where the number of cmmom basis functions
limits the ability to accurately represent intricate higherorder
mode shapes particularly in upconverted harmonics
more k  100 harmonics are required to reach numerical
precision
these examples illustrate the basic convergence properties
of scattering from timevarying shells with simple resistance
and conductance properties more importantly however they
demonstrate the increase in complexity and computational cost
when certain classes of surface conductivity fourier spectra
are used for analytical methods such as those presented
in this paper the increase in computational complexity is
manageable however this rapid scaling may quickly outpace computational resources in numerical methods such as
cmmom where multifrequency n port impedance matrices
with dimensions scaling linearly with both the number of
harmonics and number of ports must be computed stored
and inverted
b convergence characteristics
as in circuit applications of conversion matrix methods the
number of temporal harmonics must be sufficiently high to
ensure accurate field and efficiency calculations we expect
the required number of temporal harmonics 2k  1 to depend on many factors and here we examine a few of these
dependencies using two simple test cases
as an example of a system with relatively few harmonic
components in the matrix  we consider an aircore sphere
with surface conductivity of the form of 80 where 0 
1 1    0110  and   099 the resulting matrix  is
tridiagonal the electrical size of the sphere is swept over the
values ka  005 05 5 and the multiharmonic scattering

all three electrical sizes are collected at each value of k and
plotted for the p  2  2 harmonics in fig 4 labeled by
a circle annotated with t these results indicate that for
all electrical sizes this particular example converges rapidly
to numerical precision for k  15
to model a system with much richer harmonic content we
additionally examine a sphere with surface resistance of the
form of 48 with   099 r0  500  and   011
convergence results from this analysis are also shown on
fig 4 labelled by a circle annotated with rt in this case
the fourier spectrum of the corresponding surface conductivity
truncated to k harmonics is no longer sparse and many

paper we now deviate from measures of accuracy and instead
leverage the speed of these analytic methods to examine in
detail the unique capabilities of scatterers with strong timevarying behavior
a study of surface and core characteristics
harmonic generation in the spherical system studied in this
paper depends on many system parameters here we maintain
the simple surface resistance time dependence in 48 with
  09   150  and ka  2 to examine the effect of
material parameters namely the core relative permittivity r
and surface resistance r0  on harmonic scattering in fig 5
we plot the scattering efficiencies qpsc for p  2  2 as
functions of these two material parameters for reference the
limiting cases when the core is constructed of air r  1
the shell is pec t   and the shell is nonexistent

from this study we observe that harmonic generation is
maximized near r0   for all core permittivities comparing

similar timevarying conductor 20 with harmonic scattering
efficiencies maximized near values of resistivity r0 producing
maximum net absorption
two particular sets of material parameters are labelled as
points a and b within the middle panel of fig 5 the scattered
electric field in each of the p  2  2 harmonics at these
points are shown in fig 6 there up and downconversion
is clearly visible through the modification of standing wave
spatial frequency along with unique scattering behavior eg
directivity and overall intensity within each harmonic note
that only the scattered field is shown in the p  0 excitation
frequency this is not the total field and as expected there
exists a field discontinuity at the boundary of the sphere for
p 6 0 harmonics the scattered field is the total field and no
such discontinuity exists
b harmonic nearfield generation
moving away from the study of scattering crosssections we
now turn our attention toward harmonic nearfield generation
we consider a sphere of electrical size ka  2 coated with a
resistive shell governed by 48 with   09 and   150 
defining an observation point r obs  a2 within the
core see fig 8 for schematic of observation location we
compute the normalized electric field magnitude esc
within each harmonic again as a function of core relative
permittivity r and surface resistivity r0  this field magnitude
for the first upconverted harmonic p  1 is shown in
fig 7 where three distinct classes of behavior are apparent
first when the surface resistance r0 is very low the system
behaves approximately as a pec sphere with slight coupling
between internal and external fields in this regime we observe
that the p  1 harmonic field magnitudes are maximized
at the observation location over extremely narrow ranges of
core permittivity corresponding to internal resonances of the
sphere hence the name resonant coupling used to define this
mode of operation as the surface resistance increases the
qfactor of these resonances decreases eventually leading to
strong coupling of multimode field distributions in the range
01  r0   10 here the harmonics generated by the timevarying shell exist both inside the sphere and as outward
propagating scattered fields as the resistance r0 becomes
very large no currents are induced on the shell making it
effectively transparent and harmonic fields tend toward zero
though not visible in fig 7 in this weak coupling regime
internal fields are maximized when the harmonic frequency of
interest coincides approximately with the external resonances
of the dielectric sphere in isolation
in fig 8 field distributions at the excitation p  0 and
first harmonic p  1 frequencies are shown for a selection of
resistance and core permittivity values labeled as points ae in
fig 7 selected for their high internal field magnitude and low
values of resistance r0  cases a c and d represent resonant
coupling between the excitation field and the first harmonic
internal fields in these cases the first harmonic internal
field distributions are effectively those corresponding to the
internal resonances of a dielectricfilled pec shell because it
is unlikely and not the case in any of these examples that the
sphere has internal resonances at both the excitation and first
harmonic frequencies we observe that the internal fields at the
excitation frequency are effectively zero in contrast cases b
and e exist in the strong coupling regime where the conductive
shell is semitransparent and significant internal and external
fields exist at both excitation and harmonic frequencies
c trends in harmonic detuning
here we study the effective detuning of a spheres natural
internal and external resonances due to upconversion pro

cesses enabled by a timevarying conductive shell following
the nomenclature of 25 we begin by defining external
resonances of an uncoated dielectric sphere as the set of
 producing maximal scattering efficiency
frequencies ext
in the weak coupling regime where surface currents can
be considered as a perturbation on an otherwise uncoated
dielectric sphere we anticipate that if energy is coupled
into the harmonic p  the scattering efficiency qpsc will be
maximized when that frequency corresponds to one of the
external resonances of the dielectric core ie when
ext

is satisfied in fig 9 we plot the scattering efficiency of the
first p  1 and second p  2 upconverted harmonics

r0   102 and   025 the external resonance frequencies
ext
 are plotted as vertical dashed lines while combinations
of excitation and shell frequencies satisfying 84 are drawn
as diagonal dashed lines we observe that the maximum
scattering efficiencies typically align with the condition in
fig 8 scattered fields in the excitation p  0 and first upconverted
frequency p  1 corresponding to the annotated positions in fig 7 all
fields are normalized to the incident field magnitude
journal of latex class files vol xx no xx may 4 2021
84 though harmonic generation is enhanced particularly for
cases with   0 where both the harmonic frequency and
the excitation frequencies are near an external resonance
similarly in the resonant coupling regime we expect that
internal field magnitudes will be maximized for the harmonic
frequency p when that frequency corresponds to one of the
internal resonances int
 of the peccoated dielectric core
ie when
int
 p  0  p
is satisfied in fig 10 we plot the normalized field magnitude
sampled at r obs  a2 in the first upconverted p  1
harmonic and the first downconverted p  1 harmonic
using the same setup as in fig 9 with the exception that
now the resistance is assigned as r0   102 and the
diagonal dashed lines correspond to the condition prescribed
in 85 for both the p  1 and the p  1 cases it is
clear that maximization of internal fields is governed by the
condition described in 85 with little dependence on the
electrical size at the excitation frequency the opposing slopes
of the p  1 case further show that maximization of the
internal field magnitudes also occurs when the downconverted
harmonic corresponds to the internal resonance of the system
ix c onclusions
in this work we develop a quasianalytic solution to scattering problems involving spheres coated with timevarying
conductive or resistive shells implementation of the method
requires only the evaluation of special functions and the
inversion of relatively small matrices this simplicity allows
for rapid exploration of highdimensional parameterizations
as demonstrated by the selected examples though the problem being studied is simple in nature it represents a class
of likely realizations of timevarying structures ie timevarying surface impedances implemented through the use of
densely patterned timevarying lumped components should
it be feasible to construct such a structure through the use

of switches or other elements the results from the examples
presented here indicate that several interesting behaviors
particularly up and downconversion in radiation and nearfields could be engineered through careful choice of system
parameters additional behaviors may be uncovered through
further exploration of multisphere systems using the proposed
tmatrix formulation
several assumptions limit the proposed method to simple
homogeneous media and we hypothesize that some of these
assumptions may be lifted by more general treatments of the
problem specifically the use of inhomogeneous or anisotropic
conductive shells inclusion of layered media adaptation to
timevarying reactive surfaces or impedance boundary conditions and combination with methods derived for timevarying
dielectrics all stand as tasks for future work in this area we
expect that the study of these generalizations will be aided
by a combination of the field transmission line and tmatrix
formulations presented in this work
