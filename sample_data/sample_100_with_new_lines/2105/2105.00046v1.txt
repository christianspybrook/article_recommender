abstract viscoenergetic solutions have been recently advanced as a new solution concept for rateindependent systems alternative to energetic solutionsquasistatic evolutions and balanced viscosity solutions in the
spirit of this novel concept we revisit the analysis of the variational model proposed by francfort and marigo
for the quasistatic crack growth in brittle materials in the case of antiplane shear in this context viscoenergetic solutions can be constructed by perturbing the time incremental scheme for quasistatic evolutions by
means of a viscous correction inspired by the term introduced by almgren taylor and wang in the study of
mean curvature flows with our main result we prove the existence of a viscoenergetic solution with a given
initial crack we also show that if the cracks have a finite number of tips evolving smoothly on a given time
interval viscoenergetic solutions comply with griffiths criterion

1 introduction
the variational approach to brittle fracture based on the classical theory by griffith gri20 was initiated
more than twenty years ago by francfort and marigo fm98 cf also bfm08 in these models crack
growth results from a tradeoff between the competing mechanisms of
 energy conservation with the driving energy given by the stored elastic energy
 energy dissipation which takes into account the dissipated energy spent to open the crack
in the case of antiplane shear the reference configuration is represented by a bounded connected lipschitz
domain   r2  the displacement u    r is scalar and the cracks are represented by compact subsets k
of  the evolution is triggered by a prescribed time dependent boundary condition u  gt on a subset
d  of  according to the model by francfort and marigo for a linearly elastic homogeneous isotropic
material the competing energy terms are

for simplicity the elastic constant and the toughness of the material are normalized to 1 
if k denotes the collection of all compact subsets of   a quasistatic evolution for the brittle fracture
model proposed in fm98 is a function k  0 t   k fulfilling the following conditions

namely the release of potential energy when passing from the current state kt to any other state
k   k is smaller than the energy dissipated that is why 12 can also be understood as a stability

involving the stored energy at the process times s and t the energy dissipated in the time interval
s t and the work of the external forces represented by the integral term
in dmt02b this crack model in the antiplane case was analyzed imposing a bound on the number of
connected components of the crack thus replacing the space k by the space km  of all compact subsets
of  with at most m connected components and finite 1 dimensional hausdorff measure the existence
of quasistatic evolutions satisfying i s and e was proved by constructing discretetime approximate
solutions given a partition 0  t0  t1      tn
  t of 0 t  the time incremental minimization scheme
ki  argmin eti  k  h1 kki1   k  km  k  ki1
for i  1     n
provides an approximate solution which converges to a continuoustime solution as the time step tends to 0 
ever since the analysis of quasistatic evolutions for crack propagation models has been extended in several
directions cf eg cha03 fl03 dmft05 dml10 fs18 furthermore thanks to their flexibility and
robustness the notion of quasistatic evolution and the parallel concept of energetic solution mt99 mt04
have been extensively applied to a broad class of rateindependent systems cf mr15 for a survey
nonetheless it has been known for some time that quasistatic evolutionsenergetic solutions have a drawback namely when the energy functional driving the system is nonconvex such evolutions as functions of
time may have too early and too long jumps between energy wells cf eg kmz08 ex 63 and the full
characterization of energetic solutions to 1 dimensional rateindependent systems proved in rs13 essentially
this is due to the global character of the stability condition s which involves the overall energy landscape
these considerations have motivated the quest of alternative weak solvability notions based on local rather
than global minimality
to our knowledge the first attempt in this direction dates back to dmt02a where as an alternative to
14 the following time incremental minimization scheme was proposed for brittle fracture growth still in the
twodimensional antiplane case
 u  h 1 k
ui  ki   argmin eti  k  h1 kki1   ku  ui1
 kl2   k  km  k  k
for i  1     n  with   0 a fixed constant the additional l2 contribution penalizes the l2 distance of
the updated discrete displacement ui from the previous ui1
 and thus enforces locality on the time discrete
level we also record the notion of fracture evolution by local minimality advanced in lar10
a more general approach to a reformulation of rateindependent evolution devoid of unnatural jumps was
pioneered in em06 it stemmed from the idea that rateindependent evolution originates in the limit of
systems governed by two time scales the fast inner scale of the system and the slow but dominant time
scale of the external forces in this perspective viscous dissipation is negligible during a time interval in which
the system evolves continuously but it is expected to enter into the system behavior at jumps thus one
selects those solutions to the original rateindependent system that arise as limits of solutions to the viscously
regularized system this procedure leads to an alternative solution concept featuring a local in place of a global
stabilityminimality condition and an energydissipation balance that provides a description of the system
behavior at jumps with the possible onset of viscous behavior on the one hand the vanishingviscosity
technique has been formalized in an abstract setting in mrs12 mrs16 cf also neg14 that codified the
properties of these vanishingviscosity solutions in the notion of balanced viscosity solution on the other hand
it has been developed and refined in various concrete applications cf eg dds11 bfm12 krz13 cl16
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
as far as brittle fracture models are concerned however the vanishingviscosity approach has been carried
out either assuming that the crack path is a priori known or in specific geometric settings cf eg tz09
cag08 kmz08 kzm10 lt11 lt13 alm17 cl17 all20 these restrictions are related to the fact that
the construction of balanced viscosity solutions ultimately relies on the validity of a suitable chain rule for the
energy functional driving the system which seems to be hard to obtain for more general fracture models
that is why finding an appropriate mathematical formulation for the evolution of brittle fracture as an
alternative to the notion of quasistatic evolution without specific assumptions on the cracks is still an uptodate and challenging issue in this paper we aim to contribute to it by showing how the concept of viscoenergetic solution to a rateindependent system recently introduced in ms18 can be successfully applied to
the twodimensional antiplane model first addressed in dmt02b
as we will see viscoenergetic solutions have a structure in between that of energetic and balanced viscosity
solutions this intermediate character is also apparent in their characterization obtained for onedimensional
systems in min17 in the results of rs17 and in their applicability to rateindependent systems in damage
plasticity and delamination cf ros19 here we are going to demonstrate that the model by francfort
and marigo at least in the versions considered in dmt02b and cha03 provides yet another example of
rateindependent process for which viscoenergetic solutions are an adequate tool while the balanced viscosity
concept fails to apply
viscoenergetic evolution of brittle fracture viscoenergetic hereafter often abbreviated as ve  solutions were introduced in ms18 in the context of an abstract rateindependent system whose state space is a
hausdorff topological space x  endowed with
1 a driving energy functional e  0 t   x    
2 a possibly asymmetric quasidistance d  x  x  0  that encodes the energy dissipation of
the system
in the spirit of dmt02a the key idea at the core of ve concept is to enforce locality by suitably perturbing
the time incremental minimization scheme in the general context addressed in ms18 this perturbation is
obtained by means of
3 a viscous correction namely a lower semicontinuous functional   x  x  0  compatible with
d in a suitable sense
the above elements constitute a viscously corrected rateindependent system x e  d 
revisiting the brittle fracture model analyzed in dmt02b within the approach of ms18 we work in the
ambient space
x  k endowed with the topology of the hausdorff distance h 
the evolution is driven by the energy functional e  0 t   k  0  defined in 11
instead of imposing a bound on the number of connected components of the crack we penalize the nucleation
of new connected components by means of the quasidistance k k   defined as the number of connected
components of k  disjoint from k  indeed we fix a constant   0 and we consider the dissipation distance
d  k  k  0  defined by
dk k    h1 k  k   k k  
if k  k   and set equal to  otherwise the additional term  k k   controls the number of connected
components and is important in order to obtain the lower semicontinuity of d with respect to the hausdorff
distance cf proposition 36 ahead the constant  plays the role of the energetic cost of the nucleation of a
new connected component of the crack
we have chosen as viscous correction the functional   k  k  0  given by

distx k dh1 x   k k

for some   0  in the regular case considered in section 6 when k  is close to k the integral contribution
to  is approximately the sum of the squares of the length increments of the branches of the crack a similar
term has already been used in lt11 lt13 to study a viscositydriven model of crack growth the integral
in 17 is well defined for arbitrary compact sets k and k   with no structural assumptions this term was
introduced by almgren taylor and wang in atw93 cf also dg93 ls95 where it plays the role of
a sort of l2 distance between k and k  in the minimizing movement scheme for the mean curvature flow
the term  k k   has a technical role related to the lower semicontinuity properties of   the constant 
can be interpreted as an additional energetic cost due to the nucleation of a new connected component
hereafter we shall refer to the quintuple
k e h d  as a viscously corrected rateindependent system for brittle fracture
along the footsteps of ms18 we construct discrete solutions by solving time incremental minimization

with k0  k0 the initial crack it turns out that for every i  1     n 18 admits a solution thanks to the
aforementioned lower semicontinuity properties of d and   and of the energy e our main result theorem
45 ahead states that there exists a vanishing sequence j j of time steps along which the discrete solutions
kj j  defined by piecewise constant interpolation of the minimizers ki n
i1  converge to a viscoenergetic
solution of the viscously corrected system k e h d  the latter is a curve k  0 t   k with
jump set jk  complying with the following conditions

for all 0  s  t  t 
in eve  the contribution jmpc keeps track of the energy dissipated at jumps and is defined in terms of the
viscoenergetic cost c introduced in 19 below
as we have mentioned before the structure of this solution concept is in between those of quasistatic
evolutions cf 12  13 and of balanced viscosity solutions on the one hand the stability condition
sve  though featuring the viscous correction  and holding only outside the jump set jk  still retains a
global character on the other hand in the energy balance eve  the dissipation of energy is not only recorded
by the dinduced total variation functional vard  but like in the case of balanced viscosity solutions also by
an additional term that measures the energy dissipated at the jump points of k in the interval s t ie
jmpc k s t the jump cost jmpc is in turn defined in terms of a functional c obtained by minimizing a
suitable transition cost along curves  connecting the two endpoints kt and kt of the curve k at
t  jk  namely
ct kt kt  inf trcve t  e  e  r   ce k e    kt 
where e   inf e and e   sup e  the transition cost

features
1 the  total variation of the curve 
2 a quantity related to the gaps or holes of the set e which is just an arbitrary compact subset of
r and may have a more complicated structure than an interval
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
3 a functional r  0 t   k  0  that keeps track of the violation of the ve stability condition
along the curve  as it fulfills rt s  0 if and only if s does not comply with sve  at the
process time t
it is in terms of the cost c that the ve concept offers an alternative description of the system behavior at
jumps in comparison with quasistatic evolutions indeed ve solutions satisfy the jump conditions
et kt  et kt  h1 ktkt  ct kt kt
for all t  jk 
cf proposition 46 ahead thus the release of elastic energy at a jump point is not only balanced by the length
of the crack opening like it would be for quasistatic evolutions but also by the viscoenergetic cost between
the two endpoints kt and kt
nonetheless if along the footsteps of dmt02b we assume that on some interval 0  1   0 t  the ve
solution constructed in theorem 45 has the additional property that the cracks kt have a fixed number of
tips which evolve smoothly on the interval 0  1  along simple and disjoint paths then we can prove that
griffiths criterion for crack growth is satisfied cf theorem 65 ahead this result is completely analogous to
dmt02b thm 84 for quasistatic evolutions it reflects the fact that ve solutions essentially differ from
quasistatic evolutions in the description of the energetic behavior of the system at jumps cf the characterization
provided by proposition 46 ahead
plan of the paper in section 2 we recall some preliminary results on hausdorff convergence and on the
properties of the elastic energy proved in dmt02b then in section 3 we introduce the dissipation distance
d and the viscous correction   and settle their basic properties section 4 is devoted to the precise definition
of viscoenergetic solutions and to the statement of our main existence result theorem 45 in section 5
the proof of theorem 45 is carried out by showing that the viscously corrected system for brittle fracture
k e h d  satisfies the conditions of the general existence result ms18 thm 39 which thus applies
yielding the existence of ve solutions the main result of section 6 theorem 65 provides a characterization
of the behavior at the crack tips of a ve solution k0 t   k in an interval 0  1  during which k
evolves continuously as a function of time and the crack set kt fulfills suitable geometric conditions finally
in section 7 we show how relying on the results from cha03 our existence result for ve solutions can be
extended to the planar case of linearized elasticity
2 notation and preliminaries
throughout the paper  is a fixed bounded connected open subset of r2 with lipschitz boundary as in
dmt02b we shall additionally suppose that the boundary of  decomposes into
 a neumann part n  which is a possibly empty relatively open subset of  with a finite number
of connected components
 the dirichlet part d     n   it turns out that d  is also a relatively open subset of  with
a finite number of connected components
the onedimensional hausdorff measure is denoted by h1  the set of all compact subsets of  is denoted
by k whereas km  is the set of all compact subsets k of  with at most m connected components
and h1 k  
the space k is endowed with the hausdorff distance h defined by
hh k  max sup distx k sup disty h
for all h k  k
where as usual distx k  minyk xy with the convention that distx   diam and sup   0 
so that h k  0 if k   and h k  diam if k 6   given kn n  k  k we will
often write kn  k whenever hkn  k  0  with a slight abuse of notation the topology induced by the
hausdorff distance is still denoted by h and the corresponding product topology on 0 t   k by hr  the
following compactness theorem is well known see eg rog70 blaschkes selection theorem
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
theorem 21 the metric space k h is compact
we will also make use of the following result cf dmt02b cor 33 34 derived from the goab theorem
cf eg ms95 thm 1019 it shows that the class km  is closed wrt hausdorff convergence and
that with respect to this notion of convergence the hausdorff measure h1 is lower semicontinuous on km 
while it is not lower semicontinuous on k
theorem 22 let m  1 and kn n  km

h1 k  u   lim inf h1 kn  u 
for every open set u  r2

continuous dependence of these gradients on the set k and on the boundary datum g  and will ensure the

viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
intervening in our notion of viscoenergetic evolution of brittle fracture upon introducing e d and   we
will also settle some of their basic properties in particular those underlying the definition of ve solution
further properties will be investigated in section 5 ahead when carrying out the proof of our existence result
theorem 45
the energy functional throughout the paper g  c1 0 t  h 1  is a fixed function whose trace on d 
plays the role of a timedependent dirichlet loading acting on d  the energy functional e  0 t   k 
0  is defined by
et k 
min
2 u dx
uvgtk
where the space of admissible displacements is given by 23 as we will see in proposition 51 ahead e is
lower semicontinuous on 0 t   k wrt to the product topology hr on 0 t   k along sequences
with bounded ddistance from some reference set ko  km  a straightforward calculation shows that the
power functional t et k exists for every t  0 t  and all k  k and that
t et k 
t  ut dx
where t  h  is the time derivative of the function g and ut  vgt k is a solution of the
minimum problem 31 the formula for t et k is well given since ut does not depend on the choice of
the minimizer cf section 2 the upcoming proposition 51 will collect all properties of e and t e that are
relevant for our analysis
the dissipation quasidistance preliminarily let us introduce a quasidistance between two sets h and k
that keeps track of the number of connected components of k disjoint from h  more precisely   k 
k  0  is defined in this way
h k is the number of the connected components of k that do not intersect h
if h  k  while h k   otherwise
our first result shows that  satisfies the triangle inequality
lemma 31 the function   k  k  0  fulfills
h l  h k  k l
for all h k l  k
proof it is enough to show 34 in the case in which h k   and k l   so that in particular
h  k  l  hence a subfamily of the connected components of l which are disjoint from h consists of
connected components of l which are disjoint from k  let n  k l and suppose that l has at least j
connected components l1      lj  disjoint from h and that the connected components of l disjoint from k
coincide with the sets ljn1      lj  we now have to prove that h k  j  n for this it suffices to
consider the connected components l1      ljn  intersecting k  for every l  1     j  n we have that
ll intersects at least a connected component kl of k  since k  l  we ultimately have that kl  ll  since
ll  h    also kl  h    therefore each connected component kl  l  1     j  n  contributes to
the number of connected components of k disjoint from h  which yields that h k  j  n since this
holds for every j  h l we obtain 34
secondly we prove that  is lower semicontinuous wrt hausdorff convergence
lemma 32 for all sequences kn n  hn n  k we have that
kn  k hn  h  h k  lim inf hn  kn  
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
proof preliminarily we prove the following
claim for every connected component k l of k and every x  k l there exists a sequence knl n such that
h bl
as n   for some connected set
knl is a connected component of kn for every n  n and knl  k
b l  kl 
b l  k such that x  k
indeed since kn  k  there exists a sequence xn n such that xn  x and xn  kn for every n  n let
b nl be the connected component of kn containing xn  by the blaschke selection and the goab theorems
b l n converge to a connected set k
b l  which clearly contains
up to a not relabeled subsequence the sets k
b l  kl 
x thus k
we are now in a position to prove 35 indeed suppose that there are h connected components k 1      k h
of k disjoint from h  for each l  1     h  select a point xl  k l and consider the connected sets knl n
b l whose existence is ensured by the previously proved claim then
and k
 l  1     h
 nl  n  n  nl 
knl  hn  
b l  h 6   hence k l  h 6   thus setting n  maxl1h nl  we have
otherwise we would have k
hn  kn   h
for all n  n
and 35 follows
our next key result shows that if h has a finite number of connected components and k  k contains
h and fulfills h k   then k also has a finite number of connected components
lemma 33 let h  kh  for some h  1  and let k  k contain h and fulfill h k  i  
then
k  km 
with m  h  i 
proof it suffices to observe that there are i connected components of k disjoint from h  each of the remaining
connected components of k intersects h and in fact contains at least one connected component of h  since
k  h  hence k has at most h connected components intersecting h 
for a given   0  we are now in a position to define the asymmetric dissipation quasidistance d by
d  k  k  0 
dh k  h1 kh   h k 
remark 34 the contribution   to d will have the role of controlling the growth of the number of
connected components of the viscoenergetic fracture evolution 0 t   t 7 kt it is exploiting this term
that we may prove the lower semicontinuity of d wrt to hausdorff convergence in fact extending the goab
theorem cf proposition 36 ahead the constant  can be interpreted as the nucleation cost of each new
connected component of the crack set
obviously
dk k  0
for every k  k
38a
on the other hand d separates the points of k namely for every h k  k
dh k  0 implies h  k 
38b
indeed dh k  0 implies that all the connected components of k have nonempty intersection with h 
then from h  k and h1 kh  0 we conclude that h  k  as an immediate consequence of lemma 31
we have that d satisfies the triangle inequality
proposition 35 the function d  k  k  0  fulfills
dh l  dh k  dk l
for all h k l  k
the lower semicontinuity of d wrt hausdorff convergence will be a consequence of the following result
which in fact generalizes the goab theorem
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
proposition 36 let hn  kn n  k  k be a sequence such that hn  h and kn  k  suppose
that the number of connected components of kn disjoint from hn is uniformly bounded wrt n  n then
h1 kh  u   lim inf h1 kn hn   u 
310
for every open set u  
proof clearly passing to a subsequence it is not restrictive to assume that there exists k  n such that
kn has k connected components disjoint from hn for all n  n
311
for clarity first of all we will show that 310 holds with u   and then we shall point out how the proof
can be adapted to yield the localized inequality 310
claim 1  we have
h1 kh  lim inf h1 kn hn 
312
clearly we may suppose that the righthand side is finite and up to a further extraction that

316
indeed let us consider the 1 lipschitz function f    0  defined by f x  distx v  since c is
a connected set f c is an interval it follows from the second of 315 and the fact that hn  v  that
0  f c furthermore by the first of 315 and since   distv   v  we also have that   f c so
that 0   f c in particular for every t  0  there exists x  c such that f x  dx v    t so that
x  c v   therefore 0   f cv   since f is 1 lipschitz we then have   h1 f cv    h1 cv  
ie 316

since hn  v   for every c  c

furthermore by the very definition of c

h1 kv   lim inf h1 kn v   lim inf h1 kn hn 
322
where the latter inequality holds due to the fact that hn  v at least for sufficiently large n
finally let vm m be a sequence of open sets containing h such that h  
m1 v m  it follows from
322 that h1 kv m   lim inf n h1 kn hn  for every m  n so that taking the limit as m   we
ultimately have h1 kh  lim inf n h1 kn hn  ie 312

then by the goab theorem 22 the analogues of 320 hold for h1 c
the corresponding estimate for h kv u  cf 321 hence the analogue of 322 holds ie
h1 kv u   lim inf h1 kn hn u 
from the above inequality it is then possible to infer 310 by the very same arguments as in claim 1 
recalling that the quasidistance  is lower semicontinuous wrt hausdorff convergence by lemma 32 we
immediately deduce the following result from proposition 36
corollary 37 the function d  kk  0  is lower semicontinuous wrt the hausdorff distance
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
it follows from 38 proposition 35 and corollary 37 that the quasidistance d on k  k satisfies
the basic conditions required in ms18 sec 21
curves with bounded dvariation as we shall see in the next section ve solutions to the viscously
corrected system for brittle fracture are curves
k  0 t   k
such that
vard k 0 t   
323
where for a subset e  0 t  we define
vard k e  sup
dktj1  ktj   t0  t1      tn  tj  e for j  0     n 
324
with the convention that vard k   0  let us now gain further insight into the properties of curves
satisfying 323
first of all from 323 it clearly follows that dks kt   for every 0  s  t  t  so that
ks  kt
for all 0  s  t  t 
325
ie the function k is increasing wrt set inclusion
the next result shows that crack evolutions with finite dvariation are h dregulated in the sense of
ms18 definition 23 namely at every t  0 t  the left and the right limits of k wrt h exist and satisfy
a compatibility condition wrt the dissipation distance d
lemma 38 let k  0 t   k satisfy 323 for t  0 t  set

with the conventions k0  k0 and kt   kt  then

furthermore there holds kt  kt  kt for all t  0 t  let   t  0 t   kt 
kt  kt  then
the set jk  0 t    is at most countable and ktn   kt for every t   and every tn  t
329
proof properties 327 are an immediate consequence of definitions 326 and of the definition of hausdorff
distance while 329 has been proved in dmt02b prop 61 only relying on the monotonicity property
325
let us now exploit 323 in order to check 328 for kt the proof of the assertion for kt follows
the same lines for every s  0 t  let v s  vard k 0 s since v is monotone increasing and 323
holds we have that v t  limst v s   for every 0  s  s1  t we have that dks ks1  
v s1   v s passing to the limit as s1  t and using the semicontinuity of d cf corollary 37 we
conclude that
dks kt  v t  v s 
hence taking the limit as s  t we conclude that limst dks kt  0  this concludes the proof
our final result shows that curves with bounded dtotal variation starting from a crack with finitely many
connected components evolve with a uniformintime bound on the number of their connected components

lemma 39 let k  0 t   k fulfill 323 and suppose that k0  kh  for some h  1  then
for all t  0 t  with m  h  1 vard k 0 t 
kt  km 
330
proof since  k0 kt  vard k 0 t we can apply lemma 33
the viscous corrrection we consider the viscous correction   k  k  0  defined by
h k 
distx h dh1 x   h k 
331
where   0 is a prescribed constant which plays the role of a nucleation cost for each new connected
component of the crack set as before we adopt the convention that distx   diam the first property
to be satisfied for  to be an admissible viscous correction is lower semicontinuity wrt hausdorff convergence
as we will see in the proof of proposition 310 the contribution of the quasidistance   modulated by whatever
positive coefficient  has again a key role in ensuring lower semicontinuity as it controls the growth of the
number of connected components of k disjoint from h 
proposition 310
1 let h  k be fixed then for all kn n  k such that the number of
connected components of kn disjoint from h is uniformly bounded wrt n we have that
distx h dh1 x 
332
distx h dh1 x  lim inf
kn  k 
kn h
moreover
333
h k  lim inf h kn 
2 for all hn n  h  k and kn n  k  k we have
hn  h kn  k  h k  lim inf hn  kn 
334
proof  1 let us observe that for every lower semicontinuous nonnegative function f    0  we
have
f dh1 x  lim inf
f dh1 x
kn h
indeed by the lower semicontinuity of f the set ut  x    f x  t is open and by proposition 36 since
the number of connected components of kn disjoint from h is uniformly bounded we have h1 khut  
lim inf n h1 kn hut   therefore by the fatou lemma we have
f x dh x 
h1 x  f x  tkh dt
 lim inf
h x  f x  tkn h dt  lim inf
f x dh1 x 
kn h
choosing f x  distx h we obtain 332
clearly 333 immediately follows as we may suppose that lim inf n h kn    up to the extraction
of a further subsequence we have that supn  h kn   supn h kn    then it suffices to recall that
by lemma 32 lim inf n h kn   h k
 2 we may of course suppose supn hn  kn    by lemma 32 lim inf n hn  kn   h k
in order to show the lower semicontinuity of the first contribution to   let us introduce the set h   x 
  distx h   for every fixed   0  we have that hn  h  for n large enough in what follows for
simplicity we will suppose that hn  h  for all n thus distx h    distx hn  for all x   then
distx hn  dh1 x 
distx h   dh1 x 
kn hn
kn hn
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
therefore

kn hn
distx h   dh1 x
kn hn
 lim inf
distx h   dh1 x
distx h   dh1 x 
kh 
distx h   dh1 x 
where for the lastbutone inequality we have applied 332  this is possible since the boundedness of
hn  kn  and the inclusions hn  h  for all n  n imply that the number of connected components
of kn disjoint from h  is uniformly bounded wrt n  n since   0 is arbitrary we may pass to the limit
as   0 via the fatou lemma to obtain 334
in section 5 we will gain further insight into the properties of   cf proposition 52 ahead
4 ve solutions definition and main results
in this section we give the definition of viscoenergetic solution to the system k e h d  for brittle
fracture and state our main existence result
41 definition of ve solution the definition of the ve concept cf def 43 ahead hinges on a notion
of stability introduced in def 41 below that involves both the dissipation quasidistance d and its viscous
correction   and on an energydissipation distance featuring a cost that suitably measures the energy dissipated
at jumps
stable sets in the viscoenergetic sense with the viscous correction  defined in 331 at hand we
introduce the corrected dissipation d  k  k  0 
h1 kh  kh distx h dh1 x    h k if h  k
dh k  dh k  h k 
otherwise
we are now in a position to introduce the notion of stability in the viscoenergetic sense
definition 41 let q  0  we say that t k  0 t   k is d qstable if it satisfies
et k  et k    dk k    q
for all k   k
if q  0  we will simply say that t k is dstable we denote by sd the collection of all the dstable points
and by sd t  k  k  t k  sd  its section at the process time t  0 t  analogously with the
symbols sdq and sdq t we will denote the d qstable sets and their sections
we introduce the residual stability function r  0 t   k  0  via
rt k 
et ket k  dk k    et k  y t k with

et k  dk k

by the properties of e cf section 51 and the lower semicontinuity of d and  
m t k  argmink  k et k  dk k   6 
observe that r in fact records the failure of the stability condition at a given point t k  0 t   k
since
rt k  0 for all t k  0 t   k with rt k  0 if and only if t k  sd 
furthermore r is lower semicontinuous wrt the product topology hr on 0 t   k if and only if for
every q  0 the d qstable sets are hr closed

the viscoenergetic cost c it is defined by minimizing a suitable transition cost functional over a class
of curves connecting the left and rightlimits kt and kt at a jump point t  jk  such curves are
in general defined on a compact subset e  r with a possibly more complicated structure than that of an
interval they are continuous wrt the hausdorff topology h increasing in the sense of 325 and satisfying
the following additional continuity condition wrt the dissipation distance d
   0    0  ds0  s1   
for all s0  s1  e with s0  s1  s0   
such conditions define the space

definition 42 let e be a compact subset of r let e   inf e  e   sup e  and let   chd e k
for every t  0 t  we define the transition cost function
trcve t  e   var  e  e   e    gapvar  e 
rt s with
see  
1 var  e the  total variation of the curve  which is defined in analogy with 324 as
tj1  tj   t0  t1      tn  tj  e for j  0     n
var  e  sup
with the convention that var k   0

collection of the connected components of e  e   e

we can now introduce the viscoenergetic jump dissipation cost c  0 t   k  k  0  between
the two endpoints of a jump of an increasing curve k  0 t   k namely for all k  k  k we
set
ct k  k   inftrcve t  e  e  r   chd e k e    k  e    k 
with the convention inf    along the footsteps of ms18 we define the jump variation functional
defined along a curve k  0 t   k via

 ct1  kt1  kt1  for all t0  t1   0 t 
we are now in a position to define the concept of viscoenergetic solution of the system k e h d 
featuring the dstability condition 411 below required outside the jump set jk of the curve k  and the
energy balance 412 where the energy dissipated at jumps is recorded by the jump dissipation cost introduced
in 410
definition 43 viscoenergetic solution a curve k  0 t   k is a viscoenergetic ve  solution of
the system k e h d  for brittle fracture if it satisfies
 the monotonicity condition 325

42 existence and properties of ve solutions this section collects all of our results on ve solutions
for the system k e h d  with e h d and  defined in 31 21 37 331 respectively first
and foremost the existence theorem 45
as mentioned in the introduction ve solutions are constructed as follows for a given partition p  0 
 t  of the interval 0 t  with time step   maxi1n ti ti1
t  t1      tn
  and an assigned
datum k0  k we consider the minimum problem
ki  argminkk eti  k  dki1  k  ki1  k
for i  1     n 
414
which admits a solution thanks to the previously proved lower semicontinuity properties of d and   and the
lower semicontinuitycoercivity properties of e that will be precisely stated in section 51 we introduce the
leftcontinuous piecewise constant interpolant of the elements ki n
k  0 t   k
k 0  k0

if t  ti1
  t  
415
we are now in a position to give our existence result stating the convergence of the above interpolants to a
ve solution let us mention in advance that starting from an initial datum k0  kh  for some h  1  we
construct a fracture evolution with values in some km  also providing an explicit bound on the index m
cf 417 below
theorem 45 existence of ve solutions assume that the timedependent dirichlet loading fulfills
g  c1 0 t  h 1 
416
let k0  kh  for some h  1  then there exists a viscoenergetic solution k of the system k e h d 
for brittle fracture with such that k0  k0  moreover every ve solution k with k0  k0 satisfies for
every t  0 t 
417
kt  km  with m  h  1 expcp t e0 k0   1
where cp is the constant defined in 56 ahead finally for every sequence k k of time steps with k  0
as k   there exist a not relabeled subsequence of kk and a ve solution k such that
kk t  kt
for all t  0 t 
418
the proof of theorem 45 will be carried out in section 5 based on some preliminary results in which we are
going to show that the dissipation distance d defined 37 the viscous correction  in 331 and the driving
energy functional e in 31 satisfy a series of conditions that are at the heart of the general existence result
ms18 thm 39 see conditions  a    b   and  c  stated at the beginning of section 5 relying
on these properties we will deduce the proof of theorem 45 from ms18 thm 39
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
in ms18 several results on the characterization of the ve concept and on optimal jump transitions were
proved as we will see in section 53 such results also hold for our specific rateindependent system for brittle
fracture cf propositions 46 and 47 below
proposition 46 provides a twofold characterization of viscoenergetic solutions first of all in analogy to
the properties of energetic and balanced viscosity solutions for a curve k  0 t   k that is stable in
the viscoenergetic sense the validity of the energy balance 412 is equivalent to the corresponding energy
inequality  cf 419 it is also equivalent to the validity of an energydissipation inequality that solely
involves the dissipation distance d cf 420 below joint with jump conditions that also feature the ve cost c
as we have recalled in the introduction the notion of quasistatic evolution in brittle fracture features 420
joint with a dstability condition therefore the characterization provided by proposition 462 highlights
that ve solutions essentially differ from quasistatic evolutions in the description of the energetic behavior of
the system at jumps
proposition 46 ms18 prop 38 let the assumptions of thm 45 hold a curve k  0 t   k
satisfying the dstability condition 411 is a ve solution of the system k e h d  for brittle fracture
if and only if k satisfies in addition
1 either the d cenergydissipation upper estimate
et  kt   h kt k0  var k 0 t   jmpc k 0 t   e0 k0 
t es ks ds 419

joint with the following jump conditions at every jump point t  jk 
et kt  et kt
h1 ktkt  kt kt  ct kt kt
et kt  et kt
h1 ktkt  kt kt  ct kt kt 
421
finally let us gain further insight into the description of the system behavior at jumps provided by the ve
concept via the properties of optimal jump transitions given t  0 t  and k  k  k an admissible
transition curve   chd e k with e  r is an optimal transition between k and k at time
t  0 t  if it is a minimizer for ct k  k  namely
e    k 
e    k 
trcve t  e  ct k  k  
422
furthermore we say that  is a
1 sliding transition if rt s  0 for all s  e 
2 viscous transition if rt s  0 for all s  e  e   e   
we have the following result cf ms18 thm 314 rmk 315 cor 317 prop 318
proposition 47 let k  0 t   k be a ve solution of the system k e h d  for brittle fracture
then
1 at every jump point t  jk there exists an optimal jump transition  between kt and kt such
that s  kt for some s  e 
2 for a viscous transition  between kt and kt the set e  e   e   is discrete ie all of its
points are isolated namely  is a pure jump transition in fact  may be represented as a finite or
countable sequence n no  with o a compact interval of z    satisfying
n  m t n1   argmink  k et k  dn1  k  
for all n  o  o 
423
3 any optimal jump transition can be canonically decomposed into an at most countable collection of
sliding and viscous transitions
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
5 proofs of the main results
as previously mentioned prior to carrying out the proof of thm 45 in sections 51 and 52 ahead we shall
check that the system k e h d  given by 37 331 and 31 complies with a series of conditions
that were proposed in ms18 sec 22 sec 31 sec 33 as a basis for the existence of ve solutions such
conditions will also involve the perturbed functional f  0 t   k  0 
ft k  et k  dko  k
with ko  kh  for some h  1  an arbitrary reference point by a sublevel of f we mean a set of the form
t k  0 t   k  ft k  r
for some r  0  the abstract conditions from ms18 read as follows
 a   the energy functional e  0 t   k  0  is lower semicontinuous wrt the product topology
hr on the sublevels of f  which are hr compact at all t k  0 t   k there exists t et k
t e  0 t   k  r is upper semicontinuous wrt hr on the sublevels of f  and
 cp  0  t k  0 t   k 
t et k  cp et k1 
 b   the viscous correction  is left dcontinuous namely for all sequences kn n  k  k
 lim kn  k  0
kn  k and dkn  k  0 as n  
and for every t k  sd there holds
es h  es k
dh k
shf
lim sup
where we have used the placeholder
s hf
t k for s  t h  k dh k  0 s h  sd  s  t
 c  for every q  0 the d qquasistable sets sdq have hr closed intersections with the sublevels of
the functional f 
as observed in ms18 54 in particular guarantees that dstability yields local dstability
relying on the validity of properties  a    b   and  c   in section 53 ahead we shall conclude
the proofs of theorem 45 and propositions 46 and 47
51 verification of properties  a   b   and  c   propositions 51 52 and 53 ahead state
the validity of properties  a    b   and  c   respectively for our system k e h d  for brittle
fracture throughout the proof of propositions 51 and 53 we will repeatedly use that for sequences tn  kn n
in the sublevels of the functional f defined in 51 there holds
sup h1 kn   
and
 m  1  kn n  km 
as a consequence of lemma 33
proposition 51 under the assumptions of thm 45 the functional e  0 t   k  0  defined in
31 and t e are continuous wrt the hr topology on the sublevels of f and t e fulfills 52
proof let tn  kn n  0 t   k with supn ftn  kn    converge to some t k wrt the hr topology it follows from 55 and theorem 22 that k  km  too since g  c1 0 t  h 1 we have
that gtn   gt in h 1  therefore thanks to 55 we may apply proposition 23 and conclude that any
sequence un n with un  argminvvgtn kn  kn 21 v2 dx fulfills un  u as n   in l2  r2 
with u  argminvvgtk k 12 v2 dx then
etn  kn

since g  c1 0 t  h 1 formula 32 gives t et k at all t k  0 t   k we have
1 2
t et k 
tu dx  kkl 0t l2 r2 
2 u dx  2 l k 
then estimate 52 follows with
cp  kkl 0t l2 r2 
1 2
2 l 1
the very same arguments used for the continuity of e combined with the fact that   c0 0 t  h 1  in
fact yield the hr continuity of t e this concludes the proof
with the following result we check the validity of condition  b   we shall in fact prove the stronger
condition 57 below
proposition 52 the dissipation distance d defined in 37 and the viscous correction  in 331 fulfill
lim
kn  k
dkn  k
for all kn n  k  km  such that kn  k and lim dkn  k  0
in particular conditions 53 and 54 are satisfied
proof since dkn  k  0 as n   we have that for n sufficiently large kn  k and the integers
kn  k are 0  therefore it is sufficient to observe that
kn  k
distx kn  dh1 x  hkn  k  0 as n  
dkn  k
h kkn  kkn
where the last inequality follows by the definition of hausdorff distance
we conclude this section with a discussion on the closedness of the intersection of the q stable sets with
the sublevels of the functional f introduced in 51 it is immediate to see that this property is guaranteed
by the following condition given a sequence tn  kn n  sdq  for some q  0  such that tn  kn  
t k as
n   and supn ftn  kn    for every k  k with k  k and dk k    we can exhibit
a recovery sequence kn n such that kn  kn and
lim sup etn  kn etn  kn dkn  kn kn  kn q
 et k    et k  dk k    k k    q 
in this way we obtain et k  et kdk k  k k  q  0 for all k   k whence t k  sdq 
indeed in proposition 53 below we shall obtain 59 in a stronger form
proposition 53 let tn  kn n  sdq be a sequence of q stable points fulfilling supn ftn  kn   
suppose that tn  kn  
t k then for every k   k with k   k and dk k     there exists
a sequence kn n such that kn  kn and the following convergences hold as n  
kn  k

etn  kn   et k  
dkn  kn   dk k  
kn  kn   k k

in particular condition  c  is valid
the proof shall be carried out in the upcoming section 52

viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
52 proof of proposition 53 since supn ftn  kn    we have that kn   km  for some m  1 
along the footsteps of dmt02b first of all we shall exhibit a recovery sequence for a fixed competitor set
k   j that is additionally connected ie j  k1  cf the upcoming lemma 54 then in lemma 55 we
will address the general case in which the competitor set is in kp  for some p  1  the proof of proposition
53 will be then carried out at the end of this section the proofs of lemmas 54 and 55 strongly rely on the
arguments for dmt02b lemmas 38  35
lemma 54 let m  n let kn n  k  km  fulfill hkn  k  0 as n   and let j  k1  with
j  k  then there exists a sequence jn n  k1  such that jn  kn and
hjn  j  0

distx kn  dh1 x

511c
proof if k    it is sufficient to define jn  j  indeed from hkn    0 we deduce that kn   for n
sufficiently large and then the convergences properties 511 are trivially satisfied
let us now assume k 6   and let k 1      k i  1  i  m be its connected components first of all in
step 1 we will provide the construction of a recovery sequence with the desired properties 511 for a carefully
chosen set jb such that jb coincides with k  if k is connected and jb is a suitable subset of j containing k
cf 512b in the general case
step 1  if i  1  let us set
jb  k  k 1 
512a
if i  2  we apply dmt02b lemma 37 to conclude that there exists a finite family of indices j lj0  with
0      l   1     i  and a family j lj1 of connected components of j  k  such that k j1  j 6
 6 k j  j for j  1     l  namely j connects k j1 to k j  in this case we set

to carry out the construction of the sets jbn  we proceed in the following way given the connected
components k l il1 of k  we choose   0 such that the sets x    distx k l    are pairwise
disjoint and we set
e l  x  kn  distx k l   
e n1    k
e ni  k
e nl  km 
following dmt02b we observe that for sufficiently large n we have that kn  k
e nl  k l   0 as n   for all l  1     i  we now apply dmt02b lemma 36 and for all

in the case i  1 namely k  k 1  k1  we define jbn  k

are satisfied indeed in this case j  k  so that the first of 514a yields 513a furthermore k

b n1 k
e n1   0 by the second of 514a property 513c then follows from 514b as
h1 jbn kn   h1 k
j  k  
suppose now that k is not connected namely i  2  then the set jb is given by 512b for every
b nl  k l   0 as n   for all l  1     i 
j  1     l  we fix xj  k j1  j and y j  k j  j  since hk

we have that there exist sequences xn n  yn n with xn  kn
xjn  xj and ynj  y j as n   since  has a lipschitz boundary there exist arcs xnj and ynj in 
connecting xjn to xj and ynj to y j  respectively such that h1 xnj   0 and h1 ynj   0 as n   we set

it has been shown in the proof of dmt02b lemma 38 that jbn  k1  for sufficiently large n and that
513a and 513b hold it remains to check 513c with this aim we observe that by 515 we have

where the integrals are taken over j since h1 j   h1 j  by dmt02b prop 25 as for the first

where the inequality is due to the fact that kn  k
in 514b therefore sn1  0 as n   we trivially estimate
distx kn  dh1 x  diam  h1 xnj   0 as n   for all j  1     l
and we handle the terms ynj distx kn  dh1 x in the same way we thus conclude that sn2  0 and sn4  0
as n   finally we observe that
distx k dh1 x for all j  1     l
lim sup distx kn  dh x

where the first inequality follows from the fatou lemma and the second one is a straightforward consequence

viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
step 2  let us now carry out the construction of the recovery sequence jn n for a given j  k1  with
j  k  let jb be the set introduced in 512 observe that j is locally connected see cd97 lemma
1 hence the connected components of j  jb are open in the relative topology of j  therefore since j is
separable j  jb has at most countably many connected components cl ll  with l a finite or an infinite
subset of n it follows from the proof of dmt02b lemma 37 that each component cl is open in j and
satisfies c l  k 6   let us fix a point z l  c l  k for every l  l  from hkn  k  0 as n   we
deduce that there exists a sequence znl n such that znl  kn for all n  n and znl  z l as n   since
 is lipschitz for every l  l there exists an arc znl   connecting znl to zl  and such that h1 znl   0
as n   finally along the footsteps of dmt02b we observe that there exists a sequence n n  n such
that
lim
h1 znl   0
in fact if the set l consists of 1     elements then we take n   
we claim that the recovery sequence

znl 
516
complies with 511 in fact it is sufficient to check 511c as 511a and 511b have been proved in
dmt02b lemma 38 with this aim we observe that

it follows from 513c that

again by the fatou lemma and the fact that hkn  k  0 as n   all in all we conclude that

namely an inequality in 511c the converse inequality follows from proposition 310 this concludes the
proof
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
as in dmt02b lemma 35 we now extend the construction of the recovery sequence to the case the
competitor set j has at most p connected components with p  1 
lemma 55 let m p  n m p  1  let kn n  k  km  fulfill hkn  k  0 as n   and let
k   kp  with k   k  then there exists a sequence kn n  kp  such that kn  kn and properties
510 hold
proof as in the proof of dmt02b lemma 35 we consider the connected components j 1      j i  1  i  p
of the set k   we fix   0 such that the sets x    distx j l     l  1     i  are pairwise disjoint
and we define
b l  x  kn  distx j l   
l  1     i 
b nl are in km  kn  i k
b nl  and
following dmt02b we observe that for n large enough the sets k
b nl  k l   0 as n   with k l  k  j l  if k l    we set jnl  j j for all n  n if k l 6   we apply
b nl n  l  1     i  and for each l  1     i
lemma 54 to the connected sets j l and to the sequences k
we find a sequence jnl n  k1  such that

note that for n large enough the sets jnl il1 are pairwise disjoint
then we define the recovery sequence kn n for the set k  in this way
kn  jn1      jni 
b nl  kn and hkn  k    0 as n   namely 510a holds then 510b
by construction kn  l1 k
follows from 510a and proposition 51 furthermore

for l 6 j  which gives the very last equality
b nl  i jnl  namely the number of connected components  of
now we calculate kn  kn    il1 k
b nl    since for n large enough the sets jnl  l  1     i  are connected and
such
that

pairwise disjoint each  must coincide with a set jnl  for some  l  1     i  that fulfills jnl  k
b nl  j l  k l   for l 6  l  and that
for every l  1     i  recall that for n sufficiently large jnl  k

thus we infer the validity of property 510c

viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
where the last inequality follows from 517 this gives an inequality in 510d the converse one is again due
to proposition 310 this concludes the proof
proof of proposition 53 by 55 and by theorem 22i the set k belongs to km  for some m since
k k    dk k     we have that k   kp  with p  m k k   then the conclusion follows
from lemma 55
53 proofs in this section we prove theorem 45
proof of theorem 45 the first and the last statement follow from the general existence result ms18 thm
39 which applies to the system k e h d  for brittle fracture thanks to the validity of conditions
 a    b   and  c   proved in propositions 51 52 and 53
we now prove the explicit bound 417 on the number m of connected components indeed from the
energydissipation balance 412 we infer that
z t
vard k 0 t  et kt  vard k 0 t  jmpc k 0 t  e0 k0

where the last inequality follows from 32 then by the gronwall lemma we infer that
for all t  0 t 
et kt  e0 k0 1 expcp t  1
which inserted in 519 yields
vard k 0 t   e0 k0 1 expcp t   1
therefore taking into account lemma 39 we infer that
kt  km 
for all t  0 t  with m  h 
expcp t e0 k0   1
with cp the positive constant in 56 ie 36 this concludes the proof of theorem 45
520
6 behavior near the crack tips
in the same spirit of dmt02b sec 8 in this section we describe the singularity at the crack tips of the
displacement ut associated with a ve solution kt to the system k e h d  this will be examined
in an interval 0  1  during which k evolves continuously as a function of time furthermore along the
footsteps of dmt02b we confine the discussion to the case in which the moving part of the crack set
consists of a finite family of simple arcs whose endpoints are the moving tips of the crack as specified in
hypothesis 61 below in theorem 65 below we will show that the ve solution k complies with griffiths
criterion for crack growth
let us specify the structural condition on the crack k  0 t   k
hypothesis 61 we suppose that k  0 t   k fulfills the following condition on some 0  1   0 t 
there exists a finite family i pi1 of arcs contained in  and parameterized by arc length by c2 bijective
functions i  i0  i1   i such that
kt  k0  
i i t
for all t  0  1 
where for i  1     p i  0  1   i0  i1  are nondecreasing continuous functions such that i 0   i0
and i0  i t  i1  while i   i s  i0  s    we also assume that the arcs i pi1 are pairwise
disjoint and that i  kt0   i i0  for every i  1     p
hence for t  0  1  the fracture grows along the branches i  i  1     p and the points i i t are the
moving crack tips the compliance with griffiths criterion stated in theorem 65 ahead will be expressed in
terms of conditions involving the stress intensity factors of the displacements ut at the crack tips we briefly
recall some preliminary facts about this notion
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
basics on the stress intensity factor the notion of stress intensity factor is based on the following result
proposition 62 let b  r2 be an open ball and let   0  1   r2 be a simple path of class c2
parameterized by arc length such that 0   b  1   b  and   b for all   0  1  in
addition assume that  is not tangent to b at 0 and 1 
given   0  1  let   s  0  s   and let u  l12 b satisfy
u  z dx  0
for all z  l12 b with z  0 on b 
then there exists a unique constant   u   r such that
u  2  sin2  h 2 b  h 1 b 
where x  x   and x is the continuous function on b that coincides with the oriented angle
between  and x   and vanishes on the points of the form x     for   0 small enough
proof since the connected components of b have lipschitz boundary the space l12 b coincides
with h 1 b then the proof of 62 can be found in gri85 theorem 4437 and section 52 and
ms89 appendix 1
the constant  is proportional to the stress intensity factor considered in the engineering literature it is
related to the derivative of the energy with respect to the crack length as we shall see in proposition 63 below
given an open subset a   with lipschitz boundary a compact set k   and a function g  ak  r
we define
g k 
min
2 v dx 
vvagk
where
g k  v  l12 ak  v  g on a  k 
the following result can be obtained by adapting the proof of gri92 thm 641
proposition 63 let b and  be as in proposition 62 and let g  b0   r be a function for every
  0  1  suppose that vb
g  6  and let u  argminvvbg
v2 dx  then
b 2
with  defined by 62
d e
eb g   u 2
for every   0  1  
localization of the stability condition we now prove that the ve stability inequality can be localized
in the spirit of dmt02b lemma 85
lemma 64 assume that t k  0 t   k is dstable and let u  argminvvgtk k 12 v2 dx 
then for every open subset a   with lipschitz boundary we have
ea u k  ea u k   h k k  distx ka dx    ka k  ka
k  k
for all k   ka with k   k  a
proof let k   ka it follows from 41 with k  replaced by k  k  that
distx k dx    k k  k 
et k  et k k  h k k 
k  k
we repeat the very same calculations as in the proof of dmt02b lemma 85 obtaining that
et k  k  et k  ea
u k    ea

viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
as for the third term on the righthand side of 67 we observe that
distx ka dx
distx k dx 
k  k
k  k
finally let us prove that
k k  k  ka k  ka 
610
it is enough to show that every connected component of k k disjoint from k is a connected component of
k  ka  if c is a connected component of k  k and does not intersect k  then c  k   a  hence
c  k  ka  if c  is a connected set such that c  c   k  ka  then c   k  k and hence
c   c  this shows that c is a connected component of k  ka and concludes the proof of 610 which
together with 6768 yields 66
griffiths condition at the crack tips our result for a ve solution k  0 t   k satisfying in
addition the structural condition stated in hypothesis 61 involves the constants the i  i ut i t
satisfying 62 at the tips i i t of the branches of the crack where ut is the corresponding minimal
displacement cf 611 below
theorem 65 let k  0 t   k be a ve solution of the system for brittle fracture k e h d 
with timedependent boundary datum g  c1 0 t  h 1 and for every t  0 t  let
611
ut  argminvvgtkt
2 v dx 
assume that k satisfies hypothesis 61 on some 0  1   0 t  with arcs i and functions i  i  1     p
then
i t  0
1  i ut i t  0
1  i ut i t2 i t  0
for aa t  0  1 
612a
for all t  0  1 
612b
for aa t  0  1 
612c
for every i  1     p
remark 66 following dmt02b we observe that 612a states that the length of every branch of the crack
is nondecreasing in accordance with the irreversibility of the crack growth process 612b imposes that the
absolute value of the stress intensity factor at each tip be less or equal than 1  by 612c the stress intensity
factor reaches the threshold values 1 as soon as the tip moves with positive velocity in fact conditions
612 rephrase griffiths criterion in our context
therefore theorem 65 ensures that a ve solution complying with hyp 61 satisfies griffiths criterion in
the interval 0  1  during which it evolves continuously as a function of time like it happens for the quasistatic
evolutions considered in dmt02b thm 84 this is consistent with the fact that the most relevant difference
between ve solutions and quasistatic evolutions resides in the jump behavior as highlighted by proposition 46
proof of theorem 65 as in the proof of dmt02b thm 84 we fix an arbitrary t  0  1  and consider a
family of open balls b1      bp centered at the points i i t up to choosing their radii sufficiently small
we have that b i   and b i  k0   b i  b j  b i  j   for j 6 i  furthermore we may assume that
for every i  1     p
bi  i  i   0i    1i 
for suitable 0i and 1i such that i0  0i  i t  1i  i1  and that the arcs i intersect bi only at
the points i 0i  and i 1i  with a transversal intersection then taking into account hypothesis 61 we
conclude that
b i  ks  b i  i i s  i   0i    i s
613
gianni dal maso riccarda rossi giuseppe savar and rodica toader
whenever i s  0i  1i  in particular 613 holds at s  t and for s sufficiently close to t since i is
continuous at t
it follows from lemma 64 that for every i  1     p
distx ktbi  dxktb i  k  ktb i 
ebi  ut kt  ebi  ut k h k kt
k  kt
e is the localized energy functional defined in 63 choosing
for all k   kb i  with k   ktb i  where e
k  i b i  i   i     with   i t 1i  and recalling that h1 i i i t  i t
and i i tb i  i b i   0  we deduce that
e i  ut i i t  eb
e i  ut i     i t 
distx i i tbi  dx
614
i i i t
for all  
i t 1i 
taking into account that
distx i i tbi  dx  0
lim
i t i t i i i t
from 614 we obtain that
d e
ebi  ut i  i t  1  0
for all i  1     p
then 612b follows from proposition 63 applied with g  ut
for every s t  0  1  we have that ks kt  0 by hypothesis 61 hence var k s t  0 
so that vard k s t  h1 ktks since k evolves continuously in time on the interval 0  1  the
energydissipation balance 412 reduces to
z t
et kt  h1 ktks  es ks

615
from 615 with the very same arguments as in the proof of dmt02b thm 84 we deduce 612c
7 extension to 2 d linearized elasticity
in cha03 the existence of quasistatic evolutions for fracture proved in the scalar setting in dmt02b
was extended to the vectorial still twodimensional setting of linearized elasticity the argument relied on a
density result of h 1 a r2 fields in the space of fields whose symmetrized gradient is in l2 a r22
sym  proved
by the author in the case a  r is a bounded open set whose complement has a finite number of connected
components
we will now briefly explain how the arguments in cha03 also allow us to prove the existence of viscoenergetic solutions for the vectorial 2 d linearized elasticity version of the system for brittle fracture that
we address in a domain   r2 still complying with the conditions expounded at the beginning of section 2
the viscously corrected system for brittle fracture is now given by the quadruple k ele  h d  in which
 the dissipation quasidistance d and the viscous correction  are still given by 37 and 331
respectively
 the driving energy functional ele 0 t   k  0  is defined by
ele t k 
min
2 ceu  eu dx
uvle gtk
where c is the elasticity tensor and eu denotes the symmetric part of u 
g  c1 0 t  h 1  r2 
and the space for admissible displacements is now given by
vle gt k  v  ldk  v  gt on d   k 
viscoenergetic solutions for brittle fracture
here following cha03 for a given a  r2 we denote by lda the space
lda  v  l2loc a r2   ev  l2 a r22
sym  
we will denote by fle the functional associated with ele and a reference point ko as in 51
as we have seen in section 53 in order to prove the existence of ve solutions it is sufficient to show that
the system for brittle fracture k ele  h d  complies with conditions  a    b   and  c  listed
at the beginning of section 5 now the viscous correction  obviously still enjoys property  b  as for
 a   it follows from the following analogue of proposition 51
proposition 71 the functional ele  0 t   k  0  defined in 71 is continuous wrt the
hr topology on sublevels of the functional fle moreover t ele  0 t   k  r is given by
t ele t k 
ceu  et dx
for all u  vle gt k
is also continuous wrt the hr topology on sublevels of fle  and fulfills estimate 52
the proof of proposition 71 follows from the arguments in cha03 thm 3 finally proposition 53
guaranteeing the validity of property  c   carries over to the present setting in particular the construction
of the recovery sequence kn n fulfilling 59 developed throughout section 52 is still appropriate for this
vectorial setting thanks to the aforementioned continuity properties of ele 
that is why the analogue of our existence theorem 45 holds for the system k ele  h d
