Abstract: We report on a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of thermal
conductivity in indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin films with various Ga concentrations (0-30 at. %)
deposited by spray pyrolysis technique. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy
have shown a structural transformation in the range 15–20 at. % Ga from the nanocrystalline to the
amorphous phase. Room temperature femtosecond time domain thermoreflectance measurements
showed nonlinear decrease of thermal conductivity in the range 2.0–0.5 Wm-1K-1 depending on Ga
doping level. Comparing density functional theory calculations with XRD data it was found that Ga
atoms substitute In atoms in the ITO nanocrystals retaining Ia-3 space group symmetry. The calculated
phonon dispersion relations revealed that Ga doping leads to the appearance of hybridized metal atom
vibrations with avoided-crossing behavior. These hybridized vibrations possess shortened mean free
paths and are the main reason behind the thermal conductivity drop in nanocrystalline phase. An
evolution from propagative to diffusive phonon thermal transport in ITO:Ga with 15-20 at. % of Ga
was established. The suppressed thermal conductivity of ITO:Ga thin films deposited by spray
pyrolysis may be crucial for their thermoelectric applications.

1. Introduction
Indium oxide based compounds and composites with high thermal stability have been intensively
investigated as perspective semiconducting materials for high-temperature thermoelectric
applications. Additives or supplement oxides of different metallic nature like Zn, Sn, Ge, Ga, Y, Nb,
Ni etc. were used [1–7] in such compounds and composites to improve their thermoelectric and optical
properties. Some of these materials retained the lattice structure of the host oxide at large amounts of
additives. The specifics of In2O3 lattice is its complexity and large number of atoms in the primitive
cell (40). As a consequence one could expect the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity κκpph due
to the trapping of heat energy by numerous optical modes and flattening of their energy dispersions

[8], leading to lower phonon group velocities. The structural complexity of Ia-3 space group impedes
investigations of various defect complexes in In2O3 and their impact on electronic, phononic and
thermoelectric properties. In Ref. [9] some of us has reported on theoretical investigations of
electronic properties of In2O3 with Sn-, Ga- and O-based point defect complexes, employing density
functional theory. It has been shown that defect complexes strongly influence the electronic band
structure and position of indium and oxygen atoms [9]. Defect complex driven deviation in both
atomic masses and crystal lattice strain results in enhancement of phonon scattering by point defects
and may affect the lattice thermal conductivity. Impact of different defect complexes and structural
vacancies on thermal properties of In2O3 requires additional investigations.
The strong improvement of specific electronic, thermal and thermoelectric properties could be
reached when the material is in nanocrystalline form. Recent theoretical results demonstrated that
enhanced electrical conductivity σσ and thermopower S providing an elevated power factor PPPP = σσSS 2

can be achieved in ITO nanofilms [10] due to the filtering effect [10,11] of low energy conduction
electrons at grain boundaries. The PF values of around 3 mW/m∙K2 were reported for thermally aged

ITO films with an optimal Sn content [12,13]. Thorough independent experimental study [14]
confirmed the presence of potential barrier in the vicinity of grain boundaries which are responsible
for the filtering of electrons despite the degeneracy of ITO conduction band. ITO nanofilms have also
demonstrated reduced values of thermal conductivity as compared with bulk ITO [15]. The drop of
thermal conductivity was explained by strong phonon scattering on grains, reduction of electronic part
κκeeee of thermal conductivity due to the filtering of low energy conduction electrons and porosity of

ITO films [15]. Due to the geometric complexity of the nanograin network the trapping of heat
carrying vibrational modes, leading to the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity κκpph , is also

possible. Reduction of thermal conductivity without degradation of electronic parameters (σσ, S)
2

radically improves the thermoelectric efficiency, determined by figure of merit ZZZZ = σσSS 2 TT/κκtttttt .

Looking for compounds with low κκtttttt and high enough σσ and S is a mainstream in thermoelectric

material science.

Our experiments with ITO:Ga thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis have shown quite large
values of PF [13]. However, an influence of deposition parameters (like as pyrolysis temperature) on
electric and thermal properties of such films require further investigations and optimization. ITO films
remain totally nanocrystalline up to 50 at. % Sn [12], while nanocrystalline to amorphous phase
transition in ITO(Sn≤10 at. %):Ga-based films occurs at Ga content ≥ 20-30 at. % and may lead to a
sharp drop in thermal conductivity.
Thereby, in this work we focus on experimental and theoretical investigations of thermal
conductivity in ITO:Ga thin films with widely varying Ga content and almost constant amount of Sn
~6 at. %. Such concentration of Sn [12,13] is optimal in terms of PF and ZT. The experiments were
performed by an ultrafast (femtosecond) laser-induced time domain thermoreflectance method
(TDTR) [16,17]. It is a powerful and versatile technique for thermal properties investigations of a
large variety of bulk and nanoscale systems. Within the many advantages of TDTR in comparison
with conventional thermal conductivity measurements is an excellent spatial resolution at a length
scale below tens of micrometers. TDTR also requires minimal sample preparation for the
measurements. Using density functional theory (DFT) and linearized Boltzmann transport equation
(BTE) for phonons we investigate in detail how changes in phonon energy spectra affects both phonon
scattering mechanisms and lattice thermal conductivity in ITO:Ga films at different Ga
concentrations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss sample preparation and
characterization. Section 3 describes TDTR technique of thermal conductivity measurements. Our
theoretical model of phonon modes and lattice thermal conductivity in ITO:Ga films is presented in
Section 4. Discussions of results are provided in Section 5. Conclusions are given in Section 6.
2. Sample preparation and characterization
ITO films (6 at. % of Sn content in sprayed solution) were deposited at T=350-360 oC by spray
pyrolysis method on polished silicon substrates (1x1 cm2). Additionally, within the same deposition
procedure several films were doped by Ga at various concentrations in the range up to 30 at. %.
Hereinafter, under Ga concentration we refer to the following ratio: [Ga]/([In]+[Sn]+[Ga]) where
corresponding partial concentrations of compound are indicated in parentheses. The sprayed solution
was prepared as a mixture of 0.2M precursors of InCl3, SnCl4∙5H2O and GaCl3 by dissolving in the
3

dimethylformamide (DMF). The required film thickness around 200 nm was roughly monitored
during the deposition of the film by its color and by sprayed solution volume and then was measured
by F20 Filmetrics instrument. All experimental samples were annealed for a stabilization of film
structural parameters at Tan =500 oC during half an hour. Other details of our preparation method are
provided in Ref. [18].
The deposited films were characterized for their structural properties by an EMPYREAN XRD
system from Malvern Panalytical using Cu Kα (λ=1.5405 Å) radiation within a diffraction angle range
of 15–70° in θ/θ mode. The surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
using a Park XE7 instrument. Average surface roughness of deposited films did not exceed 10 nm.
Surface images of the films were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using the Hitachi
S-4700 instrument. The films were monitored by using conventional secondary electrons mode at an
accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Figure 1(a-d) presents SEM images for ITO:Ga films with Ga content
of 0, 5, 10, and 15 at. %. At Ga concentrations more than 15 at. % the films demonstrated totally
amorphous structure. The XRD summary pattern for all samples with tested Ga contents shown in
Figure 2 confirms this conclusion. The In2O3 characteristic peaks practically disappear at 20 at. % Ga.
At the range 0-15 at. % of Ga XRD 2θ diffractograms show the existence of In2O3 nanocrystalline
phase, although it does not imply the absence of finely dispersed Ga2O3 phase.

These two methods allow to compare polycrystalline effective grain sizes in cross-plane
(extracted from XRD pattern by Scherrer formula) and in-plane (extracted from SEM images)
directions, respectively. In Figure 3 we show corresponding values of average grain sizes versus Ga
content in the measured films. The difference in grain sizes extracted from XRD and SEM patterns
for pure ITO film reflects the anisotropy growth during deposition that is peculiar for large enough
grains with surface faceting. The Ga additive manifests in smaller round-shaped nanocrystallites and
in a tendency to their agglomeration. The position of dominated XRD In2O3 peaks and their shift with
Ga content allowed us to calculate the changes in the lattice constant.

3. TDTR measurements
The thermal transport properties were examined by femtosecond laser-induced time domain
thermoreflectance method. An Al film was pre-deposited on the ITO:Ga films, and it was used as the
thermal transducer of femtosecond laser pulses. The pump beam was modulated by an electro-optic
modulator at 10 MHz and illuminated the transducer with a Gaussian radius of 5.9 μm. The pumpinduced reflectivity change was monitored by the probe beam of which amplitude is collected with a
fast amplified silicon detector connected to a lock-in amplifier. We obtained in-phase (Vin) and outphase (Vout) profiles of the pump-beam-induced reflectivity variation of which phase is compared to
the internal sinusoidal reference signal of the lock-in amplifier. We fitted the TDTR signal of -Vin/Vout
in a temporal range between 100 ps and 3.75 ns by considering the thermal transport model in multilayered geometry based on the Fourier's law [16]. We set the boundary conductance across the AlITO interface and thermal conductivity of ITO films as two adjustable parameters. Heat capacities of
Al (CAl=2.42 Jcm-3K-1), Si (1.64 Jcm-3K-1) and ITO (CITO=2.78 Jcm-3K-1) were taken from the
literature [19,20]. The thermal conductivity of Al transducer was obtained from the direct current
electric conductivity by using a Wiedemann-Franz law. The Al film thickness tAl was estimated to
have an average thickness of 100±3.6 nm by taking the position of an acoustic echo peak in the TDTR
signal. The oscillating thermal wave cannot reach the bottom silicon substrate because of the very low
thermal diffusivity of ITO:Ga thin films. The average oscillating heat penetration depth is estimated
to be within 34-65% of ITO:Ga thickness. Because the lock-in amplifier independently captures and
separates the oscillating thermal responses from steady-state heating, the thin films investigated here
can be considered to be semi-infinite.
To check the validity and credibility of obtained thermal boundary conductance and thermal
conductivity, we examined how the final modeling results are sensitive to those parameters in the
given measurement configuration. The sensitivity is determined as the relative change of TDTR signal
with respect to the relative change of the parameter of interest. We found that our TDTR results are
highly sensitive to κITO, but not to the other parameter GAl-ITO. The latter is attributed to the very low
thermal diffusivity of ITO samples so that the thermal gradient of oscillating heat is mostly given in
ITO. Despite the low sensitivity to GAl-ITO, we could successfully determine the quantity since the
covariance between the two fitting parameters is small as about 0.2-0.5, except for the Ga content of
20 at. % having the value close to 0.6. In the error estimation, we considered the sensitivity results,
uncertainties in the pre-parameters used in the thermal transport model, and the position-dependent
inhomogeneity. After merging all these factors, we estimated the final error by minimizing Kullback6

Leibler divergence [21]. The obtained parameters of GAl-ITO and κITO are presented in Figures. 4(a)
and (b), respectively. At 20 at. % of Ga the error bar of κITO is relatively small, while that of GAl-ITO is
much larger than error bars for other Ga content. The latter is attributed to the large covariance
between κITO and GAl-ITO and to the high thermal resistivity of the amorphous phase, which allow us
to determine κITO more reliably than GAl-ITO.

conductivity of ITO thin films κκITO.
4. Theoretical methods
All electronic calculations were performed within density functional theory formalism as
implemented in the SIESTA code [22]. A generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchangecorrelation functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBEsol) [23] was used. Scalar-relativistic
norm-conserving pseudopotentials for core states [24] generated with PseudoDojo [25] and doublezeta basis set for localized atomic orbitals were employed, with the following valence configurations
for atoms: In 4s24p64d105s25p1, Sn 4s24p64d105s25p2, Ga 3s23p63d104s24p1 and O 2s22p4. A real-space
mesh with energy cutoff of 300 Ry and 3x3x3 reciprocal-space mesh of the Monkhorst-Pack type [26]
were found sufficient to perform structure optimizations and calculate the second-order interatomic
force constants. The force and stress convergence criteria were set to 0.001 eV/Å and 0.005 GPa,
respectively. For relaxed In2O3 with 40-atom primitive cell (In16O24) we have obtained a lattice
constant of 10.048 Å and volumetric density of 7.27 g/cm3, which are close to experimental values of
10.117 Å [27] and 7.18 g/cm3 [28].
The ITO with various Ga doping concentrations was simulated by adding (removing) a certain
number of Ga (In) atoms in a 40-atom primitive cell of bixbyite crystal structure, an example of which
7

is shown in Figure 5. In all cells one indium atom at b-site was replaced by a tin atom, which
corresponds to ITO with 6.25 at. % Sn-doping. The harmonic force constants were calculated using
the finite difference method as implemented in the PHONOPY package [29]. The displacement length
of each atom from its equilibrium position was set to 0.015 Å.

Figure 5. Example of ITO:Ga crystal structure. Two octahedra denote Sn (green) and Ga (blue)
substitutional defects surrounded by six nearest oxygen atoms.

Once the interatomic force constants were obtained, the dynamical matrix was constructed and
diagonalized, thus obtaining phonon dispersions ωωss (qq), where s is phonon branch number and q is
phonon wavevector. Based on the phonon dispersion data the phonon thermal conductivity was
calculated using the linearized Boltzmann transport equation:
κκpph =

∂∂∂∂

(1)

In Equation 1 summation is performed over entire Brillouin zone mesh and all phonon branches, T is
the temperature, N is the number of q-mesh points, V is the unit cell volume, ωω and υυxx = dddd⁄ddqqxx are

the phonon frequency and group velocity along the thermal gradient, ττ is the phonon lifetime and f is

the Bose-Einstein distribution function. Converged results for thermal conductivity were achieved for

a dense 20x20x20 q-point mesh (N=8000 points). It is implied in Equation (1) that thermal flux is
directed along the temperature gradient, that is along X Cartesian axis. The choice of the latter is
formal, since thermal conductivity tensor in bixbyite crystals is isotropic.
In case of crystalline (nanocrystalline) structures the phonon scattering rate was calculated
according to the Matthiessen's rule:
1⁄ττ = 1⁄ττUU + 1⁄ττGGGG ,
8

(2)

where 1⁄ττUU = BBBBωωss2 (qq)ee −1⁄TT

is the three-phonon Umklapp scattering rate [30] and

1⁄ττGGGG = υυss (qq)⁄llGG is the phonon scattering rate on grain (i.e. nanocrystal) boundaries with the average

grain size llGG . The scattering on grains is assumed to be diffusive, so all incident phonons completely
lose their momenta after they reach the grain boundary. Parameter B=10-18 s/K of the Umklapp
scattering was found from the comparison between calculated and experimental [7] thermal
conductivities of pure In2O3, i.e. without phonon scattering on grains.
In case of amorphous structures, the dominant mechanism of heat transport is diffusion between
localized atomic vibrations [31], in contrast to the wave-like phonon transport in crystals. In order to
model the diffusive character of thermal transport in amorphous ITO:Ga we employ here an approach
developed by some of us in Ref. [32]. Comparing equations for lattice thermal conductivity within
linearized BTE (see Equation (1)) and within a random-walk diffusion theory of heat conduction [33],
and can obtain the following expression for the rate of diffusion of lattice vibrations in an amorphous
material:
1⁄ττ =

3ππυυss2 (qq)ωωss (qq)
2⁄3

〈ωω〉2

,

(3)

where VV0 is the volume per atom and 〈ωω〉 is the mean vibrational frequency, which we have estimated

from the condition that 〈ωω〉 is the frequency at which integrated phonon density of states (DOS) equals
〈ωω〉

one-half: ∫0

gg(ωω)dddd = 1⁄2. In this way we avoided using any free parameters in our thermal

conductivity model for ITO:Ga films.

The electronic part κκeeee was estimated according to the filtering model [10,11,34]. Necessary

parameters of ITO used in the calculations were taken from [35]. Electron scattering on polar optical
phonons and ionized impurities were taken into consideration. The total thermal conductivity was
obtained as a sum of the phononic and electronic parts: κκtttttt = κκpph + κκeeee . Also, the porosity is an

inevitable structural factor for spray-pyrolyzed structures. The effect of porosity on thermal
conductivity of ITO:Ga was accounted according to the effective medium theory [36,37]. The porosity
of our films was estimated in the range 25-35% by comparing the real refractive index of the films
measured by laser ellipsometry with the same one for the bulk material [38]. This porosity is within a
reasonable range, since 44% porosity of In2O3 [39] was reported for samples synthesized at 100 °C.
We note here, that we do not clarify an influence of pore ordering and their geometry on κκtttttt , since

currently we have no technological control over these factors. This question requires an additional
investigations and remains to be addressed in the future. Thereby, for all calculated structures the
porosity was constant and fixed to 30% to facilitate the theoretical analysis and rather to focus on
9

understanding how changes in phonon dispersion and scattering mechanisms affect the thermal
transport at various Ga concentrations. It is worth noting, that higher porosity means lower thermal
conductivity, thus providing another way for phonon engineering [40–43] and tuning the
thermoelectric performance of indium oxide based material.

5. Results and Discussions
For accurate modeling of the thermal conductivity in our structures we should determine which
position of the ITO lattice tend to occupy Ga atoms. For this purpose, we have extracted the lattice
constants at different Ga concentrations from our XRD measurements and compared them with
theoretical values calculated from DFT relaxation procedure. Figure 6 shows the evolution of the ITO
lattice constant as a function of Ga content.

Figure 6. Lattice constant of ITO:Ga as a function of Ga content. Squares denote XRD data. Red and
blue circles denote theoretical calculations with Ga atoms placed in different positions (interstitial csite and substitutional d-site).

According to our previous work on In2O3 point defect formation energies [9], there are in general
two possible scenarios for Ga atoms. In the first scenario all Ga atoms occupy substitutional positions
(Figure 6, blue circles), which are the most energetically favorable. Here the theory predicts the
compression of ITO crystal structure with a linear decrease of lattice constant given by the law:
aa(xx ) = aa(0) − 0.0085xx, where aa(0) = 10.06 Å. In the second scenario, which is less likely from

energetical point of view, Ga atom is placed at an intersite (c-site, i.e. structural vacancy, specific for
10

Ia-3 space group). In this case calculations predict an expansion of the crystal structure with an
increase of the lattice constant from 10.06 Å at 0 at. % Ga to 10.16 Å at 6.25 at. % Ga. However,

introduction of additional Ga atoms in substitutional positions results again in the lattice compression
(Figure 6, red circles). According to experimental data (Figure 6, squares) the lattice constant
decreases when Ga content increases from 0 at. % to 15 at. %, thus supporting the first theoretical
scenario with all Ga atoms forming substitutional point defects. Our study of ITO:Ga system
demonstrates that within the given technological conditions the bixbyite lattice structure is maintained
until a quarter of In atoms is substituted by guest atoms and no secondary oxide phases (SnO2, Ga2O3)
appear with non-bixbyite crystallographic symmetries, that confirms the high stability of cubic In2O3
structure. On the other hand, such substitution value (~0.25) also means a high solubility limit of Ga
atoms in ITO system. Further increase of Ga doping dramatically changes the crystal structure: XRD
and SEM measurements (see Figures 1-2) show that the structures become amorphous and lose the
long-range atomic order. Nevertheless, it means that formation of In-Sn-Ga-O compound occurs even
with increased Ga content in the deposited precursor. Otherwise, traces of the bixbyite structure should
have been preserved on the XRD spectra.
Figure 7a shows the room temperature total thermal conductivity in ITO:Ga films as a function
of Ga content. Squares denote experimental data, while circles represent theoretical calculations of
κκtttttt with Ga atoms in substitutional positions. Calculation of κκeeee within filtering model [10,11,34] is

also presented for comparison (triangles). Intending to elucidate how the changes in crystalline
structure affect the thermal conductivity at different Ga concentrations, we have performed two
calculations of κκpph : (i) with phonon lifetime for crystalline films according to Equation (2) (blue

circles in Figure 7a) and (ii) with phonon lifetime for amorphous films according to Equation (3)
(green circles in Figure 7a). In general, the experimental results reveal a decreasing trend in κκtttttt for

increasing Ga doping up to 15-20 at. %, which reasonably agrees with calculations employing phonon

lifetimes for crystalline films. As the level of disorder increases further (20 at. % and 30 at. % Ga) the
thermal conductivity saturates around value ~ 0.5-0.6 Wm-1K-1, which is close to the theoretical
predictions with phonon lifetimes for the amorphous case. Thus, our theoretical results suggest that in
the range 15-20 at. % Ga there is an evolution from propagative (i.e. crystalline) to diffusive (i.e.
amorphous) phonon thermal transport in ITO:Ga films, which is in a good agreement with XRD and
SEM measurements showing crystal-to-amorphous structural transition.
At the same time our estimation of the electronic thermal conductivity demonstrates reduction of
κκeeee from 0.28 Wm-1K-1 at 0 at. % Ga down to 0.19 Wm-1K-1 at 18.75 at. % Ga. Amplification of
11

electron scattering arises from reduction of the grain size with the rise of Ga content. The electron
concentration in the conduction band remains unchanged because of isovalent nature of Ga impurity.
The obtained values of κκeeee are in the same range as κκpph in amorphous calculation, while they are

several times lower than κκpph in crystalline calculation. It is clear from Figure 7a that decreasing of

total thermal conductivity of ITO:Ga films as Ga concentration increases up to 15-20 at. % is mainly
due to suppression of the phononic contribution. Specifically, there are two responsible factors: (i)
reduction of the average grain size llGG (see Figure 3) with the corresponding increase of the phonon

scattering rate and (ii) modification of the phonon energy spectra accompanied by diminution of the
average group velocity of phonons (see Figure 8b below). These are the main factors behind the
thermal conductivity drop in the nanocrystalline ITO:Ga films.

Figure 7. (a) Total thermal conductivity of ITO:Ga films at 300 K as a function of Ga content. Squares
represent experimental data, while circles denote theoretical calculations with phonon lifetimes for
crystalline (blue circles) and amorphous (green circles) materials. Electronic thermal conductivity is

"crystalline" and "amorphous" phonon lifetimes are presented.

A useful quantity that reveals the contribution of phonons at various energies into heat conduction
is the spectral phonon thermal conductivity κκpph (EE), determined by: κκpph = ∫ κκpph (EE)dddd. Figure 7b

shows κκpph (EE) in crystalline and amorphous calculations for ITO with 0 at. % Ga (red line) and 18.75

at. % Ga (blue and green lines). The largest contribution to κκpph comes from phonons with energies in

the range 0-35 meV. The contribution of higher energy modes >40 meV in the amorphous case (green
12

line) is ~25% of κκpph , while it is almost negligible in the crystalline case (red and blue lines) due to an

enhanced phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering characterized by a quadratic dependence on phonon
frequency: 1⁄ττUU ~ωω2 . Moreover, it is obviously seen that suppression of thermal conductivity with
increasing Ga content in the crystalline case is due to the weaker contribution from low-energy (0-35

meV) vibrations. In case of amorphous films (>15 at. % Ga) the κκpph (EE) dependence is almost

insensitive to the amount of Ga since according to Equations (1) and (3) κκpph (EE)~〈ωω〉, while mean
vibrational frequency 〈ωω〉 deviates very weakly for different Ga concentrations e.g. ħ〈ωω〉 = 46 meV
at 0 at. % Ga and ħ〈ωω〉 = 45 meV at 18.75 at. % Ga.

We now turn to a more detailed analysis of the phonon properties and associated effects behind

the thermal conductivity suppression in our ITO:Ga films. The phonon dispersion and projected
density of states (PDOS) in ITO with 18.75 at. % Ga is shown in Figure 8a. The PDOS curves are
presented per one atom of the respective specimen. The maximum energy of optic phonons is ~80
meV and is only weakly dependent on Ga doping. Three acoustic branches (light green curves) - one
longitudinal acoustic (LA) and two transversal acoustic (TA) demonstrate a linear dispersion near the
Brillouin zone center, with sound velocities: υυLLLL=4.7 km/s and υυTTTT =2.9 km/s. At 0 at. % Ga υυLLLL=4.8

km/s and υυTTTT =3.0 km/s, so one can conclude that rise of Ga content results in a weak softening of the
acoustic branches.

spectra highlight acoustic branches. The orange circle designates the region with a clear avoided
crossing. (b) Average phonon group velocity as a function of phonon energy in ITO with 0 at. % Ga
(red line) and 18.75 at. % Ga (blue line). (c) Avoided-crossing behavior of phonon dispersion in
ITO:Ga. (d) Phonon mean free paths at 300 K.
According to the dispersion and PDOS data it is natural to split the whole energy range into the
lower part (0-35 meV), which is dominated by the vibrations of the metal atoms and the upper part
(>40 meV) in which the vibrations of lighter oxygen atoms determine the vibrational spectrum. These
two parts are separated by an energy gap in the range ~35-40 meV, which slightly narrows as Ga
concentration increases. The low-energy part of the spectra is characterized by hybridization (mixing)
of metal-type vibrational modes - mixed In/Sn, In/Ga and Sn/Ga modes. These hybridized modes are
accompanied by the appearance of multiple avoided-crossing points throughout the Brillouin zone
(see Figure 8c for an example), resulting in the flattening of the dispersion law and a corresponding
decrease of the average group velocity at phonon energies between 10 and 30 meV (see Figure 8b).
This effect is more pronounced for higher Ga concentrations and it plays an important role in the
suppression of the phonon heat conduction in nanocrystalline ITO:Ga films. The similar avoided14

crossing behavior was found in "host-guest" type materials such as Ba8Ga16Ge30 clathrate [44] and
YbFe4Sb12 skutterudite [45]. An analytical model describing the phonon dispersion relation of hostguest lattices with heavy guest atoms was recently proposed in Ref. [46].
It is insightful to separate between the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the κκpph of

ITO:Ga at different Ga-doping. The intrinsic element is the modification of phonon dispersion and
group velocities, related to the changes in the atomic composition and interatomic forces. From the
extrinsic factors, we can distinguish the variation in average grain size, which directly affects the
phonon scattering rate on the grain boundaries. It should be noted, that extrinsic factors usually could
be tailored within a certain limit by the technological conditions, thus providing additional way for
managing the thermal flux in ITO-based structures. In order to quantify the influence of the above
factors on κκpph we show in Figure 8d the mean free paths (MFPs) of phonons calculated taking into

account Umklapp processes and phonon scattering on the grain boundaries (red and blue triangles). It

can be seen that MFP of low-energy phonons (<10meV) in nanocrystalline ITO:Ga is limited merely
by the scattering on grains with an average grain size llGG =24nm for 0 at. % Ga and llGG =15nm for 18.75

at. % Ga, as was determined from our XRD measurements presented in Figure 3. For higher energies,

the phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering prevails and the phonon MFP quickly drops. Nevertheless,
according to the Bose-Einstein distribution the population factors of the low-energy modes are smaller
than of higher energy modes, as a result the overall contribution to the heat flux from the energy range
0-10 meV does not exceed 30% as determined from the spectral κκpph data (see Figure 7b). At the same

time, phonons with energies 10-35 meV are the main heat carriers at room temperature transferring
more than 2/3 of the total thermal flux. Therefore, the drop in thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline
ITO:Ga films as the Ga content increases is primarily due to the redistribution of the vibrational
spectrum in this energy range, leading to diminution of the average group velocity and MFPs of
phonons. Finally, in the upper part of the spectra (>40 meV) all modes possess MFPs below 1 nm
owing to the low group velocities and enhanced Umklapp scattering, resulting in an almost negligible
contribution to the thermal conductivity as follows from κκpph (EE) on Figure 7b. In contrast, the phonon
MFPs in an amorphous calculation (gray triangles in Figure 8d) are almost uniformly distributed over
entire energy range and this picture is independent of Ga content. It explains the relatively high
contribution of high-energy phonon modes in the amorphous case as well as the much weaker
dependence of phonon thermal conductivity on Ga amount in comparison with nanocrystalline
ITO:Ga films.

6. Conclusions
Thermal properties of ITO thin films with Ga concentrations up to 30 at. % deposited by spray
pyrolysis were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. XRD and SEM spectra showed the
existence of In2O3 nanocrystalline phase in the range 0-15 at. % Ga, while for higher Ga
concentrations the films demonstrated an amorphous structure. The incorporation of Ga atoms into
the host lattice during the growth in given technological conditions is an important finding regarding
the high Ga solubility limit in ITO. TDTR measurements revealed a decreasing of room temperature
thermal conductivity with increase of Ga-content from 2.0 Wm-1K-1 at 5 at. % Ga down to 0.8 Wm1

K-1 at 15 at. % Ga, while for higher Ga concentrations thermal conductivity saturates ~0.5-0.6 Wm-

1

K-1. Theoretical modelling within DFT and BTE approaches demonstrated that this drop of thermal

conductivity is primarily due to the redistribution of the metal atoms vibrations in the energy range
10-35 meV, accompanied by the appearance of multiple avoided-crossing modes throughout the
Brillouin zone with decreased group velocity and shortened phonon MFPs. In the range 15-20 at. %
Ga both experimental and theoretical results confirm the evolution from propagative to diffusive
phonon thermal transport in ITO:Ga nanofilms. The obtained results demonstrate the practical
possibility of engineering the thermal conductivity in ITO films by Ga doping and may lead to their
thermoelectric applications.
