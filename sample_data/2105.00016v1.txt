Abstract. A theorem due to Kazhdan and Ziegler implies that, by substituting linear forms for its
variables, a homogeneous polynomial of sufficiently high strength specialises to any given polynomial
of the same degree in a bounded number of variables. Using entirely different techniques, we extend
this theorem to arbitrary polynomial functors. As a corollary of our work, we show that specialisation
induces a quasi-order on elements in polynomial functors, and that among the infinite-strength
elements there is a unique smallest equivalence class in this quasi-order.

1. Introduction and main results
Fix a field K. In our main results we will assume that K is algebraically closed and of characteristic
zero, but for now we make no such assumption.
1.1. Strength.
Definition 1.1.1. Let n ≥ 1 be an integer and let f ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xn ]d be a homogeneous polynomial
of degree d ≥ 2. Then the strength of f , denoted str(f ), is the minimal integer k ≥ 0 such that there
exists an expression
f = g 1 * h1 + . . . + g k * hk
where gi ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xn ]di and hi ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xn ]d−di for some integer 0 < di < d for each i ∈ [k]. ♦
The strength of polynomials plays a key role in the resolution of Stillman's conjecture by AnanyanHochster [1, 2], the subsequent work by Erman-Sam-Snowden [12, 13, 14] and in Kazhdan-Ziegler's
work [17, 18]. Also see [3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10] for other recent papers studying strength.
1.2. Polynomial functors and their maps. Assume that K is infinite. Let Vec be the category
of finite-dimensional vector spaces over K with K-linear maps.
Definition 1.2.1. A polynomial functor of degree ≤ d over K is a functor P : Vec → Vec with the
property that for all U, V ∈ Vec the map P : Hom(U, V ) → Hom(P (U ), P (V )) is a polynomial map of
degree ≤ d. A polynomial functor is a polynomial functor of degree ≤ d for some integer d < ∞. ♦
Remark 1.2.2. For finite fields K, the correct analogue is that of a strict polynomial functor [15]. ♦
Any polynomial functor P is a finite direct sum of its homogeneous parts Pd , which are the polynomial subfunctors defined by Pd (V ) := {p ∈ P (V ) | ∀t ∈ K : P (t idV )p = td p} for each integer d ≥ 0.
A polynomial functor is called homogeneous of degree d when it equals its degree-d part.
Example 1.2.3. The functor U 7→ S d (U ) is a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree d. If U has
basis x1 , . . . , xn , then S d (U ) is canonically isomorphic to K[x1 , . . . , xn ]d . In this incarnation, linear
maps S d (φ) for φ : U → V correspond to substitutions of the variables x1 , . . . , xn by linear forms in
variables y1 , . . . , ym representing a basis of V .

Polynomial functors are the ambient spaces in current research on infinite-dimensional algebraic
geometry [6, 7, 8, 11]. Polynomial functors form an Abelian category in which a morphism α : P → Q
consists of a linear map αU : P (U ) → Q(U ) for each U ∈ Vec such that for all U, V ∈ Vec and all
φ ∈ Hom(U, V ) the following diagram commutes:
P (U )

αU

P (φ)


P (V )

// Q(U )
Q(φ)

αV


// Q(V ).

In characteristic zero, each polynomial functor P is isomorphic, in this Abelian category, to a direct
sum of Schur functors, which can be thought of as subobjects (or quotients) of the polynomial functors
V 7→ V ⊗d . For that reason, we will informally refer to elements of P (V ) as tensors.
In addition to the linear morphisms between polynomial functors above, we may also allow each αU
to be a polynomial map P (U ) → Q(U ) such that the diagram commutes. Such an α will be called
a polynomial transformation from P to Q. If U is irrelevant or clear from the context, we write α
instead of αU .
Lk
di
⊕ S d−di ) and Q := S d
Example 1.2.4. In the context of Definition 1.1.1, we set P :=
i=1 (S
and define α by
α(g1 , h1 , . . . , gk , hk ) := g1 * h1 + . . . + gk * hk .
This is a polynomial transformation P → Q.

♦

Example 1.2.5. Let Q, R be polynomial functors and α : Q ⊗ R → P a linear morphism. Then
(q, r) 7→ α(q ⊗ r) defines a bilinear polynomial transformation Q ⊕ R → P .
♦
Inspired by these examples, we propose the following definition of strength for elements of homogeneous polynomial functors. We are not sure that this is the best definition in arbitrary characteristic,
so we restrict ourselves to characteristic zero.
Definition 1.2.6. Assume that char K = 0. Let P be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree
d ≥ 2 and let V ∈ Vec. The strength of p ∈ P (V ) is the minimal integer k ≥ 0 such that
p = α1 (q1 , r1 ) + . . . + αk (qk , rk )
where, for each i ∈ [k], Qi , Ri are irreducible polynomial functors with positive degrees adding up
to d, αi : Qi ⊕ Ri → P is a bilinear polynomial transformation and qi ∈ Qi (V ) and ri ∈ Ri (V ) are
tensors.
♦
Remark 1.2.7. Positive degrees of two polynomial functors cannot add up to 1. So nonzero tensors
p ∈ P (V ) of homogeneous polynomial functors P of degree 1 cannot have finite strength. We say that
such tensors p have infinite strength. Note that the strength of 0 ∈ P (V ) always equals 0.
♦
Proposition 1.2.8. Assume that char K = 0. For each integer d ≥ 2, the strength of a polynomial
f ∈ S d (V ) according to Definition 1.1.1 equals that according to Definition 1.2.6.
Proof. The inequality ≥ follows from the fact that αi : S di ⊕ S d−di → S d , (g, h) 7→ g * h is a bilinear
polynomial transformation. For the inequality ≤, suppose that α : Q ⊕ R → S d is a nonzero bilinear
polynomial transformation, where Q and R are irreducible of degrees e < d and d − e < d. So Q
and R are Schur functors corresponding to Young diagrams with e and d − e boxes, respectively, and
Q ⊗ R admits a nonzero linear morphism to S d , whose Young diagram is a row of d boxes. The
Littlewood-Richardson rule then implies that the Young diagrams of Q and R must be a single row as
well, so that Q = S e and R = S d−e , and also that there is (up to scaling) a unique morphism Q ⊗ R =
S e ⊗ S d−e → S d , namely, the one corresponding to the polynomial transformation (g, h) 7→ g * h. 
The strength of a tensor in P quickly becomes very difficult when P is not irreducible.

Example 1.2.9. Take P = (S d )⊕e for some integer e ≥ 1. Then the strength of a tuple (f1 , . . . , fe ) ∈
P (V ) is the minimum number k ≥ 0 such that
f1 , . . . , fe ∈ span{g1 , . . . , gk }
where g1 , . . . , gk ∈ S d (V ) are reducible polynomials.
♦
V
Example 1.2.10. Consider P = S 2 ⊕ 2 , so that P (V ) = V ⊗ V , and assume that K is algebraically closed. The only possibilities for Q and R are Q(V ) = R(V ) = V . The bilinear polynomial
transformations α : Q ⊕ R → P are of the form
α(u, v) = au ⊗ v + bv ⊗ u = c(u ⊗ v + v ⊗ u) + d(u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u)
for certain a, b, c, d ∈ K. We note that str(A) = ⌈rk(A)/2⌉ when A ∈ S 2 (V ) and str(A) = rk(A)/2
V
when A ∈ 2 (V ). In general, we have
rk(A)/2, rk(A + A⊤ )/2, rk(A − A⊤ )/2 ≤ str(A) ≤ rk(A), rk(A + A⊤ )/2 + rk(A − A⊤ )/2

for all A ∈ V ⊗ V , where each bound can hold with equality. For example, for the matrix


0 1

0 0




.
..
A=




0 1
0 0
we have rk(A + A⊤ )/2 = rk(A − A⊤ )/2 = str(A) = rk(A).
♦
V

Example 1.2.11. Again take P = S 2 ⊕
and consider P (K 2 ) = K 2×2 . Assume K is algebraically
closed. The matrix


1 x
A=
0 1
clearly has strength ≤ 2. We will show that A has strength 2 whenever x = ±2 and strength 1
otherwise. In particular, this shows that the subset of P (K 2 ) of matrices of strength ≤ 1 is not closed.
Suppose A has strength 1. Then we can write A as au ⊗ v + bv ⊗ u with a, b ∈ K and v, u ∈ K 2 .
Let e1 , e2 be the standard basis of K 2 . Without loss of generality, we may assume that u = e1 + λe2
and v = e1 + μe2 for some λ, μ ∈ K. We get
a + b = 1,

aμ + bλ = x,

aλ + bμ = 0,

λμ = 1.

Using λ = μ−1 and b = 1 − a, we are left with aμ2 + (1 − a) = xμ and a + (1 − a)μ2 = 0. The latter
gives us μ 6= ±1 and a = μ2 /(μ2 − 1). We get μ2 + 1 = xμ. Now, if x 6= ±2, then such a μ 6= ±1
exists. So in this case A indeed has strength 1. If x = ±2, the only solution is μ = ±1. Hence A has
strength 2 in this case.
♦
1.3. Subsets of polynomial functors.
Definition 1.3.1. Let P be a polynomial functor. A subset of P consists of a subset X(U ) ⊆ P (U )
for each U ∈ Vec such that for all φ ∈ Hom(U, V ) we have P (φ)(X(U )) ⊆ X(V ). It is closed if each
X(U ) is Zariski-closed in P (U ).
♦
Example 1.3.2. Fix integers d ≥ 2 and k ≥ 0. The elements in S d (V ) of strength ≤ k form a subset
of S d . This set is closed for d = 2, 3 but not for d = 4; see [3].
♦
Example 1.3.3. Take K = R and let X(V ) be the set of positive semidefinite elements in S 2 (V ),
i.e., those that are sums of squares of elements of V . Then X(V ) is a subset of S 2 .

1.4. Kazhdan-Ziegler's theorem: universality of strength.
Theorem 1.4.1 (Kazhdan-Ziegler [18, Theorem 1.9]). Let d ≥ 2 be an integer. Assume that K is
algebraically closed and of characteristic 0 or > d. Let X be a subset of S d . Then either X = S d or
else there exists an integer k ≥ 0 such that each polynomial in each X(U ) has strength ≤ k.
This theorem is a strengthening of [7, Theorem 4], where the additional assumption is that X is
closed. The condition that K be algebraically closed cannot be dropped, e.g. by Example 1.3.3: there
is no uniform upper bound on the strength of positive definite quadratic forms. The condition on the
characteristic can also not be dropped, but see Remark 1.9.2.
Corollary 1.4.2 (Kazhdan-Ziegler, universality of strength). With the same assumptions on K, for
every fixed number of variables m ≥ 1 and degree d ≥ 2 there exists an r ≥ 0 such that for any
number of variables n ≥ 1, any polynomial f ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xn ]d of P
strength ≥ r and any polynomial
g ∈ K[y1 , . . . , ym ]d there exists a linear variable substitution xj 7→ i cij yi under which f specialises
to g.
Proof. For each U ∈ Vec, define X(U ) ⊆ S d (U ) as the set of all f such that the map
Hom(U, K m ) → S d (K m )
φ 7→ S d (φ)f
is not surjective. A straightfoward computation shows that this is a subset of S d . It is not all of S d ,
because if we take U to be of dimension d * dim S d (K m ), then in S d (U ) we can construct a sum f of
dim S d (K m ) squarefree monomials in distinct variables and specialise each of these monomials to a
prescribed multiple of a basis monomial in S d (K m ). Hence f 6∈ X(U ). By Theorem 1.4.1, it follows
that the strength of elements of X(U ) is uniformly bounded.

1.5. Our generalisation: universality for polynomial functors. Let P, Q be polynomial functors. We say that Q is smaller than P , denoted Q ⋖ P , when P and Q are not (linearly) isomorphic
and Qd is a quotient of Pd for the highest degree d where Pd and Qd are not isomorphic. We say that
a polynomial functor P is pure when P ({0}) = {0}.
Remark 1.5.1. Let Q ⋖ P be polynomial functors and suppose that P is homogeneous of degree
d > 0. Then Qd must be a quotient of Pd . So we see that Q ⊕ R ⋖ P for any polynomial functor R
of degree < d.
♦
The following is our first main result.
Theorem 1.5.2 (Main Theorem I). Assume that K is algebraically closed of characteristic zero.
Let X be a subset of a pure polynomial functor P over K. Then either X(U ) = P (U ) for all U ∈ Vec
or else there exist finitely many polynomial functors Q1 , . . . , Qk ⋖ P and polynomial transformations
Sk
αi : Qi → P with X(U ) ⊆ i=1 im(αi,U ) for all U ∈ Vec. In the latter case, X is contained in a
proper closed subset of P .
If we assume furthermore that P is irreducible, then in the second case there exists a integer k ≥ 0
such that for all U ∈ Vec and all p ∈ X(U ) the strength of p is at most k.
This is a strengthening of a theorem from the upcoming paper [8] (also appearing in the first
author's thesis [6, Theorem 4.2.5]), where the additional assumption is that X be closed.
Remark 1.5.3. When P is irreducible of degree 1, then P (U ) = U . In this case, the subsets of P are
P and {0}. So indeed, the elements of a proper subset of P have bounded strength, namely 0.
♦
Again, the condition that K be algebraically closed cannot be dropped, and neither can the condition on the characteristic; however, see Remark 1.9.2. Main Theorem I has the same corollary as
Theorem 1.4.1.

Corollary 1.5.4. With the same assumptions as in Main Theorem I, let U ∈ Vec be a fixed vector
space. Then there exist finitely many polynomial functors Q1 , . . . , Qk ⋖ P and polynomial transforSk
mations αi : Qi → P such that for every V ∈ Vec and every f ∈ P (V ) that is not in i=1 im(αi,V )
the map Hom(V, U ) → P (U ), φ 7→ P (φ)f is surjective.
Sk
If P is irreducible, then the condition that f 6∈ i=1 im(αi,V ) can be replaced by the condition that
f has strength greater than some function of dim U only.
1.6. Limits and dense orbits. Let P be a pure polynomial functor over K. There is another point
of view on closed subsets of P , which involves limits that we define now.
Definition 1.6.1. We define P∞ := limn P (K n ), where the map P (K n+1 ) → P (K n ) is P (πn ) with
←−
πn : K n+1 → K n the projection map forgetting the last coordinate. We equip P∞ with the inverse
limit of the Zariski
topologies on the P (K n ), which is itself a Zariski topology coming from the fact
S
that P∞ = ( n P (K n )∗ )∗ . We also write P (πn ) for the projection map P∞ → P (K n ); this will
not lead to confusion. A polynomial transformation α : P → Q naturally yields a continuous map
P∞ → Q∞ also denoted by α.
♦
If P = S d , then the elements of P∞ can be thought of as homogeneous series of degree d in
infinitely many variables x1 , x2 , . . .. Here, closed subsets of P∞ are defined by polynomial equations
in the coefficients of these series. S
On P∞ acts the group GL∞ = n GLn , where GLn is embedded into GLn+1 via the map


g 0
g 7→
.
0 1
Indeed, with this embedding the map P (K n+1 ) → P (K n ) in the definition of P∞ is GLn -equivariant,
and this yields the action of GL∞ on the projective limit. In the case of degree-d series, an element
g ∈ GLn ⊂ GL∞ maps each of the first n variables xi to a linear combination of x1 , . . . , xn and the
remaining variables to themselves.
The map that sends a closed subset X of P to the closed subset X∞ := limn X(K n ) of P∞ is a
←−
bijection with the collection of closed GL∞ -stable subsets of P∞ [6, Proposition 1.3.28]. Hence closed
subsets of polynomial functors can also be studied in this infinite-dimensional setting.
Example 1.6.2. On degree-d forms, GL∞ clearly has dense orbits, such as that of
f = x1 x2 * * * xd + xd+1 xd+2 * * * x2d + . . .
The reason is that this series can be specialised to any degree-d form in finitely many variables by
linear variable substitutions. This implies that the image of GL∞ *f in each S d (K n ) is dense. Hence
d
.
♦
GL∞ *f is dense in S∞
For every pure polynomial functor P , the group GL∞ has dense orbits on P∞ -in fact, uncountably
many of them! See [6, §4.5.1]. They have the following interesting property.
Corollary 1.6.3. Suppose that GL∞ *p is dense in P∞ . Then for each integer n ≥ 1, the image of
GL∞ *p in P (K n ) is all of P (K n ).
Proof. For V ∈ Vec, define
X(V ) := {P (φ)P (πn )p | n ≥ 1, φ ∈ Hom(K n , V )} ⊆ P (V ),
which is exactly the image of GL∞ *p under the projection P∞ → P (K m ) followed by an isomorphism
P (φ), where φ : K m → V is a linear isomorphism. We see that X is a subset of P . For each V ∈ Vec,
the subset X(V ) is dense in P (V ) since GL∞ *p is dense in P∞ . So X = P by Main Theorem I.

The notion of strength has an obvious generalisation.
Definition 1.6.4. Assume that char K = 0. Let P be a homogeneous polynomial functor. The
strength of a tensor p ∈ P∞ is the minimal integer k ≥ 0 such that
p = α1 (q1 , r1 ) + . . . + αk (qk , rk )

for some irreducible polynomial functors Qi , Ri whose positive degrees sum up to d, bilinear polynomial
transformations αi : Qi ⊕ Ri → P and elements qi ∈ Qi,∞ and ri ∈ Ri,∞ . If no such k exists, we say
that p has infinite strength.
♦
Corollary 1.6.5. Assume that char K = 0 and that P is irreducible of degree ≥ 2. Then an element
of P∞ has infinite strength if and only if its GL∞ -orbit is dense.
Proof. If p ∈ P∞ has finite strength, then let αi : Qi × Ri → P be as in the definition above and let
α := α1 + . . . + αk : Q :=

k
M
(Qi ⊗ Ri ) → P
i=1

be their sum, so that p ∈ im(α). Consider the closed subset X = im(α), i.e., the closed subset
defined by X(V ) = im(αV ) for all V ∈ Vec. As dim Q(K n ) is a polynomial in n of degree < d, while
dim P (K n ) is a polynomial in n of degree d, we see that X(K n ) is a proper subset of P (K n ) for all
n ≫ 0. Since p ∈ X∞ , it follows that GL∞ *p is not dense.
Suppose, conversely, that GL∞ *p is not dense. Then it is contained in X∞ for some proper closed
subset X of P . Hence p has finite strength by Main Theorem I.

Example 1.6.6. Let P, Q be homogeneous functors of the same degree d ≥ 2 and let p ∈ P∞ be
an element of infinite strength. Then (p, 0) ∈ P∞ ⊕ Q∞ also has infinite strength, but the orbit
GL∞ *(p, 0) is not dense.
♦
Remark 1.6.7. In Section 3 we will use a generalisation of notation introduced here: for an integer
m ≥ 0 we will write P∞−m for the limit limn P (K [n]−[m]) over all integers n ≥ m. This space is
←−
isomorphic to P∞ , but the indices have been shifted by m. On P∞−m acts the group GL∞−m ∼
= GL∞ ,
which is the union of GL(K [n]−[m] ) over all n ≥ m. We denote the image of an element p ∈ P∞−m
in P (K [n]−[m] ) by p[n]−[m] . The inclusions ιn : K [n]−[m] → K n sending v 7→ (0, v) allow us to view
P∞−m as a subset of P∞ .
♦
Corollary 1.6.8. Let P be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree d ≥ 2 and m ≥ 0 an integer.
Let p ∈ P∞−m be a tensor whose GL∞−m -orbit is not dense and let q ∈ P∞ be an element with finite
strength. Then the GL∞ -orbit of p + q ∈ P∞ is also not dense.
Proof. Note that p is contained in the image of α : Q∞−m → P∞−m for some polynomial transformation α : Q → P with Q ⋖ P [6, Theorem 4.2.5] and q is contained in the image of β : R∞ → P∞ for
some polynomial transformation β : R → P with deg(R) < d. So since Q ⊕ R ⋖ P by Remark 1.5.1,
we see that p + q is contained in a proper closed subset of P . Hence its GL∞ -orbit is not dense. 
1.7. Linear endomorphisms. Our second goal in this paper is to show that there always exist
minimal f with dense orbits. This minimality relates to a monoid of linear endomorphisms extending
GL∞ , as follows. Elements of GL∞ are N × N matrices of the block form


g 0
0 I∞
where g ∈ GLn for some n and I∞ is the infinite identity matrix.
Definition 1.7.1. Let E ⊃ GL∞ be the monoid of N × N matrices with the property that each row
contains only finitely many nonzero entries.
♦
Example 1.7.2. For every integer i ≥ 1, let φi ∈ K ni ×mi be a matrix. Then the block matrix


φ1


φ2


..
.
is an element of E.

We define an action of E on P∞ as follows. Let p = (p0 , p1 , . . .) ∈ P∞ and φ ∈ E. For each integer
i ≥ 0, to compute qi in
q = (q0 , q1 , . . .) = P (φ)p
we choose ni ≥ 0 such that all the nonzero entries of the first i rows of φ are in the first ni columns.
Now, we let ψi ∈ K i×ni be the i × ni block in the upperleft corner of φ, so that


ψi 0
φ=
,
∗ ∗
and we set qi := P (ψi )pni . Note that if we replace ni by a larger number ñi , then the resulting matrix
ψ̃i satisfies ψ̃i = ψi ◦ π, where π : K ñi → K ni is the projection. Consequently, we then have
P (ψ̃i )pñi = P (ψi )P (π)pñi = P (ψi )pni ,
so that qi is, indeed, well-defined. A straightforward computation shows that, for φ, ψ ∈ E, we have
P (ψ) ◦ P (φ) = P (ψ ◦ φ), so that E does indeed act on P∞ .
P∞
For infinite degree-d forms, the action of φ ∈ E is by linear variable substitutions xj 7→ i=1 φij xi .
Note that, since each xi appears in the image of only finitely many xj , this substitution does indeed
make sense on infinite degree-d series.
Since GL∞ ⊆ E, an E-stable subset of P∞ is also GL∞ -stable. The converse does not hold, since
for instance E also contains the zero matrix, and P (0)f = 0 6= P (g)f for all nonzero f ∈ P∞ and
g ∈ GL∞ when the polynomial functor P is pure. However, it is easy to see that GL∞ -stable closed
subsets of P∞ are also E-stable. In particular, we have GL∞ *f = P (E)f .
1.8. A quasi-order on infinite tensors.
Definition 1.8.1. For infinite tensors p, q ∈ P∞ we write p  q if p ∈ P (E)q. In this case, we say
that q specialises to p.
♦
From the fact that E is a unital monoid that acts on P∞ , we find that  is transitive and reflexive.
Hence it induces an equivalence relation ≃ on P∞ by
p ≃ q :⇔ p  q and q  p,
as well as a partial order on the equivalence classes of ≃.
Example 1.8.2. Fix an integer k ≥ 1 and consider the polynomial functor P = (S 1 )⊕k . A tuple
1
q = (q1 , . . . , qk ) ∈ P∞ has a dense GL∞ -orbit if and only if q1 , . . . , qk ∈ S∞
are linearly independent.
Suppose that q has a dense GL∞ -orbit and let A be the N × k matrix corresponding to q. Then A
has full rank. By acting with an element of GL∞ ⊆ E, we may assume that
 
Ik
A=
B
where B is again an N × k matrix. Now, take
φC :=



Ik
C

I∞



∈E

and note that φ−B A = (Ik 0)⊤ , so that P (φ−B )q = (x1 , . . . , xk ). So any two tuples in P∞ with a
dense GL∞ -orbit are in the same equivalence class. Moreover, the element of E specializing one tuple
to the other can be chosen to be invertible in E as φC φ−C = I∞ .
♦
There is an obvious relation between  and orbit closures, namely: if p  q, then p ∈ GL∞ *q. The
converse, however, is not true.
3
Example 1.8.3. Let p = x1 (x21 + x22 + . . .), q = x31 + x32 + . . . ∈ S∞
. Then q has infinite strength and
3
so p ∈ S∞ = GL∞ *q. However, we have p 6 q: suppose that

f := x1 g(x1 , x2 , . . .) + h(x2 , x3 , . . .) ∈ S 3 (E)q

3
for some g ∈ S∞
and h ∈ S∞
. As only finitely many variables xi are substituted by linear forms
containing x1 when specialising q to f , we see that

x1 g(x1 , x2 , . . .) + h̃(x2 , x3 , . . .) ∈ S 3 (E)(x31 + x32 + . . . + x3n )
3
for some integer n ≥ 1 and h̃ ∈ S∞
. From this, it is easy to see that g has finite strength. Hence
2
2
f 6= p as x1 + x2 + . . . has infinite strength. So indeed p 6 q.
♦

In order to have a tensor p ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit, the polynomial functor P must be pure.
For some time, we believed that when this is the case all elements p ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit
might form a single ≃-equivalence class. When P has degree ≤ 2, this is in fact true; see Example 4.1.4.
However, it doesn't hold for cubics.
3
Example 1.8.4. Let p, q ∈ S∞
be as before. Now also consider r = p(x1 , x3 , . . .) + q(x2 , x4 , . . .).

We have q = r(0, x1 , 0, x2 , . . .)  r and so S∞
= GL∞ *q ⊆ GL∞ *r. Hence both q and r have dense
GL∞ -orbits. And, we have r 6 q: indeed, otherwise p = r(x1 , 0, x2 , 0, . . .)  r  q, but p 6 q.

1.9. Minimal classes of elements with dense orbits. Our second main result is the following.
Theorem 1.9.1 (Main Theorem II). Suppose that K is algebraically closed of characteristic zero.
Let P be a pure homogeneous polynomial functor over K. Then there exist tensors p, r ∈ P∞ whose
GL∞ -orbits are dense such that p  q  r for all q ∈ P∞ whose GL∞ -orbit is dense.
The elements p that have this property form a single ≃-class which lies below the ≃-classes of all
other q ∈ P∞ whose GL∞ -orbit is dense. For the construction of such a tensor p ∈ P∞ , see §3.1. For
the construction of the tensor r ∈ P∞ , see §3.4.
Remark 1.9.2. In both our Main Theorems, we require that the characteristic be zero. This is
because the results in [6] and [8] require this. However, the proof of topological Noetherianity for
polynomial functors in [11] does not require characteristic zero, and shows that after a shift and a
localisation, a closed subset of a polynomial functor admits a homeomorphism into an open subset of
a smaller polynomial functor. In characteristic zero, this is in fact a closed embedding, so that it can
be inverted and yields a parameterisation of (part of) the closed subset. In positive characteristic, it
is not a closed embedding, but the map still becomes invertible if one formally inverts the Frobenius
morphism; this is touched upon in [8]. This might imply variants of our Main Theorems in arbitrary
characteristic, but we have not yet pursued this direction in detail.

2. Proof of Main Theorem I
2.1. The linear approximation of a polynomial functor.
Let P be a polynomial functor over
L∞
an infinite field and let U, V ∈ Vec. Then P (U ⊕ V ) = d,e=0 Qd,e (U, V ) where
Qd,e (U, V ) := {v ∈ P (U ⊕ V ) | ∀s, t ∈ K : P (s idU ⊕ t idV )v = sd te v} ⊆ Pd+e (U ⊕ V ).

The terms with e = 0 add up to P (U ), and the terms with e = 1 add up to a polynomial bifunctor
evaluated at (U, V ) that is linear in V . This is necessarily of the form P ′ (U ) ⊗ V , where P ′ is a
polynomial functor. In other words, we have
P (U ⊕ V ) = P (U ) ⊕ (P ′ (U ) ⊗ V ) ⊕ higher-degree terms in V.
We informally think of the first two terms as the linear approximation of P around U . Now suppose
that we have a short exact sequence
0→P →Q→R→0
of polynomial functors. This implies that for all U, V we have a short exact sequence
{0} → P (U ⊕ V ) → Q(U ⊕ V ) → R(U ⊕ V ) → {0}

UNIVERSALITY OF HIGH-STRENGTH TENSORS

9

and inspecting the degree-1 parts in V we find a short exact sequence
0 → P ′ → Q′ → R′ → 0.
This, and further straightforward computations, shows that P 7→ P ′ is an exact functor from the
category of polynomial functors to itself.
Remark 2.1.1. For U ∈ Vec fixed, denote the polynomial functor sending V 7→ P (U ⊕ V ) and
φ 7→ P (idU ⊕φ) by ShU (P ). Then we have
ShU (P )e (V ) = {v ∈ P (U ⊕ V ) | ∀t ∈ K : P (idU ⊕ t idV )v = te v}
and from this we see that Qd,e (U, V ) = ShU (P )e (V ) ∩ Pd+e (U ⊕ V ). In particular, when P is homoLd
geneous of degree d, we see that P (U ⊕ V ) = e=0 Qd−e,e (U, V ) where Qd−e,e (U, V ) = ShU (P )e (V ).
Also note that, in this case, ShU (P )0 (V ) = P (U ) and ShU (P )d (V ) = P (V ) via the inclusions of U, V
into U ⊕ V .

Example 2.1.3. Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Then S p contains the
subfunctor P (V ) := {v p | v ∈ V }. We have P (U ⊕ V ) = P (U ) ⊕ P (V ), and hence P ′ = 0.
♦
2.2. Proof of Main Theorem I. In this subsection we prove Theorem 1.5.2. We start with a result
of independent interest.
Theorem 2.2.1. Let P be a pure polynomial functor over an algebraically closed field Kof characteristic 0 or > deg(P ) and let X be a subset of P such that X(V ) is dense in P (V ) for all V ∈ Vec.
Then, in fact, X(V ) is equal to P (V ) for all V ∈ Vec.
Example 1.3.3 shows that the condition that K be algebraically closed cannot be dropped. We do
not know if the condition on the characteristic of K can be dropped, but the proof will use that the
polynomial functor P ′ introduced in §2.1 is sufficiently large, which, by Example 2.1.3, need not be
the case when char K is too small.
Proof. Let q ∈ P (K n ). For each k ≥ n, we consider the incidence variety
Zk := {(φ, r) ∈ Hom(K k , K n ) × P (K k ) | rk(φ) = n and P (φ)r = q}.
We write ek := dimK P (K k ). Since for every φ ∈ Hom(K k , K n ) of rank n the linear map P (φ) is
surjective, Zk is a vector bundle of rank ek − en over the rank-n locus in Hom(K k , K n ). Hence Zk is
an irreducible variety with dim Zk = kn+ek −en . We therefore expect the projection Π : Zk → P (K k )
to be dominant for k ≫ n. To prove that this is indeed the case, we need to show that for z ∈ Zk
sufficiently general, the local dimension at z of the fibre Π−1 (Π(z)) is (at most) dim(Zk )−ek = kn−en .
By the upper semicontinuity of the fibre dimension, it suffices to exhibit a single point z with this
property, and indeed, it suffices to show that the tangent space to the fibre at z has dimension (at
most) kn − en .
To find such a point z, set U := K n and V := K k−n and consider
z := (πU , P (ιU )q + r) ∈ Zk ,
where πU : U ⊕ V → U is the projection and ιU : U → U ⊕ V is the inclusion and where we will choose
r ∈ P ′ (U ) ⊗ V ⊆ P (U ⊕ V ). Note that then
P (ιU )q + r ∈ P (U ) ⊕ (P ′ (U ) ⊗ V ) ⊆ P (U ⊕ V )
and that P (πU )r = 0 so that z does, indeed, lie in Zk .

10

The tangent space Tz Π−1 (Π(z)) (projected into Hom(K k , K n )) is contained in the solution space
of the linear system of equations
P (πU + ǫψ)(P (ιU )q + r) = q

mod ǫ2

for ψ. By the rank theorem, the dimension of this solution space equals kn = dim(Hom(K k , K n ))
minus the rank of the linear map
Hom(U ⊕ V, U ) → P (U ), ψ 7→ the coefficient of ǫ in P (πU + ǫψ)(P (ιU )q + r).
So it suffices to prove that for all k ≫ n there is a suitable r such that this linear map is surjective. In
fact, we will restrict the domain to those ψ ∈ Hom(U ⊕ V, U ) of the form ω ◦ πV where πV : U ⊕ V → V
is the projection and ω ∈ Hom(V, U ). Then
P (πU + ǫψ)(P (ιU )q) = P ((πU + ǫω ◦ πV ) ◦ ιU )q = P (idU )q = q
So P (ιU )q does not contribute to the coefficient of ǫ and this coefficient equals
P (idU + idU )(idP ′ (U) ⊗ ω)r
where idU + idU : U ⊕ U → U is the map sending (u1 , u2 ) to u1 + u2 . Note that the codomain of
idP ′ (U) ⊗ ω equals P ′ (U ) ⊗ U ⊆ P (U ⊕ U ), so that the composition above makes sense. Below we will
show that for k − n = dim V ≫ n and suitable r ∈ P ′ (U ) ⊗ V the linear map
ΩP,V,r : Hom(V, U ) → P (U )
ω 7→ P (idU + idU )(idP ′ (U) ⊗ ω)r
is surjective.
Hence there exists a k such that Zk → P (K k ) is dominant. By Chevalley's theorem, the image
contains a dense open subset of P (K k ), and this dense open subset intersects the dense set X(K k ).
Hence there exists an element p ∈ X(K k ) and a φ ∈ Hom(K k , K n ) such that P (φ)p = q. Finally,
since X is a subset of P , also q is a point in X(K n ). Hence X(K n ) = P (K n ) for each n, as desired. 
Lemma 2.2.2. Let P be a polynomial functor over an infinite field K with char(K) = 0 or char(K) >
deg(P ) and let U ∈ Vec. Then for V ∈ Vec with dim V ≫ dim U , there exists an r ∈ P ′ (U ) ⊗ V
such that
ΩP,V,r : Hom(V, U ) → P (U )
ω 7→ P (idU + idU )(idP ′ (U) ⊗ ω)r
is surjective.
Proof. When char(K) = 0, the Abelian category of polynomial functors is semisimple, with the
Schur functors as a basis. When char(K) = p > 0, the situation is more complicated. The irreducible
polynomial functors still correspond to partitions [16, Theorem 3.5]. A degree-d irreducible polynomial
functor is a submodule of the functor T (V ) = V ⊗d if and only if the corresponding partition is column
p-regular [19, Theorem 3.2]. Luckily, this is always the case when d < p. And, the Abelian category of
polynomial functors of degree < p is semisimple [16, Corollary 2.6e]. Now, if P, Q are such polynomial
functors and r1 ∈ P ′ (U ) ⊗ V and r2 ∈ Q′ (U ) ⊗ W have the required property for P, Q, respectively,
then
r := (r1 , r2 ) ∈ (P ′ (U ) ⊗ V ) ⊕ (Q′ (U ) ⊗ W ) ⊆ (P ′ (U ) ⊕ Q′ (U )) ⊗ (V ⊕ W )
= (P ⊕ Q)′ (U ) ⊗ (V ⊕ W )
has the required property for P ⊕ Q. Hence it suffices to prove the lemma in the case where P is an
irreducible polynomial functor of degree d. We then have T = P ⊕ Q, where T (V ) = V ⊗d and Q
is another polynomial functor. By a similar argument as above, if r ∈ T ′ (U ) ⊗ V has the required
property for T , then its image in P ′ (U ) ⊗ V has the required property for P . Hence it suffices to prove
the lemma for T .

UNIVERSALITY OF HIGH-STRENGTH TENSORS

Now we have
T (U ⊕ V ) = T (U ) ⊕ (V ⊗ U ⊗ U ⊗ * * * ⊗ U ) ⊕ (U ⊗ V ⊗ U ⊗ * * * ⊗ U )
⊕ * * * ⊕ (U ⊗ U ⊗ U ⊗ * * * ⊗ V ) ⊕ terms of higher degree in V ,
′

so that T is a direct sum of d copies of U 7→ U ⊗d−1 . We take r in the first of these copies, as follows.
Let e1 , . . . , en be a basis of U and set
X
vα ⊗ eα1 ⊗ * * * ⊗ eαd−1
r :=
α∈[n]d−1

where the vα are a basis of a space V of dimension nd−1 . For every β ∈ [n]d−1 and i ∈ [n], the linear
map ω that maps vβ to ei and all other vα to zero is a witness to the fact that ei ⊗ eβ1 ⊗ * * * ⊗ eβd−1
is in the image of ΩT,V,r . Hence this linear map is surjective.

Lemma 2.2.3. Assume that K is algebraically closed of characteristic zero. Let P, Q be polynomial
functors. Assume that P is irreducible of degree d, Q has degree < d and let α : Q → P be a
polynomial transformation, then there is a uniform bound on the strength of elements of im(αV ) that
is independent of V .
Proof. Let R be the sum of the components of Q of strictly positive degree. Any element in im(αV )
is also in im(βV ) for a polynomial transformation βV : R → P obtained from α by a suitable specialisation. Write R = R(1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ R(k) , where the R(i) are Schur functors of degrees 0 < di < d. The
polynomial transformation β factors uniquely as the polynomial transformation
δ : R(1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ R(k) → F :=

and a linear polynomial transformation γ : F → P . As γ is linear, we see that str(γV (v)) ≤ str(v)
for all V ∈ Vec and v ∈ F (V ). So it suffices to prove that the elements of the subset im(δ), which
depends only on Q and d, have bounded strength. We have

Proof of Theorem 1.5.2 (Main Theorem I). Let X be a subset of a pure polynomial functor P over
an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero. For each V ∈ Vec define Y (V ) := X(V ). If
Y is a proper closed subset of P , then by [6, Theorem
S 4.2.5] there exist finitely many polynomial
transformations αi : Qi → P with Qi ⋖ P and Y (V ) ⊆ i im(αi,V ) for all V ∈ Vec. Since X ⊆ Y , we
are done. Otherwise, if Y (V ) = P (V ) for all V , then Theorem 2.2.1 implies that also X(V ) = P (V )
for all V . The last statement follows from the previous lemma.

Proof of Corollary 1.5.4. Let X be the subset of P constisting of all elements f ∈ P (V ) such that
Hom(V, U ) → P (U )
φ 7→ P (φ)f
is not surjective. By Main Theorem I, it suffices to prove that X 6= P . As before, we claim that in
fact X(V ) 6= P (V ) already when dim V ≥ deg(P ) * dim P (U ).
First suppose that P is irreducible. Then P is a Schur functor. Take V0 = K d and l = dim P (U ).
Then it is known that Hom(V0 , U ) * P (V0 ) spans P (U ). Let P (φ1 )p1 , . . . , P (φl )pl be a basis of P (U ),
let ιi : V0 → V0⊕l and πi : V0l → V0 be the inclusion and projection maps and take
p = P (ιi )p1 + . . . + P (ιl )pl ∈ P (V0⊕l ).

12

ARTHUR BIK, ALESSANDRO DANELON, JAN DRAISMA, AND ROB EGGERMONT

Then P (φi ◦ πi )(p) = P (φi )pi . Hence
Hom(V0⊕l , U ) → P (U )
φ 7→ P (φ)p
is surjective.
Next, suppose that P = Q ⊕ R and that there exist f ∈ Q(V ) and g ∈ R(W ) such that
Hom(V, U ) → Q(U )

and

Hom(W, U ) → R(U )

φ 7→ Q(φ)f

φ 7→ R(φ)g

are surjective. By induction, we can assume such f, g exist when dim V ≥ deg(P ) * dim Q(U ) and
dim W ≥ deg(P ) * dim R(U ). Now, we see that
Hom(V ⊕ W, U ) → P (U )
φ 7→ P (φ)(P (ι1 )(f ) + P (ι2 )(g))
is surjective. This proves the first part of the corollary. For the second statement, we note that when
P is irreducible the elements of im(αi ) have bounded strength. As the bound depends only on X and
S
X only depends on dim U , we see that f 6∈ ki=1 im(αi ) for all f with strength greater than some
function of dim U only.

3. Proof of Main Theorem II
3.1. Construction of the minimal class. Let P be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree
d > 0 over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero. Decompose
P = P (1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ P (l)
into Schur functors. For each U ∈ Vec of dimension ≥ d the GL(U )-module P (i) (U ) is irreducible
(and in particular nonzero). Let V ∈ Vec be a vector space of dimension d. Let V (1,i) be a copy of V
for each i = 1, . . . , l and choose any nonzero q (1,i) ∈ P (i) (V (1,i) ). We write
q (1) := q (1,1) + . . . + q (1,l) ∈ P (1) (V (1,1) ) ⊕ * * * ⊕ P (l) (V (1,l) ) ⊆ P (W (1) )
where W (1) = V (1,1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ V (1,l) . We take independent copies W (j) = V (j,1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ V (j,l) of W (1)
and copies q (j) = q (j,1) + . . . + q (j,l) ∈ P (W (j) ) of q1 and set
q := q (1) + q (2) + . . . ∈ P∞
where we concatenate copies of a basis in the ld-dimensional space W (1) to identify W (1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ W (k)
with K kld .

S d (V (1,1) ) and q (1,2) := xd+1 ∧ * * * ∧ x2d ∈
V (1,1) and V (1,2) , respectively. We then have
q = (xd1 + xd+1 ∧ * * * ∧ x2d ) + (xd2d+1 + x3d+1 ∧ * * * ∧ x4d ) + . . .

We will prove, first, that any q constructed in this manner has a dense GL∞ -orbit in P∞ , and
second, that q  p for all p ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit.
3.2. Density of the orbit of q.
Proposition 3.2.1. The GL∞ -orbit of q is dense in P∞ .
Proof. It suffices to prove that for each U ∈ Vec and each p ∈ P (U ) there exists a k ≥ 1 and a linear
map φ : W (1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ W (k) → U such that P (φ)(q (1) + . . . + q (k) ) = p. Furthermore, we may assume
that U has dimension at least d. Fix a linear injection ι : V → U . Now q̃ (i) := P (ι)(q (j,i) ) is a nonzero
vector in the GL(U )-module P (i) (U ), which is is irreducible. Hence the component p(i) of p in P (i) (U )
can be written as
p(i) = P (g (1,i) )q̃ (i) + . . . + P (g (ki ,i) )q̃ (i)

for suitable elements g (1,i) , . . . , g (ki ,i) ∈ End(U ). Do this for all i = 1, . . . , l. By taking the maximum
of the numbers ki (and setting the irrelevant g (j,i) equal to zero) we may assume that the ki are
all equal to a fixed number k; this is the k that we needed. Now we may define φ by declaring its
restriction on V (j,i) to be equal to g (j,i) ◦ ι. We then have

3.3. Minimality of the class of q.
Proposition 3.3.1. We have q  p for every p ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit.
Proof. Let p ∈ P∞ be a tensor with a dense GL∞ -orbit and write p = (p0 , p1 , p2 , . . .) with pi ∈ P (K i ).
Take m0 = n0 = 0. There exists a linear map φ0 : K m0 → K n0 such that P (φ0 )pm0 = qn0 = 0,
namely the zero map. Write ni = n0 + ild. Our goal is to contruct, for each integer i ≥ 1, an integer
mi ≥ mi−1 and a linear map ψi : K [mi ]−[mi−1 ] → W (i) such that the linear map φi : K mi → K ni

commute satisfies P (φi )pmi = qni = q (1) + . . . + q (i) .
Let i ≥ 1 be an integer. As observed in §2.1, we can write
P (K mi−1 ⊕ V ) = P (K mi−1 ) ⊕ R1 (V ) ⊕ * * * ⊕ Rd−1 (V ) ⊕ P (V )
where Rj = ShK mi−1 (P )j is a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree j. Writing K N as K mi−1 ⊕
K N−[mi−1 ] , we obtain a corresponding decomposition
p = pmi−1 + r1 + . . . + rd−1 + p′
where rj ∈ Rj,∞−mi−1 and p′ ∈ P∞−mi−1 and we claim that p′ has a dense GL∞−mi−1 -orbit; here we
use the notation from Remark 1.6.7.
The polynomial bifunctor (U, V ) 7→ P (U ⊕ V ) is a direct sum of bifunctors of the form (U, V ) 7→
Q(U ) ⊗ R(V ) where Q, R are Schur functors. It follows that Rj (V ) is the direct sum of spaces
Q(K mi−1 ) ⊗ R(V ) where Q, R are Schur functors of degrees d − j, j, respectively. Hence the elements r1 , . . . , rd−1 have finite strength. Also note that pmi−1 ∈ P (K mi−1 ) has finite strength. So by
Corollary 1.6.8, we see that the GL∞−mi−1 -orbit of p′ must be dense.
Ld−1
The tuple (r1 , . . . , rd−1 ) ∈
j=1 Rj,∞−mi−1 may not have a dense GL∞−mi−1 -orbit. However,
there exists a polynomial functor R less than or equal to R1 ⊕ * * * ⊕ Rd−1 with R({0}) = {0}, an
r ∈ R∞−mi−1 and a polynomial transformation
α = (α1 , . . . , αd−1 ) : R → R1 ⊕ * * * ⊕ Rd−1
such that r has a dense GL∞−mi−1 -orbit and α(r) = (r1 , . . . , rd−1 ). Since P is homogeneous of degree
d > deg(R), the pair (r, p′ ) has a dense orbit in R∞−mi−1 ⊕ P∞−mi−1 by [6, Lemma 4.5.3]. Hence, by
Corollary 1.6.3, there exists an mi ≥ mi−1 + ld and a linear map ψi : K [mi ]−[mi−1 ] → W (i) such that
R(ψi )r[mi ]−[mi−1 ] = 0 and P (ψi )p′[mi ]−[mi−1 ] = q (i) .
Since polynomial transformations between polynomial functors with zero constant term map zero
to zero, the first equality implies that, for all j = 1, . . . , d − 1,
Rj (ψi )rj,[mi ]−[mi−1 ] = Rj (ψi )αj (r[mi ]−[mi−1 ] ) = αj (R(ψi )r[mi ]−[mi−1 ] ) = αj (0) = 0.
Thus, informally, applying the map ψi makes p′ specialise to the required q (i) , while the terms
r1 , . . . , rd−1 are specialised to zero.

Remark 3.3.2. Note that the element e ∈ E constructed above has only finitely many nonzero entries
in each row and in each column!
♦
Remark 3.3.3. Fix an integer k ≥ 0. Then we have the following strengthening of the previous
1 ⊕k
theorem: we have (x1 , . . . , xk , q)  (l1 , . . . , lk , p) for every (l1 , . . . , lk , p) ∈ (S∞
) ⊕ P∞ with a dense
GL∞ -orbit. Here q is defined as before in variables distinct from x1 , . . . , xk . To see this, note that a
1 ⊕k
1
tensor in (S∞
) ⊕ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit is of the form (l1 , . . . , lk , p) where l1 , . . . , lk ∈ S∞
are linearly independent and p ∈ P∞ has a dense GL∞ -orbit. By acting with an invertible element of
E as in Example 1.8.2, we may assume that li = xi . Take n0 = k. Similar to induction step in the
proof of the previous theorem, there exists an integer m0 ≥ k and a linear map ψ : K [m0 ]−[k] → K n0
such that the linear map φ0 = idk + ψ : K k ⊕ K [m0 ]−[k] → K n0 satisfies P (φ0 )pm0 = qn0 = 0. We now
proceed as in the proof of the theorem with these m0 , n0 , φ0 to find the result.

GL∞ -orbit follows directly from Propositions 3.2.1 and 3.3.1.

3.4. Maximal tensors. Next, we construct maximal elements with respect to  of P∞ for any
pure polynomial functor P . We start with n-way tensors, then do Schur functors and finally general
polynomial functors. Let d ≥ 1 be an integer and let T d be the polynomial functor sending V 7→ V ⊗d .

Lemma 3.4.1. There exists a tensor rd ∈ T∞
such that p  rd for all p ∈ T∞

satisfies p  r1 for all p ∈ T∞

suppose that d ≥ 2 and that rd−1 = rd−1 (x1 , x2 , . . .) ∈ T∞ satisfies p  rd−1 for all p ∈ T∞ . We

For j ∈ {1, . . . , d}, we define the map − ⊗j − : T∞

as the inverse limit of the bilinear

maps − ⊗j − : V × V

such that vj ⊗j (v1 ⊗ * * * ⊗ vj−1 ⊗ vj+1 ⊗ * * * ⊗ vd ) = v1 ⊗ * * * ⊗ vd
for all finite-dimensional vector space V and all vectors v1 , . . . , vd ∈ V . Now, we take

rd :=

d−1
with p1 , p2 , . . . ∈ T∞
and by assumption we can specialize rd−1 to pi using an element of E for all i.
Combined, this yields a specialization of rd to p. Note here that xι(i,j,1) 7→ xi and xι(i,j,k) 7→ li,j,k for
k > 1 in such a way that xl occurs, when ranging over k, in only finitely many li,j,k when i ≤ l and
xl does not occur in li,j,k when i > l. This means that the specialization of rd to p indeed goes via
d
an element of E. So for all d ≥ 1, the space T∞
has a maximal element with respect to .


Lemma 3.4.2. Let P be a Schur functor of degree d ≥ 1. Then there exists a tensor r ∈ P∞ such
that p  r for all p ∈ P∞ .
d
Proof. The space P∞ is a direct summand of T∞
. Let r be the component in P∞ of rd from the
previous lemma. Then p  r for all p ∈ P∞ .


Proof of Theorem 1.9.1, the existence of r. Let P be a polynomial functor and write
P = P (1) ⊕ * * * ⊕ P (k)
(i)

as a direct sum of Schur functors. For each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, let ri = ri (x1 , x2 , . . .) ∈ P∞ be a tensor
(i)
such that pi  ri for all pi ∈ P∞ and take r = (r1 (x1 , xk+1 , . . .), . . . , rk (xk , x2k , . . .)) ∈ P∞ . Then
p  r for all p ∈ P∞ .

4. Further examples
In this section we give more examples: we prove that tensors in P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit for a
single equivalence class when P has degree ≤ 2, we compare candidates for minimal tensors in a direct
sum of S d 's of distinct degrees and we construct maximal elements in P∞ for all P with P ({0}) = {0}.
4.1. Polynomial functors of degree ≤ 2.

Example 4.1.1. Take P = S 1 ⊕ S 1 . Then a pair (v, w) ∈ S∞
⊕ S∞
has one of the following forms:
1
(1) the pair (v, w) with v, w ∈ S∞
linearly independent vectors;
1
(2) the pair (λu, μu) with u ∈ S∞ nonzero and [λ : μ] ∈ P1 ; or
(3) the pair (0, 0).

In the first case, the pair (v, w) has a dense GL∞ -orbit and is equivalent to (x1 , x2 ). When μv−λw = 0
for some λ, μ ∈ K, then this also holds for all specialisations of (v, w). So the poset of equivalence
classes is given by:
(x1 , x2 )
P1
(0, 0)
1
where a point [λ : μ] ∈ P1 corresponds to the class of (λu, μu) with u ∈ S∞
nonzero and all points in
1
P are incomparable.

Example 4.1.2. Take P = S 2 . By Proposition 3.3.1 each infinite quadric
X
p=
aij xi xj
1≤i≤j

of infinite rank specialises to the quadric q = x1 x2 + x3 x4 + . . . via a suitable linear change of
coordinates. Here each variable is only allowed to occur in only finitely many of the linear forms that
x1 , x2 , . . . are substituted by. Conversely, it is not difficult to see that q specialises to p as well by

We conclude that the infinite-rank quadrics form a single equivalence class under ≃ and that the rank
function is an isomorphism from the poset of equivalence classes to the well-ordered set {0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞}.

Example 4.1.3. Take P = 2 . By Proposition 3.3.1 each infinite alternating tensor
X
p=
aij xi ∧ xj
1≤i<j

of infinite rank specialises to q = x1 ∧ x2 + x3 ∧ x4 + . . .. And, q specialises to p as well by applying
the following element of E:


As before, we conclude that the infinite-rank alternating tensors form a single ≃-equivalence class and
that the rank function is an isomorphism from the poset of equivalence classes to the well-ordered set
{0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞}.

V
Example 4.1.4. Take P = (S 1 )⊕a ⊕ (S 2 )⊕b ⊕ ( 2 )⊕c for integers a, b, c ≥ 0. By Remark 3.3.3, any
tuple in P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit specialises to the tuple
(x1 , . . . , xa , y1 y2 + y2b+1 y2b+2 + . . . , . . . , y2b−1 y2b + y4b−1 y4b + . . . ,
z1 ∧ z2 + z2c+1 ∧ z2c+2 + . . . , . . . , z2c−1 ∧ z2c + z4c−1 ∧ z4c + . . .)
where y2ib+j = xa+2ib+2ic+j for i ≥ 0 and 1 ≤ j < 2b and z2ic+j = xa+2(i+1)b+2ic+j for i ≥ 0 and
1 ≤ j < 2c. By the previous examples, each of the entries in this latter tuple independently specialises
to any tensor in the same space. So the entire tuple also specialises to any other tuple in P∞ . So the
tuple with a dense GL∞ -orbit again form a single ≃-equivalence class.
♦
4.2. Non-homogeneous polynomial functors. The proof of Proposition 3.3.1 relies on the fact
that P is homogeneous. Apart from the slight generalisation from Remark 3.3.3, we don't know if
such a result holds in a more general setting.
Question 4.2.1. Take P = S 2 ⊕ S 3 . Does there exist a tensor q ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit such
that q  p for all p ∈ P∞ with a dense GL∞ -orbit?
The next example compares different candidates for such a minimal element.
Example 4.2.2. Take P = S d1 ⊕ S d2 ⊕ * * * ⊕ S dk with 1 < d1 < d2 < * * * < dk . By [6, Lemma 4.5.3],
di
an element (f1 , * * * , fk ) ∈ P∞ has dense GL∞ -orbit if and only if fi ∈ S∞
has dense GL∞ -orbit for
all i = 1, . . . , k. In particular, the elements
q = (q (1) , . . . , q (k) ) = (xd11 + xd21 + . . . , . . . , xd1k + xd2k + . . .)
and

1
p = (p(1) , . . . , p(k) ) = (xd11 + xdk+1
+ . . . , * * * , xdkk + xd2kk + . . .)
have dense GL∞ -orbits. Clearly q  p. By Corollary 1.6.3, there exists an n ≥ 1 and linear forms
d
(j)
l1 , . . . , ln in x1 , . . . , xk such that qn (l1 , . . . , ln ) = xj j for j = 1, . . . , k. Take

lhn+i = li (xhn+1 , . . . , xhn+n )

since
q (j) = qn(j) + qn(j) (xn+1 , . . . , x2n ) + . . .
(j)

we see that q (l1 , l2 , . . .) = p . Let A be the k × n matrix corresponding to l1 , . . . , ln and take

Then P (e)q (j) = q (j) (l1 , l2 , . . .). So p  q. Hence p ≃ q.
