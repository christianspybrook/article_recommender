Abstract
The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling.
This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without
direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general
multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies
by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there
are at least n + 1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n − 1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n = 2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there
are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady
state conditions, there are at most n + 1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard
Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.

Keywords: futile cycles, bistability, signaling pathways, biomolecular networks, steady states

Introduction

A promising approach to handling the complexity of cell signaling pathways is to decompose pathways into
small motifs, and analyze the individual motifs. One particular motif that has attracted much attention in
recent years is the cycle formed by two or more inter-convertible forms of one protein. The protein, denoted
here by S0 , is ultimately converted into a product, denoted here by Sn , through a cascade of "activation"
reactions triggered or facilitated by an enzyme E; conversely, Sn is transformed back (or "deactivated")
into the original S0 , helped on by the action of a second enzyme F . See Figure 1.

Such structures, often called "futile cycles" (also called substrate cycles, enzymatic cycles, or enzymatic
inter-conversions, see [1]), serve as basic blocks in cellular signaling pathways and have pivotal impact on
the signaling dynamics. Futile cycles underlie signaling processes such as GTPase cycles [2], bacterial
two-component systems and phosphorelays [3, 4] actin treadmilling [5]), and glucose mobilization [6], as
well as metabolic control [7] and cell division and apoptosis [8] and cell-cycle checkpoint control [9]. One
very important instance is that of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ("MAPK") cascades, which regulate

1

primary cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [10–13] in eukaryotes from
yeast to humans.
MAPK cascades usually consist of three tiers of similar structures with multiple feedbacks [14–16].
Each individual level of the MAPK cascades is a futile cycle as depicted in Figure 1 with n = 2. Markevich
et al.'s paper [17] was the first to demonstrate the possibility of multistationarity at a single cascade
level, and motivated the need for analytical studies of the number of steady states. Conradi et al. studied
the existence of multistationarity in their paper [19], employing algorithms based on Feinberg's chemical
reaction network theory (CRNT). (For more details on CRNT, see [31,32].) The CRNT algorithm confirms
multistationarity in a single level of MAPK cascades, and provides a set of kinetic constants which can
give rise to multistationarity. However, the CRNT algorithm only tests for the existence of multiple steady
states, and does not provide information regarding the precise number of steady states.
In [18], Gunawardena proposed a novel approach to the study of steady states of futile cycles. His
approach, which was focused in the question of determining the proportion of maximally phosphorylated
substrate, was developed under the simplifying quasi-steady state assumption that substrate is in excess.
Nonetheless, our study of multistationarity uses in a key manner the basic formalism in [18], even for the
case when substrate is not in excess.
In Section 2, we state our basic assumptions regarding the model. The basic formalism and background
for the approach is provided in Section 3. The main focus of this paper is on Section 4, where we derive
various bounds on the number of steady states of futile cycles of size n. The first result is a the lower
bound for the number of steady states. Currently available results on lower bounds, as in [29], can only
handle the case when quasi-steady state assumptions are valid; we substantially extend these results to the
fully general case by means of a perturbation argument which allows one to get around these restricted
assumptions. Another novel feature of our results in this paper is the derivation of an upper bound
of 2n − 1, valid for all kinetic constants. Models in molecular cell biology are characterized by a high
degree of uncertainly in parameters, hence such results valid over the entire parameter space are of special
significance. However, when more information of the parameters are available, sharper upper bounds can
obtained, see Theorems 4 and 5. We finally conclude our paper in Section 5 with a conjecture of an n + 1
upper bound.
We remark that the results given here complement our work dealing with the dynamical behavior
of futile cycles. For the case n = 2, [25] showed that the model exhibits generic convergence to steady
states but no more complicated behavior, at least within restricted parameter ranges, while [27] showed a
persistence property (no species tends to be eliminated) for any possible parameter values. These papers
did not address the question of estimating the number of steady states. (An exception is the case n = 1,
for which uniqueness of steady states can be proved in several ways, and for which global convergence to
these unique equilibria holds [27].)

Model assumptions

Before presenting mathematical details, let us first discuss the basic biochemical assumptions that go into
the model. In general, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can follow either distributive or processive
mechanism. In the processive mechanism, the kinase (phosphatase) facilitates two or more phosphorylations
(dephosphorylations) before the final product is released, whereas in the distributive mechanism, the kinase
(phosphatase) facilitates at most one phosphorylation (dephosphorylation) in each molecular encounter.
In the case of n = 2, a futile cycle that follows the processive mechanism can be represented by reactions
2

as follows:
S0 + E ←→ ES0 ←→ ES1 −→ S2 + E
S2 + F ←→ F S2 ←→ F S1 −→ S0 + F ;
and the distributive mechanism can be represented by reactions:
S0 + E ←→ ES0 −→ S1 + E ←→ ES1 −→ S2 + E
S2 + F ←→ F S2 −→ S1 + F ←→ F S1 −→ S0 + F.
Biological experiments have demonstrated that both dual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in MAPK
are distributive, see [14–16]. In their paper [19], Conradi et al. showed mathematically that if either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation follows a processive mechanism, the steady state will be unique, which,
it is argued in [19], contradicts experimental observations. So, to get more interesting results, we assume
that both phosphorylations and dephosphorylations in the futile cycles follow the distributive mechanism.
Our structure of futile cycles in Figure 1 also implicitly assumes a sequential instead of a random
mechanism. By a sequential mechanism, we mean that the kinase phosphorylates the substrates in a
specific order, and the phosphatase works in the reversed order. This assumption dramatically reduces the
number of different phospho-forms and simplifies our analysis. In a special case when the kinetic constants
of each phosphorylation are the same and the kinetic constants of each dephosphorylation are the same,
the random mechanism can be easily included in the sequential case. Biologically, there are systems, for
instance the auto-phosphorylation of FGF-receptor-1, that have been experimentally shown to follow a
sequential mechanism [33].
To model the reactions, we assume mass action kinetics, which is standard in mathematical modeling
of molecular events in biology.

and similarly for Φ3n+2 and Φ3n+3 , we use the remaining equations in (2).

3n+3
, x is a positive steady state of Σ(κ, C) if and only if x ∈ Z(κ, C).
Observe that, by definition, given x ∈ R+
So, the mathematical statement of the central problem in this paper is to count the number of elements
in Z(κ, C). Our analysis will be greatly simplified by a preprocessing. Let us introduce a function

Ψj = Φj , j = n + 1, . . . , 3n + 3.
It is easy to see that
Z(κ, C) = {x | Ψ(x, κ, C) = 0},
but now the first 3n equations are:
Ψi = lcati−1 di − kcati−1 ci−1 = 0, i = 1, . . . , n,
Ψn+1+j = konj sj e − (koffj + kcatj )cj = 0, j = 0, . . . , n − 1

Although the equation Ψ = 0 represents 3n + 3 equations with 3n + 3 unknowns, next we will show that
it can be reduced to two equations with two unknowns, which have the same number of positive solutions
as Ψ = 0. Let us first define a set
κ,C
S(κ, C) = {(u, v) ∈ R+ × R+ | Gκ,C
1 (u, v) = 0, G2 (u, v) = 0},
κ,C
2
where Gκ,C
1 , G2 : R+ −→ R are given by
κ

Gκ,C
1 (u, v) = v (uφ1 (u) − φ2 (u)Etot /Ftot ) − Etot /Ftot + u,

2 (u, v) = φ0 (u)φ2 (u)v + (φ0 (u) − Stot φ2 (u) + Ftot uφ1 (u) + Ftot φ2 (u)) v − Stot .

The precise statement is as follows:
Lemma 1 There exists a mapping δ : R3n+3 −→ R2 such that, for each κ, C, the map δ restricted to
Z(κ, C) is a bijection between the sets Z(κ, C) and S(κ, C).
Proof. Let us define the mapping δ : R3n+3 −→ R2 as δ(x) = (e/f, s0 ), where
x = (s0 , . . . , sn , c0 , . . . , cn−1 , d1 , . . . , dn , e, f ).
If we can show that δ induces a bijection between Z(κ, C) and S(κ, C), we are done.
First, we claim that δ(Z(κ, C)) ⊆ S(κ, C). Pick any x ∈ Z(κ, C), we have that x satisfies (3)-(5).
Moreover, Φ3n+2 (x, κ, C) = 0 yields
e
Etot = e + es0 φκ1 ( ),
f
and thus
Etot
.
(8)
e=
1 + s0 φκ1 (e/f )
Using Φ3n+1 (x, κ, C) = 0 and Φ3n+2 (x, κ, C) = 0, we get:
Etot
e(1 + s0 φκ1 (e/f ))
,
=
Ftot
f (1 + s0 φκ2 (e/f ))
κ
which is Gκ,C
1 (e/f, s0 ) = 0 after multiplying by 1 + s0 φ2 (e/f ) and rearranging terms.

To check that Gκ,C
2 (e/f, s0 ) = 0, we start with Φ3n+3 (x, κ, C) = 0, i.e.

that is, Gκ,C
2 (e/f, s0 ) = 0. since both G1 (e/f, s0 ) and G2 (e/f, s0 ) are zero, δ(x) ∈ S(κ, C).

Next, we will show that S(κ, C) ⊆ δ(Z(κ, C)). For any y = (u, v) ∈ S(κ, C), let the coordinates of x be
defined as:

for i = 0, . . . , n − 1. It is easy to see that the vector x = (s0 , . . . , sn , c0 , . . . , cn−1 , d1 , . . . , dn , e, f ) satisfies
Φ1 (x, κ, C) = 0, . . . , Φ3n+1 (x, κ, C) = 0. If Φ3n+2 (x, κ, C) and Φ3n+3 (x, κ, C) are also zero, then x is an
element of Z(κ, C) with δ(x) = y. Given the condition that Gκ,C
i (u, v) = 0 (i = 1, 2) and u = e/f, v = s0 ,
κ,C
we have G1 (e/f, s0 ) = 0, and therefore (9) holds. Since

It remains for us to show that the map δ is one to one on Z(κ, C). Suppose that δ(x1 ) = δ(x2 ) = (u, v),
where
xi = (si0 , . . . , sin , ci0 , . . . , cin−1 , di1 , . . . , din , ei , f i ), i = 1, 2.
By the definition of δ, we know that s10 = s20 and e1 /f 1 = e2 /f 2 . Therefore, s1i = s2i for i = 0, . . . , n.
Equation (8) gives
Etot
= e2 .
e1 =
1 + vφκ1 (u)
Thus, f 1 = f 2 , and c1i = c2i , d1i+1 = d2i+1 for i = 0, . . . , n − 1 because of (3)-(5). Therefore, x1 = x2 , and δ
is one to one.
The above lemma ensures that the two sets Z(κ, C) and S(κ, C) have the same number of elements. From
κ,C
now on, we will focus on S(κ, C), the set of positive solutions of equations Gκ,C

Lower bound on the number of positive steady states

One approach to solving (10)-(11) is to view Gκ,C
2 (u, v) as a quadratic polynomial in v. Since G2 (u, 0) < 0,
equation (11) has a unique positive root, namely
p

(14)
So, any (u, v) ∈ S(κ, C) should satisfy (12) and (14). On the other hand, any positive solution u of (14)
(notice that φκ0 (u) > 0) and v given by (12) (always positive) provide a positive a solution of (10)-(11),
that is, (u, v) is an element in S(κ, C). Therefore, the number of positive solutions of (10)-(11) is the same
as the number of positive solutions of (12) and (14). But v is uniquely determined by u in (12), which
further simplifies the problem to one equation (14) with one unknown u. Based on this observation, we
have:
6n−6
such that the following
Theorem 1 For each positive numbers Stot , γ, there exist ε0 > 0 and κ ∈ R+
property holds. Pick any Etot , Ftot such that

Ftot = Etot /γ < ε0 Stot /γ,

(15)

then the system Σ(κ, C) with C = (Etot , Ftot , Stot ) has at least n + 1 (n) positive steady states when n is
even (odd).

Proof. For each κ, γ, Stot , let us define two functions R+ × R+ −→ R as follows:
H̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) = H κ,(εStot ,εStot /γ,Stot ) (u)

2φκ2 (u)
− γφκ0 (u) + uφκ0 (u).
By Lemma 1 and the argument before this theorem, it is enough to show that there exist ε0 > 0 and κ ∈
6n−6
such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε0 ), the equation F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) = 0 has at least n + 1 (n) positive solutions
R+
when n is even (odd). (Then, given Stot , γ, Etot , and Ftot satisfying (15), we let ε = Etot /Stot < ε0 ,
and apply the result.)
A straightforward computation shows that when ε = 0,
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = Stot (uφκ1 (u) − γφκ2 (u)) − γφκ0 (u) + uφκ0 (u)

where the λi 's and KMi 's are defined as in (6), and βi = kcati /lcati . The polynomial F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
is of degree n + 1, so there are at most n + 1 positive roots. Notice that u = 0 is not a root because
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = −γ < 0, which also implies that when n is odd, there can not be n + 1 positive roots.
Now fix any Stot and γ. We will construct a vector κ such that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) has n + 1 distinct positive
roots when n is even.
Let us pick any n + 1 positive real numbers u1 < * * * < un+1 , such that their product is γ, and assume

λ0 , . . . , λn−1 , KM0 , . . . , KMn−1 , β0 , . . . , βn−1 ,
we will find a vector

lon0 , . . . , lonn−1 , loff0 , . . . , loffn−1 , lcat0 , . . . , lcatn−1 ) ∈ R+

such that βi = kcati /lcati , i = 0, . . . , n − 1, and (6) holds. This vector κ will guarantee that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
has n + 1 positive distinct roots. When n is odd, a similar construction will give a vector κ such that
F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) has n positive roots and one negative root.
One construction of κ (given λi , KMi , βi , i = 0, . . . , n − 1) is as follows. For each i = 0, . . . , n − 1, we
start by defining:
λi KMi
,
LM i =
βi
consistently with the definitions in (6). Then, we take
koni = 1, loni = 1,
and
koffi = αi KMi , kcati = (1 − αi )KMi , lcati =

1 − αi
KMi , loffi = LMi − lcati ,
βi

where αi ∈ (0, 1) is chosen such that
loffi = LMi −

1 − αi
KMi > 0.
βi

This κ satisfies βi = kcati /lcati , i = 0, . . . , n − 1, and (6).
In order to apply the Implicit Function Theorem, we now view the functions defined by formulas in
(16) and (17) as defined also for ε ≤ 0, i.e. as functions R × R+ −→ R. It is easy to see that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u)
is C 1 on R × R+ because the polynomial under the square root sign in F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) is never zero. On
κ,γ,S
tot (0, u ) 6= 0. By the
the other hand, since F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) is a polynomial in u with distinct roots, ∂ F̃

Implicit Function Theorem, for each i = 1, . . . , n + 1, there exist open intervals Ei containing 0, and open
intervals Ui containing ui , and a differentiable function
αi : Ei → Ui
such that αi (0) = ui , F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, αi (ε)) = 0 for all ε ∈ Ei , and the images αi (Ei )'s are non-overlapping. If
we take
n+1
\
\
(0, +∞),
Ei
(0, ε0 ) :=
1

then for any ε ∈ (0, ε0 ), we have {αi (ε)} as n + 1 distinct positive roots of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u). The case when
n is odd can be proved similarly.
The above theorem shows that when Etot /Ftot is sufficiently small, it is always possible for the futile
cycle to have n + 1 (n) steady states when n is even (odd), by choosing appropriate kinetic constants κ.
10

We should notice that for arbitrary κ, the derivative of F̃ at each positive root may become zero, which
breaks down the perturbation argument. Here is an example to show that more conditions are needed:
with
n = 2, λ0 = 1, λ1 = 3, γ = 6, β0 = β1 = 1/12, K0 = 1/8, K1 = 1/2, Stot = 5,
we have that

F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = 3u3 − 12u2 + 15u − 6 = 3(u − 1)2 (u − 2)

has a double root at u = 1. In this case, even for ε = 0.01, there is only one positive root of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u),
see Figure 2.

states of system Σ(κ, C) is greater or equal to the number of (positive) roots of F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u).

Proof. Suppose that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u) has m roots: ū1 , . . . , ūm . Applying Lemma 2, we have
∂ F̃ κ,γ,Stot
(0, ūk ) 6= 0, k = 1, . . . , m.

By the perturbation arguments as in Theorem 1, we have that there exists ε1 > 0 such that F̃ κ,γ,Stot (ε, u)
has at least m roots for all 0 < ε < ε1 .
The above result depends heavily on a perturbation argument, which only works when Etot /Ftot is
sufficiently small. In the next section, we will give an upper bound of the number of steady states with no
restrictions on Etot /Ftot , and independent of κ and C.

4.2

Upper bound on the number of steady states

Theorem 3 For each κ, C, the system Σ(κ, C) has at most 2n − 1 positive steady states.
Proof. An alternative approach to solving (10)-(11) is to first eliminate v from (10) instead of from (11),
i.e.
Etot /Ftot − u
A(u)
v=

uφ1 (u) − (Etot /Ftot )φ2 (u)

when uφκ1 (u) − (Etot /Ftot )φκ2 (u) 6= 0. Then, we substitute (22) into (11), and multiply by (uφκ1 (u) −
(Etot /Ftot )φκ2 (u))2 to get:

Therefore, if uφκ1 (u) − (Etot /Ftot )φκ2 (u) 6= 0, the number of positive solutions of (10)-(11) is no greater
than the number of positive roots of P κ,C (u).
In the special case when uφκ1 (u) − (Etot /Ftot )φκ2 (u) = 0, by (10), we must have u = Etot /Ftot , and
thus φκ1 (Etot /Ftot ) = φκ2 (Etot /Ftot ). Substituting into (11), we get a unique v defined as in (12) with
u = Etot /Ftot . But notice that in this case u = Etot /Ftot is also a root of P κ,C (u), so also in this case
the number of positive solutions to (10)-(11) is no greater than the number of positive roots of P κ,C (u).
It is easy to see that P κ,C (u) is divisible by u. Consider the polynomial Qκ,C (u) := P κ,C (u)/u of
degree 2n + 1. We will first show that Qκ,C (u) has no more than 2n positive roots, then we will prove by
contradiction that 2n distinct positive roots can not be achieved.
It is easy to see that the coefficient of u2n+1 is
(λ0 * * * λn−1 )2
> 0,
LMn−1
and the constant term is

Etot
> 0.
Ftot KM0

So the polynomial Qκ,C (u) has at least one negative root, and thus has no more than 2n positive roots.
Suppose that S(κ, C) has cardinality 2n, then Qκ,C (u) must have 2n distinct positive roots, and each of
them has multiplicity one. Let us denote the roots as u1 , . . . , u2n in ascending order. We claim that none
of them equals Etot /Ftot . If so, we would have φκ1 (Etot /Ftot ) = φκ2 (Etot /Ftot ), and Etot /Ftot would
be a double root of Qκ,C (u), contradiction.
12

Since Qκ,C (0) > 0, Qκ,C (u) is positive on intervals
I0 = (0, u1 ), I1 = (u2 , u3 ), . . . , In−1 = (u2n−2 , u2n−1 ), In = (u2n , ∞),
and negative on intervals
J1 = (u1 , u2 ), . . . , Jn = (u2n−1 , u2n ).
As remarked earlier, φκ1 (Etot /Ftot ) 6= φκ2 (Etot /Ftot ), the polynomial Qκ,C (u) evaluated at Etot /Ftot
is negative, and therefore, Etot /Ftot belongs to one of the J intervals, say Js = (u2s−1 , u2s ), for some
s ∈ {1, . . . , n} .
On the other hand, the denominator of v in (22), denoted as B(u), is a polynomial of degree n and
divisible by u. If B(u) has no positive root, then it does not change sign on the positive axis of u. But v
changes sign when u passes Etot /Ftot , thus v2s−1 and v2s have opposite signs, and one of (u2s−1 , v2s−1 )
and (u2s , v2s ) is not a solution to (10)-(11), which contradicts the fact that both are in S(κ, C).
Otherwise, there exists a positive root ū of B(u) such that there is no other positive root of B(u)
between ū and Etot /Ftot . Plugging ū into Qκ,C (u), we see that Qκ,C (ū) is always positive, therefore, ū
belongs to one of the I intervals, say It = (u2t , u2t+1 ) for some t ∈ {0, . . . , n}. There are two cases:
1. Etot /Ftot < ū. We have

u2s−1 < Etot /Ftot < u2t < ū.

Notice that v changes sign when u passes Etot /Ftot , so the corresponding v2s−1 and v2t have different
signs, and either (u2s−1 , v2s−1 ) ∈
/ S(κ, C) or (u2t , v2t ) ∈
/ S(κ, C), contradiction.
2. Etot /Ftot > ū. We have

ū < u2t+1 < Etot /Ftot < u2s .

Since v changes sign when u passes Etot /Ftot , so the corresponding v2t+1 and v2s have different
signs, and either (u2t+1 , v2t+1 ) ∈
/ S(κ, C) or (u2s , v2s ) ∈
/ S(κ, C), contradiction.
Therefore, Σ(κ, C) has at most 2n − 1 steady states.

4.3

Fine-tuned upper bounds

In the previous section, we have seen that any (u, v) ∈ S(κ, C), u 6= Etot /Ftot must satisfy (22)-(23), but
not all solutions of (22)-(23) are elements in S(κ, C). Suppose that (u, v) is a solution of (22)-(23), it is
in S(κ, C) if and only if u, v > 0. In some special cases, for example, when the enzyme is in excess, or the
substrate is in excess, we could count the number of solutions of (22)-(23) which are not in S(κ, C) to get
a better upper bound.
The following is a standard result on continuity of roots; see for instance Lemma A.4.1 in [30]:
Lemma 3 Let g(z) = z n + a1 z n−1 + * * * + an be a polynomial of degree n and complex coefficients having
distinct roots

h(z) = z n + b1 z n−1 + * * * + bn , |ai − bi | < ε for i = 1, . . . , n,
then h has precisely ni roots in Bδ (λi ) for each i = 1, . . . , q.

such that φκ1 (γ) 6= φκ2 (γ), and each Stot > 0, there exists
Theorem 4 For each γ > 0 and κ ∈ R+
ε2 > 0 such that for all positive numbers Etot , Ftot satisfying Ftot = Etot /γ < ε2 Stot /γ, the system
Σ(κ, C) has at most n + 1 positive steady states.

Proof. Let us define a function R+ × C −→ C as follows:
Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) = Qκ,(εStot ,εStot /γ,Stot ) (u),
and a set B κ,γ,Stot (ε) consisting of the roots of Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) which are not positive or the corresponding
v's determined by u's as in (22) are not positive, Since Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) is a polynomial of degree 2n + 1,
if we can show that there exists ε2 > 0 such that for any ε ∈ (0, ε2 ), Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) has at least n roots
counting multiplicities that are in B κ,γ,Stot (ε), then we are done.
In order to apply Lemma 3, we regard the function Q̃κ,γ,Stot as defined on R × C. At ε = 0:
Q̃κ,γ,Stot (0, u) = [φκ0 φκ2 (γ − u)2 + (φκ0 − Stot φκ2 )(uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )2 ]/u
= [φκ0 φκ2 (γ − u)2 + φκ0 (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot φκ2 (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(γ − u) − Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 )2 ]/u
= [φκ0 (γ − u)u(φκ1 − φκ2 ) + Stot u(uφκ1 − γφκ2 )(φκ2 − φκ1 )]/u
= (φκ2 − φκ1 )(uφκ0 + Stot (uφκ1 − γφκ2 ) − γφκ0 )
= (φκ2 − φκ1 )F̃ κ,γ,Stot (0, u)
Let us denote the distinct roots of Q̃κ,γ,Stot (0, u)/u as
u1 , . . . , uq ,
with multiplicities
n1 + * * * + nq = 2n + 1,
and the roots of φκ1 − φκ2 as
u1 , . . . , up , p ≤ q,
with multiplicities
m1 + * * * + mp = n, ni ≥ mi , for i = 1, . . . , p.
For each i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is real and positive, then there are two cases (ui 6= γ as φκ1 (γ) 6= φκ2 (γ)):
1. ui > γ. We have
2. ui < γ. We have

ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) > γ(φκ1 (ui ) − φκ2 (ui )) = 0.
ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) < γ(φκ1 (ui ) − φκ2 (ui )) = 0.

14

In both cases, ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ) and γ − ui have opposite signs, i.e.
(ui φκ1 (ui ) − γφκ2 (ui ))(γ − ui ) < 0.
Let us pick δ > 0 small enough such that the following conditions hold:
1. For all i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is not real, then Bδ (ui ) has no intersection with the real axis.
2. For all i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is real and positive, the following inequality holds for any real u ∈ Bδ (ui ):
(uφκ1 (u) − γφκ2 (u))(γ − u) < 0.

3. For all i = 1, . . . , p, if ui is real and negative, then Bδ (ui ) has no intersection with the imaginary
axis.

4. Bδ (uj ) Bδ (uk ) = ∅ for all j 6= k = 1, . . . , q.

By Lemma 3, there exists ε3 > 0 such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε3 ), the polynomial Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u)/u has exactly

in (22) will be an element in S. If so, we are done, since there are p1 ni ≥ p1 mi = n such roots, of
Q̃κ,γ,Stot (ε, u) which are in B κ,γ,Stot (ε).
For each i = 1, . . . , p, there are two cases:
1. ui is not real. Then condition 1 guarantees that uki (ε) is not real for each k = 1, . . . , ni , and thus is
in B κ,γ,Stot (ε).
2. ui is real and positive. Pick any root uki (ε) ∈ Bδ (ui ), k = 1, . . . , ni , the corresponding vik (ε) equals
γ − uki (ε)

uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε))

followed from (24). So (uki (ε), vik (ε)) ∈
3. ui is real and negative. By condition 1 and 3, uki (ε) is not positive for all k = 1, . . . , ni .

The next theorem considers the case when enzyme is in excess:

Proof. For each γ > 0, κ ∈ R+
R+ × C −→ C as follows:
Q̄κ,γ,Etot (ε, u) = Qκ,(Etot ,Etot /γ,εEtot ) (u).

15

Let us define the set C κ,γ,Etot (ε) as the set of roots of Q̄κ,γ,Etot (ε, u) which are not positive or the
corresponding v's determined by u's as in (22) are not positive. If we can show that there exists ε3 > 0
such that for any ε ∈ (0, ε3 ) there is at most one positive root of Q̄κ,γ,Etot (ε, u) that is not in C κ,γ,Etot (ε),
we are done.

Let us pick δ > 0 small enough such that the following conditions hold for all i = 2, . . . , q:

2. If ui is real and positive, then for any real u ∈ Bδ (ui ), the following inequality holds:

nj roots in each Bδ (uj ), j = 1, . . . , q, denoted by ukj (ε), k = 1, . . . , nj .
We pick one such ε, and if we can show that all of the roots in Bδ (ui ), i = 2, . . . , q are in C κ,γ,Etot (ε),
then we are done, since the only roots that may not be in C κ,γ,Etot (ε) are the roots in Bδ (u1 ), and there
is one root in Bδ (u1 ).
For each i = 2, . . . , p, there are three cases:
16

1. ui is not real. Then condition 1 guarantees that uki (ε) is not real for all k = 1, . . . , ni .
2. ui is real and positive. Pick any root uki (ε), k = 1, . . . , ni , the corresponding vik (ε) equals

uki (ε)φκ1 (uki (ε)) − γφκ2 (uki (ε))
So, uki (ε) is in C κ,γ,Etot (ε).
3. ui is real and negative. By conditions 1 and 3, uki (ε) is not positive for all k = 1, . . . , ni .

Conclusions and discussions

Here we have set up a mathematical model for multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of size
n, and studied the number of positive steady states based on this model. We reformulated the question
of number of positive steady states to question of the number of positive roots of certain polynomials,
through which we also applied perturbation techniques. Our theoretical results depend on the assumption
of mass action kinetics and distributive sequential mechanism, which are customary in the study of multisite
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
An upper bound of 2n − 1 steady states is obtained for arbitrary parameter combinations. Biologically,
when the substrate concentration greatly exceeds that of the enzyme, there are at most n + 1 (n) steady
states if n is even (odd). And this upper bound can be achieved under proper kinetic conditions, see
Theorem 1 for the construction. On the other extreme, when the enzyme is in excess, there is a unique
steady state.
As a special case of n = 2, which can be applied to a single level of MAPK cascades. Our results
guarantees that there are no more than three steady states, consistent with numerical simulations in [17].
We notice that there is an apparent gap between the upper bound 2n − 1 and the upper bound of n + 1
(n) if n is even (odd) when the substrate is in excess. If we think the ratio Etot /Ftot as a parameter ε,
then when ε ≪ 1, there are at most n + 1 (n) steady states when n is even (odd), which coincides with the
largest possible lower bound. When ε ≫ 1, there is a unique steady state. If the number of steady states
changes "continuously" with respect to ε, then we do not expect the number of steady states to exceed
n + 1 (n) if n is even (odd). So a natural conjecture would be that the number of steady states never
exceed n + 1 under any conditions.
