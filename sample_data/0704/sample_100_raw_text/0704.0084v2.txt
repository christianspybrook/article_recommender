We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where
the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas
dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions
that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where
the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density
blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time tc is
approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law ∼ (tc − t)−2 . The velocity gradient blows
up as ∼ − (tc − t)−1 while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than
a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the
singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform
in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the
density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an "ordinary" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect
to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically.
Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

INTRODUCTION

Structure formation in many-body systems is one of
central problems of non-equilibrium physics. A most
spectacular phenomena of structure formation is clustering of matter. Here an initially structureless, almost homogeneous distribution of particles of matter
self-assembles into clusters. Such an evolution cannot
proceed indefinitely in a gas where interactions between
the particles are (i) short-range and (ii) Hamiltonian.
There are two important classes of gases where one of
these two properties is violated, and clustering can occur. In the first one long-range forces, such as gravity,
are present. Clustering provides here a natural mechanism of star formation1 and of the large-scale structure of the Universe2 . The second class of systems are
dissipative systems where interactions between the particles, at the level of an effective description, are nonHamiltonian. One well-known example is optically thin
gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation, and
dense condensations develop3,4,5 . In this paper we consider a more basic non-Hamiltonian many-body system:
a gas of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles, or
granular gas. Here particles lose energy to their internal
degrees of freedom.
The granular gas is the low-density limit of granular
flows6,7 . In its simplest version, the granular gas model
deals with a dilute assembly of identical hard spheres
(with diameter σ and unit mass) who lose energy at instantaneous binary collisions in such a way that the normal component of the relative velocity of particles is re-

duced by a constant factor 0 ≤ r < 1 (the coefficient of
normal restitution) upon each collision. Granular gases
exhibit a plethora of structure forming instabilities, including the clustering instability of a freely cooling homogeneous inelastic gas8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 . This
instability brings about the generation of a macroscopic
flow and formation of dense clusters of particles.
The natural language for a theoretical description of
macroscopic flows of a granular gas is the Navier-Stokes
granular hydrodynamics6,7 . Although the criteria of its
validity are quite restrictive, see below, granular hydrodynamics is instrumental for theoretical investigations,
and often prediction, of a host of collective effects in
granular flows. Recently, applications of granular hydrodynamics have been extended to non-stationary flows
of granular gases17,20,21,22 . The non-stationary settings
provide sharp tests to continuum models of granular flows
and help evaluate their domains of validity. This is especially true when the time-dependent solutions of the
continuum equations develop finite-time singularities23 ,
such as the recently predicted density blowup in freely
cooling granular gases: at zero gravity17,22 , and at finite
gravity21.
We will assume throughout this paper nearly elastic
particle collisions, a very small gas density (that we denote by ρ), and a very small Knudsen number:
1−r ≪ 1,

ρσ d ≪ 1 ,

and

lf ree /L ≪ 1 .

(1)

Here d > 1 is the dimension of space, lf ree is the
mean free path of the particles, and L is the characteristic length scale of the hydrodynamic fields. Under

2
these assumptions the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leading-order theory for
granular gases6,7 . Previous works9,10 employed hydrodynamic equations to show that, for sufficiently large
systems, the homogeneously cooling state of the granular gas is linearly unstable. The unstable perturbations
grow via two (linearly) independent modes: the shear
mode corresponding to the development of a macroscopic
solenoidal flow, and the clustering mode corresponding
to the development of a potential flow that causes formation of clusters of particles. How does the clustering mode develop beyond the linear regime, and do the
hydrodynamic nonlinearities arrest the density growth?
For the clustering instability in large systems (as well as
for the gravitational instability2 ) the growing perturbations bring the system into a fully developed non-linear
regime9,11,14,16,17,18 . Therefore, one has to deal with fully
non-linear hydrodynamic equations. Not restricting ourselves to a close proximity to the homogeneously cooling state, we can formulate the problem in a more general way and explore different nonlinear flows of a freely
evolving granular gas.
Solving the hydrodynamic equations analytically, and
even numerically, is a difficult task, and additional simplifications are needed. We will make two additional simplifying assumptions in this work. First, assuming a largescale flow, we will neglect the viscous and heat conduction terms in the hydrodynamic equations. Second, we
will assume that the macroscopic flow is one-dimensional.
A natural environment for the second assumption is provided by the geometry of a narrow channel with perfectly
elastic side walls that we adopt here, following Refs.17,18 .
Although the microscopic motion of particles in the channel remains two- or three-dimensional (2d or 3d), the
macroscopic flow depends only on one spatial coordinate:
the coordinate along the channel. This is because, in a
narrow channel, both the shear mode and the clustering mode in the transverse directions are suppressed (see
Refs. 17,18 for detail). As a result, one can focus on the
development of the (one-dimensional) clustering mode as
it enters a strongly nonlinear regime.
Working in the channel geometry, Efrati et al.17 considered the long-wavelength limit of the clustering instability, when the linear growth rate of the instability is
the highest. In this case the inelastic energy loss of the
gas is the fastest process, and the gas pressure drops, almost instantaneously, to a very small value. The further
dynamics are then (almost) purely inertial which would
bring about a finite-time blow-up of the velocity gradient and, therefore, of the density. This is the well known
blow-up of the free flow24 . Its signatures were observed in
the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations17
until the maximum gas density became so high that the
numerical scheme lost accuracy. The numerical results of
Ref.17 were tested in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in 2d of a freely cooling gas of inelastically colliding disks in a long and narrow channel18 . The MD simulations supported the free-flow blow-up scenario until

the time when the gas density approached the hexagonal
close-packing value, and the further density growth was
arrested.
As we have recently found22 , the free flow asymptotics
does not hold all the way to the density blowup. Very
close, in time and in space, to the (attempted) free-flow
singularity, the compressional heating starts to act and
temporarily stabilizes the gas temperature at a small
but finite value. As a result, the gas pressure again becomes important: it breaks the purely inertial dynamics
and, though unable to stop the density blowup, dramatically changes the local blowup properties. It turns out
that, after a brief crossover, the further dynamics obey a
new blowup scenario, not limited to the long-wavelength
limit22 . The new scenario has the following features. As
the blow-up time tc is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law ∼ (tc − t)−2 . The velocity
gradient blows up as ∼ −(tc − t)−1 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp, rather
than a shock discontinuity, at the singularity. The gas
temperature vanishes at the singularity, but the pressure
there remains finite. This blowup, which obeys the above
asymptotic laws near the singularity, emerges universally,
that is for generic initial and boundary conditions. (Note
that, in the long-wavelength limit, the crossover from the
free flow regime to the finite-pressure regime does not
happen when the initial gas density is not very small.
In this case excluded particle volume effects interfere in
the dynamics, and arrest the density growth, before the
crossover has a chance to occur, as indeed was observed
in Ref.18 .)
These findings are based on extensive numerical simulations (numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations for a host of initial and boundary conditions) and a
family of exact analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic
equations, without and with shocks, briefly announced in
Ref.22 . In the present work we give a detailed account of
the exact solutions and investigate their structure close
to the singularity. We verify the exact solutions numerically. We show that the singularity follows the isobaric
scenario: the gas pressure is approximately uniform in
space and constant in time in a close vicinity of the developing singularity. Finally, we evaluate the validity of
the exact solutions close to the singularity by estimating
the role of additional physical processes: the viscosity,
heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II we introduce the equations of ideal granular
hydrodynamics (IGHD) and discuss their general properties. In Section III we employ Lagrangian coordinates
and derive a family of exact solutions of the IGHD equations, consider some particular cases of the solutions and
investigate global and local properties of the solutions.
In Section IV we adapt the exact solutions to describe a
different setting, where a piston moves into a granular gas
at rest, and a density blowup, developing at the piston,
coexists with an "ordinary" shock wave propagating into
the gas. Besides demonstrating the presence of the two

3
different types of singularities in the same system, this solution allows an arbitrary initial density profile at large
distances, showing that the density blowup is a local process. Section V presents the results of numerical solutions
of the IGHD equations that confirm stability of the exact
solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations and establish universality of the density blowup
for different initial conditions. In Section VI we discuss
the role of non-ideal effects, neglected in our solutions,
close to the singularity. In Section VII we summarize our
results and discuss their bearing on cluster formation.

IDEAL HYDRODYNAMICS OF A FREELY
COOLING GRANULAR GAS

Under the three strong inequalities (1), the NavierStokes granular hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively
accurate leading-order theory for granular gases. It deals
with three coarse-grained fields: the mass density ρ(x, t),
the mean flow velocity v(x, t) and the granular temperature T (x, t). An additional coarse-grained field, the pressure p(x, t), is related to the density and temperature
by the perfect gas equation of state p = ρT . Assuming
a one-dimensional macroscopic flow, we can write these
equations as

2d, and ν0 = 5(3σ 2 π)−1 and κ0 = 15ν0 /8 in 3d, see
Ref. 6. The only difference between Eqs. (2)-(4) and
the standard gas dynamic equations for a dilute gas of
elastically colliding spheres is the presence in Eq. (4) of
the inelastic energy loss term −ΛρT 3/2 .
There are three types of dissipative terms in Eqs. (2)(4): the viscous terms in Eqs. (3) and (4), the heat
conduction term in Eq. (4) and the energy loss term in
Eq. (4). The viscous and heat conduction terms include
spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields, whereas
the energy loss term is independent of the gradients.
When the characteristic hydrodynamic length scale of the
flow is sufficiently large, the viscous and heat conduction
terms can be neglected, while the energy loss term should
be kept, and we arrive at the equations of ideal granular
hydrodynamics (IGHD):

For consistency, all the assumptions must be checked a
posteriori, after a hydrodynamic problem in question is
solved, and the hydrodynamic length and time scales are
found.
The basic state of the freely cooling gas is the homogeneously cooling state described by the Haff law25 :
ρ = ρ0 ,

v = 0,

T =

2 .

(7)

This state corresponds to the initial conditions ρ(x, t =
0) = ρ0 = const, T (x, t = 0) = T0 = const and v(x, t) =
0. Obviously, the IGHD equations reproduce the Haff's
law exactly, as the homogeneously cooling state does not
include gradients of the hydrodynamic fields.
A more meaningful example of a situation where the
IGHD applies is provided by the linear stability analysis of the homogeneously cooling state. This analysis, in the framework of the complete, non-ideal NavierStokes hydrodynamics (2)-(4) and its extensions was performed by many workers, starting from Goldhirsch and
collaborators9 and McNamara10. The main results of the
linear stability analysis can be described, at the level of
order-of-magnitude estimates, as follows. The evolution
of a small sinusoidal perturbation with the wave number k is determined by two competing processes. The
inelastic energy loss tends to enhance the√fluctuations
on the cooling time scale [(1 − r2 )σ d−1 ρ T ]−1 which
is k-independent. In its turn, the viscosity and thermal conduction tend
√to erase the perturbation on a time
scale [k 2 lf2 ree ρσ d−1 T ]−1 , where lf ree ∼ 1/(nσ d−1 ) is
√
the mean free path and lf2 ree ρσ d−1 T is the characteristic value of the viscosity/heat conductivity. Balancing these two time√scales, one obtains the critical wave
number kc ∼ lf−1
ree 1 − r so that the perturbations with
k < kc grow, while the short-wavelength perturbations,
k > kc , decay9,10 . In a narrow channel, such that perturbations in the transverse direction with wave numbers smaller than kc are not allowed, only perturbations
along the channel will grow. As a result, by the end of
the linear stage, the hydrodynamic fields are effectively
one-dimensional and
√ have characteristic length scales of
the order of lf ree / 1 − r or longer. The validity of the
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics (2)-(4) for the description
of the whole range of
√ unstable perturbations demands
a strong inequality 1 − r ≪ 1. On the other hand,
the IGHD model (5) and (6) is valid if we demand a
strong inequality k ≪ kc . Indeed, one can check that, in
this case, the growth rate of the clustering instability, as
obtained from the IGHD, coincides in the leading order
in k/kc with that obtained from the full hydrodynamic
equations.
In Section VI we will perform a consistency check, and
establish the validity domain, of our exact nonlinear solutions of the IGHD equations (5) and (6). Now let us

4
discuss the basic properties of these equations. Although
much simpler than the non-ideal equations (2)-(4), the
nonlinear IGHD equations still present a hard mathematical problem. Going back to elastic particle collisions,
Λ = 0, one recovers the ordinary ideal gas dynamics in
one dimension. Among most interesting solutions are
those describing the development of wave-breaking singularities when starting from smooth initial data26,27 . Note
that, even for Λ = 0, the general initial value problem is
not soluble analytically, except for the particular case of
an isentropic flow, where
the entropy per unit volume

s(ρ, T ) = ρ ln T /ργ−1 is uniform in space and constant
in time26,27 . Needless to say, at Λ > 0, Eqs. (5) and (6)
do not allow isentropic
solutions. The total entropy of
R
the fluid S = s(ρ, T ) dx, governed by Eq. (5) and (6),
is monotone decreasing:
Z
dS
= −Λ ρ2 T 1/2 dx ,
(8)
dt

where we have assumed that there is no net entropy
flux from the boundaries. As expected from the microscopic picture, the local entropy loss rate in Eq. (8) is
proportional to the particle collision rate. The entropy
loss implies that the system may exhibit self-organization
phenomena28 as is indeed observed in the process of clustering instability.
Before deriving a family of exact solutions exhibiting a finite-time density blowup, we note two rescaling
symmetries of Eqs. (5) and (6). The first symmetry
relates solutions at different Λ > 0. If ρ(x, t), v(x, t)
and T (x, t) solve Eqs. (5) and (6) at some Λ, then the
rescaled fields ρ[(Λ′ /Λ)x, (Λ′ /Λ)t], v[(Λ′ /Λ)x, (Λ′ /Λ)t]
and T [(Λ′ /Λ)x, (Λ′ /Λ)t] solve the same system with the
cooling coefficient Λ′ . Therefore, the general mathematical properties of Eqs. (5) and (6), such as the existence
of singularities, are the same for any Λ > 0. The second symmetry relates solutions of Eqs. (5) and (6) at the
same Λ. If ρ, v and T solve Eqs. (5) and (6), then ρ̃, ṽ
and T̃ defined by
p

ρ̃(x, t) = αρ(αx, α βt), ṽ(x, t) = βv(αx, α βt),
p
(9)
T̃ (x, t) = βT (αx, α βt) ,
with any α > 0 and β > 0, also solve Eqs. (5) and (6).
These symmetries are exploited in the following.

The family of exact solutions, presented in this Section,
are smooth initially but become singular in a finite time
tc . At the singularity, the density blows up, in contrast
to the ordinary "wave-breaking" singularity of the ideal
gas dynamics (Λ = 0), where only the gradients of the
hydrodynamic fields blow up26,27 . An exact solution of a
different type, presented in Section IV, includes a shock
already at t = 0. That solution also exhibits a density
blowup, and the local properties of the blowup are the
same as in the initially smooth solutions.
Let us introduce Lagrangian coordinates. The coordinates x(m, t) of the fluid particles obey the equation
∂x(m, t)
= v(x(m, t), t),
∂t

(12)

where m is a continuous label (a Lagrangian coordinate)
of particles. The defining property of the exact solutions
that we are going to present is independence of the particle accelerations ∂t2 x(m, t) of time: the fluid particle
coordinates x(m, t) satisfy the equation
x(m, t) = x(m, 0) + v(m, 0)t +

a(m, 0)t2
,
2

(13)

where v(m, 0) and a(m, 0) are the initial velocities and
accelerations of the fluid particles, respectively. As we
will see later, the total mass of gas is finite for our solutions. As a result, the pressure must vanish at the boundaries, implying existence of a point with a zero pressure
gradient (and, therefore, a zero particle acceleration) in
between. A fluid particle that has a zero acceleration
(that is conserved in our solutions) moves with a constant velocity, and we choose to work in such a frame of
reference where this particle is at rest, so that the conditions v(x = 0, t) = 0 and ∂x p(x = 0, t) = 0 are obeyed.
It is convenient to choose the Lagrangian coordinate
m to be the mass coordinate29 :

m(x, t) =

that is the mass content between the Eulerian points 0

Now let us consider what types of initial conditions
evolve according to Eqs. (20)-(22) and discuss the density
blowup that is brought by this evolution.
B.

Initial conditions and density blowup for the
exact solutions

A particular member of our family of exact solutions
(20)-(22) is determined by a specific choice of the constant A > 0 and of the initial density ρ(m, 0) ≥ 0, defined on the interval [−π/(2μ), π/(2μ)]. In the Eulerian
coordinates one can specify an arbitrary initial density
profile ρ(x, 0) that has a fixed total mass π/μ:
Z ∞
ρ(x, 0)dx = π/μ.
(23)
−∞

(22)

where we have used the condition v(m = 0, t) = 0. This
family of solutions describes a compression flow (the velocity gradient is negative everywhere), as the compressional heating is balanced, in Eq. (17), by the inelastic
cooling. The solutions include an arbitrary non-negative
function ρ(m, 0): the initial gas density. The arbitrary
constant A > 0 that, together with ρ(m, 0), determines
the (time-dependent) Mach number of the flow, appears
due to the rescaling symmetry of the equations and corresponds to the constant β in Eq. (9). One can check that
the constant α in Eq. (9) corresponds to the freedom of
multiplying ρ(m, 0) and A by α.
As the pressure p must be non-negative, and vanish
at the (finite or infinite) boundaries of the freely moving
gas, the solutions (20) can hold only on a finite interval
(−π/2μ, π/2μ) (we assume that the gas region is singleconnected, and the interval includes m = 0). Therefore,
the total mass of the gas in these
R ∞solutions is finite and
fixed by parameters Λ and γ: −∞ ρ(x, 0)dx = π/μ =
√
2πγ/Λ.
Once the solutions (20)-(22) in the Lagrangian coordinates are known, we can return to the Eulerian coordinates by using, at any time t, Eq. (15). Depending
on the particular choice of the initial density, there are
two possible types of solutions (20)-(22). First, the fixed
mass of the gas π/μ can be distributed, at t = 0, over
either an infinite, or a finite x-interval. This is determined by the behavior of ρ(m, 0) near m = ± π/2μ. For
example, let ρ(m, 0) ∼ (π/2μ − m)1+a near m = π/2μ.
Then it follows from Eq. (15) that the gas occupies an
infinite (correspondingly, a finite) interval of positive x
if a ≥ 0 (correspondingly, a < 0). The velocity can
be either finite, or infinite at the gas boundaries. For
example, for the same behavior of the initial density
ρ(m, t = 0) ∼ (π/2μ − m)1+a near m = π/2μ one obtains a finite (correspondingly, infinite) gas velocity at
m = π/2μ for a < 2 (correspondingly, a ≥ 2).

Once ρ(x, 0) and A are specified, one needs to choose the
origin so that the gas masses to the left and to the right
of the origin are the same [and equal to π/(2μ)]. Then
the initial gas pressure in the Eulerian coordinates is

 Z x

p(x, 0) = 2A cos μ

Now, using Eq. (22), we calculate the velocity gradient
in the Eulerian coordinate at t = 0:
∂v(x, 0)
∂v(m, 0)
= ρ(m, 0)
∂x
p ∂m
= −2μ Aρ(m, 0) cos(μm).

(25)

which, in view of the condition v(x = 0, t) = 0, yields
Z xp
v(x, 0) = −μ
2ρ(x′ , 0)p(x′ , 0)dx′
(26)
0

with p(x, 0) from Eq. (24). Equations (24) and (26) show
that, once ρ(x, 0) is a smooth function of x, then the
initial pressure and velocity are smooth functions as well.
Let us now proceed to the properties of the solutions.
As we already noted, these solutions describe a motion of
fluid particles with a time-independent acceleration, see
Eq. (13). This time-independent acceleration is
a(m, 0) = −

∂p(m, 0)
= 2μA sin(μm).
∂m

(27)

The evolution described by Eqs. (20)-(22) brings about a
singularity of this initially smooth flow: ρ(m, t) blows up
in a finite time, while the rest of the flow variables - the
pressure and velocity - remain finite. The density blow up
occurs at the Lagrangian point m0 where ρ(m, 0) cos(μm)
reaches its maximum:
ρ(m0 , 0) cos(μm0 ) = max [ρ(m, 0) cos(μm)] .

(28)

Interestingly, the point m0 corresponds, in view of
Eq. (25), to the point of the absolute (negative) minimum of the velocity gradient in the Eulerian coordinates,

6
just as in the case of the free flow (that is, zero pressure)
singularity24 . The singularity occurs when the Jacobian
of the Lagrangian transformation of the fluid particles
vanishes for the first time: ∂m x(m = m0 , tc ) = 0. For
the time tc and the Eulerian coordinate of the singularity

The velocity gradient at the singularity point x(m0 , t)
diverges. The divergence law can be easily found in the

Finally, the (finite) pressure is conserved on the Lagrangian trajectory:
p(x = x(m0 , t), t) = 2A cos(μm0 ).

(33)

Note that the pressure does not have a minimum at the
singularity point, so this flow does not conform to the
popular "pressure instability" scenario9.
It is instructive to consider several particular examples
of solutions starting with the mass distributed over an
infinite interval of x.

Solutions with mass distributed over an infinite
interval of x

In our first example the initial density profile in the
Lagrangian coordinates is ρ(m, 0) = ρ0 cos(μm). To return to the Eulerian coordinates, we use Eq. (15) and

where we have introduced the characteristic inelastic
cooling length scale l = 1/(μρ0 ) whose meaning will become clear shortly. We use Eq. (34) to express ρ(m, 0) =

ρ0 cos(μm) through x. The rest of initial conditions follow from Eq. (20) and Eq. (22) at t = 0. Note that
the initial gas temperature T (m, 0) = p(m, 0)/ρ(m, 0) =
2A/ρ0 ≡ T0 is uniform in space. The initial conditions

the singularity still develops at x = 0. Indeed, it is the
maximum of the function ρ(m, 0) cos(μm), rather than
of ρ(m, 0) that determines, in view of Eq. (28), the singularity point. For acr < a < ãcr this maximum is still
at m = m0 = 0. As time progresses, the two symmetric
density peaks move toward the origin, reaching it precisely at the time of singularity. The pressure still has a
maximum at x = 0, while√in view of Eqs. (47) the time of
singularity is still tc = τ cosh a. Instead of looking for
the maxima of ρ(m), it is convenient to look for the minima of the inverse density which, by virtue of Eq. (21),
can be written as

If ρ(m, 0) does not vanish at |m| = π/(2μ), or vanishes
slower than linearly there, then the integral in Eq. (15)
converges, and the total gas mass π/μ is distributed over
a finite interval of x. It follows from Eq. (22) that the
velocity (which vanishes at x = m = 0 and has a negative
gradient everywhere) takes finite values at the ends of the
interval over which the mass is distributed. As a result,
the x-interval, occupied by the gas, shrinks in the course
of evolution. Assuming for simplicity that ρ(m, 0) is an
even function of m, we find from Eqs. (15) and (21) that
the interval [−L(t), L(t)], occupied by the gas, shrinks
with time as

Using the first of Eq. (29) we find tc /τ

non-zero in the singularity point, so the pressure is neither maximum, nor minimum.

and reaches its minimum at t = tc . This minimum is always positive except in the degenerate case of ρ(m, 0) =
ρ0 / cos(μm), when the whole gas collapses into the point
x = 0 at the time of singularity. It turns out that, in this
degenerate case, the solution is self-similar in the Eulerian coordinates x and t and separable in the Lagrangian
coordinates m and t. It can be shown that all self-similar
solutions with a finite energy have an infinite density at
some locations already at t = 0. Such initial conditions
do not correspond to a dilute gas, so they will not be
considered here.

Differentiating this function
with respect to m one can
√
verify that at t = τ cosh a the minimum is indeed at
m = 0. Finally, at a > ãcr the density blows up symmetrically at two Eulerian points x = ± x(m0 , tc ) 6= 0,

A generic example of the solution on a finite Eulerian interval is provided by the uniform initial density
ρ(m, 0) = ρ0 . In the Eulerian coordinates this choice
corresponds to the constant initial density, ρ(x, 0) = ρ0 ,

Energy decay for the exact solutions

A useful global characteristics of the clustering process
is provided by the evolution of the total kinetic energy of
all particles versus time, E(t) > 0. This quantity is convenient to follow in experiment and in MD simulations.

where the first term under the integral is the thermal

solutions Eqs. (20)-(22). First, consider the conditions
under which the initial total energy E(0) is finite. For
the initial thermal energy we have

m = π/2μ, we find that Eth (0) is finite at a < 1 and
infinite otherwise. A simple example of the initial condition with an infinite energy is ρ(m, 0) = ρ0 cos2 (μm)

One can check that the decay of the thermal and macroscopic kinetic energies, separately, is also quadratic in

special for the function E(t).
As a simple example, consider the initial density

Local structure of the exact solutions near the
singularity

To analyze the local structure of the developing singularity we consider the Taylor expansion of the inverse
density u(m, t) ≡ 1/ρ(m, t) in a close vicinity of m = m0
at times close to tc . To calculate the m-derivatives it
is convenient to p
write u(m, t) = u(m, 0)[1 − tφ(m)]2 ,
where φ(m) = μ Aρ(m, 0) cos(μm) satisfies the conditions φ(m0 ) = 1/tc and φ′ (m0 ) = 0, see Eqs. (28) and
(29). After some algebra we find
u′ (m0 , t)
= ∆2 ,
u′ (m0 , 0)
u′′ (m0 , t)
= −2tc φ′′ ∆ + O(∆2 ),
u(m0 , 0)
u′′′ (m0 , t) = −2tc ∆ [3u′ (m0 , 0)φ′′ + u(m0 , 0)φ′′′ ]
+O(∆2 ),
u(4) (m0 , t)
= 6t2c φ′′2 + O(∆),
u(m0 , 0)

(61)

where all the derivatives of φ are evaluated at m = m0 ,
and ∆ ≡ 1 − t/tc . The first non-vanishing m-derivative
at t = tc is, therefore, of the fourth order, and we obtain
u(m, tc )
≃ b2 μ4 (m − m0 )4 , μ|m − m0 | ≪ 1,
u(m0 , 0)

(62)

where we have introduced a positive dimensionless constant b = −tc φ′′ (m0 )/2μ2 [recall that φ(m) has a maximum at m = m0 , so that φ′′ (m0 ) < 0]. Using the expression for tc from Eq. (29) and the definition of φ one
finds that b is independent of A and can be written as
b=−

where we have used [ρ(m, 0) cos(μm)]′ (m = m0 ) =

shows that, at the singularity, u = 1/ρ vanishes faster
than quadratically in m, as expected in general when a
singularity is analytic. GoingRback to the Eulerian coorm

in m in Eq. (62). Thus, at t = tc the density profile is

Note that while the exponent 2/5 of this power law is
different from the exponent 4/5 of the power law for the
density, the two power laws have the same region of validity in x, see Eq. (64). Though the velocity gradient
diverges at the singularity, the velocity itself is continuous there and has a cusp ∼ |xc −x|3/5 . This is in contrast
with the "wave breaking" singularity of ordinary gas dynamics, where the velocity becomes discontinuous at the
point where the velocity gradient blows up.
It is clear from the above that the local profiles of the
density and velocity at t = tc do not depend on the details
of the initial density ρ(m, 0). This is not so for the pressure for which two types of spatial behavior are possible.
For the special case where ρ(m, 0) cos(μm) is maximum
at m = 0, and so m0 = 0, the density blows up at the origin x = 0. As a result, the pressure versus x has a local
maximum at x = 0, and the value of the maximum stays
constant in time: p(x = 0, t) = 2A. The pressure profile
in a vicinity of x = 0 can be obtained from a Taylor expansion of Eq. (20): p(m, t)/A ≃ 2 − μ2 m2 + O(μ4 m4 ).

In the generic case, where the maximum of
ρ(m, 0) cos(μm) is not at zero, so that m0 6= 0,
the singularity develops at a point which is not special
for the pressure. Here the Taylor expansion of Eq. (20)
yields
p(m)/A = 2 cos(μm0 ) − 2μ(m − m0 ) sin(μm0 )

that holds at (|x − xc |/l)1/5 ≪ 1. Note that the local
x-dependence of the pressure at t = tc is very different
from that of the density, or velocity gradient. First, the
pressure remains finite at t = tc . Second, even though
the pressure gradient diverges at x = xc , the divergence
stems from a small correction term to a constant pressure, see Eq. (69) and (71). As we discuss later, this
difference in behavior is crucial for understanding the
physical nature of the singularity.
Now let us investigate the local structure of the flow
immediately before the singularity: at tc − t ≪ tc . The
leading terms of the double Taylor expansion of the inverse density u(m, t) = u(m, 0)[1 − tφ(m)]2 in a vicinity
of m = m0 and t = tc (that is, at μ|m − m0 | ≪ 1 and

by Eq. (68) sets in the outer region in the same way as
the density power law.
The development of the pressure profile as t approaches

[|x − xc (t)|/l]1/5 ≪ 1, the pressure is approximately constant. This suggests that the sound waves are the fastest
physical process near the singularity. Before we consider
the hierarchy of time scales in more detail, let us reiterate that the finite-time singularity described here is quite
different from the free-flow singularity24 where the density blows up as (tc − t)−1 , the plateau of the inner region
shrinks with time as (tc − t)3/2 , the power law tail in the
outer region is ∼ x2/3 , and where the Lagrangian velocity, rather than the Lagrangian acceleration, is constant
in time.

Time scale separation and isobaric scenario

In general, there are three time scales that characterize
the dynamics described by the nonlinear IGHD equations
√
(5) and (6): the sound travel√time tsound ∼ L/ T , the
cooling time tcooling ∼ 1/(Λρ T ), and the inertial time
tinertial ∼ L/v. Here ρ, T , and v are typical values of the
fields, while L = L(t) is the characteristic spatial scale
of the flow. The evolution of the hydrodynamic fields
can produce time scale separation: a strong inequality
between the time scales. Moreover, the hierarchy of the
time scales can be different in different regions of space.
Let us evaluate the time scales for our exact solutions
(20)-(22). Here there are only two independent time
scales: the sound travel and the cooling time scales. This
stems from the fact that the compressional heating and
the inelastic cooling balance each other in the equation
for the pressure, so that tinertial ∼ tcooling . Consider the
5/2
inner region |x − xc | <
∼ l(1 −
√t/tc ) √ . From the results
of the previous subsection,√ T ∼ T0 (1 − t/tc ), while
L(t) ∼ l(1 − t/tc )5/2 . As l/ T0 ∼ τ ∼ tc , we obtain

(85)

We observe that, except close to tc , tsound ∼ tcooling ∼ tc .
However, as the singularity is approached, the sound
travel time in the inner region becomes much shorter
than the cooling time. In this situation, the pressure
in the inner region is expected to become constant5 as
our solutions indeed show.
To further elucidate this point, let us estimate the
size of the spatial region at t = tc such that, within
this region, the time scales obey the strong inequality
tsound
p ≪ tcooling . Equations (84) and (85) show that,
at 1 − t/tc ≪ 1, tsound ≪ tcooling in the inner region.
At these times the size L(t) of the shrinking inner region obeys the inequality (L/l)1/5 ≪ 1. As we saw in the
previous subsection, the shrinking inner region leaves behind stationary profiles of the fields. Therefore, at t = tc ,
the local time scales at some |x| = x0 ≪ l can be estimated by their values at those times when L(t) shrinks
to the size x0 . That is, at t = tc the time scale separation tsound ≪ tcooling ∼ tinertial holds in the region
(|x − xc |/l)1/5 ≪ 1 which is precisely the region where
the pressure is approximately constant. Therefore, the
density blowup, as featured by our exact solutions, locally follows the isobaric scenario, previously suggested
in the context of condensation processes developing in
gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation5,30 .
This fact has important consequences for the theory of
clustering that will be explored elsewhere.
We now proceed to the derivation of an additional solution that would allow us to demonstrate two important
features of the developing density singularity: its locality
and its possible coexistence with shock singularities of
ordinary gas dynamics.

IV. A PISTON MOVING INTO A GRANULAR
GAS AT REST: A BLOWUP WITH A SHOCK

The family of exact solutions, describing the finite time
density blowup and reported in Section
√ III, have a special
value of the total gas mass, π/μ = ( 2πγ)/Λ. Here we
relax this requirement by constructing an exact solution
that can have an arbitrarily large mass. In this solution
both the finite-time density blowup and an "ordinary"
shock discontinuity are present.
First, we note that formation of a density singularity
in hydrodynamics is a local process. The set of Eqs. (10)(11) is hyperbolic and has a finite speed of propagation
of information. Therefore, a finite-time density blowup,
developing at a point with a finite x, cannot be affected
by a change in the initial conditions sufficiently far away
(provided the velocity is finite there). In particular, this
is true for initial density variations that change the total
mass of the gas, possibly making it infinite. The solution
that we are going to present here illustrates this point,
as it has an arbitrary density distribution sufficiently far
from the developing singularity.
The solution also illustrates another point that is absent in the solutions reported in Section III: appearance

13
of shocks. At Λ = 0, Eqs. (10)-(11) become the equations
of classical ideal gas dynamics which produce shocks: initially smooth hydrodynamic fields develop shock discontinuities in a finite time26,27 . Shocks can also appear at
Λ > 0, the case of our interest. The following argument
can be helpful in elucidating the comparative role of the
two types of singularities: the density blowup and the
shock. Let the initial conditions be fixed. Then, as Λ
goes down, the development of a density blow up will
be delayed in time (the delay time becoming infinite as
Λ → 0). On the other hand, the time of shock formation must obviously approach a finite limit as Λ → 0.
Therefore, for sufficiently small Λ the shock formation
will typically precede the density blowup. In the exact
solution that we are going to present, the shock is present
in the solution from the very beginning.
We choose for this solution (an extended version of)
a basic setting of ideal one-dimensional gas dynamics:
at t = 0 a piston starts moving at a constant speed v0
into an undriven granular gas at rest. Because such a
gas has a zero temperature everywhere, the initial state
of the gas is uniquely characterized by the initial density profile, say ρ0 (x). It is convenient to go over to
the frame moving with the piston, where the piston rests
at x = 0. There one needs to solve Eqs. (5) and (6)
with the initial conditions ρ(x, 0) = ρ0 (x), v(x, 0) = −v0 ,
T (x, 0) = 0 and the boundary conditions v(x = 0, t) = 0
and v(x = +∞, t) = −v0 . At t = 0 the gas hits the
piston wall at x = 0, and a shock forms instantaneously
and starts propagating into the gas. Each of the hydrodynamic fields experiences a discontinuity at the shock front
x0 (t) that obeys x0 (0) = 0. The solution at x > x0 (t)
is of course ρ(x, t) = ρ0 (x + v0 t), v(x, t) = −v0 and
T (x, t) = 0, while at 0 ≤ x ≤ x0 (t) non-trivial distributions of the hydrodynamic fields develop. We show below
that a special choice of ρ0 (x) yields a solution that, at
x < x0 (t), is of the same type as that described in Section
III.
The jump conditions at the shock front are provided by
the same Rankine-Hugoniot conditions as in the ordinary
gas26 . Indeed, these conditions can be obtained by considering the equations of mass, momentum and energy
balance in an infinitesimal volume (x0 (t) − ǫ, x0 (t) + ǫ),
in the limit of ǫ → 0. While the mass and momentum
balances are exactly the same as in the ordinary gas, the
inelastic loss correction to the energy balance is proporR x (t)+ǫ
tional to x00(t)−ǫ ρ2 T 3/2 dx (see subsection III E), and it
vanishes at ǫ → 0 despite the discontinuity of the integrand. The Rankine-Hugoniot conditions state that,
in the frame moving with the piston, the mass, momentum and energy fluxes should be continuous through the
shock26 :

at 0 ≤ m ≤ mf (t) is a constant acceleration solution presented in Section III. In the upstream region, m > mf (t),
the gas is undisturbed by the shock, and the solution is

Φ(μm∗ ) = γ − 1 which yields μm∗ = 1.08031 . . . for
γ = 2 (in 2d) and 0.87915 . . . for γ = 5/3 (in 3d). That
is, by the time t = tc when the density blows up at
the piston, the shock has traveled only a finite distance
(both in the m-, and in the x-space) from the piston. It is
obvious, therefore, that our solution allows an arbitrary
modification of the density profile ρ0 (x) at sufficiently
large x that are unreachable for the shock. This clearly
shows that initial states with an arbitrary large mass of
gas can develop a finite-time density blowup.

NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS

We confirmed the exact solutions, presented in Figs. 14 and 6, by solving numerically the IGHD equations (16)
and (17) in the Lagrangian coordinates. In each case
we used the initial and boundary conditions, provided
by the exact solutions themselves. We employed the
classical artificial viscosity, staggered grid scheme of von
Neumann and Richtmyer31 . The number of cells (grid
points) used varied between 1000 and 2000 and showed
numerical convergence until close to the singularity. As
the solution developed a density blowup, the simulation
had to be terminated at a very high but finite maximum
density: usually at about 107 ρ0 , where ρ0 is the initial
density. We also enforced the simulations to stop when
the density jump between two adjacent cells exceeded a
prescribed value, usually 50 percent. (When such jumps
develop near the singularity, the accuracy of the simulation degrades and can be restored only by a rezoning
algorithm that was not employed.) One example of the
numerical solution is shown in Fig. 1 alongside with the
analytical solution, and very good agreement is observed.
Very good agreement was also obtained for the solutions
shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 6 (not shown). The numerical
solutions inevitably add some effective noise to the system because of the spatial and temporal discretization
and round-off errors. The fact that the analytical solutions are accurately reproduced numerically confirms
their stability with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations.
We also performed extensive numerical simulations
with Eqs. (16) and (17) for a variety of initial and boundary conditions that did not correspond to any of the
exact solutions. As already briefly reported in Ref.22 ,

a power law ρ ∼ x−4/5 , to guide the eye. The Lagrangian and
Eulerian coordinates, time and the hydrodynamic fields are
made dimensionless, as explained
√ in Section V. The parameters are Λ̃ = ρ0 Λλ = 0.5, v0 = T0 and γ = 2.

these simulations show that, for generic initial conditions, a finite-time density blowup always occurs. Remarkably, the numerical solutions exhibit, close to the
singularity, the same local scaling behaviors in space
and in time as those exhibited by our exact solutions
and presented in subsection III F. One series of simulations dealt with a symmetric inflow of an initially
uniform gas, ρ(x, 0) = ρ0 and T (x, 0) = T0 , from "infinity": v(x, 0) = −v0 tanh(x/λ). Here it is convenient
√
to rescale the x-coordinate by λ,√ time by λ/ T0 , the
density by ρ0 , the velocity by T0 , the temperature
by T0 , the pressure by ρ0 T0 and the Lagrangian mass
coordinate m by ρ0 λ. After this rescaling the governing equations Eqs. (16) and (17) keep their form, except that Λ becomes rescaled: Λ̃ = ρ0 Λλ. The rescaled

initial conditions√ become ρ(x, 0) = p(x, 0) = 1 and
v(x, 0) = −(v0 / T0 ) tanh(x). The numerical solutions
were obtained on the (rescaled) interval |x| < 10 that
corresponds, at t = 0, to the (rescaled) Lagrangian interval |m| < 10. The boundary√conditions are v(x =
±10, t) = v(x = ±10, 0) = ∓(v0 / T0 ) tanh 10. Because
of the symmetry of the problem with respect to x = 0 we
actually solved it on the half-interval 0 < x < 10, replacing the boundary condition at x = −10 by the condition
v(0, t) = 0.
Here we present one typical example of such a simulation, briefly mentioned
in Ref.22 . The parameters are
√
Λ̃ = 0.5, v0 = T0 and γ = 2. The (one half of the)
simulated flow is shown in Fig. 7. Panel (a) provides a
general view of (one half of) the system. The gas inflow
creates a compression in the central region. A compression wave propagates outwards and steepens. This steepening would lead to a wave breaking singularity, but the
numerical scheme resolves this singularity, by means of
the artificial viscosity, as a shock wave that continues
propagating outward. At the same time the gas density
at the origin continues growing and ultimately blows up.
The density growth in a vicinity of the origin is presented
in panel (b). Panel (c) focuses on the density and pressure history at the origin. While the density blows up at
t = tc , the pressure hardly varies there so the isobaric scenario holds. The inset of panel (c) verifies that, close to
tc , the density blowup proceeds as (tc − t)−2 . Panels (d)
and (e) add more tests of the spatial and temporal scaling behavior near the singularity. Panel (d) shows a plot
of the rescaled density ρ(x, t)(tc − t)2 versus the rescaled
coordinate x(tc − t)−5/2 . The collapse of the curves at
different times proves the local self-similarity (note that
the gas density at the origin varies, for these times, by
four orders of magnitude). Finally, panel (e) verifies the
presence of the inner and outer regions, described by our
theory, see subsection III F. The density plateau, whose
size shrinks as ∼ (tc − t)5/2 , represents the inner region,
while in the outer region a time-independent density profile forms with a power-law behavior ρ ∼ x−4/5 as predicted by our exact solutions.
The same universal features of the singularity were also
observed when starting from small-amplitude sinusoidal
density or velocity perturbations around a homogeneous
state.

VI.

NON-IDEAL EFFECTS NEAR THE
SINGULARITY

Having found the exact nonlinear solutions of the
IGHD equations (5) and (6), we are in the position to test
the assumptions behind these equations and establish the
domain of validity of the solutions (as accurate leadingorder descriptions) in the presence of "non-ideal" effects.
First, the validity of the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics,
Eqs. (2)-(4), demands that the Knudsen number lf ree /L
remain much smaller than unity. The smallest hydrody-

17
namic length scale of the solution can be estimated as
L(t) ∼ l(1 − t/tc )5/2 , see subsections III F and III G. The
mean free path lf ree ∼ 1/(ρσ d−1 ) ∼ (1−t/tc)2 /(ρ0 σ d−1 ).
As l ∼ 1/(Λρ0 ) and Λ ∼ (1 − r)σ d−1 , we obtain
lf ree
1−r
∼ p

L
1 − t/tc

(109)

At t <
∼ tc the Knudsen number is small by the assumption 1−r ≪ 1. However, as t approaches tc , the Knudsen
number grows indefinitely which invalidates the hydrodynamics. We shall see, however, that one of the assumptions of the IGHD breaks down even earlier.
Now consider the ratio of the viscous stress term to
the pressure gradient term in the momentum

ratio

√
region, see subsection III F. As both ∂m v and T vanish linearly as t → tc , their ratio depends on time only
weakly, and can√be estimated by its value at t = 0. As
|∂m v(m, 0)| ∼ Λ T (see subsection III A), we find
√
ν0 ∂x ( T ∂x v)
∼ 1−r,
∂x (ρT )

(110)

that is the viscous stress is always negligible in our solutions as long as 1 − r ≪ 1.
The same estimate (up to the sign) holds for the ratio
of the viscous heating term to the compressional heating
term in Eq. (4):
√
ν0 (γ − 1) T (∂x v)2 /ρ
∼ 1−r ≪ 1.
(γ − 1)T ∂x v

(111)

In contrast to the viscous terms, the heat conduction
term in Eq. (4), which is initially small in our solutions,
does become important near the singularity. We estimate
the ratio of the heat conduction term to the inelastic
cooling term as follows:

the density becomes comparable with the (fraction

close packing density. This happens at 1 − t/tc ∼ ρσ d ,
so Lvalid ∼ l(ρ0 σ d )5/4 . At moderate densities one can
use, in numerical solutions, a half-empiric equation of
state due to Carnahan and Starling32 , and half-empiric
transport coefficients obtained for granular gases33 in the
spirit of Enskog
kinetic theory34 .

When ρ0 σ ≪ 1 − r the heat conduction becomes
important when the gas is still dilute. This happens at
5/2
time
√ 1 − t/tc ∼ 1 − r so that Lvalid ∼ l(1 − r) . As long
as 1 − r ≪ 1, the Knudsen number is still small at that
time, and the complete Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics is
still applicable.
Therefore, as the blowup time tc is approached, either
the heat conduction, or the excluded particle volume effects become important and invalidate our theory in the
inner region. In this sense, our solutions describe an intermediate asymptotic regime of formation of a dense
cluster of particles. Importantly, in the outer region our
solutions remain valid until much later times. Indeed, as
the inner region shrinks, it leaves behind stationary profiles of the fields, see subsection III F. The ratios of the
different terms governing the IGHD validity are given,
at some x from the outer region, by the corresponding
ratios in the inner region estimated at the time when
L(t) ∼ |x − xc |. As a result, at some time close to tc
(see above), our solutions break down in the inner region which size at that time is Lvalid , while in the outer
region, |x − xc | ≫ Lvalid , our solutions continue to hold.
The fact that the IGHD description breaks down only
locally, in a small region of space, can be exploited for
derivation of an effective description of the clustering dynamics beyond the singularity time. In this description
close-packed clusters appear as finite-mass point-like singularities of the density22 . This effective description is
similar in spirit to the description of shocks (that actually have finite widths) as discontinuities in ordinary
ideal gas dynamics.

SUMMARY

(112)

The same estimate is obtained for the ratio of the heat
conduction term to the compressional heating term. This
ratio becomes of order
√ unity at 1 − t/tc ∼ 1 − r ≪ 1. At
this time lf ree /L ∼ 1 − r ≪ 1, see Eq. (109), so the
IGHD equations break down while the full Navier-Stokes
hydrodynamics, Eqs. (2)-(4), is still valid.
In its turn, the dilute gas assumption, ρσ d ≪ 1, breaks
down, and excluded particle
p volume effects become important, at 1 − t/tc ∼ ρ0 σ d ≪ 1. The relative role
of the heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects in the breakdown of our analytic solutions near
the attempted singularity is determined
p by the competition between
the small parameters ρ0 σ d and 1 − r.

Let us briefly summarize the main results of this work.
We introduced "ideal granular hydrodynamics" (IGHD)
equations that provide a simple but informative description of non-stationary large-scale flows of dilute granular
gases with nearly elastic collisions between the particles.
We employed the IGHD equations to investigate analytically and numerically the paradigmatic phenomenon of
particle clustering in freely cooling granular gases. We
believe that the IGHD will provide a useful framework
for a host of other problems involving large-scale flows of
driven granular gases.
We focused on a one-dimensional granular hydrodynamic flow, characteristic of an idealized channel geometry, and derived a family of exact nonlinear and nonstationary analytic solutions of the IGHD that describe a
finite-time blowup of the gas density. The derivation was

18
made possible by a transformation of the hydrodynamic
equations to Lagrangian coordinates. The exact solutions
are characterized by a constant in time accelerations in
the Lagrangian frame, and they are not self-similar. We
investigated the local structure of the flow near the singularity and determined local spatial and temporal scaling
laws for the hydrodynamic quantities in question. We
also found an instructive soluble case of the problem of
a piston entering, at a constant speed, a granular gas
at rest. Here a density singularity, developing at the
piston, coexists with a shock wave that is located elsewhere. Besides demonstrating the presence of the two
different types of singularities in the same system, this
solution allows an arbitrary density profile at large distances, showing that the density blowup is a local process. In all of these solutions the developing singularity
obeys locally the isobaric scenario5,30 : the gas pressure
remains approximately uniform in space and constant in
time in a close vicinity of the blowup point. This finding
has important consequences for the theory of clustering.
Indeed, by imposing, in the zeroth order of theory, the
isobaricity condition on the hydrodynamic equations, one
arrives at a powerful reduced description of the nonlinear
clustering process. This description is valid for a much
broader class of initial conditions than those giving rise
to the exact solutions reported in the present work. The
corresponding results will be presented elsewhere.
Our numerical solutions of the IGHD equations accurately reproduce the analytic solutions, thus confirming
their stability with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations. Furthermore, numerical simulations with a
variety of initial and boundary conditions showed that
that the local scaling laws near the singularity are universal, that is independent of details of the initial and
boundary conditions.
We also analyzed additional physical effects, neglected
in IGHD, which become important in a narrow spatial
region near the attempted singularity. Depending on the
parameters, either excluded particle volume effects, or
heat conduction invalidate our solutions there. In the
former case, the density growth should directly cross over

to the formation of close-packed clusters of particles. In
the latter case, the final outcome of the nonlinear density
growth is yet unknown. The future work should find out
whether the heat conduction arrests the density blowup
or only modifies the singularity law. In any case, our
exact solutions can be viewed as instructive intermediate
asymptotics, describing a broad class of strongly nonlinear clustering flows of granular gases. No less important,
as breakdown of these solutions occurs only in the narrow
regions around the density peaks, it is possible to continue the ideal solutions beyond the singularity by introducing into the theory finite-mass point-like singularities
of the density. This procedure yields a simple effective
description of granular gases with embedded close-packed
clusters, in much the same way as the ideal gas dynamics
describes a gas flow with shock discontinuities22 .
Very recently, one of our exact solutions has been successfully tested against MD simulations of the dynamics
of a very dilute gas of nearly elastically colliding identical
hard disks in a very long and narrow 2d channel. The
results will be presented elsewhere.
Finally, we note that the power law of the density
blowup near the singularity, ∼ (tc − t)−2 , is the same as
the one recently found in a different setting: that of an
initially thermalized granular gas, freely cooling and collapsing under gravity21 . In each of the two problems the
momentum equation is "fast", while the energy equation
is "slow" in a small vicinity of the collapse. This suggests
common physics behind the two collapse phenomena and
demands further investigation.
