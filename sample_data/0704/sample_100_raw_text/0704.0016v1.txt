Abstract
++
+
In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons Ξ+
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc . We care-

fully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic
harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by
other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes
are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy
would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value
of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored.

INTRODUCTION

The quite large difference of the lifetimes between D ± and D 0 and the lifetimes close
to each other for B ± and B 0 are well explained by taking into account the non-spectator
effects[1]. This success implies that the mechanism which governs the reactions at quark
level is well understood. When we apply the mechanism to the heavy baryon case, some
problems emerge. The famous puzzle in the heavy-flavor field that the lifetime of Λb is
remarkably shorter than that of B meson is much alleviated recently when the operators
of higher dimensions are taken into account[2, 3]. The more recent experimental value of
the ratio τ (Λb )/τ (B 0 ) = 1.041 ± 0.057[4] is close to the theoretical evaluation[3]. However,
in the theoretical works, one can notice that the evaluation of hadronic matrix elements is
still very rough and based on some approximations. The possible errors brought up by the
uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements are still uncontrollable. In our recent work[5],
we find that the short-distance contributions to the branching ratio of Λb → Λγ which is
evaluated in the PQCD approach, are much smaller than that from long-distance effects.
Therefore, even though one has a full reason to believe that the low-energy QCD should
solve the discrepancy if it exists, he must find a proper way to deal with the hadronic matrix
elements.
The observation of doubly charmed baryon Ξ+
cc by the SELEX Collaboration at
FERMILAB[6] provides an opportunity to investigate the hidden problems. Hopefully the
study may shed some lights on the unknown non-perturbative QCD effects which result in
obvious difference between baryons and mesons. Because Ξ+
cc contains two heavy quarks,
by the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) the situation may become relatively simple
and clear compared to the case of Λb or Λc which possesses only one heavy quark. Thus a
careful study on the Ξ+
cc is necessary and interesting. Several groups already investigated
the two-heavy-flavor baryons a long time ago[7, 8]. In their work, the evaluation of the
hadronic matrix elements is based on the quark-diquark structure of the baryons. This is
definitely reasonable, it is believed that two heavy quarks can constitute a more stable and
compact color-anti-triplet diquark[9]. However, since charm quark, even b-quark, is not so
heavy that the degree of freedom of the light flavor can be ignored, the diquark scenario
may bring up certain errors, especially when evaluating lifetimes of baryons, because only
inclusive processes are concerned. In this work, we do not use the diquark picture, but
2

instead, adopt a simpler non-relativistic model for the baryon and re-evaluate the hadronic
matrix elements. As a by-product, one can compare the results by the diquark picture with
that by the three valence-quark picture. It may help us to better understand the diquark
picture and its application range.
The advantage is obvious, that we only concern the inclusive processes in terms of the
optical theorem when calculating the lifetime. Therefore, we do not need to deal with
the hadronization to light hadrons. The only non-perturbative effects come from the wave
function of the heavy baryon. Moreover, since there are two heavy quarks in the baryon,
the relativistic effects are not so significant and the framework of non-relativistic harmonic
oscillator model might lead to a reasonable result.
Moreover, at the quark level, we carry out similar calculations as that in the literature,
but we keep some new operators which are CKM suppressed and contribute to the lifetime.
They appear at the non-spectator scattering at order of

1
m3c

in heavy quark expansion(HQE).

Later, our numerical results show that their contributions are indeed very tiny to make any
substantial contributions.
All the concerned parameters in the model are obtained by fitting data, therefore we
avoid some theoretical uncertainties and obtain reasonable results. Comparing these results
with data, we may gain information about the the whole picture.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Section.II we derive the formulation for the lifetimes
++
+
of Ξ+
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc which include the non-spectator effects. In Section.III, we use a simple

model, i.e. the harmonic oscillator, to estimate the hadronic matrix elements. In Section.IV
we present our numerical results along with the values of all the input parameters. The last
section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion.

FORMULATION FOR LIFETIMES OF Ξ+

Spectator Contribution to Lifetimes of Ξ+
cc , Ξcc , Ωcc

The lifetime is determined by the inclusive decays. Thus one can use the optical theorem
to obtain the total width (lifetime) of the heavy hadron by calculating the absorptive part
of the forward-scattering amplitude.

3

The total width is then written as
Z

Γ(HQ → X) =

hHQ |Γ̂|HQ i,
mHQ
2mHQ

(1)

where
T̂ = T {iLef f (x), Lef f (0)}

(2)

and Lef f is the relevant effective Lagrangian. 1/mQ is the expansion parameter, and the
non-local operator T̂ is expanded as a sum of local operators and the corresponding Wilson
coefficients include terms with increasing powers of 1/mQ . Definitely, the lowest dimensional term dominates in the limit mQ → ∞ and it is the dimension-three operator c̄c.
The total width of a charmed hadron Hc is determined by ImhHc |T̂ |Hc i[10] with a proper
normalization[11].
Γ(Hc → f ) =

where the coefficients ci (f ) depend on the masses of the internal quarks in the loop. The
coefficient c3 (f ) has been calculated to one-loop order[12, 13, 14] whereas the coefficient
c5 (f ) is evaluated at the tree level[15, 16]. VCKM is the Cabibbo-Kabayashi-Maskawa mixing
matrix elements and Gμυ is the gluonic field strength tensor. Since the third term involves
light quarks, it can be different for charmed hadrons with various light flavors. Thus, the
difference appears at the 1/m3c order and in the hadronic matrix elements of four-quark
operators. The contributions at orders higher than 1/m3c are neglected.
To the lowest order, the main contribution comes from the heavy quark(charm quark)
decays, while the light flavors are treated as spectators. The contributions are due to the
semileptonic and the nonleptonic decays as follows:
Γ(c → s) =

Γc→sl̄υ +

l=e,μ

Γc→sq̄q′

The semileptonic and nonleptonic decay rates of the c quark up to order 1/m2c has been
evaluated by many authors[17], and here we would directly use their results.

Non-spectator Contributions to Inclusive Decays of Ξ+

The total width of hadrons which involve at least one charm quark c can be decomposed
into two parts
Γ(HQ → f ) = Γspectator + Γnonspectator .

For the spectator scenario, the contribution to the total width of the (ccd)-baryon ground

quarks with the s−quark in Ω+

THE HADRONIC MATRIX ELEMENTS

Because the hadronic matrix elements are fully determined by the non-perturbative
QCD effects which cannot be reliably evaluated at present yet, we need to invoke concrete
phenomenological models to carry out the computations. In this work, we adopt a simple
non-relativistic model, i.e. the harmonic oscillator[20]. This model has been widely employed in similar researches[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In fact, an advantage of the calculations
of the lifetimes of heavy hadrons is that one does not need to deal with the hadronization
process of lighter products (quarks or even gluons) and the heavy hadrons can be well
described by such simple non-relativistic models, and the results are relatively reliable than

the doubly charmed baryons, because aρ reflects the coupling between two charm quarks,
we set it to be the same as that for J/ψ. aλ reflects the coupling of the light quark with
these two charm quark, thus we can reasonably set it to be the same as aρ in D-mesons.
With these parameters as input, the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons can be
evaluated out (see TABLE.I), if the non-spectator effects are taken into account.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of doubly charmed baryons with the non-spectator
effects being properly taken into account. As argued in the introduction, to evaluate the
lifetimes (the total widths), only the inclusive processes are concerned, and then the nonperturbative effects are all from the wavefunctions of the doubly charmed baryons. Due
to existence of the two heavy charm quarks, the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model
should apply in this case. Mainly, we carefully calculate the contribution of non-perturbative
effects to the lifetimes in the model, which are closely related to the bound states of the
baryons.
Our numerical results indicate that the non-spectator contributions to the lifetimes of

++

+
Ξ+
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc are substantial. The non-spectator contributions to the width of Ξcc are

mainly from the WE diagrams (the PI diagrams which contribute are CKM suppressed),
since the WE contribution is constructive, therefore the lifetime of Ξ+
cc is much suppressed.
By contraries, for Ξ++
and Ω+
c
cc , the non-spectator contributions are mainly from the PI
diagrams and the net effect is destructive. It is noted that for Ω+
cc there still are Cabibbosuppressed WE diagrams, but for Ξ++
cc there are only PI diagrams. Therefore the predicted
lifetime of Ξ++
cc is larger than that of other two baryons. We also employ other values for
parameters aρ , aλ and find that the resultant values can vary within 20% uncertainty.
Our results are
++
τ (Ξ+
cc ) = 0.25 ps τ (Ξcc ) = 0.67 ps

and

τ (Ω+
cc ) = 0.21 ps.

These are generally consistent with the results obtained by Kiselev et al.[7] and Guberina
et al.[8], even though they used different models for calculating the hadronic matrix elements.
Concretely, they used the diquark picture and attributed the non-perturbative effects into
the wavefunction of the diaquark at origin. Kiselev et al. gave τ (Ξ+
cc ) ∼ 0.16 − 0.22 ps
+
τ (Ξ++
cc ) ∼ 0.40 − 0.65 ps and τ (Ωcc ) ∼ 0.24 − 0.28.

Although all the theoretical predictions based on different models agree with each other,
they are obviously one order larger than the upper limit of the measured value on the
lifetime of Ξ+
cc (0.033 ps) by the SELEX collaboration[6]. This deviation, as suggested by
some authors, may come from experiments[28]. So far the difference between theoretical
predictions and experimental data may imply some unknown physics mechanisms which
drastically change the value, if the future experiment, say at LHCb, confirms the measurement of the SELEX. Recently, several groups have studied the possibility of doubly heavy
baryon production at hadron collider LHC and future linear collider ILC[29, 30] and the
effective field theories for two heavy quarks system are also further investigated[31]. We are
expecting the new data from more accurate experiments at LHC and ILC to improve our
theoretical framework and determine if there are contributions from new physics beyond
the standard model.
