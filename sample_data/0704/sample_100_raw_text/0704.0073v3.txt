A TRANSCENDENTAL APPROACH TO KOLLÁR'S
INJECTIVITY THEOREM
OSAMU FUJINO
Abstract. We treat Kollár's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give
a curvature condition which implies Kollár type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is formulated for a compact
Kähler manifold, but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms
on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete Kähler metric. We
need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral sequence.

1. Introduction
In [Ko1], János Kollár proved the following theorem. We call it
Kollár's original injectivity theorem in this paper.
Theorem 1.1 (cf. [Ko1, Theorem 2.2]). Let X be a smooth projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic
zero and let L be a semi-ample line bundle on X. Let s be a nonzero
holomorphic section of L⊗k for some k > 0. Then
×s : H q (X, KX ⊗ L⊗m ) → H q (X, KX ⊗ L⊗m+k )

is injective for every q ≥ 0 and every m ≥ 1, where KX is the canonical
line bundle of X. Note that ×s is the homomorphism induced by the
tensor product with s.
The following theorem is the main result of this paper. It is an
analytic formulation of Kollár type cohomology injectivity theorem.
Theorem 1.2 (Main Theorem). Let X be an n-dimensional compact
Kähler manifold. Let (E, hE ) (resp. (L, hL )) be a holomorphic vector
(resp. line) bundle on X with a smooth hermitian metric hE (resp. hL ).
Let F be a holomorphic line bundle on X with a singular hermitian
metric hF . Assume the following conditions.
(i) There exists a subvariety Z of X such that hF is smooth on
X \ Z.
√
(ii) −1Θ(F ) ≥ −γ in the sense of currents, where γ is a smooth
(1, 1)-form on X.
√
(iii) √−1(Θ(E) + IdE ⊗ Θ(F )) ≥Nak 0 on X \ Z.
(iv) −1(Θ(E) + IdE ⊗ Θ(F ) − εIdE ⊗ Θ(L)) ≥Nak 0 on X \ Z for
some positive constant ε.
Here, ≥Nak 0 means the Nakano semi-positivity. Let s be a nonzero
holomorphic section of L. Then the multiplication homomorphism
×s : H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J (hF )) → H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J (hF ) ⊗ L)
is injective for every q ≥ 0, where J (hF ) is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the singular hermitian metric hF of F .
The formulation of Theorem 1.2 was inspired by Ohsawa's injectivity
theorem (see [O2]). Although the assumptions in Theorem 1.2 may
look artificial for algebraic geometers, our main theorem is useful and
have potentiality for various generalizations. As a direct consequence
of Theorem 1.2, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1.3. Let X be an n-dimensional compact Kähler manifold.
Let (E, hE ) (resp. (L, hL )) be a holomorphic vector (resp. line) bundle on X with a smooth hermitian metric hE (resp. hL ). Let F be a
holomorphic line bundle on X. Assume the following conditions.
(a) There exists an effective Cartier divisor D on X such that
⊗k
O
√X (D) ≃ F for some positive integer k.
(b) √−1Θ(E) ≥Nak 0.
(c) −1(Θ(E) − εIdE ⊗ Θ(L)) ≥Nak 0 for some positive constant
ε.

KOLLÁR'S INJECTIVITY THEOREM

3

Let s be a nonzero holomorphic section of L. Then the multiplication
homomorphism
×s : H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J ) → H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J ⊗ L)

is injective for every q ≥ 0, where J = J ( k1 D) is the multiplier ideal
sheaf associated to k1 D (cf. Definition 2.8).
One of the advantages of our formulation is that we are released from
sophisticated algebraic geometric methods such as desingularizations,
covering tricks, Leray's spectral sequence, and so on both in the proof
and in various applications (see, for example, the proof of Proposition
4.1). The main ingredient of our proof of Theorem 1.2 is Nakano's
identity (see Proposition 2.16).
We note that there are many contributors (Kollár, Esnault–Viehweg,
Kawamata, Ambro, ...) to this kind of cohomology injectivity theorem. We just mention that the first result was obtained by Tankeev
[Tn, Proposition 1]. It inspired Kollár to obtain his famous injectivity
theorem (see [Ko1] or Theorem 1.1). After [Ko1], many generalizations
of Theorem 1.1 were obtained (see the books [EV] and [Ko2]). Kollár
did not refer to [E] in [Ko2]. However, we think that [E] is the first
paper where Kollár's injectivity theorem is proved (and generalized) by
differential geometric arguments.
Let us recall Enoki's theorem [E, Theorem 0.2], which is a very
special case of Theorem 1.2, for the reader's convenience. To recover
Corollary 1.4 from Theorem 1.2, it is sufficient to put E = OX , F =
L⊗m , and L = L⊗k . The reader who reads Japanese can find [F2]
useful. It is a survey on Enoki's injectivity theorem.
Corollary 1.4 (Enoki). Let X be an n-dimensional compact Kähler
manifold and let L be a semi-positive holomorphic line bundle on X.
Suppose L⊗k , k > 0, admits a nonzero global holomorphic section s.
Then
×s : H q (X, KX ⊗ L⊗m ) → H q (X, KX ⊗ L⊗m+k )
is injective for every m > 0 and every q ≥ 0.
We recall Enoki's idea of the proof in [E] because we will use the
same idea to prove Theorem 1.2.
1.5 (Enoki's proof). From now on, we assume that k = m = 1 for
simplicity. It is well known that the cohomology group H q (X, KX ⊗
L⊗l ) is represented by the space of harmonic forms Hn,q (L⊗l ) = {u :
 ̄ = 0, D ′′∗⊗l u = 0},
smooth L⊗l -valued (n, q)-form on X such that ∂u
L
 ̄ We take u ∈ Hn,q (L). Then,
where DL′′∗⊗l is the formal adjoint of ∂.
 ̄
∂(su)
= 0 because s is holomorphic. We can check that DL′′∗⊗2 (su) = 0

4

OSAMU FUJINO

by using Nakano's identity and the semi-positivity of L. Thus, s induces ×s : Hn,q (L) → Hn,q (L⊗2 ). Therefore, the required injectivity is
obvious.
Enoki's theorem contains Kollár's original injectivity theorem (cf. Theorem 1.1) by the following well-known lemma.
Lemma 1.6. Let L be a semi-ample line bundle on a smooth projective
manifold X. Then L is semi-positive.
Proof. There exists a morphism f = Φ|L⊗m | : X → PN induced by the
complete linear system |L⊗m | for some m > 0 because L is semi-ample.
Let h be a smooth hermitian metric on OPN (1) with positive definite
1
curvature. Then (f ∗ h) m is a smooth hermitian metric on L whose
curvature is semi-positive.

Remark 1.7. Let X be a complex analytic space and let E be a coherent sheaf on X. In order to prove H p (X, E) = 0, it is sufficient
to construct a homomorphism φ : E → F of coherent sheaves on X
such that the induced map H p (X, E) → H p (X, F ) is injective and that
H p (X, F ) = 0. This simple observation plays crucial roles for various
vanishing theorems on toric varieties (see, for example, [F3] and [F4]).
Anyway, injectivity theorems sometimes are very useful in proving various vanishing theorems. See the proof of Corollary 4.7 below.
We quickly review Kollár's proof of his injectivity theorem in [Ko2],
which is much simpler than Kollár's original proof in [Ko1], for the
reader's convenience.
1.8 (Kollár's proof). Let X be a smooth projective n-fold and let L
be a (not necessarily semi-ample) line bundle on X. Let s be a nonzero holomorphic section of L⊗2 . Assume that D = (s = 0) is a
smooth divisor on X for simplicity. We can take a double cover π :
Z → X ramifying along D. By the Hodge decomposition, we obtain
a surjection H q (Z, CZ ) → H q (X, OZ ) for every q. By taking the antiinvariant part of the covering involution, we obtain that H q (X, G) →
H q (X, L−1 ) is surjective for every q, where π∗ CZ = CX ⊕ G is the
eigen-sheaf decomposition. It is not difficult to see that there exists
a factorization H q (X, G) → H q (X, L−1 ⊗ OX (−D)) → H q (X, L−1 )
for every q. Therefore, ×s : H q (X, KX ⊗ L) → H q (X, KX ⊗ L ⊗
OX (D)) is injective by the Serre duality. In general, D is not necessarily
smooth. So, we have to use sophisticated algebraic geometric methods
such as desingularizations, relative vanishing theorems, Leray's spectral
sequences, and so on, even when X is smooth and L is free.

Remark 1.9. As we saw in 1.8, thanks to the Serre duality, the injectivity of H q (X, KX ⊗ L) → H q (X, KX ⊗ L ⊗ OX (D)) is equivalent to
the surjectivity of H n−q (X, L−1 ⊗ OX (−D)) → H n−q (X, L−1 ). However, injectivity seems to be much better and more natural for some
applications and generalizations. See Section 4.
Roughly speaking, Kollár's geometric proof in [Ko2] (and Esnault–
Viehweg's proof in [EV]) depends on the Hodge decomposition, or the
degeneration of the Hodge to de Rham type spectral sequence. So,
it works only when E is a unitary flat vector bundle (see [Ko2, 9.17
Remark]). On the other hand, our analytic proof (and the proofs in [E],
[O2], and [Tk]) relies on the harmonic representation of the cohomology
groups. We do not know the true relationship between the geometric
proof and the analytic one.
1.10 (More advanced topics). In [F1], we prove a relative version of
Theorem 1.2. In that case, X is not necessarily compact. When X is
not compact, a locally square integrable differential form u on X is not
necessarily globally square integrable. So, we use Ohsawa–Takegoshi's
twisted version of Nakano's identity to control the asymptotic behavior
of the L2 -norm of u around the boundary of X. Thus, we need much
more analytic methods for the relative setting.
In [F12, Chapter 2], [F5], and [F11, Sections 5 and 6], we develop the
geometric approach (see 1.8) to obtain a very important generalization
of Kollár's injectivity theorem. In those papers, we consider mixed
Hodge structures on compact support cohomology groups. Roughly
speaking, the decomposition
M
Hcn (X \ Σ, C) ≃
H q (X, ΩpX (log Σ) ⊗ OX (−Σ))
p+q=n

where X is a smooth projective variety and Σ is a simple normal crossing divisor on X produces a generalization of Kollár type cohomology
injectivity theorem. The reader can find a thorough treatment of our
geometric approach in [F12, Chapter 2]. We have already obtained
many applications for the log minimal model program in [F10], [F12],
[F6], [F7], [F8], [FST], [F9], [F11], and [F13].
By our experience, we know that Kollár type injectivity theorems
play crucial roles for the study of base point free theorems and the
abundance conjecture for log canonical pairs (cf. [Fk], [F14], and so
on).
We summarize the contents of this paper. In Section 2, we fix notation and collect basic results. Section 3 is the proof of the main
theorem: Theorem 1.2. We will represent the cohomology groups by

the spaces of harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable
 ̄
complete Kähler metric. We will use L2 -estimates for ∂-equations
on
complete Kähler manifolds (see Lemma 3.2). It is a key point of our
proof. In Section 4, we treat Kollár type injectivity theorem, Esnault–
Viehweg type injectivity theorem, and Kawamata–Viehweg–Nadel type
vanishing theorem as applications of Theorem 1.2. We recommend the
reader to compare them with usual algebraic geometric ones. We note
that we discuss them in a more general relative setting in [F1].

2. Preliminaries
In this section, we collect basic definitions and results in algebraic
and analytic geometries. For details, see, for example, [D4].
2.1 (Singular hermitian metric). Let L be a holomorphic line bundle
on a complex manifold X.
Definition 2.2 (Singular hermitian metric). A singular hermitian metric on L is a metric which is given in every trivialization θ : L|Ω ≃ Ω×C
by
kξk = |θ(ξ)|e−φ(x) , x ∈ Ω, ξ ∈ Lx ,
where φ ∈ L1loc (Ω) is an arbitrary function, called the weight of the
metric with respect to the trivialization θ. Here, L1loc (Ω) is the space
of the locally integrable functions on Ω.
The following singular hermitian metrics play important roles in the
study of higher dimensional algebraic varieties.
P
Example 2.3. Let D = αj Dj be a divisor with coefficients αj ∈ N.
Then OX (D) is equipped with a natural singular hermitian metric as
follows. Let f be a local section of OX (D), viewed as a meromorphic
function such that div(f ) + D ≥ 0. We define kf k2 = |f |2 ∈ [0, ∞]. If
gj is a generator of the ideal of Dj on an P
open set Ω ⊂ X, then the
weight corresponding to this metric is φ = j αj log |gj |. It is obvious

KOLLÁR'S INJECTIVITY THEOREM

that this metric is a smooth hermitian metric on X \D and its curvature
is zero on X \ D. Let L be a holomorphic line bundle on X. Assume
that L⊗k ≃ M ⊗ OX (D) for some holomorphic line bundle M and an
effective divisor D on X. As above, OX (D) is equipped with a natural
singular hermitian metric hD . Let hM be any smooth hermitian metric
1

k
hDk . Note that
on M. Then L has a singular hermitian metric hL := hM
hL is smooth outside D and ΘhL (L) = k1 ΘhM (M) on X \ D.
2.4 (Multiplier ideal sheaf). The notion of multiplier ideal sheaves
introduced by Nadel [Nd] is very important in recent developments of
complex and algebraic geometries (cf. [L, Part Three]).
Definition 2.5 ((Quasi-)plurisubharmonic function and multiplier ideal
sheaf). A function u : Ω → [−∞, ∞) defined on an open set Ω ⊂ Cn
is called plurisubharmonic (psh, for short) if
1. u is upper semi-continuous, and
2. for every complex line L ⊂ Cn , u|Ω∩L is subharmonic on Ω ∩ L,
that is, for every a ∈ Ω and ξ ∈ Cn satisfying |ξ| < d(a, Ωc ),
the function u satisfies the mean inequality
Z 2π
1
u(a) ≤
u(a + eiθ ξ)dθ.
2π 0
Let X be an n-dimensional complex manifold. A function φ : X →
[−∞, ∞) is said to be
S plurisubharmonic (psh, for short) if there exists
an open cover X = i∈I Ui such that φ|Ui is plurisubharmonic on Ui
(⊂ Cn ) for every i. A smooth strictly plurisubharmonic
function ψ on
√
 ̄ is a positive definite
X is a smooth function on X such that −1∂ ∂ψ
smooth (1, 1)-form. A quasi-plurisubharmonic (quasi-psh, for short)
function is a function φ which is locally equal to the sum of a psh
function and of a smooth function. If φ is a quasi-psh function on a
complex manifold X, the multiplier ideal sheaf J (φ) ⊂ OX is defined
by
Γ(U, J (φ)) = {f ∈ OX (U); |f |2e−2φ ∈ L1loc (U)}
for every open set U ⊂ X. Then it is known that J (φ) is a coherent
ideal sheaf of OX . See, for example, [D4, (5.7) Proposition].

Remark 2.6. By the assumption (ii) in Theorem 1.2, the weight of
the singular hermitian metric hF is a quasi-psh function on every trivialization. So, we can define multiplier ideal sheaves locally and check
that they are independent of trivializations. Thus, we can define the
multiplier ideal sheaf globally and denote it by J (hF ), which is an
abuse of notation. It is a coherent ideal sheaf on X.

Example 2.7. Let X = { z ∈ C | |z| < r} for some 0 < r < 1 and
let L be a trivial line
p bundle on X. We consider a singular hermitian
metric hL = exp( − log |z|2 ) of L. Thenp
hL is smooth outside the
1
origin 0 ∈ X. The weight of hL is φ = − 2 − log |z|2 and φ is a psh
function on X. The Lelong number of φ at 0 is
lim inf
z→0

φ(z)
= 0.
log |z|

Thus, we have J (hL ) ≃ OX by Skoda. Note that φ is smooth outside
0, which is an analytic subvariety of X. However, φ does not have
analytic singularities around 0.
P
Definition 2.8. Let X be a complex manifold and let D = αj Dj be
an effective Q-divisor on X. Let gj be a generator of the ideal
P of Dj on
an open set Ω ⊂ X. We put J (D) := J (φ), where φ = j αj log |gj |.
Since J (φ) is independent of the choice of the generators gj 's, J (D) is
a well-defined coherent ideal sheaf on X. We call J (D) the multiplier
ideal sheaf associated to the effective Q-divisor D. We say
the
Q that
−2αj
divisor D is integrable at a point x0 ∈ X if the function |gj |
is
integrable on a neighborhood of x0 , equivalently, J (D)x0 = OX,x0 . Let
D ′ be another effective Q-divisor on X. Then, J (D) = J (D + εD ′)
for 0 < ε ≪ 1, ε ∈ Q.
Remark 2.9. In Definition 2.8, D is integrable at x0 if and only if the
pair (X, D) is Kawamata log terminal (klt, for short) in a neighborhood
of x0 (cf. [KM, Definition 2.34]).
Example 2.10. Let hL be the singular hermitian metric defined in
Example 2.3. Then the weight of the singular hermitian metric hL is
a quasi-psh function on every trivialization. Therefore, the multiplier
ideal sheaf J (hL ) is well-defined and J (hL ) = J ( k1 D).
2.11 (Hermitian and Kähler geometries). We collect the basic notion
and results of hermitian and Kähler geometries (see also [D4]).
Definition 2.12 (Chern connection and its curvature form). Let X
be a complex hermitian manifold and let (E, h) be a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle on X. Then there exists the Chern connection
D = D(E,h) , which can be split in a unique way as a sum of a (1, 0)
′
′′
and of a (0, 1)-connection, D = D(E,h)
+ D(E,h)
. By the definition of
′′
′′
 ̄
the Chern connection, D = D(E,h) = ∂. We obtain the curvature form
2
Θ(E) = Θ(E,h) = Θh := D(E,h)
. The subscripts might be suppressed if
there is no danger of confusion.

Let U be a small open set of X and let (eλ ) be a local holomorphic
frame of E|U . Then the hermitian metric h is given by the hermitian
matrix H = (hλμ ), hλμ = h(eλ , eμ ), on U. We have h(u, v) = t uH v̄
on
P U for smooth sections
P u, v of E|U .PThis implies that h(u, v) =

Definition 2.13 (Inner product). Let X be an n-dimensional complex
manifold with the hermitian metric g. We denote by ω the fundamental
form of g. Let (E, h) be a hermitian vector bundle on X, and u, v are
E-valued (p, q)-forms with measurable coefficients, we set

where |u| is the pointwise norm induced by g and h on Λp,q TX∗ ⊗ E, and
dVω = n!1 ω n . More explicitly, hu, vidVω = t u∧H∗v, where ∗ is the Hodge
star operator relative to ω and H is the (local) matrix representation
of h. When we need to emphasize the metrics, we write |u|g,h, and so
on.
p.q
Let Lp,q
(2) (X, E)(= L(2) (X, (E, h))) be the space of square integrable
E-valued (p, q)-forms on X. The inner product was defined in Definition 2.13. When we emphasize the metrics, we write Lp,q
(2) (X, E)g,h ,
where g (resp. h) is the hermitian metric of X (resp. E). As usual
one can view D ′ and D ′′ as closed and densely defined operators on
′∗
′′ ∗
the Hilbert space Lp,q
also have
(2) (X, E). The formal adjoints D , D
closed extensions in the sense of distributions, which do not necessarily
coincide with the Hilbert space adjoints in the sense of Von Neumann,
since the latter ones may have strictly smaller domains. It is well
known, however, that the domains coincide if the hermitian metric of
X is complete. See Lemma 2.17 below.

Definition 2.14 (Nakano positivity and semi-positivity). Let (E, h) be
a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold X with a smooth
hermitian metric h. Let Ξ be a Hom(E, E)-valued (1, 1)-form such that
t t
( Ξh) = t Ξh. Then Ξ is said to be Nakano positive (resp. Nakano semipositive) if the hermitian form on TX ⊗ E associated to t Ξh is positive
definite (resp. semi-definite). We write Ξ >Nak 0 (resp. ≥Nak 0). We
note that Ξ1 >Nak Ξ2 (resp. Ξ1 ≥Nak Ξ2 ) means that Ξ1 − Ξ2 >Nak 0
(resp. ≥Nak 0). A holomorphic vector bundle
√ (E, h) is said to be Nakano
positive (resp. Nakano semi-positive) if −1Θ(E) >Nak 0 (resp. ≥Nak
0). We usually omit "Nakano"when E is a line bundle.

Definition 2.15 (Graded Lie bracket). Let C ∞ (X, Λp,q TX∗ ⊗ E) be the
space of the smooth E-valued (p, q)-forms on X. If A, B are the endomorphisms of pure degree of the graded module M • = C ∞ (X, Λ•,• TX∗ ⊗
E), their graded Lie bracket is defined by
[A, B] = AB − (−1)deg A deg B BA.
Let us recall Nakano's identity, which is one of the main ingredients
of the proof of our main theorem: Theorem 1.2.
Proposition 2.16 (Nakano's identity). We further assume that g is
Kähler. Let
∆′ = D ′ D ′∗ + D ′∗ D ′
and
∆′′ = D ′′ D ′′∗ + D ′′∗ D ′′
be the complex Laplace operators acting on E-valued forms. Then
√
∆′′ = ∆′ + [ −1Θ(E), Λ],

where Λ is the adjoint of ω ∧ * .

The following lemma is now classical. See, for example, [D1, Lemme
4.3].
Lemma 2.17 (Density lemma). If g is complete, then C0p,q (X, E) is
dense in DomD ′′∗ ∩ Dom∂ ̄ with respect to the graph norm
 ̄ + kD ′′∗ uk,
u 7→ kuk + k∂uk

where C0p,q (X, E) is the space of the E-valued smooth (p, q)-forms on
 ̄ is the domain of
X with compact supports and DomD ′′∗ (resp. Dom∂)
′′∗
 ̄
D (resp. ∂).
Combining Proposition 2.16 with Lemma 2.17, we obtain the following formula.

Proposition 2.18. Let u be a square integrable E-valued (n, q)-form on
X with dim X = n and let g be a complete Kähler
metric on X. Let ω
√
be the fundamental form of g. Assume that −1Θ(E) ≥Nak −cIdE ⊗ ω
for some constant c. Then we obtain that

 ̄ 2 = kD ′ ∗ uk2 + hh −1Θ(E)Λu, uii

for every u ∈ DomD ′′∗ ∩ Dom∂.

The final remark in this section will play crucial roles in the proof
of the main theorem: Theorem 1.2. The proof is an easy calculation
(cf. [D1, Lemme 3.3]).

KOLLÁR'S INJECTIVITY THEOREM

Remark 2.19. Let g ′ be another hermitian metric on X such that
g ′ ≥ g and ω ′ be the fundamental form of g ′. Let u be an E-valued
(n, q)-form with measurable coefficients. Then, we have |u|2g′,h dVω′ ≤
|u|2g,hdVω , where |u|g′ ,h (resp. |u|g,h) is the pointwise norm induced by g ′
and h (resp. g and h). If u is an E-valued (n, 0)-form, then |u|2g′,h dVω′ =
|u|2g,hdVω . In particular, kuk2 is independent of g when u is an (n, 0)form.

3. Proof of the main theorem
In this section, we prove the main theorem: Theorem 1.2. The idea
is very simple. We represent the cohomology groups by the space of
harmonic forms on X \ Z (not on X!). The manifold X \ Z is not
compact. However, it is a complete Kähler manifold and all hermitian
metrics are smooth on X \Z. So, there are no difficulties on X \Z. Note
that we do not need the difficult regularization technique for quasi-psh
functions on Kähler manifolds (cf. [D1, Théorème 9.1]).
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Since X is compact, there exists a complete
Kähler metric g ′ on Y := X \ Z such that g ′ > g on Y . We sketch the
construction of g ′ because we need some special properties of g ′ in the
following proof. The next lemma is well known. See, for example, [D2,
Lemma 5].
Lemma 3.1. There exists a quasi-psh function ψ on X such that ψ =
−∞ on Z with logarithmic poles along Z and ψ is smooth outside Z.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that ψ < −e on X. We
1
put φ = log(−ψ)
. Then φ is a quasi-psh function on X and φ < 1.
√
 ̄ + αω > 0
Thus, we can take a positive constant α such that −1∂ ∂φ

 ̄ + αω). We will show that
ω ′ = ω + ( −1∂ ∂φ

ω ′ ≥ ∂(log(log(−ψ))) ∧ ∂(log(log(−ψ)))
if we choose α ≫ 0. We have

Proof of Claim. First, let X = i∈I Ui be a finite Stein cover of X such
that each Ui is small. We can assume that there is a small Stein open
set Vi of X such that Ui ⋐ Vi for every i (see the proof of Lemma 3.2).
We denote this cover by U = {Ui }i∈I . By Cartan and Leray, we obtain
H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J (hF )) ≃ Ȟ q (U, KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J (hF )),

where the right hand side is the Čech cohomology group calculated
by U. Let {ρi }i∈I be a partition of unity associated to U. We put
Ui0 i1 ***iq = Ui0 ∩ * * * ∩ Uiq . Then Ui0 i1 ***iq is Stein. Let u = {ui0 i1 ***iq } such
that ui0 i1 ***iq ∈ Γ(Ui0 i1 ***iq , KX ⊗ E ⊗ F ⊗ J (hF )) and δu = 0, where δ is

dimensional, separated, Fréchet space (cf. [GR, Chap. VIII, Sec. A,

Let U ⋐ V be small Stein open sets of X. Then there exists a
smooth strictly psh function Φ on V such that (L, hL e−Φ ) is semipositive on V . In this situation, C1′ ≤ e−Φ ≤ C2′ on U for some positive
constants C1′ and C2′ . By applying the same argument as in Lemma

Proof of Corollary 1.3. We put hF := hDk as in Example 2.3, where hD
is the natural
√ singular hermitian metric on OX (D). Then hF is smooth
on X \D, −1Θ(F ) ≥ 0 in the sense of currents, and J (hF ) = J ( k1 D).
Therefore, we can apply Theorem 1.2.

4. Applications: injectivity and vanishing theorems
In this section, we treat only a few applications of Theorem 1.2. We
recommend the reader to see the results in [Tk] and the arguments in
[Nk, Chapter V, §3] for other formulations and generalizations. See
also [F1] for various applications and generalizations in a more general
relative setting. For applications in the log minimal model program,

which can not be covered by the results in this paper, see [F9], [F11],
[F12], and so on.
The following formulation is due to Kollár (cf. [Ko2, 10.13 Theorem]).
He stated this result for the case where E is a trivial line bundle and
(X, ∆) is klt, that is, J (∆) ≃ OX .
Proposition 4.1 (Kollár type injectivity theorem). Let f : X → Y be
a proper surjective morphism from a compact Kähler manifold X to a
normal projective variety Y . Let L be a holomorphic line bundle on X
and let D be an effective divisor on X such that f (D) 6= Y . Assume
that L ≡ f ∗ M + ∆, where M is a nef and big Q-divisor on Y and ∆
is an effective Q-divisor on X. Let (E, hE ) be a Nakano semi-positive
holomorphic vector bundle on X. Then
H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J (∆)) → H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ OX (D) ⊗ J (∆))
is injective for every q ≥ 0, where J (∆) is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the effective Q-divisor ∆.
Proof. By taking P ∈ Pic0 (X) suitably, we have L ⊗ P ∼Q f ∗ M + ∆.
We can assume that L ∼Q f ∗ M + ∆ by replacing L (resp. E) with
L ⊗ P (resp. E ⊗ P −1 ). By Kodaira's lemma (see [KM, Proposition
2.61]), we can further assume that M is ample (cf. Definition 2.8). Let
h := Φ|mM | : Y → PN be the embedding induced by the complete linear
system |mM| for a large integer m. Then OY (mM) ≃ h∗ OPN (1). We
can take an effective divisor A on PN such that OPN (A) ≃ OPN (l) for
some positive integer l and D ′ = f ∗ h∗ A−D is an effective divisor on X.
We add D ′ to D and can assume that D = f ∗ h∗ A. Under these extra
assumptions, we can easily construct hermitian metrics satisfying the
assumptions in Theorem 1.2 (see Example 2.3). We finish the proof of
the proposition.

Remark 4.2 (Numerical equivalence). In the above proposition, we
note that L ≡ f ∗ M + ∆ means c1 (L) = c1 (f ∗ M + ∆) in H 2 (X, R),
where c1 is the first Chern class of Q-divisors or line bundles.
Remark 4.3. Proposition 4.1 is a generalization of [Ko2, 10.13 Theorem], which is stated for a compact Kähler manifold. However, the
proof of [Ko2, 10.13 Theorem] given in [Ko2] works only for projective
manifolds. In [Ko2, 10.17.3 Claim], we need an ample divisor on X to
prove local vanishing theorems.
The following proposition is a reformulation of [EV, 5.12. Corollary
b)] from the analytic viewpoint. It is essentially the same as Proposition 4.1. In [EV], E is trivial and J ≃ OX .

18

OSAMU FUJINO

Proposition 4.4 (Esnault–Viehweg type injectivity theorem). Let X
be a smooth projective variety and let D be an effective divisor on X.
Let (E, hE ) be a Nakano semi-positive holomorphic vector bundle and
let L be a holomorphic line bundle on X. Assume that L⊗k (−D) is nef
and abundant, that is, κ(L⊗k (−D)) = ν(L⊗k (−D)), for some positive
integer k. Let B be an effective divisor on X such that
H 0 (X, (L⊗k (−D))⊗l ⊗ OX (−B)) 6= 0
for some l > 0. Then
H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J ) → H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J ⊗ OX (B))

is injective for every q, where J := J ( k1 D) is the multiplier ideal sheaf
associated to the effective Q-divisor k1 D.
Proof. Let π : Z → X be a projective birational morphism from a
smooth projective variety Z with the following properties: (i) There
exists a proper surjective morphism between smooth projective varieties f : Z → Y with connected fibers, and (ii) there is a nef and big
Q-divisor M on Y such that π ∗ (L⊗k (−D)) ∼Q f ∗ M. For the proof, see
[Ka, Proposition 2.1]. On the other hand, Ri π∗ (KZ/X ⊗ J ( k1 π ∗ D)) = 0
for i > 0 and π∗ (KZ ⊗ J ( k1 π ∗ D)) ≃ KX ⊗ J ( k1 D) by [L, Theorem
9.2.33, and Example 9.6.4]. We note that (π ∗ E, π ∗ hE ) is Nakano semipositive on Z. So, we can assume that X = Z without loss of generality. It is not difficult to see that f (B) 6= Y by the assumption
that H 0 (X, (L⊗k (−D))⊗l ⊗ OX (−B)) 6= 0 for some l > 0. Thus, this
proposition follows from Proposition 4.1.

The referee pointed out that Proposition 4.4 is sharper than [EP,
Theorem 3.1].
Remark 4.5. In this remark, we use the notation in [EP, Theorem
3.1]. Let k be a positive integer such that k > λ. We take general
members D1 , * * * , Dk of H 0 (X, A ⊗ a) and put

λ
(D1 + * * * + Dk ).
k
Then L−D is nef and abundant and L−D −ǫB is Q-effective for some
0 < ǫ < 1. By the construction, we have J (D) = J (X, aλ ) (cf. [L,
Proposition 9.2.28]). Therefore, by Proposition 4.4 for E = OX , we
obtain that
D=

H i (X, OX (KX +L)⊗J (X, aλ )) → H i (X, OX (KX +L+B)⊗J (X, aλ ))
is injective for every i.

KOLLÁR'S INJECTIVITY THEOREM

19

Remark 4.6 (Vanishing theorem and torsion-freeness). Proposition
4.1 gives some generalizations of Kollár's vanishing and torsion-free
theorems. We do not pursue them here because we discuss them in a
more general relative setting in [F1]. We just mention that [Ko2, 10.15
Corollary] holds for KX ⊗ E ⊗ J (∆), where we use the same notation
as in Proposition 4.1. We note [L, Example 9.5.9] when we restrict the
multiplier ideal sheaf J (∆) to a general hypersurface. Related topics
are in [EV, 6.12 Corollary, and 6.17 Corollary] and [EP, Section 3].
By combining Proposition 4.1 with Serre's vanishing theorem, we
obtain the next corollary. It may be better to be called Nadel type
vanishing theorem.
Corollary 4.7 (Kawamata–Viehweg type vanishing theorem). Let X
be a smooth projective variety and let L be a holomorphic line bundle
on X. Assume that L ≡ M + ∆, where M is a nef and big Q-divisor
on X and ∆ is an effective Q-divisor on X. Let (E, hE ) be a Nakano
semi-positive holomorphic vector bundle on X. Then H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗
L ⊗ J (∆)) = 0 for q ≥ 1. Moreover, if ∆ is integrable outside finitely
many points, then H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L) = 0 for q ≥ 1.
Proof. We use Proposition 4.1 under the assumption that Y = X and
f = idX . We take an effective ample divisor D on X and apply Proposition 4.1. Then we obtain that
H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J (∆)) → H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J (∆) ⊗ OX (mD))

is injective for m > 0 and q ≥ 0. By Serre's vanishing theorem, we
have H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ J (∆)) = 0 for q ≥ 1. When ∆ is integrable
outside finitely many points, OX /J (∆) is a skyscraper sheaf. Therefore, H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ OX /J (∆)) = 0 for q ≥ 1. By combining
it with the above mentioned vanishing result, we obtain the desired
result.

The final result is a slight generalization of Demailly's formulation
of Kawamata–Viehweg type vanishing theorem.

Corollary 4.8 (cf. [D3, Main Theorem]). Let L be a holomorphic line
bundle on an n-dimensional projective manifold X. Assume that some
positive power L⊗k can be written L⊗k ≃ M ⊗ OX (D), where M is
a nef line bundle and D is an effective divisor such that k1 D is integrable on X \ B. Let ν = ν(M) be the numerical dimension of
the nef line bundle M. Let (E, hE ) be a Nakano semi-positive holomorphic vector bundle on X. Then H q (X, KX ⊗ E ⊗ L) = 0 for
q > n − min{max{ν, κ(L)}, codimB}.

20

OSAMU FUJINO

Sketch of the proof. By the standard slicing arguments, we can reduce
it to the case where min{max{ν, κ(L)}, codimB} = dim X. We note
that codimB = ∞ if and only if B = ∅. By Kodaira's lemma (cf. [KM,
Lemma 2.60, Proposition 2.61]), we can further reduce it to the case
when M is ample. We note that if A is a general smooth very ample
Cartier divisor on X then
0 → KX ⊗ E ⊗ L → KX ⊗ E ⊗ L ⊗ OX (A) → KA ⊗ E|A ⊗ L|A → 0

is exact and J ( k1 D)|A = J ( k1 D|A ). In particular, k1 D|A is integrable
on A \ B|A . For the details of these reduction arguments, see the first
and second steps in the proof of the main theorem in [D3]. Therefore,
this corollary follows from the previous corollary: Corollary 4.7.
