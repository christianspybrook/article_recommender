CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF
ONE-DIMENSIONAL GAS
By Vladislav V. Vysotsky1
St. Petersburg State University
We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model
of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of n identical
particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero
initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual
attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new
particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws
of conservation.
We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of Kn (t) as n → ∞,
where Kn (t) denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system
with n initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem
for Kn (t). Its proof is based on the discovered localization property
of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each
particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles.

1. Introduction.
1.1. Description of the model. We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas
consists of n point particles, each one of mass n1 . These particles are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles
begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When two or more
particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster,
whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of mass and momentum
conservation. Between collisions, particles move according to the laws of
Newtonian mechanics.
We suppose that the force of mutual attraction does not depend on distance and equals the product of masses. This assumption is natural for

one-dimensional models because, by the Gauss law applied to flux of the
gravitational field, gravitation is proportional to the distance to the power
one minus dimension of the space. At any moment, the acceleration of a
particle is thus equal to difference of masses located to the right and to the
left of the particle.
Random initial positions of particles are usually described (see [8, 16,
25]) by the following natural models: in the uniform model, n particles are
independently and uniformly spread on [0, 1]; in the Poisson model, particles
are located at points n1 S1 , n1 S2 , . . . , n1 Sn , where Si is a standard exponential
random walk. In other words, particles are located at points of first n jumps
of a Poisson process with intensity n.
These two models are the most natural and interesting; let us call them
the main models of initial positions. However, we will see that behavior
of the Poisson model is essentially defined by independence of initial distances between particles rather than by the particular type of the distances'
distribution. Therefore, it is of a great mathematical interest to generalize the Poisson model by introducing the i.d. model, where "i.d." stands
for "independent distances," as follows. Particles are initially located at
1

n S1 , n S2 , . . . , n Sn , where Si is a positive random walk whose nonnegative
i.i.d. increments Xi satisfy the normalization condition EXi = 1. Note that
if we proceed to the limit as n → ∞, we consider a system of total mass one,
which consists of, roughly speaking, infinitesimal particles homogeneously
spread on [0, 1]; this is true for all the mentioned models of initial positions.
The mathematical interest in sticky particles systems arises mainly from
relations between these systems and some nonlinear partial differential equations originating from fluid mechanics, for example, the Burgers equation.
These equations admit interpretation in terms of sticky particles; see Gurbatov et al. [10], Brenier and Grenier [4] or E, Rykov and Sinai [6]. Sticky
particles models are also used for numerical solving of other partial differential equations; see Chertock et al. [5] for explanations and further references.
As time goes, particles aggregate in clusters. Clusters become larger and
larger while the number of clusters decreases until they merge into a single
cluster containing all initial particles. This process of mass aggregation is
strongly connected with additive coalescence; see Bertoin [2] and Giraud [9]
for the most recent results and references.
The aggregation process resembles formation of a star from dispersed
space dust and sticky particles models indeed have relations to astrophysics.
It is appropriate to clarify these relations since they are not so direct and
cause a lot of misunderstanding.
It is known that the distribution of galaxies in the universe is very inhomogeneous and the regions of high density form a peculiar cellular structure.
The first attempt to understand the formation of such structures was made

CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL GAS

in 1970 by Zeldovich. Most of the mass in the universe is believed to exist in the form of particles that practically do not collide with each other
and interact only gravitationally, for example, neutrinos. In his model, Zeldovich considered an initially homogeneous collisionless medium of particles
moving by pure inertia; the gravitational interaction was taken away by an
appropriate time change. He showed that singularities, that is, the thin regions of very high density of particles, so called "pancakes," appear even if
initial speeds of particles form a smooth velocity field.
Zeldovich's approximate model, however, does not explain formation of
the cellular structure of matter. His approximation does not take into account that particles hitting a "pancake" are hampered by its strong gravitational field and start oscillating inside the "pancake" instead of flying away.
Although this gravitational adhesion of collisionless particles is not precisely
the same as the real sticking, the model of sticky particles serves as a reasonable approximation. The effect of gravitational adhesion was then analyzed
by the use of the Burgers equation; Gurbatov, Saichev and Shandarin proposed it in 1984 to extend Zeldovich's approximation, which is invalid after
formation of "pancakes."
The model of sticky particles is directly mentioned in Gurbatov et al. [11];
a comprehensive survey of the formation of the Universe's large-scale structure could be found in Shandarin and Zeldovich [23].
1.2. Statement of the problem and the results. In general, the problem
is to describe the process of mass aggregation. How fast is it? How large
the clusters are? Where do clusters appear most intensively, and so forth?
Numerous papers on the model (e.g., [8, 14, 16, 20, 25]) are dedicated to
probabilistic description of various properties of the aggregation process as
the number of initial particles n tends to infinity. Thus, the behavior of a
typical system consisting of a large number of particles is studied.
In this paper, we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of Kn (t), which
denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system with n initial particles.
This variable is a decreasing random step function satisfying Kn (0) = n
and Kn (t) = 1 for t ≥ Tnlast , where Tnlast denotes the moment of the last
collision. While calculating Kn (t), we also count initial particles that have
not experienced any collisions; in other words, Kn (t) is the total number of
particles existing at time t.
It is very important to know the behavior of Kn (t). This gives us a deep
understanding of the aggregation process since the average size of a cluster
at time t is Knn(t) .
At first we give a short deterministic example. Suppose that particles are
located at points n1 , n2 , . . . , nn , that is, Si = i. By simple calculations, we find
that there would not be any collisions before t = 1. At the moment t = 1, all

4

V. V. VYSOTSKY

particles simultaneously stick together, hence Kn (t) = n for 0 ≤ t < 1 and
Kn (t) = 1 for t ≥ 1.
However, when the initial positions are random, the aggregation process
behaves entirely differently. In [25], the author proved the following statement.
Fact 1. There exists a deterministic function a(t) such that both in the
Poisson and the uniform models of initial positions, for any t ≥ 0, we have
(1)

Kn (t) P
−→ a(t),
n

n → ∞.

The function a(t) is continuous, a(0) = 1, and a(t) = 0 for t ≥ 1. We conjecture, on the basis of numerical simulations, that a(t) = 1 − t2 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
The relation a(t) = 0 for t > 1 is not of a surprise because we know from
P
Giraud [8] that both in the Poisson and the uniform models, Tnlast −→ 1 (the
limit constant is so "fine" due to the proper scaling of the model). Therefore,
we say that the moment t = 1 is critical; note that this moment coincides
with the moment of the total collision in the deterministic model.
The aim of this paper is to strengthen the result of [25]. We first generalize Fact 1 and prove it for the i.d. model. We will see [relations (19)
and (27) below] that a(t) is equal to the probability of a certain event that
is expressed in terms of Xi . Also, we will prove that a(t) depends on the
√
common distribution of Xi as follows: a(t) = 1 on [0, μ), where
μ := sup{y : P{Xi < y} = 0};
√
a(t) ∈ (0, 1) on ( μ, 1); and a(t) = 0 on (1, ∞).
Furthermore, the recent results of the author [26] allow us to prove the
conjecture from Fact 1 that aPoiss (t) = aUnif (t) = 1 − t2 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. There
is an amazing contrast between the simplicity of this formula and the hard
calculations one needs to obtain it. It is remarkable that now we know the
limit function a(t) for the main models of initial positions.
Our main goal is to improve (1) by finding the next term in the asymptotics of Kn (t). The result is the following statement, where the standard
D
symbol −→ denotes weak convergence and D denotes the Skorohod space.
Theorem 1. In the i.d. model with continuous Xi satisfying EXiγ < ∞
for some γ > 4, there exists a centered Gaussian process K(*) on [0, 1) such
that
(2)

as n → ∞. The process K(*) depends on the distribution of Xi . This process satisfies K(0) = 0 and has a.s. continuous trajectories. The covariance
√
function R(s, t) of K(*) is continuous on [0, 1)2 , R(s, t) > 0 on ( μ, 1)2 , and
√
R(s, t) = 0 on [0, 1)2 \ ( μ, 1)2 .
In the uniform model, (2) holds for some centered Gaussian process K Unif (*)
on [0, 1). This process satisfies K Unif (0) = 0 and has a.s. continuous trajectories. The covariance function RUnif (s, t) of K Unif (*) is continuous on [0, 1)2 ,
and RUnif (s, t) = RPoiss (s, t) − s2 t2 .
Thus, the Poisson and the uniform models lead to different limit processes
K Poiss (*) and K Unif (*), although aPoiss (*) = aUnif (*).
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 1 (see Billingsley [3], Section 15),
we get
(3)

Kn (t) − na(t) D
√
−→ N (0, σ 2 (t)),
n

n→∞

for any t < 1, where σ 2 (t) := R(t, t). It is possible to show that in the i.d.
model, (3) holds for all t 6= 1 under the less restrictive condition EXi2 < ∞,
with σ 2 (t) = 0 for t > 1; continuity of Xi is not required.
We also study convergence of the left-hand side of (3) at the critical
moment t = 1. Apparently, the limit is not Gaussian, but this complicated
problem is related to a curious, but hardly provable conjecture on integrated
random walks. In view of this non-Gaussianity, it seems impossible to prove
any extended version of Theorem 1 that describes the weak convergence of
trajectories on the whole interval [0, 1]; we refer to Section 7 for further
discussion.
We finish this subsection with a note on scaling. In our model, the masses
of particles are equal to n1 and the distances between them are of the order
1
n . Let us rescale the i.d. model by multiplying all masses and distances
by n: the system of particles of mass one each, initially located at points
S1 − S[n/2] , S2 − S[n/2] , . . . , Sn − S[n/2] , is called the expanding model. The
particles are shifted by S[n/2] because we want the system to expand "filling"
the whole line as n → ∞ rather than only the positive half-line.
All results of our paper hold true for the expanding model. This is not
unexpected because the shift does not produce any changes and the rescaling
of masses is equivalent to the time contraction by n times while the rescaling
of distances is equivalent to the time expansion by n times. We refer the
reader to Section 2 below or to Lifshits and Shi [16] for rigorous arguments.
1.3. Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we describe a general method
which is used to study systems of sticky particles. This method is applied for
studying the i.d. model in Section 3, where we investigate some properties of

6

the aggregation process. We will show that the aggregation process is highly
local, that is, the behavior of a particle is essentially defined by the motion
of neighbor particles. This localization property suggests that we could use
limit theorems for weakly dependent variables to prove both Fact 1 and
Theorem 1 for the i.d. model; this will be done in Section 4. Then we will
prove Theorem 1 for the uniform model in Section 5. In Section 6 we study
the number of clusters at the critical moment t = 1. Some open questions
are discussed in Section 7.
2. Method of barycenters. In this section we briefly describe the method
of barycenters, which is the main tool used to study systems of sticky particles; it is also applicable to more general models where particles could
have nonzero initial speeds and different masses. The method of barycenters
was independently introduced by E, Rykov and Sinai [6] and Martin and
Piasecki [20].
Let us start with several definitions. We always numerate particles from
left to right and identify particles with their numbers. A block of particles is
a nonempty set J ⊂ [1, n] consisting of consecutive numbers. For example,
the block (i, i + k] consists of particles i + 1, . . . , i + k. Note that there are not
any relations between blocks and clusters: for example, a block's particles
could be contained in different clusters and these clusters could even contain
particles that do not belong to the block.
It is convenient to assume that initial particles do not vanish at collisions
but continue to exist in created clusters. Then the coordinate xi,n (t) of a
particle i could be defined as the coordinate of a cluster that contains the
particle at time t. The second subscript n always indicates the number of
initial particles; we will
omit this subscript as often as possible.
P
By xJ (t) := |J|−1 i∈J xi (t) denote the position of the barycenter of a
block J at time t. Further, define
(R)

x∗J (t) := xJ (0) + 21 (MJ
(R)

(L)

(L)

− MJ )t2 ,

where MJ := n−1 (n − maxj∈J ) and MJ := n−1 (minj∈J −1) are the total masses of particles located to the right and to the left of the block J ,
respectively.
A block is free from the right up to time t if, up to this time, the block's
particles did not collide with particles initially located to the right of the
block. We similarly define blocks that are free from the left and say that a
block is free up to time t if it is both free from the right and from the left.
The next statement plays the key role in the analysis of sticky particles
systems. The barycenter of a free block moves as an imaginary particle consisting of all particles of the block put together at the initial barycenter. In a
more precise and general way, we state the following.

CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL GAS

7

Proposition 1. If a block J is free from the right (resp. left) up to time
t, then xJ (s) ≥ x∗J (s) for s ∈ [0, t] [resp. xJ (s) ≤ x∗J (s)]. If a block J is free
up to time t, then xJ (s) = x∗J (s) for s ∈ [0, t].
This statement could be found, for example, in Lifshits and Shi [16],
Proposition 4.1. The easy proof is based on the property of conservation of
momentum.
The moment when a particle j sticks with its right-hand side neighbor
j + 1 is called the merging time Tj,n of the particle j. In other words, Tj,n
is the first moment when particles j and j + 1 are contained in a common
cluster; here j ∈ [1, n − 1]. Proposition 4.3 from Lifshits and Shi [16], which
is stated below, gives us a way to calculate Tj,n .
Proposition 2.
(4)

For every j ∈ [1, n − 1], we have

Tj,n = min {s ≥ 0 : x∗(j,k] (s) = x∗(l,j] (s)}.
j<k≤n
0≤l<j

Thus, Tj,n is expressed by means of barycenters. Note that since
k−l 2
s ,
2n
each of the equations x∗(j,k] (s) = x∗(l,j] (s) has a unique nonnegative solution.
We also mention that at the moment Tj,n appears a cluster that consists of
the particles l + 1, . . . , k, where k and l are minimizers of the right-hand side
of (4).
We will prove Proposition 2 since the proof is simple and perfectly illustrates the sense of the method of barycenters.
(5)

x∗(j,k](s) − x∗(l,j] (s) = x(j,k](0) − x(l,j] (0) −

Proof of Proposition 2. For any u < Tj,n , the particles j and j + 1
are contained in different clusters. Therefore, for every l < j, the block [l, j]
is free from the right up to time u, and for every k > j, the block [j + 1, k]
is free from the left. By Proposition 1,
x∗(l,j] (u) ≤ x(l,j] (u) ≤ xj (u) < xj+1 (u)
≤ x(j,k] (u) ≤ x∗(j,k] (u),

and since, by (5), the function x∗(j,k] (s) − x∗(l,j] (s) is decreasing for s ≥ 0, we
conclude that
u <{s ≥ 0 : x∗(j,k](s) = x∗(l,j] (s)}.
Taking minimum over k, l and taking supremum over u, we get Tj,n ≤
min{* * *}.

8

V. V. VYSOTSKY

Let us prove the last inequality in the other direction. By the definition of
Tj,n , there exist an l < j and a k > j such that the blocks (l, j] and (j, k] are
free up to time Tj,n (clusters containing particles from these blocks collide
exactly at time Tj,n ). In view of Proposition 1,
x∗(l,j] (Tj,n ) = x(l,j] (Tj,n ) = x(j,k](Tj,n ) = x∗(j,k] (Tj,n );
hence Tj,n = {s ≥ 0 : x∗(j,k] (s) = x∗(l,j] (s)} and Tj,n ≥ min{* * *}. 

because the total number of clusters decreases by one at each moment Ti,n .
This representation plays the key role in the investigation of Kn (t). Clearly,
we need to study properties of the r.v.'s Ti,n to prove limit theorems for
Kn (t); such study will be done in this section.
3.1. The initial study. Let us simplify the representation for Tj,n from
Proposition 2. In this section we consider the i.d. model of initial positions,
where xj,n (0) = n1 Sj . Recall that Sj is a random walk with i.i.d. increments
{Xj }j∈Z (we will need the variables {Xj }j≤0 later).

3.2. Localization property of the aggregation process. We see that Tj,n
is a function of X2 , . . . , Xn ; in other words, it is necessary to know the
distances between all n particles to find Tj,n . The aggregation process is
actually highly local, that is, the value of Tj,n is essentially defined by the
initial distances between neighbor particles {i} of j for which |j − i| is small
enough.
To make this statement rigorous, we need to introduce the following notation. Let us put
(M )

Tj

:=

min {s ≥ 0 : Fk,j,l (s) = 0},

1≤k,l≤M

j ∈ Z, M ∈ N,

which is expressed in terms of the variables {Xi }|j−i|≤M only. Also, define
Tj := inf {s ≥ 0 : Fk,j,l (s) = 0},

j ∈ Z,

which is, in some sense, the merging time in an appropriate infinite system
of particles. The reader could construct such system by considering the limit
of the expanding model, see Section 1.

Let us estimate the rate of the convergence of P{Tj 6= Tj } to zero as the

the above-mentioned locality of the aggregation process. In fact, by (10), we

3.3. The distribution function of T0 in the Poisson model. It is amazing
that in the Poisson model, the distribution function of T0 could be found
explicitly. This is important because by (27) below, the limit function a(t)
equals P{T0 > t} for the i.d. model. Also, in the proof of Theorem 1 for the
uniform model, we will need aPoiss (t) = P{T0Poiss ≥ t} to be twice differentiable and have a continuous second derivative.
Lemma 2.

In the Poisson model, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, we have
P{T0 ≥ t} = 1 − t2 .

Although these calculations seem to be technical, they are based on quite
original ideas. 
3.4. Some properties of the variables Ti . In this subsection we prove
several important properties of the r.v.'s Ti .
1. The sequence Ti is stationary.
Proof. This statement immediately follows from the definition of Ti and
stationarity of Xi , which are i.i.d.

3. We have P{ μ ≤ Ti ≤ 1} = 1 while sup{y : P{Ti < y} = 0} = μ and
inf{y : P{Ti < y} = 1} = 1; recall that μ = sup{y : P{Xi < y} = 0}. In addition, if 0 < DXi < ∞, then P{Ti = 1} = 0.
√
Proof. First, P{ μ ≤ Ti } = 1 is trivial, because both infima in (19) are
nonpositive.
Second, fix a t ≥ 1 and consider P{Ti ≥ t}. Taking into account that infima
in (19) are nonpositive, we obtain

P{Ti ≥ t} ≤ P inf
(k − i)(Xi − t2 ) + (X0 − t2 ) ≥ 0 .

It follows from the asymptotics of unilateral small deviation probabilities of

Third, sup{y : P{Ti < y} = 0} = μ and inf{y : P{Ti < y} = 1} = 1 follow
if we prove that for any t < EXi = 1, the common distribution of the i.i.d.

and it could be shown via the strong law of large numbers that the last
probability is strictly positive for all t < 1.
(k)
4. Suppose Xi is continuous. Then Tj and Tj,n are continuous for any
j, k, n and the common distribution of Tj could have an atom only at 1. In
addition, if EXi2 < ∞, then Tj are continuous.
Proof. By (7) and (8),
Tj,n =

r.v.'s. The Tj

(k) D

are also continuous because Tj

16

Now we prove the continuity of Tj . By Property 3, it only remains to
(k)
verify that P{Tj ≥ t} is continuous on [0, 1). But P{Tj ≥ t} − P{Tj ≥ t} =
P{1{t≤Tj } 6= 1{t≤T (k) } }, and in view of (13),

for every s < 1 = EXi . The last expression tends to zero by the strong law
of large numbers; then P{Tj ≥ t} is continuous on [0, s] as a uniform limit
(k)
of continuous functions P{Tj ≥ t}. Since s < 1 is arbitrary, P{Tj ≥ t} is
continuous on [0, 1).
5. The cov(1{s≤T0 } , 1{t≤Tk } ) tends to zero as k → ∞ for all s, t ∈ [0, 1). If,
in addition, EXiγ < ∞ for some γ > 1, then for any s, t ∈ [0, 1) and k ∈ N,
we have
(21)

|cov(1{s≤T0 } , 1{t≤Tk } )| ≤ 2γ (ρ(s) + ρ(t))k1−γ .

Proof. The idea is to approximate 1{s≤T0 } and 1{t≤Tk } by 1{s≤T (k/2) } and
0

1{t≤T (k/2) } , respectively; here by k/2 we mean ⌈k/2⌉, where ⌈x⌉ = min{m ∈

0

first is a function of {Xi }i≤k/2 while the second is a function of {Xi }i≥k/2+1 .
We then have

are associated; the author
owes this observation to M. A. Lifshits.

CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL GAS

17

Proof. Let us first recall the definition and some basic properties of associated variables. R.v.'s ξ1 , . . . , ξm are associated if for any coordinate-wise
nondecreasing functions f, g : Rm → R, it is true that
cov(f (ξ1 , . . . , ξm ), g(ξ1 , . . . , ξm )) ≥ 0
(assuming that the left-hand side is well defined). An infinite set of r.v.'s is
associated if any finite subset of its variables is associated.
The following sufficient conditions of association are well known; see [7].
(a) Independent variables are associated.
(b) Coordinate-wise nondecreasing functions (of finite number of arguments) of associated r.v.'s are associated.
(c) If the variables ξ1,k , . . . , ξm,k are associated for every k and (ξ1,k , . . . ,
D

ξm,k ) −→ (ξ1 , . . . , ξm ) as k → ∞, then ξ1 , . . . , ξm are associated.
(d) If two sets of associated variables are independent, then the union of
these sets is also associated.
n−1
Then {Ti,n }i=1
are associated for every n by (a), (b) and (20). Analo(k)
(k)
gously, {Ti }i∈Z are associated for every k. Finally, since Ti → Ti a.s. as
k → ∞ for every i, (c) ensures the association of {Ti }i∈Z .
7. For any s, t ∈ R and k ∈ Z,

cov(1{T0 ≤s} , 1{Tk ≤t} ) ≥ 0.

(23)

Proof. This inequality follows from cov(1{T0 ≤s} , 1{Tk ≤t} ) = cov(1{s<T0 } ,

1{t<Tk } ), the association of T0 , Tk and (b).

8. If EXiγ < ∞ for some γ ≥ 2, then the stationary sequence min{Ti , t}
is strongly mixing for any t < 1 and its coefficients of strong mixing α(k)
satisfy α(k) = o(k2−γ ).
Proof. Recall that stationary r.v.'s ξi are strongly mixing if α(k) → 0 as
k → ∞, where α(k) are the coefficients of strong mixing defined as
α(k) :=

sup

A∈F−∞

here F−∞
:= σ(ξ0 , ξ−1 , . . .) and Fk∞ := σ(ξk , ξk+1 , . . .) are the σ-algebras of
"past" and "future," respectively. It is readily seen that

(24)

α(k) ≤ sup | cov(f (ξ0 , ξ−1 , . . .), g(ξk , ξk+1 , . . .))|,
0≤f,g≤1

where the supremum is taken over Borel functions f, g : R∞ → [0, 1].
Let us estimate α(k) in the same way we estimated the left-hand side
of (21). Fix some Borel functions f, g : R∞ → [0, 1]. We approximate the

(k/2+1)

Pn−1that the

1{t<Ti }
Pn−1
instead of i=1 1{t<Ti,n } : We thus deal with a single sequence Ti and avoid
considering the triangular array Ti,n .
Let us now prove Fact 1 for the i.d. model. We prove (1) for t 6= 1 without
any additional assumptions on Xi ; for t = 1, we require EXi2 < ∞. The
properties of the limit function a(t) were studied in Section 3.4, Properties
3 and 4.
Proof of Fact 1.

Let us first prove (1) for all t < 1. It is sufficient to check that

Fact 3. The law of large numbers holds for r.v.'s ξi if there exists a

which is n2 i=1 o(1) = o(1) by Lemma 1. To be very precise, Lemma 1
deals with slightly different indicators, but we can estimate the considered

Property 4, Section 3.4).
We now check that (1) holds for all t > 1. Using (26) gives E Knn(t) =

P{Ti,n > t} → 0 as n → ∞ and Knn(t) −→ a(t) = 0 follows from the

It remains to check that (1) holds for t = 1 if EXi2 < ∞ to conclude
the proof. If DXi = 0, then the situation is deterministic, this case was
described in Introduction. Here we always have Kn (1) = 1 and (1) is true.
If 0 < DXi < ∞, then by Property 3 from Section 3.4, we have a(1) = 0 and
P{T0 = 1} = 0; consequently, a(t) = P{T0 > t} is continuous at t = 1. Then
P
(1) is true for t = 1 since 0 < Knn(1) ≤ Knn(t) −→ a(t) for any t ∈ (0, 1) and

the Un (*) is the empirical process of stationary r.v.'s Ti with the continuous

to the existence of a centered Gaussian process K(*) on [0, 1) such that
(32)

D

Un (*) −→ K(*)

in D[0, 1 − ε] for all ε ∈ (0, 1).

We will use the following result from Lin and Lu [17], Section 12 on
convergence of empirical processes. They attribute this statement to Q.-M.
Shao, who published it in 1986, in Chinese.
Fact 4. Let ξi be a sequence of stationary strongly mixing r.v.'s distributed on [0, 1], and let F be the common distribution function of ξi .
Suppose F (x) = x on [0, 1] (i.e., ξi are uniformly distributed) and the coefficients of strong mixing of the sequence F (ξi ) decrease as O(k−(2+δ) )
as k → ∞ for some δ > 0. Then the empirical processes of ξi weakly converge
in D[0, 1] to a centered Gaussian process with the covariance function
P
cov(
1{ξ0 ≤s} , 1{ξi ≤t} ).
i∈Z

Remark. The limit Gaussian process is a.s. continuous on [0, 1]. Fact 4
also holds true if F is an arbitrary continuous distribution function.

The a.s. continuity of the limit process could be concluded by a comparison of the proof from Lin and Lu [17] with the proof of Theorem 22.1 from
Billingsley [3]. The statements and the proofs of these theorems are identical,

CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL GAS

23

but Lin and Lu do not state the continuity while Billingsley does. Further,
since F (ξi ) is uniformly distributed on [0, 1] if F is continuous, Fact 4 holds
true for every continuous F ; see the proof of Theorem 22.1 by Billingsley [3]
for explanations.
Recall that we need to prove the convergence of the empirical process of
Ti . It seems that the r.v.'s Ti are not strongly mixing; but min{Ti , 1 − ε} are
strongly mixing because of Property 8, Section 3.4. These variables are not
continuous and so we need to fix them. Let us fix an ε ∈ (0, 1), and let αi
be i.i.d. r.v.'s independent of all Ti and, say, uniformly distributed on [0, ε];
we define T̃i := min{Ti , 1 − ε} + 1{Ti ≥1−ε} αi .
The stationary variables T̃i are distributed on [0, 1], their common distribution function G is continuous, and the coefficients of strong mixing
of G(T̃i ) decrease as o(k2−γ ). The proof of the last statement is the same
as the proof of Property 8 from Section 3.4. Indeed, approximate the vari(k/2)
(k/2+1)
ables G(T̃0 ), G(T̃−1 ), . . . from the "past" by G(T̃0
), G(T̃−1
), . . . where
(m)

(m)

T̃i := min{Ti , 1 − ε} + 1{T (m) ≥1−ε} αi ; use the analogous approximation
i
for the variables from the "future"; and then repeat word for word the arguments of the previous proof.
Now, recalling that γ > 4, we see that T̃i satisfy the assumptions of Fact 4,
with the only difference that their distribution is not uniform. By Ũn (*)
denote the empirical process of T̃i ; clearly, Ũn (*) coincides with the empirical
process Un (*) of Ti on [0, 1 − ε]. By the remark to Fact 4, we conclude that
first,

where K̃(*) is a centered Gaussian process with the covariance function
R̃(s, t) :=

i∈Z

cov(1{T̃0 ≤s} , 1{T̃i ≤t} )

and, second, trajectories of K̃(*) are a.s. continuous on [0, 1].
[There exists a simpler and more elegant proof of (33). Note that {T̃i }i∈Z
are associated as coordinate-wise nondecreasing functions of associated r.v.'s
{Ti , αi }i∈Z , see (a), (b) and (d) from Property 6, Section 3.4. Then we can
obtain (33) applying the result of Louhichi [18] on convergence of empirical
processes of stationary associated r.v.'s ξi instead of using Fact 4. This theorem requires only cov(F (ξ0 ), F (ξk )) = O(k−(4+δ) ), which could be proved
analogously to Property 5, Section 3.4. Thus we avoid the complicated estimations of the strong mixing coefficients, and the proof of (33) is becomes
much simpler. The only problem is that this proof requires γ > 5.
We also note that the a.s. continuity of K̃(*) could be proved directly,
without referring to the proof of Fact 4. The arguments should be the same
as in the proof of the continuity of K Unif (*) in Section 5.]

R(s, t) :=

X
i∈Z

cov(1{T0 ≤s} , 1{Ti ≤t} ),

which is, evidently, equal to R̃(s, t) on [0, 1 − ε]2 . Since R̃(s, t) is positive
definite and ε > 0 is arbitrary, the function R(s, t) is positive definite on
[0, 1)2 . Therefore, by Lifshits [15], Section 4, there exists a centered Gaussian
process K(*) on [0, 1) with the covariance function R(s, t). The trajectories
D
of K(*) are a.s. continuous on [0, 1) by K(*) = K̃(*) on [0, 1 − ε], arbitrariness
of ε > 0, and the a.s. continuity of K̃(*) on [0, 1].
D
Finally, by (33), Ũn (*) = Un (*) on [0, 1 − ε], K̃(*) =
K(*) on [0, 1 − ε], and
the a.s. continuity of K̃(*), we get (32). Since (32) implies (30), we conclude
the proof of (2).
Only the stated properties of R(s, t) remain to be proven. The continuity
of the joint distribution function of continuous variables T0 and Ti implies
that cov(1{T0 ≤s} , 1{Ti ≤t} ) is continuous on [0, 1)2 for every i ≥ 0. Then, in
view of (21), R(s, t) is continuous on [0, 1)2 as a sum of uniformly converging
series of continuous functions.
√
The strict positivity of R(s, t) on ( μ, 1)2 trivially follows from (34), (23)
and cov(1{T0 ≤s} , 1{T0 ≤t} ) = a(s ∨ t)(1 − a(s ∧ t)) > 0; the last inequality holds
√
by Property 3, Section 3.4. The R(s, t) = 0 on [0, 1)2 \ ( μ, 1)2 follows from
√
P{Ti ≤ μ} = 0, which holds by Properties 3 and 4 from Section 3.4. 
We note that (3) holds for t 6= 1 under the less restrictive condition EXi2 <
∞. For t < 1, the proof is almost the same: By (29), which is true for γ > 3/2,
we conclude that (3) holds if the stationary associated sequence 1{t<Ti }
satisfies the central limit theorem. Then we refer to the central limit theorem
for stationary associated sequences from Newman [21]; his theorem requires
only R(t, t) < ∞, that is, the convergence of the right-hand side of (34). This
condition holds by (13) and Fact 2. For t > 1, relation (3) holds true with
σ 2 (t) = 0 because of Proposition 3.
Finally, note that the process K(*) is associated, that is, the r.v.'s
{K(t)}t∈[0,1) are associated. In fact, by (6), Property 6 from Section 3.4,
√
are
and Condition (b) from the same Property 6, the processes Kn (*)−na(*)

associated for every n. Then K(*) is associated by (2) and (c), Property 6.

5. Proof of Theorem 1 for the uniform model. There exists a simple
method that allows to extend results from the Poisson model to the uniform
model and vise versa. The method is based on the next statement (see
Karlin [13], Section 9.1).

ues of the process are defined by xUnif
1,n (0), . . . , xn,n (0), which are mutually
independent of βn by Fact 5.

where η is a standard Gaussian r.v.
We claim that (38), the independence of Yn (*) and Zn (*), and (39) yield
the weak convergence of Yn (*) in D[0, 1 − ε]. Let us check the tightness of
Yn (*) and the convergence of their finite-dimensional distributions.
The tightness of Yn (*) in D[0, 1 − ε] follows from Yn (*) = (Yn (*) + Zn (*)) −
Zn (*), (38), and (39). Indeed, by the Prokhorov theorem, (38) and (39) yield
that both sequences Yn (*) + Zn (*) and −Zn (*) are tight. But trajectories
of −Zn (*) are a.s. continuous because of the continuity of a(*), and the
tightness follows from the continuity of addition + : D × C → D and the fact
that under any continuous mapping, the image of a compact set is also a
compact set.
Now we study convergence of finite dimensional distributions of Yn (*).
Recall that the characteristic function of a centered Gaussian vector in Rm
is e−1/2(Ru,u) , where u ∈ Rm and R is the covariance matrix of the vector.
Then (38), the independence of Yn (*) and Zn (*), and (39) yield that for the
characteristic functions of all finite-dimensional distributions of Yn (*), we
have

where u ∈ Rm , t = (t1 , . . . , tm ) ∈ [0, 1−ε]m , and Yn (t) := (Yn (t1 ), . . . , Yn (tm )).
We stress that (40) is true for every t ∈ [0, 1 − ε]m since the limit processes
in (38) and (39) have continuous trajectories.
We see that the matrix {RPoiss (tj , tk ) − t2j t2k }m
j,k=1 is positive definite for
m
any t = (t1 , . . . , tm ) ∈ [0, 1 − ε] and m ≥ 1 since the absolute value of the
left-hand side of (40) does not exceed one. Putting
RUnif (s, t) := RPoiss (s, t) − s2 t2 ,
Unif (t , t )}m
we have {RPoiss (tj , tk ) − t2j t2k }m
j k j,k=1 ; then the function
j,k=1 = {R
Unif
2
R
(s, t) is positive definite on [0, 1) since ε > 0 is arbitrary. Thus, by
Lifshits [15], Section 4, RUnif (s, t) is the covariance function of some centered
Gaussian process K Unif (*) on [0, 1).
Relation (2) is thus proved. Now check that K Unif (*) ∈ C[0, 1 − ε] a.s. to
conclude the proof of Theorem 1 for the uniform model.
For this purpose, let us prove that a.s., trajectories of Yn (*) have jumps
of size √1n only. In fact, the jumps of Yn (*) coincide with the jumps of
√1 K Unif (*),

obvious because if the equality holds true, then a certain nontrivial linear
combination of i.i.d. exponential Xi equals zero.

continuous on [0, 1 − ε].
Since ε ∈ (0, 1) is arbitrary, a.s., K Unif (*) is continuous on the whole interval [0, 1). The RUnif (s, t) = RPoiss (s, t) − s2 t2 is continuous on [0, 1)2 because
RPoiss (s, t) is. 

We do not know if this sequence is weakly convergent, but we hope that
it is. We also have a naive guess that its limit is Gaussian because the limit
in Theorem 1 is Gaussian. In view of Kn (1) ≥ 1, this conjectured weak limit
is nonnegative, hence it is Gaussian if and only if it is identically equal to
zero. However, the results of this section show that the limit is nonzero, thus
our guess on Gaussianity fails.
The study of convergence of K√n (1)
is quite complicated. Therefore, in this

to say that pk are the unilateral small deviation probabilities of an integrated
centered random walk.
We need to obtain the asymptotics of pk → 0 to continue the study of
convergence of K√n (1)

are completely dependent on the correctness of the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1.

We have pk ∼ c1 k−1/4 as k → ∞ for some c1 ∈ (0, ∞).

Simulations show that the conjecture is true and c1 ≈ 0.36. The weaker
form pk ≍ k−1/4 of Conjecture 1 was proved by Sinai [22], but only for integrated symmetric Bernoulli random walks. It also interesting to note that,

we additionally refer to Isozaki and Watanabe [12] who state (43) explicitly.

7. Open questions. 1. The number of clusters at the critical moment
t = 1.
Here the main question is if Conjecture 1 holds true. Even by itself, this
problem is worth studying.
But even if Conjecture 1 is true, we still do not have a proof of weak

strongly believes, relying on numerical simulations, that the limit exists. It
would be interesting to find this conjectured limit, which should be nontrivial
by Proposition 5, in an explicit form.

is not Gaussian, hence the limit process K(*), which is Gaussian on [0, 1),
is no more Gaussian on [0, 1]. Therefore, it is doubtful that Theorem 1 is
true in D[0, 1]; at least, one should provide a proof completely different from
the presented one. Also, it is unclear how to define the finite-dimensional
distributions of the non-Gaussian K(*) on [0, 1] because simulations show
that K(1) would not be independent with K(t) for t < 1.
3. The number of clusters in the warm gas.
In the presented case, initial speeds of particles are zero. This model is often called the cold gas according to its zero initial temperature. We introduce
a new model stating that initial speeds of particles are an v1 , an v2 , . . . , an vn ,
where vi are some i.i.d. r.v.'s and an is a sequence of normalization constants. This model, called the warm gas, was studied in many papers, for
example, [14, 16, 20, 25].
It is of a great interest to study the behavior of Kn (t) in the warm gas.
In [25], the author proved that in the basic case where an = 1 for all n and
P
Evi2 < ∞, we have Knn(t) −→ 0 for all t > 0. The question is to find a normalization of Kn (t) leading to some nontrivial limit. Clearly, this normalization
depends on an , but it is very possible that there is an effect of phase transition similar to the one discovered by Lifshits and Shi [16]: If an are small
enough, then the gas has a low temperature and the normalization is the
same as in the cold gas. If an are big enough, as in the basic case an ≡ 1,
then the normalization and the behavior of the gas differ entirely from the
case of the cold gas.
The author believes that the localization property, which is described in
Section 3, could be helpful in a study of these questions.
It is also interesting to compare the behavior of Kn (1) in the warm and in
the cold gases; in the warm gas, the moment t = 1 plays the same "critical"
role as in the cold gas, see Lifshits and Shi [16]. The variable Kn (1) was
studied by Suidan [24], who considered the warm gas with an ≡ 1 and deterministic initial positions of particles (his initial positions were n1 , n2 , . . . , nn ).
For this case, Suidan found the distribution of Kn (1) and showed
that
√
EKn (1) ∼ log n. Recall that in the presented case, EKn (1) ∼ c3 n.

4. The number of clusters in ballistic systems of sticky particles.
A sticky particles model is called ballistic if it evolves according to the
laws introduced in Section 1, but in the absence of gravitation. Such models
are, in some sense, more natural than gravitational ones because the basic assumption that gravitation does not depend on distance is sometimes
confusing. However, an unpublished paper of Lifshits and Kuoza shows that
certain gravitational and ballistic models are tightly connected.
It seems interesting to study the number of clusters in the ballistic model.
The author does not know any results in this field.
