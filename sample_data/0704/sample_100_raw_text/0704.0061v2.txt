INTERSECTION BODIES AND GENERALIZED
COSINE TRANSFORMS
BORIS RUBIN
Abstract. Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of
geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the
relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the
context of their application to investigation of a certain family of
intersection bodies, which we call λ-intersection bodies. The latter
include k-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and
unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of Lp -spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of
the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this
result to the study of sections of λ-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are
given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs.

1. Introduction
This is an updated and extended version of our previous preprint
[R5].
Intersection bodies interact with Radon transforms and encompass
diverse classes of geometric objects associated to sections of star bodies.
The concept of intersection body was introduced in the remarkable
paper by Lutwak [Lu] and led to a breakthrough in the solution of the
long-standing Busemann-Petty problem; see [G], [K4], [Lu], [Z2] for
references and historical notes.
We remind some known facts that will be needed in the following.
An origin-symmetric (o.s.) star body in Rn , n ≥ 2, is a compact set
K with non-empty interior such that tK ⊂ K ∀t ∈ [0, 1], K = −K,
and the radial function ρK (θ) = sup{λ ≥ 0 : λθ ∈ K} is continuous
on the unit sphere S n−1 . In the following, Kn denotes the set of all
o.s. star bodies in Rn , Gn,i is the Grassmann manifold of i-dimensional
linear subspaces of Rn , and voli (*) denotes the i-dimensional volume
function. The Minkowski functional of a body K ∈ Kn is defined by
n−1
||x||K = min{a ≥ 0 : x ∈ aK}, so that ||θ||K = ρ−1
.
K (θ), θ ∈ S

Definition 1.1. [Lu] A body K ∈ Kn is an intersection body of a body
L ∈ Kn if ρK (θ) = voln−1 (L ∩ θ⊥ ) for every θ ∈ S n−1 , where θ⊥ is the
central hyperplane orthogonal to θ.
By taking into account that voln−1 (L ∩ θ⊥ ) in Definition 1.1 is a
constant multiple of the Minkowski-Funk transform
Z
(Mf )(θ) =
f (u) dθ u,
f (u) = ρLn−1 (u),
S n−1 ∩θ ⊥

Goodey, Lutwak and Weil [GLW] generalized Definition 1.1 as follows.
Definition 1.2. A body K ∈ Kn is an intersection body if ρK = Mμ
for some even non-negative finite Borel measure μ on S n−1 .
A sequence of bodies Kj ∈ Kn is said to be convergent to K ∈ Kn
in the radial metric if lim ||ρKj − ρK ||C(S n−1 ) = 0.
j→∞

Proposition 1.3. The class of intersection bodies is the closure of the
class of intersection bodies of star bodies in the radial metric.
Proposition 1.4. If K is an intersection body in Rn , n > 2, then for
every i = 2, 3, . . . , n − 1 and every η ∈ Gn,i , K ∩ η is an intersection
body in η.
Regarding these two important propositions see [FGW], [GW] and
a nice historical survey in [G].

Different generalizations of the concept of intersection body associated to lower dimensional sections were suggested in the literature; see,
e.g., [K4], [RZ], [Z1]. The following one, which plays an important role
in the study of the lower dimensional Busemann-Petty problem, is due
to Zhang [Z1].
Definition 1.5. We say, that a body K ∈ Kn belongs to Zhang's class
Zin if there is a non-negative finite Borel measure m on the Grassmann
n−i
manifold Gn,i such that ρK
= Ri∗ m, where Ri∗ is the dual spherical
Radon transform; see (2.2), (2.5).
Another generalization was suggested by Koldobsky [K2] and described in detail in [K4]. This class of bodies will be our main concern.
Definition 1.6. [K4, p. 71] A body K ∈ Kn is a k-intersection body
of a body L ∈ Kn (we write K = IBk (L)) if
volk (K ∩ ξ) = voln−k (L ∩ ξ ⊥ )

(1.1)

∀ξ ∈ Gn,k .

We denote by IBk,n the set of all bodies K ∈ Kn satisfying (1.1) for
some L ∈ Kn .
When k = 1, this definition coincides with Definition 1.1 up to a
constant multiple. An analog of Definition 1.2 was given in the Fourier
analytic terms as follows.
Definition 1.7. [K4, Definition 4.7] A body K ∈ Kn is a k-intersection
body if there is a non-negative finite Borel measure μ on S n−1 , so that
for every Schwartz function φ,

where φ̂ denotes the Fourier transform of φ.
The set of all k-intersection bodies in Rn will be denoted by Ikn .
Keeping in mind Proposition 1.3 for k = 1, one can alternatively
define the class Ikn as a closure of IBk,n in the radial metric; cf. [Mi1,
p. 532]. However, to apply results from [K4] to such class, equivalence
of this definition to Definition 1.7 must be proved. We will do this in
the more general situation in Section 5.2.
From Definitions 1.6 and 1.7 it is not clear, for which bodies L ∈ Kn
the relevant k-intersection body K = IBk (L) does exist. It is also not
obvious which bodies actually constitute the class Ikn . The following
important characterization is due to Koldobsky.

4

BORIS RUBIN

Theorem 1.8. [K4, Theorem 4.8] A body K ∈ Kn is a k-intersection
body if and only if || * ||−k
K represents a positive definite tempered dis∧
tribution on Rn , that is, the Fourier transform (|| * ||−k
K ) is a positive
tempered distribution on Rn .
The concept of k-intersection body is related to another important
development. For K ∈ Kn , the quasi-normed space (Rn , || * ||K ) is said
to be isometrically embedded in Lp , p > 0, if there is a linear operator
T : Rn → Lp ([0, 1]) so that ||x||K = ||T x||Lp ([0,1]) .
Theorem 1.9. [K4, Theorem 6.10] The space (Rn , || * ||K ) embeds isometrically in Lp , p > 0, p 6= 2, 4, . . . , if and only if Γ(−p/2)(|| * ||pK )∧
is a positive distribution on Rn \ {0}.
Following Theorems 1.9 and 1.8, one can formally say that K ∈ Ikn if
and only if (Rn , || * ||K ) embeds isometrically in L−k . This observation,
combined with Definition 1.7, was used by A. Koldobsky to define the
concept of "isometric embedding in Lp " for negative p.
Definition 1.10. [K4, Definition 6.14] Let 0 < p < n, K ∈ Kn . The
space (Rn , || * ||K ) is said to be isometrically embedded in L−p if there
is a non-negative finite Borel measure μ on S n−1 , so that for every
Schwartz function φ,

where φ̂ denotes the Fourier transform of φ.
Origin-symmetric bodies K in this definition can be regarded as "unit
balls of n-dimensional subspaces of L−p ". Comparing Definitions 1.10
and 1.7, one might call these bodies "p-intersection bodies". Since the
meaning of the space L−p itself is not specified in Definition 1.10 and
since our paper is mostly focused on geometric properties of bodies
(rather than embeddings in Lp ), in the following we prefer to adopt
another name "λ-intersection body", where λ is a real number, that
will be specified in due course. We denote the set of all λ-intersection
bodies in Rn by Iλn .
Contents of the paper. We will focus on intimate connection
between intersection bodies, spherical Radon transforms, and generalized cosine transforms; see definitions in Section 2.2. This approach
is motivated by the fact that the volume of a central cross section of
a star body is expressed through the spherical Radon transform, and
the latter is a member of the analytic family of the generalized cosine
transforms. These transforms were introduced by Semyanistyi [Se] and

INTERSECTION BODIES

arise (up to naming and normalization) in different contexts of analysis
and geometry; see, e.g., [K4], [R1]-[RZ], [Sa2], [Sa3], [Str1], [Str2].
Sections 2-4 provide analytic background for geometric considerations in Sections 5-7. In Section 2 we establish our notation and define
the generalized cosine transforms on the sphere and the relevant dual
transforms on Grassmann manifolds. In Section 3 we present basic
properties of these transforms, establish new relations between spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms, and prove
"restriction theorems", which are akin to trace theorems in Sobolev
spaces. Section 4 deals with positive definite homogeneous distributions, that can be characterized in terms of the generalized cosine
transforms. This section serves as a preparation for the forthcoming
definition of the concept of λ-intersection body. We investigate which
λ's are appropriate and why. In Section 5 we switch to geometry and
define the class Iλn of λ-intersection bodies. The case 0 < λ < n corresponds to the "unit balls of L−p -spaces" in the spirit of Definition
1.10. The reader will find in this section new proofs of some known
facts. We introduce the notion of λ-intersection body of a star body
in Rn , which extends Definition 1.6 to all λ < n, λ 6= 0. The class
of all such bodies will be denoted by IBλn . We will prove that for
all λ < n, λ 6= 0, −2, −4, . . . , the class Iλn is the closure of IBλn in
the radial metric. The case λ = 1 gives Proposition 1.3. It will be
proved that all m-dimensional central sections of λ-intersection bodies are λ-intersection bodies in the corresponding m-planes provided
λ < m, λ 6= 0.
The natural question arises: How to construct λ-intersection bodies?
In Section 6 we give a series of examples; some of them are known and
some are new. They can be obtained by utilizing auxiliary statements
from Section 3. In particular, the famous embedding of Zhang's class
n
Zn−k
into Ikn , which was first established in [K3] and studied in [Mi1],
[Mi2], will be generalized to the case, when k is replaced by any λ ∈
(0, n). Section 7 is devoted to the so called (q, l)-balls, defined by
n
Bq,l
= {x = (x′ , x′′ ) : |x′ |q + |x′′ |q ≤ 1; x′ ∈ Rn−l , x′′ ∈ Rl },

q > 0.

n
We show that if 0 < q ≤ 2, then Bq,l
∈ Iλn for all λ ∈ (0, n). If
n
∈ Iλn . If q > 2 and
q > 2 and n − 3 ≤ λ < n, we still have Bq,l
n
0 < λ < λ0 = max(n − l, l) − 2, then Bq,l 6∈ Iλn . The case, when
q > 2, l > 1, and λ0 ≤ λ < n − 3 represents an open problem.
In Section 8 we remind the generalized Busemann-Petty problem
(GBP) for i-dimensional central sections of o.s. convex bodies in Rn .
This challenging problem is still open for i = 2 and i = 3 (n ≥ 5).
It actually inspires the whole investigation. Using properties of the

6

BORIS RUBIN

generalized cosine transforms, we give a short direct proof of the fact
that an affirmative answer to GBP implies that every smooth o.s. convex body in Rn with positive curvature is an (n − i)-intersection body.
This fact was discovered by A. Koldobsky. The original proof in [K3]
n
is based on the embedding In−i
⊂ Zin and Zhang's result [Z1, Theorem
6]. The latter heavily relies on the Hahn-Banach separation theorem.
Our proof is more constructive and almost self-contained. We conclude
the paper by Appendix, which is added for convenience of the reader.
The list of references at the end of the paper is far from being complete. Further references can be found in cited books and papers.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Notation. In the following, N = {1, 2, . . . } is the set of all natural numbers, S n−1 is the unit sphere in Rn with the area σn−1 =
2π n/2 /Γ(n/2); Ce (S n−1 ) is the space of even continuous functions on
S n−1 ; SO(n) is the special orthogonal group of Rn ; for θ ∈ S n−1 and
γ ∈ SO(n), dθ and dγ denote the relevant invariant probability measures; D(S n−1) is the space of C ∞ -functions on S n−1 equipped with
the standard topology, and D ′ (S n−1 ) stands for the corresponding dual
space of distributions. The subspaces of even test functions (distributions) are denoted by De (S n−1 ) ( De′ (S n−1 )); Gn,i denotes the Grassmann manifold of i-dimensional subspaces ξ of Rn with the SO(n)invariant probability measure dξ; D(Gn,i) is the space of infinitely differentiable functions on Gn,i.
We write M(S n−1 ) and M(Gn,i) for the spaces of finite Borel measures on S n−1 and Gn,i ; M+ (S n−1 ) and M+ (Gn,i) are the relevant
spaces of non-negative measures; Me+ (S n−1) denotes the space of even
measures μ ∈ M+ (S n−1 ). Given a function φ on Gn,i , we denote
φ⊥ (η) = φ(η ⊥ ), η ∈ Gn,n−i. Similarly, given a measure μ ∈ M(Gn,n−i),
the corresponding "orthogonal measure" μ⊥ in M(Gn,i) is defined by
(μ⊥ , φ) = (μ, φ⊥ ), φ ∈ C(Gn,i).
Let {Yj,k } be an orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics on S n−1 .
Here j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , and k = 1, 2, . . . , dn (j), where dn (j) is the dimension of the subspace of spherical harmonics of P
degree j. Each
function ω ∈ D(S n−1 ) admits a decomposition ω = j,k ωj,k Yj,k with
R
the Fourier-Laplace coefficients ωj,k = S n−1 ω(θ)Yj,k (θ)dθ, which decay
rapidly as j → ∞. Each distribution f ∈ D ′ (S n−1 ) can be defined by

(f, ω) = j,k fj,k ωj,k where fj,k = (f, Yj,k ) grow not faster than j m for

and has the Fourier-Laplace decomposition Πt f = j,k tj fj,k Yj,k [SW].
For f ∈ D ′ (S n−1 ), this decomposition serves as a definition of Πt f . For
harmonic analysis on the unit sphere, the reader is referred to [Le],
[Mü], [Ne], [SW], and a survey article [Sa3].
2.2. Basic integral transforms. For integrable functions f on S n−1
and φ on Gn,i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1, the spherical Radon transform (Ri f )(ξ), ξ ∈
Gn,i, and its dual (Ri∗ φ)(θ), θ ∈ S n−1 , are defined by

Historical notes. Regarding spherical Radon transforms (2.2) and
the Minkowski-Funk transform (2.8), see [GGG], [He], [R2], [R3]. The
first detailed investigation of the analytic family {M α } is due to Semyanistyi [Se], who showed that these operators naturally arise in the
Fourier analysis of homogeneous functions. The case α = 2 in (2.11)
was known before, thanks to W. Blaschke, A.D. Alexandrov, and P.
Lévy. Integrals (2.9) (sometimes with different normalization) arise
in diverse areas of analysis and geometry; see [K4], [R1] - [R3], [Sa3],
[Str1], and references therein. In convex geometry and Banach space
theory, operators (2.11) with α − 1 replaced by p are known as the pcosine transforms. More general analytic families (2.6) and (2.7) were
introduced in [R2].

3. Analytic Families of the Generalized Cosine
Transforms
3.1. Basic properties. Below we review basic properties of integrals
(2.6), (2.7), (2.9); see [R2], [R3] for more details. For integrable functions f and φ and Re α > 0, integrals (2.6), (2.7) and (2.9) are absolutely convergent. When f and φ are infinitely differentiable, these
integrals extend meromorphically to all α ∈ C.

(M α f, ω) = (f, M α ω) =

Lemma 3.2. Let α, β ∈ C; α, β 6= 1, 3, 5, . . . . If α + β = 2 − n and
f ∈ De (S n−1 ) (or f ∈ De′ (S n−1 )), then
(3.5)

M α M β f = f.

If α, 2 − n − α 6= 1, 3, 5, . . ., then M α is an automorphism of the spaces
De (S n−1 ) and De′ (S n−1 ).
Proof. The equality (3.5) is equivalent to mj,α mj,β = 1, α + β = 2 − n.
The latter follows from (3.4). The second statement is a consequence of
the standard theory of spherical harmonics [Ne], because the FourierLaplace multiplier mj,α has a power behavior as j → ∞.

Corollary 3.3. The Minkowski-Funk transform on the spaces De (S n−1 )

Note that there is a wide variety of diverse inversion formulas for
the Minkowski-Funk transform (see [GGG], [He], [R3] and references
therein), but all of them are, in fact, different realizations of (3.6),
depending on classes of functions.
3.2. Auxiliary statements. We establish some connections between
operator families defined above.

Lemma 3.4. Let α, β ∈ C; α, β 6= 1, 3, 5, . . . . If Re α > Re β, then
M α = M β Aα,β , where Aα,β is a spherical convolution operator with the
Fourier-Laplace multiplier
Γ(j/2 + (1 − α)/2) Γ(j/2 + (n − 1 + β)/2)
(3.7)
aα,β (j) =
,
Γ(j/2 + (n − 1 + α)/2) Γ(j/2 + (1 − β)/2)

so that aα,β (j) ∼ (j/2)β−α as j → ∞. If α and β are real numbers
satisfying α > β > 1 − n, α + β < 2, then Aα,β is an integral operator
such that Aα,β f ≥ 0 for every non-negative f ∈ L1 (S n−1 ).

Proof. The first statement follows from (3.4). To prove the second one,
we consider integral operators

They can be easily computed by taking into account that Πt ∼ tj in

integrals (3.8) and (3.9) are absolutely convergent and obey Qμ,ν

3.3. Restriction theorems. Theorems of such type deal with traces
of functions on lower dimensional subspaces and are well known, for instance, in the theory of function spaces. To the best of our knowledge,
traces of functions represented by Radon transforms or, more generally,
by the generalized cosine transforms , were not studied systematically
and deserve particular attention, because they provide analytic background to a series of results related to sections of star bodies; cf. [R3,
Sec. 3.5], [FGW]. Given a subspace η ∈ Gn,m and k < m, we denote
by Gk (η) the manifold of all k-dimensional subspaces of η.

Theorem 3.10. Let f ∈ De (S n−1 ), η ∈ Gn,m , 1 < m < n. Suppose that
f = M 1−λ g, where Re λ < m, λ 6= 0, −2, −4, . . . . Then the restriction
λ
λ
of f onto η is represented as f = MS1−λ

1−λ
(3.20) and MS1−λ
, but on the sphere
n−1 ∩η denotes the same operator M
n−1

∩ η.
Proof. For Re λ < 1, the statement is a particular case of Theorem
3.9 (set k = 1). For other values of λ, the result follows by analytic
continuation.


Remark 3.11. The restriction λ 6= 0, −2, −4, . . . in Theorems 3.9 and
3.10 is caused by the Gamma function Γ(λ/2) in the numerator of the
corresponding normalizing factor. It is evident from the proof, that
both theorems remain true also for λ = −2l, l ∈ N, if we remove the
normalizing factor. Then M 1−λ in Theorem 3.10 will be substituted
for M̃ 1+2l ; see (2.11).
We will need the following generalization of Theorem 3.10.
Theorem 3.12. Let f ∈ Ce (S n−1 ), μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ), and let η ∈ Gn,m ,
1 < m < n. Suppose that f = M 1−λ μ, if λ < m, λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, and
f = M̃ 1+2l μ, if λ = −2l.
(i) There is a measure ν ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ∩ η) such that the restriction of
f onto S n−1 ∩ η is represented as f = MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η ν.
n−1
(ii) If dμ(θ) = g(θ)dθ, g ∈ Ce (S ), then (i) holds with dν(θ) =
(Tηλ g)(θ)dθ, where Tηλ g has the form (3.20).
(iii) If λ = −2l, l ∈ N, then (i) and (ii) hold with MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η substituted
1+2l
for M̃S n−1 ∩η .
Proof. STEP 1. Let first λ < m, λ 6= 0, −2, −4, . . . . We invoke the
Poisson integral (2.1) so that
Πt f = Πt M 1−λ μ = M 1−λ gt ,

gt = Πt μ ∈ De (S n−1 ),

t ∈ (0, 1).

Since f is continuous, then Πt f converges to f as t → 0 uniformly
on S n−1 , and therefore, uniformly on S n−1 ∩ η. Hence, for any test
function ω ∈ D(S n−1 ∩ η), owing to Theorem 3.10, we have
(f, ω) = lim(Πt f, ω) = lim(M 1−λ gt , ω)

n−1
Thus, lim(νt , MS1−λ
∩η). If ω is even,
n−1 ∩η ω) exists for every ω ∈ D(S
t→0

i.e., ω ∈ De (S n−1 ∩ η), then, by Lemma 3.2, we can replace ω by

16

BORIS RUBIN

MS1−m+λ
n−1 ∩η ω and conclude that the limit lim(νt , ω) is well-defined for every
t→0

ω ∈ De (S n−1 ∩η). Since νt = Tηλ Πt μ is an even function and the generic
test function ω ∈ D(S n−1 ∩ η) can be represented as ω+ + ω− , where
ω± are even and odd, respectively, it follows that the limit lim(νt , ω) =
t→0

lim(νt , ω+ ) is well-defined for every ω ∈ D(S n−1 ∩ η) (not only for even
t→0

ω, as stated above). Since D ′ (S n−1 ∩ η) is weakly complete, there is an
even distribution ν in D ′ (S n−1 ∩ η) so that
ω ∈ D(S n−1 ∩ η).

(ν, ω) = lim(νt , ω),
t→0

Furthermore, since (νt , ω) = (Tηλ Πt μ, ω) is non-negative for every nonnegative ω ∈ D(S n−1 ∩ η) and every t ∈ (0, 1), then ν is a positive
distribution and, by Theorem 9.1, ν is a measure in Me+ (S n−1 ∩ η).
1−λ
Thus, by (3.23), (f, ω) = lim(νt , MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η ω) = (ν, MS n−1 ∩η ω), which
t→0

means that f = MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η ν, as desired.
If dμ(θ) = g(θ)dθ, g ∈ Ce (S n−1 ), then νt = Tηλ Πt g tends to Tηλ g uniformly on S n−1 ∩η as t → 0. Hence, by (3.23), (f, ω) = (Tηλ g, MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η ω),
1−λ
λ
which means f = MS n−1 ∩η Tη g.
STEP 2. Consider the case λ = −2l, l ∈ N, when f = M̃ 1+2l μ,

there is a measure ν ∈ M+ (S n−1 ∩ η) such that
lim(Tη−2l Πt μ, ω) = (ν, ω) ∀ω ∈ C(S n−1 ∩ η).

Using this equality, for f = M̃ 1+2l μ we obtain

4. Positive Definite Homogeneous Distributions
We remind some known facts; see, e.g., [GS], [Le]. Let S(Rn ) be the
Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing C ∞ -functions on Rn and S ′ (Rn )
its dual. The Fourier transform of F ∈ S ′ (Rn ) is defined by
Z
n
hF̂ , φ̂i = (2π) hF, φi, φ̂(y) =
φ(x) eix*y dx, φ ∈ S(Rn ).
Rn

A distribution F ∈ S ′ (Rn ) is homogeneous of degree λ ∈ C if for any
φ ∈ S(Rn ) and any a > 0, hF, φ(x/a)i = aλ+n hF, φi. Homogeneous distributions on Rn are intimately connected with distributions on S n−1 .
Let first f ∈ L1 (S n−1 ), (Eλ f )(x) = |x|λ f (x/|x|), x ∈ Rn \ {0}. The
operator Eλ generates a meromorphic S ′ -distribution
Z ∞
Z
λ+n−1
hEλ f, φi = a.c.
r
u(r)dr, u(r) =
f (θ)φ(rθ)dθ,
S n−1

where "a.c." denotes analytic continuation in the λ-variable. The distribution Eλ f is regular if Re λ > −n and admits simple poles at
λ = −n, −n − 1, . . .. The above definition extends to all distributions
f ∈ D ′ (S n−1 ) by the formula
Z ∞
hEλ f, φi = a.c.
r λ+n−1u(r)dr, u(r) = (f, φ(rθ)), 1
0

′

and the map Eλ : D (S n−1) → S ′ (Rn ) is weakly continuous. If f
is orthogonal to all spherical harmonics of degree j, then the derivative u(j) (r) equals zero at r = 0 and the pole at λ = −n − j is
removable. In particular, if f is an even distribution, i.e., (f, φ) =
(f, φ− ), φ− (θ) = φ(−θ) ∀φ ∈ D(S n−1), then the only possible poles
of Eλ f are −n, −n − 2, −n − 4, . . . .
The Fourier transform of homogeneous distributions was extensively
studied by many authors; see [Sa3] and references therein. We restrict
our consideration to even distributions, when the operator family {M α }
defined by (2.9) naturally arises thanks to the formula
[E1−n−α f ]∧ = 21−α π n/2 Eα−1 M α f.

(4.1)

This formula amounts to Semyanistyi [Se]. If f ∈ De (S n−1 ), then (4.1)
holds pointwise for 0 < Re α < 1 (see, e.g., Lemma 3.3 in [R1] ) and
extends in the S ′ -sense to all α ∈ C satisfying
(4.2)

α∈
/ {1, 3, 5, . . .} ∪ {1 − n, −n − 1, −n − 3, . . .}.

1Here

and S

and on, different notations h*, *i and (*, *) are used for distributions on Rn
, respectively.

Since De (S n−1) is dense in De′ (S n−1) and the maps E1−n−α and Eα−1
are weakly continuous from De′ (S n−1 ) to S ′ (Rn ), then (4.1) extends to
all f ∈ De′ (S n−1 ).
Regarding the cases excluded in (4.2), we note that if α = 1 + 2l for
some l = 0, 1, . . ., then (4.1) is meaningful if and only if f is orthogonal
to all spherical harmonics of degree 2l. If α = 1 − n − 2l for some
l = 0,
P1, . . ., then, according to the spherical harmonic decomposition
f = j,k fj,k Yj,k , j even, formula (4.1) is substituted for the following:

where −∆ is the Laplace operator, ∂ = (∂/∂ξ1 , . . . , ∂/∂ξn ), and δ(ξ)
is the delta function. It is worth noting that for α = 1, 3, 5, . . ., the
distribution [E1−n−α f ]∧ can also be understood in the regularized sense
without any orthogonality assumptions. However, such regularization
does not preserve homogeneity; see [Sa1], [Sa3].
Our main concern is positivity and positive definiteness of even homogeneous distributions. The reader is referred to [GV] for the general
theory. A distribution F ∈ S ′ (Rn ) is positive if hF, φi ≥ 0 for all nonnegative φ ∈ S(Rn ). A similar definition holds for distributions on the
sphere and on Rn \ {0}. A distribution F ∈ S ′ (Rn ) is positive definite
if F̂ is positive. For our purposes, it is important to know, which even
homogeneous distributions are positive definite. Let us rewrite (4.1)
and (4.2) with 1 − n − α replaced by −λ. We have
(4.4)
(4.5)

[E−λ f ]∧ = 2n−λπ n/2 Eλ−n M 1+λ−n f,
λ∈
/ Λ0 ,

Λ0 = {n, n + 2, n + 4 . . .} ∪ {0, −2, −4, . . .}.

Theorem 4.1. Let λ ∈ R \ Λ0 , f ∈ De′ (S n−1).
(i) If λ < 0 and E−λ f is a positive definite distribution, then f = 0.
(ii) For all λ ∈ R \ Λ0 , the following statements are equivalent:
(a) [E−λ f ]∧ is a positive distribution on Rn \ {0} (for λ > 0, this can
be replaced by "E−λ f is a positive definite distribution on Rn ");
(b) M 1+λ−n f ∈ Me+ (S n−1 );
(c) f = M 1−λ μ for some measure μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ).
Furthermore, for any real λ 6= 0, −2, −4, . . ., and any i = 1, 2, . . . , n−1,
(c) is equivalent to
i−λ
μ for some measure μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ).

1+λ−n

and (Πt M
f )(θ) is the Poisson integral of M 1+λ−n f . If E−λ f is a
positive definite distribution, then, by (4.4), Eλ−n M 1+λ−n f is a positive
distribution. On the other hand, if λ < 0 and m > −λ, then cλ < 0.
Hence hEλ−n M 1+λ−n f, φi can be non-negative for every non-negative
φ ∈ S(Rn ) only if (Πt M 1+λ−n f )(θ) = 0 for every 0 < t < 1 and
θ ∈ S n−1 . The latter implies M 1+λ−n f = 0, which is equivalent to
f = 0 because M 1+λ−n is injective; see Lemma 3.2.
(ii) Let [E−λ f ]∧ be a positive distribution on Rn \ {0}. It means that
for every φ ∈ S(Rn ) such that φ ≥ 0 and 0 ∈
/ suppφ, h[E−λ f ]∧ , φi ≥ 0
or, by (4.4), hEλ−n M 1+λ−n f, φi ≥ 0. Choose φ(x) = ψ(|x|)ω(x/|x|),
where ω ∈ RD(S n−1), ω ≥ 0, and ψ is a smooth non-negative function

hEλ−n M 1+λ−n f, φi = (M 1+λ−n f, ω) ≥ 0,

5. λ-intersection bodies
5.1. Definitions and comments. We remind that Kn is the set of
all origin-symmetric star bodies K in Rn , n ≥ 2; ρK and || * ||K are the
radial function and the Minkowski functional of K. The following definitions and statements are motivated by Theorem 4.1 and the previous
consideration. Let λ be a real number,

if λ > 0, λ 6= n, n + 2, n + 4, . . . ,
(5.1)
sλ =
Γ(λ/2) if λ < 0, λ 6= −2, −4, . . . .

The values λ = 0, n, n + 2, n + 4, . . . will not be considered in the
following, but values λ = −2, −4, . . . will be included. They become
meaningful if we change normalization. For λ 6= 0, n, n + 2, n + 4 . . . ,
let Iλn be the set of bodies K ∈ Kn , for which there is a measure
μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ) such that sλ ρK = M 1−λ μ if λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, and
ρK = M̃ 1−λ μ ≡ M̃ 1+2l μ, otherwise. The equality sλ ρK = M 1−λ μ
means that for any φ ∈ D(S n−1),

where for λ ≥ 1, (M 1−λ φ)(θ) is understood in the sense of analytic
continuation. We remind the notation
Λ0 = {n, n + 2, n + 4 . . .} ∪ {0, −2, −4, . . .}.
Theorem 5.1. For λ ∈ R\Λ0, the following statements are equivalent:
(a) K ∈ Iλn ;
∧
(b) The Fourier transform [sλ || * ||−λ
K ] is a positive distribution on
Rn \ {0} (for λ > 0, this can be replaced by "|| * ||−λ
K is a positive definite
n
distribution on R ");
(c) sλ M 1+λ−n ρλK ∈ Me+ (S n−1 );
The theorem is an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.1 if the latter is applied to f = sλ ρλK . Another useful characterization is provided
by Theorem 4.1 (d).
Theorem 5.2. Let λ ∈ R \ Λ0 . If K ∈ Iλn , then for every i ∈
{1, 2, . . . , n−1} there is a measure μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ) such that sλ Ri ρλK =

BORIS RUBIN

Although Iλn was called "the set of bodies", the definition of this set
is purely analytic and extra work is needed to understand what bodies
(if any) actually constitute the class Iλn .
The following comments will be helpful.
1. The case λ > n is not so interesting, because by Theorem 5.1(c),
Iλn is either empty (if Γ((n − λ)/2) < 0) or coincides with the whole
class Kn (if Γ((n − λ)/2) > 0).
2. The case λ ∈ (0, n) agrees with the concept of isometric embedding of the space (Rn , || * ||K ) into L−p , p = λ; see Introduction. In the
framework of this concept, all bodies K ∈ Iλn can be regarded as "unit
balls of n-dimensional subspaces of L−λ ".
3. If K ∈ Iλn , where λ < 0 (one can replace λ by = −p, p > 0), then
Z
p
||u||K =
|θ * u|p dμ(θ)
S n−1

for some μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ). This is the well known Lévy representation,
characterizing isometric embedding of the space (Rn , || * ||K ) into Lp ;
see Lemma 6.4 in [K4]. Statement (b) in Theorem 5.1 agrees with
Theorem 1.9. Keeping this terminology, we can state the following
Proposition 5.3. Let p > −n, p 6= 0. Then (Rn , || * ||K ) embeds
n
isometrically in Lp if and only if K ∈ I−p
.
4. If λ = k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}, then Iλn = Ikn coincides with the class
of k-intersection bodies; see Definition 1.7 and Theorem 1.8. Theorems
5.1 and 5.2 provide new characterizations of this class.
These comments inspire the following
Definition 5.4. Let λ < n, λ 6= 0. A body K ∈ Kn is said to be a
λ-intersection body if K ∈ Iλn , or, in other words, if there is a measure
μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ) such that sλ ρλK = M 1−λ μ if λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, and
1+2l
ρ−2l
μ, otherwise.
K = M̃
The result of Theorem 5.2 for λ = i = k can serve as an alternative
definition of k-intersection bodies in terms of Radon transforms. This
definition agrees with Definition 1.6 and mimics Definition 1.2.
Definition 5.5. Let k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}. A body K ∈ Kn is a kintersection body if there is a non-negative measure μ on S n−1 such
that
(5.2)

(Rk ρkK )(ξ) = (Rn−k μ)(ξ ⊥ ),

ξ ∈ Gn,k .

5.2. λ-intersection bodies of star bodies and closure in the radial metric. As we mentioned in Introduction, the class of intersection
bodies, which coincides with Iλn when λ = 1, is the closure in the radial metric of the class of intersection bodies of star bodies. Below
we extend this result to all λ < n, λ 6= 0, in the framework of the
unique approach. We remind (see Definition 1.6) that K ∈ Kn is a
k-intersection body of a body L ∈ Kn and write K = IBk (L) if
(5.4)

volk (K ∩ ξ) = voln−k (L ∩ ξ ⊥ )

∀ξ ∈ Gn,k .

Let IBk,n be the set of all bodies K ∈ Kn satisfying (5.4) for some
L ∈ Kn .
How can we extend the purely geometric property (5.4) to noninteger values of k? To this end, we first express (5.4) in terms of
the generalized cosine transforms (2.9).
Lemma 5.6. If K = IBk (L) is infinitely smooth, then
(5.5)

ρLn−k = c M 1−n+k ρkK ,

ρkK = c−1 M 1−k ρLn−k ,

c = π k−n/2 (n − k)/k.
Proof. We make use of (3.13), where we set i = k, α = 1 − n + k and
f = ρkK . By (3.1), this gives
(5.6)

Rk ρkK = c̃Rn−k,⊥ M 1−n+k ρkK ,

c̃ =

π k−n/2 σn−k−1
.
σk−1

On the other hand, if K = IBk (L) is infinitely smooth, then, according
to (5.4) and the equality
σk−1
(5.7)
volk (K ∩ ξ) =
(Rk ρkK )(ξ),
k
we have
k σn−k−1
Rn−k,⊥ ρLn−k .
(5.8)
Rk ρkK =
(n − k) σk−1
Comparing (5.6) and (5.8), owing to injectivity of the Radon transform,
we obtain the first equality in (5.5). The second equality follows from
the first one by (3.5).

BORIS RUBIN

Equalities (5.5) are extendable to non-integer values of k. We denote
cλ,n = π λ−n/2 (n−λ)/λ,
and let sλ be defined by (5.1).
Definition 5.7. Let λ < n, λ 6= 0; K, L ∈ Kn . We say that K is a
1−λ n−λ
λ-intersection body of L and write K = IBλ (L) if sλ ρλK = c−1
ρL

1+2l n+2l

We also denote

IBλ,n

1−λ n−λ
By (3.5), equality sλ ρλK = c−1
ρL is equivalent to ρLn−λ =

sλ cλ,n M 1−n+λ ρλK . Both equalities are generally understood in the sense
of distributions, for instance,

If K (or L) is smooth, then sλ ρλK (θ) = c−1

λ,n (M

every θ ∈ S .

Theorem 5.8. Let λ < n, λ 6= 0. If λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, then the class
∞
Iλn of λ-intersection bodies is the closure of the classes IBλ,n and IBλ,n
of λ-intersection bodies of star bodies in the radial metric:
(5.10)

Iλn = cl IBλ,n = cl IBλ,n
.

∞
If λ = −2l, l ∈ N, then Iλn ⊂ cl IBλ,n = cl IBλ,n

Proof. STEP 1. We first prove that Iλn ⊂ cl IBλ,n

Our aim is to define a sequence Kj ∈ IBλ,n
such that ρKj → ρK in the
λ
C-norm. Consider the Poisson integral Πt ρK (see (2.1)), that converges
to ρλK in the C-norm when t → 1. In the case (a), for any test function

Similarly, in the case (b), we have a pointwise equality (Πt ρ−2l

(M̃ 1+2l Πt μ)(θ), θ ∈ S n−1 . Choose Kj so that ρλKj = Πtj ρλK , where tj is
a sequence in (0, 1) approaching 1. Clearly, Kj converges to K in the

Conversely, let K ∈ cl IBλ,n

sλ (ρλKj , M 1−n+λ ω) → sλ (ρλK , M 1−n+λ ω) = sλ (M 1−n+λ ρλK , ω).

The right-hand side of (5.11) is non-negative, because by (3.5), for
every j and every ω ∈ De+ (S n−1 ),

sλ (ρλKj , M 1−n+λ ω) = c−1

By Theorem 9.1, it follows that sλ M 1−n+λ ρλK is a non-negative measure. We denote it by μ. By (3.5), for any ω ∈ D(S n−1 ),
sλ (ρλK , ω) = sλ (M 1−n+λ ρλK , M 1−λ ω) = (μ, M 1−λ ω) = (M 1−λ μ, ω),

i.e., K ∈ Iλn . This gives IBλ,n

STEP 2. It remains to prove that cl IBλ,n = cl IBλ,n . Since IBλ,n

K ∈ cl IBλ,n and consider the case λ 6= −2, −4, . . . . We have to show
that there is a sequence of smooth bodies Kj , which converges to K in

as j → ∞. It means, that K ∈ cl IBλ,n

Remark 5.9. If λ = −2, −4, . . . , we cannot prove the coincidence of

relies heavily on the fact that M 1−λ is an isomorphism of De (S n−1 ). If

kernel, which consists of spherical harmonics of degree > 2l; see [R1]
for details.

Corollary 5.10.
(i) A unit ball of every n-dimensional subspace of Lp , can be approximated in the radial metric by bodies K, defined by (5.12), where L ∈ Kn
has a C ∞ boundary.
(ii) If, moreover, p 6= 2, 4, . . . , then the set of unit balls of all ndimensional subspaces of Lp , can be identified with the closure in the
radial metric of the set of bodies K satisfying (5.12) for some smooth
body L ∈ Kn (one can also consider arbitrary bodies L ∈ Kn ).
5.3. Central sections of λ-intersection bodies. It is known, that
a cross-section K ∩ η of a body K ∈ Ikn by any m-dimensional central
plane η is a k-intersection body in η provided 1 ≤ k < m < n. This
fact was established in [Mi1, Proposition 3.17] by using Theorem 1.8
and a certain approximation procedure. Below we present more general
results, including sections of k-intersection bodies of star bodies and
the case of non-integer k = λ. These results are consequences of the
restriction theorems from Section 3.3.
Theorem 5.11. Let 1 ≤ k < m < n, η ∈ Gn,m . If K = IBk (L) in Rn ,
then K ∩ η = IBk (L̃) in η, where the body L̃ is defined by

Theorem 5.11 has the following generalization.
Theorem 5.12. Let 1 < m < n, η ∈ Gn,m and suppose that λ < m,

body L̃ is defined by

Moreover, if K ∈ Iλ in R , then K ∩ η ∈ Iλm in η.

Proof. Let λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, and let θ ∈ S n−1 ∩ η. By Definition 5.7,
1−λ n−λ
sλ ρλK = c−1
ρL , and Theorem 3.12 (with f = sλ ρλK and g =

where ρL̃m−λ = c Tηλ ρLn−λ , c = π (n−m)/2 (m − λ)/(n − λ). By Definition

n−1 ∩η ρ
K (θ) = (M̃S n−1 ∩η Tη

where ρL̃m+2l = Tη−2l ρLn+2l . This gives (5.15).
Furthermore, if K ∈ Iλn , λ 6= −2l, l ∈ N, then, by Definition 5.4,
sλ ρλK = M 1−λ μ, μ ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ). Hence, by Theorem 3.12, there is
a measure ν ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ∩ η) such that the restriction of sλ ρλK onto
m
S n−1 ∩ η is represented as sλ ρλK = MS1−λ
n−1 ∩η ν. It means that K ∩ η ∈ Iλ
in η. In the case λ = −2l, l ∈ N, the argument is similar.

6. Examples of λ-intersection bodies
The definition of the classes Iλn and IBλ,n and all known characterizations are purely analytic. Unlike the case λ = 1, when an intersection
body of a star body is explicitly defined by a simple geometric procedure, it is not clear how can we construct λ−intersection bodies in the
general case. Below we give some examples, when the radial function
of a λ−intersection body can be explicitly determined. These examples
utilize the generalized cosine transforms.
Example 6.1. Let λ < 1, λ 6= 0. This case is the simplest. Indeed,
given a non-negative measure μ on S n−1 , the relevant λ−intersection

28

BORIS RUBIN

body can be directly constructed by the formula ρλK = M 1−λ μ, if λ 6=
1+2l
−2l, l ∈ N, and ρ−2l
μ, otherwise. In other words (cf. (2.11)),
K = M̃
Z
λ
(6.1)
ρK (u) =
|θ * u|−λ dμ(θ).
S n−1

This fact (with λ replaced by −p) is a reformulation of Theorem 6.17
from [K4], which was stated in the language of isometric embeddings
and relies on the P. Lévy characterization; see also Lemma 6.4 and
Theorem 4.11 in [K4].
Example 6.2. If n − 3 ≤ λ < n, λ > 0, then Iλn includes all originsymmetric convex bodies in Rn .
This fact is due to Koldobsky [K4, Corollary 4.9]. It can be proved
using a slight modification of the argument from [R3, Sec. 7] as follows.
By Theorem 5.1 (c), it suffices to check that for any o.s. convex body
K, M 1+λ−n ρλK ∈ Me+ (S n−1 ). For λ ≥ n − 1, this is obvious. To handle
the case n − 3 ≤ λ < n − 1, suppose first that K is infinitely smooth.
Using polar coordinates, for Re α > 0, we can write
Z
α α+n−1
(6.2)
(M ρK
)(u) = (α + n − 1) γn (α)
|x * u|α−1 dx.
K

M 1+λ−n ρλK

Then
can be realized as analytic continuation (a.c.) at α =
1 + λ − n of the right-hand side of (6.2). The latter can be written as
Z ∞
I(α) = 2(α + n − 1)γn (α)
tα−1 AK,u (t) dt,
0

⊥

AK,u (t) = voln−1 (K ∩{tu+u }). Taking analytic continuation (see [GS,
Chapter 1]), for −2 < α < 0 (which is equivalent to n − 3 ≤ λ < n − 1)
we get
Z
∞

a.c.I(α) = c1

0

tα−1 [AK,u (t) − AK,u (0)] dt.

Similarly, a.c.I(α) at α = −2 (which corresponds to λ = n − 3) is
c2 A′′K,u (0). Following [GS], one can easily check that constants c1 and
c2 are negative. Since K is convex, both analytic continuations are
positive, and therefore M 1+λ−n ρλK > 0. If K is an arbitrary o.s. convex
body, we approximate it in the radial metric by smooth o.s. convex
bodies Kj . Then for any test function ω ∈ D+ (S n−1 ), by the previous
step we have
(M 1+λ−n ρλK , ω) = (ρλK , M 1+λ−n ω) = lim (ρλKj , M 1+λ−n ω)
j→∞

see also [Mi2], where it is proved that Zn−i
is a proper subset of Iin if
2 ≤ i ≤ n − 2.

Example 6.4. If 0 < (i − 1)/2 < λ ≤ i < n and ρλK = M i−λ μ for some
μ ∈ M+ (S n−1 ), then K ∈ Iλn .
Indeed, by Lemma 3.4 (with α = i − λ, β = 1 − λ), ρλK = M i−λ μ =
M 1−λ Ai−λ,1−λ , where Ai−λ,1−λ is an integral operator which preserves
positivity provided i − λ > 1 − λ > 1 − n, (i − λ) + (1 − λ) < 2. This
is just our case.
Example 6.5. One can construct bodies K ∈ Iλn from bodies L ∈ Iδn
λ/δ
by the formula ρK = ρL provided 0 < δ < λ < n.
Indeed, by Definition 5.4, there is a measure μ ∈ M+ (S n−1 ) so that
ρδL = M 1−δ μ. Then, by Lemma 3.4 (with α = 1 − δ, β = 1 − λ),
ρλK = ρδL = M 1−δ μ = M 1−λ A1−δ,1−λ μ, and we are done. This example
generalizes the corresponding result from [Mi1, p. 533, Statement (c)],
which was obtained in a different way for the case, when λ and δ are
integers.

Both statements are due to Koldobsky. The first one follows from
the fact that for 0 < q ≤ 2 the Fourier transform of ||x||−λ
q is a positive
′
S -distribution (see Lemmas 3.6 and 2.27 in [K4]). The second statement is a reformulation of Theorem 4.13 from [K4]. The "if" part is a
consequence of Example 6.2.
7. (q, l)-balls
In this section we consider one more example, which resembles Example 6.6, but does not fall into its scope and requires a separate
consideration. Let
x = (x′ , x′′ ) ∈ Rn ,

q > 0.

n
We wonder, for which triples (q, l, n), Bq,l
is a λ-intersection body. To
study this problem, we need some preparation. Consider the Fourier
integral
Z
q
(7.2)
γq,l (η) =
e−|y| eiy*η dy,
η ∈ Rl ,
q > 0.
Rl

The function γq,l (η) is uniformly continuous on Rl and vanishes at
infinity.
Lemma 7.1. If 0 < q ≤ 2, then γq,l (η) > 0 for all η ∈ Rl .
Proof. (Cf. [K4, p. 44, for l = 1]). For η = 0, the statement is obvious.
It is known (see, e.g., [SW]), that
(7.3)

2

[e−t|* | ]∧ (η) = π l/2 t−l/2 e−|η|

2 /4t

,

t > 0.

This gives the result for q = 2. Let 0 < q < 2. By Bernstein's theorem
[F, Chapter 18, Sec. 4], there is a non-negative finite measure μq on
R∞
q/2
[0, ∞) so that e−z = 0 e−tz dμq (t), z ∈ [0, ∞). Replace z by |y|2 to

Our next concern is the behavior of γq,l (η) when |η| → ∞. If q
q
is even, then e−|*| is a Schwartz function and therefore, γq,l is infinitely smooth and rapidly decreasing. In the general case, we have the
following.
Lemma 7.2. For any q > 0,
(7.5)

lim |η|l+q γq,l (η) = 2l+q π l/2−1 Γ(1 + q/2)Γ((l + q)/2) sin(πq/2).

|η|→∞

Proof. For l = 1, this statement can be found in [PS, Chapter 3, Problem 154] and in [K4, p. 45]. In the general case, the proof is more
sophisticated and relies on the properties of Bessel functions. By the
well-known formula for the Fourier transform of a radial function (see,
e.g., [SW]), we write γq,l (η) = I(|η|), where

A0 = Re lθ hl/2 (z 1/q ) dz. To evaluate the last integral, we again use

n
Now we can proceed to studying (q, l)-balls Bq,l
; see (7.1). There is
n
an intimate connection between geometric properties of the balls Bq,l
and the Fourier transform of the power function || * ||pq,l. The case q = 2
is well-known and associated with Riesz potentials; see, e.g., [St]. The
relevant case of lnq -balls, which agrees with l = 1 was considered in
Example 6.6.

Lemma 7.3. Let q > 0, ξ = (ξ ′ , ξ ′′ ) ∈ Rn , γq,l (ξ ′′ ) and γq,n−l(ξ ′ ) be
the functions of the form (7.2). We define

(i) Let ξ 6= 0 and ξ 6= 0. If q is even, then the integral (7.8) is absolutely convergent for all p > −n. Otherwise, it is absolutely convergent
when −n < p < 2q. In these cases, hp,q,l (ξ) is a locally integrable
function away from the coordinate subspaces Rl and Rn−l .
(ii) If −n < p < 0, then hp,q,l (ξ) ∈ L1loc (Rn )∩S ′ (Rn ) and (||*||pq,l)∧ (ξ) =
hp,q,l(ξ) in the sense of S ′ -distributions. Specifically, for φ ∈ S(Rn ),

If qR is even, then γq,l and γq,n−l are rapidly decreasing and I2 ≤

this case, I2 does not exceed ||γq,n−l ||1||γq,l ||1 1 tp−1 dt. The latter is
finite when p < 0, because, by Lemma 7.2, γq,n−l and γq,l are integrable
functions on respective spaces. When ξ → ∞, one can readily check
that hp,q,l (ξ) = O(|ξ|m) for some m > 0, and therefore, hp,q,l ∈ S ′ (Rn ).

Theorem 7.4. If 0 < q ≤ 2, 0 < l < n, then Bq,l
is a λ-intersection
body for any 0 < λ < n.

Proof. Owing to Lemma 7.1, the function (7.8) (with p replaced by −λ)
is positive, and therefore, by Lemma 7.3, || * ||−λ
q,l represents a positive
definite distribution. Now the result follows by Theorem 5.1.

n
Consider the case q > 2. In this case Bq,l
is convex, and, owing to
n
n
Example 6.2, Bq,l ∈ Iλ for all n − 3 ≤ λ < n. What about λ < n − 3?
This case is especially intriguing.
−λ
Proposition 7.5. If q > 2 and 0 < λ < max(n − l, l) − 2, then || * ||q,l
n
is not a positive definite distribution and therefore, Bq,l
6∈ Iλn .

n
Proof. Let 0 < λ < n − l − 2 and suppose the contrary, that Bq,l
∈ Iλn .
n
Consider the section of Bq,l
by the (n − l + 1)-dimensional plane η =
n−l
n
Ren ⊕ R . By Theorem 5.12, Bq,l
∩ η ∈ Iλn−l+1 in η, and therefore

||xn en + x′′ ||λq,l = (|xn |q + |x′′ |q )−λ/q

is a positive definite distribution in η. By the second derivative text (see
[K4, Theorem 4.19]) this is impossible if 0 < λ < n − l − 2. A similar
contradiction can be obtained if we assume 0 < λ < l − 2 and consider
n
the section of Bq,l
by the (l + 1)-dimensional plane Re1 ⊕ Rl .

Proposition 7.5 can be proved without using the second derivative
text and Theorem 5.12 on sections of λ-intersection bodies; see [R4].
The bounds for λ appear to be the same.
n
Open problem. Let q > 2, l > 1. Is Bq,l
a λ-intersection body if
max(n − l, l) − 2 < λ < n − 3?
This problem does not occur in the case l = 1 as in Example 6.6.

8. The generalized cosine transforms and comparison of
volumes
For 1 < i < n, let voli (*) denote the i-dimensional volume function.
Suppose that i is fixed, and let A and B be o.s. convex bodies in Rn
satisfying
(8.1)

voli (A ∩ ξ) ≤ voli (B ∩ ξ) ∀ξ ∈ Gn,i .

Does it follow that
(8.2)

voln (A) ≤ voln (B) ?

This question is known as the Generalized Busemann-Petty Problem
(GBP); see [G], [RZ], [Z1].
Theorem 8.1. If GBP (8.1)-(8.2) has an affirmative answer, then
every smooth origin-symmetric convex body with positive curvature in
Rn is an (n − i)-intersection body.
Proof. Suppose that B is an o.s. convex body in Rn so that the radial
function ρB is infinitely smooth, the boundary of B has a positive curvan
ture and B ∈
/ In−i
. By Definition 5.4, there is a function φ ∈ De (S n−1 ),
which is negative on some open origin-symmetric set Ω ⊂ S n−1 and
n−i
such that ρB
= M 1+i−n φ. We choose a function h ∈ De (S n−1 ) so
that h 6≡ 0, h(θ) ≥ 0 if θ ∈ Ω and h(θ) ≡ 0 otherwise. Define an o.s.
smooth body A by ρiA = ρiB − εM 1−i h, ε > 0. If ε is small enough,
0
then A is convex. Since by (3.12), Ri M 1−i h = c Rn−i,⊥
h ≥ 0, then
i
i
Ri ρA ≤ Ri ρB , which gives (8.1). On the other hand, by (3.5),
n−i i
(ρB
, ρB − ρiA ) = ε(M 1+i−n φ, M 1−i h) = ε(φ, h) < 0,

n−i i
n−i i
or (ρB
, ρB ) < (ρB
, ρA ). By Hölder's inequality, this implies voln (B) <
voln (A), which contradicts (8.2).


Remark 8.2. As we noted in Introduction, Theorem 8.1 is not new, and
its proof given in [K3] relies on a sequence of deep facts from functional
analysis. The proof presented above is much more elementary and
constructive. For instance, it allows us to keep invariance properties of
the bodies under control. This advantage was essentially used in our
paper [R4].
Theorem 8.1 and Proposition 7.5 imply the following
n
Corollary 8.3. Let 1 ≤ l ≤ n/2; i > l + 2, B = B4,l
(see (7.1)). Then
n
there is a smooth o.s. convex body A in R so that (8.1) holds but (8.2)
fails.

36

BORIS RUBIN

Setting l = 1 in this statement, we obtain the well-known BourgainZhang theorem, which states that GBP has a negative answer when
3 < i < n; see [BZ], [K4], [RZ] on this subject. For i = 2 and i = 3
(n ≥ 5) the GBP is still open. An affirmative answer in these cases
was obtained in [R4] for bodies having a certain additional symmetry.
9. Appendix
Every positive distribution F ∈ RS ′ (Rn ) is given by a tempered nonnegative measure μ, i.e., hF, φi = φ(x)dμ(x); see, e.g., [GV, p.147]).
For convenience of the reader, we present a similar fact for the sphere.
Theorem 9.1. A distribution f ∈ D ′ (S n−1 ) is positive if and only if
there is a measure μ ∈ M+ (S n−1 ) such that
Z
(f, φ) =
φ(θ)dμ(θ)
∀φ ∈ D(S n−1).
S n−1

Proof. This statement is known, however, we could not find precise reference and decided to give a proof for convenience of the reader. The
"if" part is obvious. To prove the " only if" part, we write a test function φ ∈ D(S n−1) as a sum φ = φ1 +iφ2 , where φ1 = Re φ, φ2 = Im φ.
Since −||φ||C(S n−1 ) ≤ φj ≤ ||φ||C(S n−1) , j = 1, 2, and f is positive, then
−(f, 1) ||φ||C(S n−1) ≤ (f, φj ) ≤ (f, 1) ||φ||C(S n−1) ,

and therefore, |(f, φ)| ≤ |(f, φ1 )| + |(f, φ2 )| ≤ 2(f, 1) ||φ||C(S n−1) . Since
D(S n−1) is dense in C(S n−1 ), then f extends as a linear continuous
functional f ̃ on C(S n−1 ) and, by the RRiesz theorem, there is a measure μ on S n−1 such that (f ̃, ω) = S n−1 ω(θ)dμ(θ) for every ω ∈
R
 ̃ φ) = n−1 φ(θ)dμ(θ) for every
C(S n−1). In particular, (f, φ) = (f,
S
φ ∈ D(S n−1 ). By taking into account that every non-negative function
ω ∈ C(S n−1 ) can be uniformly approximated by non-negative functions
φk ∈ D(S n−1) (for instance, by Poisson integrals of ω), we get
Z
Z
φk (θ)dμ(θ) = lim (f, φk ) ≥ 0.
ω(θ)dμ(θ) = lim
S n−1

k→∞

S n−1

The latter means that μ is non-negative.
