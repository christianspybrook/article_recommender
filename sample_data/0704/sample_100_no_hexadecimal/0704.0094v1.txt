We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy
cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential
models which fit the lensing data. Marginally consistent CDM models in Newtonian gravity are
found with a total mass MCDM = 1 × 1015 M⊙ of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with
VDM = 3000 km s−1 , and the "bullet" X-ray gas can move with Vgas = 4200 km s−1 . These are
nearly the maximum speeds that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a
Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000 − 5400 km s−1 ), and the bullet gas would not be bound
by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with VDM ∼ 4500 km s−1 ∼ Vgas would invoke
unrealistic large amount MCDM = 7 × 1015 M⊙ of CDM for a cluster containing only ∼ 1014 M⊙ of
gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of 4500 km s−1 is easily
obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian
model with hot dark matter MHDM ≤ 0.6×1015 M⊙ and CDM model with a halo mass ≤ 1×1015 M⊙
are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.

POTENTIAL FROM TIMING

Timing is a unique technique to establish the case for
dark matter halos, first and most throughly explored in
the context of the Local Group (Kahn & Woljter 1959,
Fich & Tremaine 1991, Peebles 1989, Inga & Saha 1998).
In its simplest version the Local Group consists of the
Milky Way and M31 as two isolated point masses, which
formed close to each other, moved apart due to the Hubble expansion, and slowed down and moved towards each
other upto their present velocity ∼ 120 km s−1 and separation (about 700 kpc) due to their mutual gravity. The
age of the universe sets the upper limit on the period of
this galaxy pair, hence the total mass of the pair through
Kepler's 3rd law assuming Newtonian gravity.
Timing also finds a timely application in the pair of
merging galaxy clusters 1E0657-56 at redshift z = 0.3,
which is largely an extra-galactic grand analogy of the
M31-MW system. The sub-cluster, called the "bullet",
presently penetrates 400-700 kpc through the main clus−1
ter with an apparent speed of ∼ 4750+710
(Marke−550 km s
vitch 2006). The X-ray gas of the bullet (amounts to
2 × 1013M⊙ ) collides with the X-ray gas of the main cluster (with the total gas up to 1014 M⊙ ) and forms a Mach-3
cone in front of the "bullet". The two clusters have at
least four different centers, which are offset by 400 kpc
between the pair of X-ray gas centers and by 700 kpc
between the pair of star-light centers, which coincides
with the gravitational lensing centers and (dark matter)
potential centers (Clowe et al. 2006). The penetration
speed is unusually high, hard for standard cosmology to
explain statistically (Hayashi & White 2006), and modi-

fied force law has been suggested (Farrar & Rosen 2006,
Angus et al. 2007).
The timing method applies in in MONDian gravity
as well as Newtonian. Like lensing, timing is merely a
method about constraining potential distribution, and is
only indirectly related to the matter distribution. In this
Letter we model the bullet clusters as a pair of mass concentrations formed at high redshift, and set constraint on
their mutual force using the simple fact that their radial
oscillation period must be close to the age of universe
at z = 0.3. We check the consistency with the lensing
signal of the cluster and give interpretations in terms of
standard CDM and MOND.
First we can understand the speed of the bullet cluster analytically in simplified scenarios. Approximate the
two clusters as points of fixed masses M1 and M2 on a
head-on orbit, we can apply the usual MW-M31 timing
argument. The total mass M0 = M1 + M2 is constant.

ratio.
The predictions for simple Newtonian Keplerian gravity are given in Fig. 1; the more subtle case for a MONDian cluster is discussed in the final section. Setting the
orbital period T = 10Gyrs, the age of the universe at
the cluster redshift, yields presently V ∼ 3200 km s−1 in
Newtonian for a normal combined mass of M1 + M2 =
(0.7 − 1) × 1015 M⊙ for the clusters, which is about 7-10
times their baryonic gas content (∼ 1014 M⊙ ) for Newtonian universe of Ω = 0.3 cold dark matter. In agreement
with Farrar & Rosen and Hayashi & White, the simple timing argument suggests that dark halo velocities
of 4750 km s−1 , as high as the "bullet" X-ray gas, would
require halos with unrealistically larger masses of dark
matter, ∼ 1016 M⊙ , an order of magnitude more than
what a universal baryon-dark ratio implies. As a sanity
check, assuming a conventional 3 × 1012 M⊙ Local Group
dark matter mass Fig.1 predicts the relative velocity of
∼ 100km/s for the M31-MW system at separation 700
kpc after 14 Gyrs, consistent with observation (Binney
& Tremaine 1987).
These analytical arguments, while straightforward, are
not precise given its simplifying assumptions. For one,
clusters do not form immediately at redshift infinity, and
the cluster mass and size might grow with time graduallly. More important is that point mass Newtonian halo
models are far from fitting the weak lensing data of the
1E0657-56. A shallower Newtonian potential makes it
even more difficult to accelerate the bullet. On the other
hand, Angus, Shan, Zhao, Famaey (2007) show that there
are MOND-inspired potentials that fits lensing. As commented in their conclusion, the same potential is deep
enough that a V = 4750 km s−1 "bullet" is bound in an
orbit of apocenter rmax of a few Mpc, so the two clusters could be accelerated by mutual gravity from a zero
velocity apocenter to 4750 km/s within the clusters' lifetime. This line of thought was further explored by the
more systematic numerical study of Angus & McGaugh
(2007).
Our paper is a spin-off of these works and the works
of Hayashi & White and Farrar & Rosen. We emphasize
the unification of the semi-analytical timing perspective
and the lensing perspective, and aim to derive robust
constraints to the potential, without being limited to a

specific gravity theory or dark matter candidate.
Towards the completion of this work, we are made
aware by the preprint of Springel & Farrar (2007) that the
unobserved bullet DM halo could be moving slower than
its observed stripped X-ray gas. These authors, as well
as the preprint of Milosovic et al. (2007), emphasized the
effect of hydrodynamical pressure, which we will not be
able to model realisticly here. But to address the velocity
differences, instead we treat the X-ray gas as a "bullestic
particle". We argue that our hypothetical ballistic particle must move slow enough to be bound to vicinity of the
subhalo before the collision, but moves somewhat faster
−1
than 4700+700
now, since it does not experience
−550 km s
ram pressure of the gas. This model follows the spirit
of classical timing models of the separation of the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Magellanic Stream
(Lin & Lynden-Bell 1982).

3D POTENTIAL FROM LENSING

The weak lensing shear map of Clowe et al. (2006)
has been fitted by Angus et al. (2007) using a fourcomponent analytical potential each being spherical but
on different centres. For our purpose we redistribute the
minor components and simplify the potential into two
components centred on the moving centroid of galaxy
light of the main cluster with the present spatial coordinates r1 (t) = (−564, −176, 0) kpc and subcluster galaxy
centroid r2 (t) = (145, 0, 0) kpc; the coordinate origin is
set at the present brightest point of the "bullet" X-ray

gas; presently the cluster is at z = 0.3 or cosmic time
t = 10Gyrs. We also apply a Keplerian truncation to the
potential beyond the truncation radius rt . So the following 3D potential is adopted for the cluster 1E0657-56 at

The truncation rt evolves with time, since a pre-cluster
region collapses gradually after the big bang, and its
boundary and total mass grows with time till it reaches
the size of a cluster. In the interests of simplicity rather
than rigour, we use a linear model rt = C × t, where C
is a constant of the unit kpc/Gyr.
To check that the simplified potential is still consistent with weak lensing data, we recompute the 3D weak
lensing convergence (Taylor et al. 2004) for sources at
distance D(0, zs ) at the redshift zs ,

the distance increases by a factor 1.3 to 1.6 for source
redshifts of 3 to infinity. Fig.2 shows the predicted κ
along the line joining the two dark centers; the result
is insensitive to the cluster truncation radius as long as
rt ≥ 1000kpc presently. The lensing model predicts a
signal in between that of the weak lensing data of Clowe
et al., and strong lensing data of Bradac et al. It is
known that these two data sets are somewhat discrepant
to each other. So the fit here is reasonable. The method
is deprojection is essentially similar to the decomoposition method of Bradac et al. whose explicit assumption
of Einsteinian gravity is however unnecessary.
The important thing here is that as far as deprojecting the above potential is concerned, no assumption is
needed on the gravity theory as long as light rays follow geodesics, a feature built in most alternative gravity theory. Similarly orbits of massive particles are also
(different) geodesics in these theories. The meaning of
potential in such theories is that the potential (scaled by
a factor 2/c2 ) represents metric perturbations to the flat

ORBITS OF THE COLLIDING CLUSTERS

We now use this potential to predict the relative speed
of the two clusters. This is possible using the classical
timing argument, in the style of Kahn & Wolter (159),
Fich & Tremaine (1991) and Voltonen et al. (1998);
we postpone most rigourous least action models (Peebles 1989, Schmoldt & Saha 1998) for later investigations since these require modeling a cosmological constant and other mass concentrations along the orbital
path of the bullet clusters, which have technical issues in
non-Newtonian gravity. We trace the orbits of the two
centroids of the potentials according to the equation of
2
motion ddtr2i = −∇Φ(ri ). We assign different relative velocities presently (at z = 0.3), and integrate backward
in time and require the two centroids of the potential be
close together at a time 10 Gyrs ago. The motions are
primarily in the sky plane, but we allow for 600 km/s
relative velocity component in the line of sight. Clearly
at earlier times when t is small, the two centroids are
well-separated compared to their sizes, so they move in
the growing Keplerian potential of each other. At latter times the centroids came close and move in the cored

isothermal potential.
We shall consider models with a normal truncation
rt = C × t = 1000 kpc at time t = 10 Gyrs. We also
consider models with a very large truncation C × t =
10000 kpc. In the language of CDM, the truncation
means the virial radius of the halo. The present instantaneous escapepspeed of the model can be computed by Vesc =
−2Φ(X, Y, Z, t). We find Vesc ∼
4200 − 4500 km s−1 in the central region of the shallower
potential model with a present truncation 1000 kpc. The
escape speed increases to Vesc ∼ 5700 km s−1 for models
with a present truncation 10000 kpc.
Fig. 3 shows the predicted orbits for different present
dr1
2
relative velocities VDM = | dr
dt − dt |. Among models
with a normal truncation, we find VDM ∼ 2950 km s−1 ; a
model with relative velocity VDM < 2800 km s−1 would
predict an unphysical orbital crossing at high redshift,
while models with VDM > 3000 km s−1 would predict
that the two potential centroids were never close at high
redshift.
Larger halo velocities are only possible in models
with very large truncation. If the relative velocity is
4200 km s−1 < VDM < 4750 km s−1 between two cluster gravity centroids, then the truncation must be as big
as 10Mpc at z = 0.3.
We also track the orbit of the bullet X-ray gas centroid as a tracer particle in the above bi-centric potential. We look for orbits where the bullet X-ray gas will
always be bound to one member of the binary system
since the ram pressure in a hydrodynamical collision is
unlikely to be so efficient to eject the X-ray gas out of
potential wells of both the main and sub-clusters. This
means that the bullet speed must not exceed greatly the
present instantaneous escape speed of the model, which is
∼ 4200 − 4500 km s−1 in the central region of the shallow
potential of a model with a present truncation 1000 kpc.
The escape speed increases to ∼ 5700 km s−1 for models
with a present truncation 10000 kpc. The model with
normal truncation is marginally consistent with the ob−1
served gas speed Vgas ∼ 4750+710
. The problem
−550 km s
would become more severe if the potential were made
shallower by an even smaller truncation. The gas speed
is less an issue in models with larger truncation.
In short the present velocity and lensing data are easier explained with potential models of very large truncation. Models with normal truncation have smaller
gravitational power, can only accelerate the subhalo to
3000 km s−1 in 10 Gyrs. Models with normal CDM truncation can only accelerate the bullet X-ray gas cloud to
∼ 4200 − 4400 km s−1 , the escape speed, marginally consistent with observations.
Above simulation results are sensitive to the present
cluster separation, but insensitive to the present direction of the velocity vector. Unmodeled effects such as
dynamical friction associated with a live halo will reduce
the predicted VDM for the same potential, but the effect
is mild since the actual collision is brief ∼ 0.1 − 0.3Gyrs

NEWTONIAN AND MONDIAN MEANINGS
OF THE POTENTIAL MODEL

Assuming Newtonian gravity the models with normal
truncation rt = 1Mpc at t = 10Gyrs correspond to cluster (dark) masses of M1 = 0.745 × 1015 M⊙ and M2 =
0.345 × 1015M⊙ ; the larger truncation rt = 10Mpc corresponds to M1 = 7.45 × 1015M⊙ and M2 = 3.45 × 1015M⊙
in Newtonian. All these models fit lensing.
Interpreted in the MONDian gravity, the truncation
is due to external field effect and cosmic background

5
so to make the MOND potential finite hence escapable
(Famaey, Bruneton, Zhao 2007). Beyond the truncation radius, MOND potential becomes nearly Keplerian. The MONDian models, insensitive to truncation, would have masses only M1 = 0.66 × 1015 M⊙ and
M2 = 0.16 × 1015 M⊙ . These masses are still higher
than their baryonic content ∼ 1014 M⊙ , implying the
need for, e.g., massive neutrinos; the neutrino density
is too low in galaxies to affect normal MONDian fits to
galaxy rotation curves, but is high enough to bend light
and orbits significantly on 1Mpc scale. The neutrino-tobaryon ration, approximately 7:1 in the bullet cluster,
would be a reasonable assumption for a MONDian universe with Ωb ∼ 0.04 plus 2eV neutrinos hot dark matter
ΩHDM ∼ 0.25 ∼ 7 × Ωb (Sanders 2003, Pointecoute &
Silk 2005, Skordis et al. 2006, Angus et al. 2007). The
amount of hot dark matter inferred here is the same as
Angus et al. (2007) since their potential parameters are
fixed by the same lensing data.
V.

relative speeds between galaxies of the two clusters is predicted to be VDM ∼ 2900 km s−1 in CDM and VDM ∼
4500 km s−1 in μHDM (MOND + Hot Dark Matter) if
the two clusters were born close to each other 10 Gyrs
ago; both models assume close to universal gas-DM ratio
in clusters, i.e., about (0.6 − 1) × 1015 M⊙ Hot or Cold
DM. Modeling the bullet X-ray gas as ballistic particle,
we find the gas particle with speed of Vgas = 4200km/s
(at the lower end of observed speed) is bound to the
potential of the subcluster for most part of the Hubble
time for both above models, insensitive to the preference
of the law of gravity. But if future relative proper motion measurements of the subcluster galaxy speed is as
high as VDM = 4500km/s, or the gas speed is as high as
Vgas ∼ 5400 km s−1 , then Newtonian models would need
to invoke unlikely 7 × 1015 M⊙ DM halos around 1014 M⊙
gas.

CONCLUSION

In short a consistent set of simple lensing and dynamical model of the bullet cluster is found. The present
