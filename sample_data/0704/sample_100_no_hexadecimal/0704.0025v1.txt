1 Introduction
Theoretical study of polarons in the strongly correlated system is like an attempt to view contents of a Pandora box embedded into another, even more
sinister and obscure, container of riddles, enigmas and mysteries. This desperate situation occurs because solution is not known even for the simplest
polaron problem, i.e. when a perfectly stable quasiparticle (QP) with momentum as a single quantum number interacts with a well defined bath of
bosonic elementary excitations. To the contrary, the definition of the strongly
correlated system implies that QPs might be highly unstable and the very
notion of QPs, both in electronic and bosonic subsystems, is under question.
Thus, one faces the problem of an interplay between ill defined objects and
it is crucial to solve the problem without approximations. Further difficulty,
pertinent to realistic systems, is an interplay of the momentum and other
quantum numbers characterizing internal states of a QP.
The problem of polaron originally emerged as that of an electron coupled
to phonons (see [1, 2]). In the initial formulation a structureless QP is characterized by the only quantum number, momentum, which changes due to
interaction of the QP with phonons [3, 4]. Later, depending on what can be
called "particle" and "environment", and how they interact with each other,
the polaron concept was related to extreme diversity of physical phenomena.
There are many other objects which, having nothing to do with phonons, are
isomorphic to simple polaron [5], as, e.g. an exciton-polaron in the intraband
scattering approximation [6, 7, 8, 9]. Another example is the problem of a hole
in the antiferromagnet which is closely related to polaron since hole movement
is accompanied by the spin flips which, in the spin wave approximation, are
equivalent to creation and annihilation of magnons [10, 11].

The concept of polaron was further generalized to include internal degrees
of freedom which, interacting with environment, change their quantum numbers. Example of a complex QP is the Jahn-Teller polaron, where electronphonon interaction (EPI) changes quantum numbers of degenerate electronic
states [12, 13, 14]. This generalization is important due to it's relevance to
the colossal magnetoresistance phenomena in the manganese oxides [15, 16].
Another example is the pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, where EPI is inelastic
and leads to transitions between close in energy electronic levels of a QP
[17, 18, 19]. Further generalization is a system of several QPs which interact
both with each other and environment. For example, effective interaction of
two electrons through exchange by phonons can overcome the Coulomb repulsion and form a bound state, bipolaron [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. On the other hand,
coupling of attracting hole and electron to the lattice vibrations [25, 26, 27]
can create a lot of qualitatively different objects: localized exciton, weakly
bound pair of localized hole and localized electron, etc. [28, 7]. Scattering by
impurities introduces additional complexity to the polaron problem because
interference of impurity potential with lattice distortion, which accompanies
the polaron movement, can contribute either constructively or destructively
to the localization of a QP on impurity [29, 30, 7].
In addition, a bare QP and bosonic bath can not be considered as well
defined in the correlated systems. Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectra
(ARPES), revealing the Lehmann Function (LF) of quasiparticle, demonstrate
broad peaks in many correlated systems: cooper oxide high-temperature superconductors [31, 32, 33], colossal magnetoresistive manganites [34, 35, 36],
quasi-one-dimensional Peierls conductors [37, 38], and Verwey magnetites [39].
Besides, phonons are also broadened in many correlated systems, e.g. in hightemperature semiconductors [40] and mixed-valent materials [41, 42]. One of
possible reasons for these broadenings is the interaction of the QPs with the
lattice degrees of freedom. However, in many realistic cases other subsystems,
not explicitly included into the polaron Hamiltonian, are responsible for the
decay of QP and phonons, e.g., another electronic bands, phonon anharmonicity, interaction with nuclear spins, etc. Then, if this auxiliary broadening is
known in some approximation, one can formulate an ambitious goal to study
spectral response when "bare" quasiparticle with known damping interacts
with "broadened" bosonic excitations.
No one of traditional numerical methods, to say nothing of analytical ones,
can give approximation free results for measurable quantities of polaron, such
as optical conductivity or angle resolved photoemission spectra, for in macroscopic system of arbitrary dimension. Besides, we are not aware of any numerical method which can incorporate in an approximation free way the information on the damping of QP and bosonic bath. Below we describe basics of recently developed Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DMC) method for numerically
exact computation of Green functions and correlation functions in imaginary
time for few polarons in a macroscopic system [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51].
Analytic continuation of imaginary time functions to real frequencies is per-

formed by a novel approximation free approach of stochastic optimization
(SO) [45, 50, 51], circumventing difficulties of popular Maximal Enthropy
method. Finally we focus on results of application of the DMC-SO machinery
to various problems [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]
The basic models, related to the polaronic objects in correlated systems,
which can be solved by DMC-SO methods, are stated in the next Sect. It
is followed in Sect. 1.2 by description of stumbling blocks encountered by
analytic methods. Sect. 2 concerns the basics of DMC-SO methods. However,
those who are not interested in the details of the methods can briefly look
through the definitions in the introduction for Sect. 2 and turn to Sect. 3
where LF and optical conductivity of Fröhlich polaron are discussed (see also
[58]). Results of studies of the self-trapping phenomenon are presented in Sect.
4 and application of DMC-SO methods to the exciton problem can be found
in Sect. 5. The chapter is completed by Sect. 6 devoted to studies of ARPES
of high temperature superconductors.
1.1 Formulation of a General Model with Interacting Polarons
In general terms, the simplest problem of a complex polaronic object, where
center-of-mass motion does not separate from the rest of degrees of freedom,
is introduced as system of two QPs

Complicated model (1)-(6) is still too far from the cases encountered in
strongly correlated systems. Due to coupling of QPs (1) and (5) and bosonic
fields (4) to additional degrees of freedom, these excitations are not well defined from the onset. Namely, the dispersion relation of the QP spectrum ǫ(k)
in realistic system is ill-defined. One can speak of a Lehmann Function (LF)
[59, 60, 61] of a QP

δ(ω − Eν (k)) |hν|a†k |vaci|2

,which is normalized to unity 0 dωLk (ω) = 1 and can be interpreted as
a probability that a QP has momentum k and energy ω. (Here {|νi} is a
complete set of eigenstates of Hamiltonian Ĥ in a sector of given momentum
k: H |ν(k)i = Eν (k) |ν(k)i.) Only for noninteracting system the LF reduces
to delta function LNONINT
(ω) = δ(ω − ǫ(k)) and, thus, sets up dispersion
k
relation ω = ǫ(k).
Specific cases of model (1)-(6) describe enormous variety of physical problems. Hamiltonians (1) and (2), in case of attractive potential U(p, k, k′ ) > 0,
describe an exciton with static screening [62, 63]. Besides, expressions (1)-(4)
describe bipolaron for repulsive interaction [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] U(p, k, k′ ) < 0
and exciton-polaron otherwise [25, 26, 27]. The simplest model for excitonphonon interaction, when only two (T = 2) lowest states of relative electronhole motion are relevant (e.g. in one-dimensional charge-transfer exciton
[64, 65, 66]), is defined by Hamiltonians (4)-(6)). The same relations (4)-(6)
describe the problems of Jahn-Teller [all ǫi in Hamiltonian (5) are the same]
and pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron. The problem of a hole in an antiferromagnet
in spin-wave approximation is expressed in terms of Hamiltonians (4)-(6) with
Q = 1 and T = 1. When hole also interacts with phonons, one has to take into
account one more bosonic branch and set Q = 2 in (4) and (6). Finally, the
simplest nontrivial problem of a polaron, i.e. of a structureless QP interacting
with one phonon branch, is described by noninteracting Hamiltonians of QP

The simplest polaron problem, in turn, can be subdivided into continuous and
lattice polaron models.
1.2 Limitations of Analytic Methods in Problem of Polarons
Analytic solution for the problem of exciton in a rigid lattice is available
only for small radius Frenkel regime [67] and large radius Wannier regime
[68]. However, even limits of validity for these approximations are not known.
Random phase approximation approaches [62, 63], are capable of obtaining
some qualitative conclusions for intermediate radius regime though its' quantitative results are not reliable due to uncontrolled errors. The situation is
similar with the problem of structureless polaron, where analytic solutions
are known only in the weak and strong coupling regimes. Besides, reliable
results for these regimes are available only for ground state properties.
Although several novel methods, capable of obtaining properties of excited
states, were developed recently, variational coherent-states expansion [69] and
free propagator momentum average summation [70] as a few examples, all of
them, to provide reliable data in a specific regime, need either comparison
with exact sum rules [71, 72] or with exact numerical results.
Application of variational methods to study of excitations is a tricky issue since, strictly speaking, they are valid only for the ground state. As an
example for the importance of sum rules in variational treatment, we refer
to the problem of the optical conductivity of the Fröchlich polaron. Possibility of existence of Relaxed Excited State (RES), which is a metastable state
where lattice deformation has adjusted to the electronic excitation rendering
stability and narrow linewidth of the spectroscopic response, was briefly mentioned by S. I. Pekar in early 50's. Then, conception of RES was rigorously
formulated by J. T. Devreese with coworkers and has been a subject of extensive investigations for years [5, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 48, 57]. Calculations of
impedance [75] in the framework of technique [78] supported the existence of
a narrow stable peak in the optical conductivity. However, even the authors
of [75] were skeptical about the fact that the width of RES in the strong
coupling regime appeared to be more narrow than the phonon frequency, i.e.
inverse time which is, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is
required for the lattice readaptation. In consequent paper [77] they realized
the importance of many-phonon processes and studied two-phonon contribution to optical conductivity. Importance of many phonon processes was
confirmed when variational results [75] were compared with exact DMC simulations [48]. Variational result well reproduced the position of the peak in
exact data though failed in description of the peak width in the strong coupling regime [48]. Finally, when approach [75] was modified and several sum
rules were accurately introduced into variational model [57], both position

and width of the peak were quantitatively reproduced. Studies [57] (see Sect.
3.1), do not address rather philosophical question whether RES exists or not,
though inevitably prove that, in contrast to the foregoing beliefs, there in no
stable excited state of the Fröhlich polaron in the strong coupling regime.
Note that sometimes excited states can not be handled by analytic methods
even for weak couplings: perturbation theory expression for LF of the Fröhlich
polaron model diverges at the phonon energy ωph [See (34) in Sect. 3.1.] and
more elaborate treatment is necessary.
Difficulties of semianalytic methods enhance in the intermediate coupling
regime where results are sometimes wrong even for ground state properties.
For example, the variatioanl approach [79], which has been considered as an
intermediate coupling theory, appeared to be valid only in the weak coupling
limit [45]. Special interest to the methods, giving reliable information on excited states, is triggered by the self-trapping phenomenon which occurs just
in the intermediate coupling regime. This phenomenon is a dramatic transformation of QP properties when system parameters are slightly changed
[3, 7, 9, 80]. In the intermediate coupling regime "trapped" QP state with
strong lattice deformation around it and "free" state with weakly perturbed
lattice may hybridize and resonate because of close energies at some critical
value of electron-lattice interaction γc . It is clear that, to study self-trapping,
one has to apply a method giving reliable information on excited states in the
intermediate coupling regime.

2 Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic
Optimization Methods
In this section we introduce definitions of exciton-polaron properties which
can be evaluated by DMC and SO methods. An idea of DMC approach for
numerically exact calculation of Green functions (GFs) in imaginary times
is presented in Sect. 2.1, and a short description of SO method, which is
capable of making unbiased analytic continuation from imaginary times to
real frequencies, is given in Sect. 2.2. Using combination of DMC and SO,
one can often circumvent difficulties of analytic and traditional numerical
methods. Therefore, a brief comparative analysis of advantages and drawbacks
of DMC-SO machinery is given in Sect. 2.3.
To obtain information on QPs it is necessary to calculate Matsubara GF
in imaginary time representation and make analytic continuation to the real
frequencies [60]. For the two-particle problem (1)-(4) the relevant quantity is
the two-particle GF [46, 47]

(Here hk−p (τ ) = eĤτ hk−p e−Ĥτ , τ > 0.) In the case of exciton-polaron, vacuum state | vaci is the state with filled valence and empty conduction bands.

For the bipolaron problem it is a system without particles. In the simpler case
of a QP with two-level internal structure described by (4)-(6) the relevant
quantity is the one-particle matrix GF [52, 47]
Gk,ij (τ ) = hvac | ai,k (τ )a†j,k | vaci, i, j = 1, 2.

(11)

For a structureless polaron the matrix (11) reduces to one-particle scalar GF
Gk (τ ) = hvac | ak (τ )a†k | vaci .

(12)

Information on the response to an external weak perturbation (e.g. optical
absorption) is contained in the current-current correlation function hJβ (τ )Jδ i
(β/δ are Cartesian indexes).

with the Lehmann function (LF) Lk (ω) given in (7), reveals information on
the ground and excited states. Here {|νi} is a complete set of eigenstates of
Hamiltonian Ĥ in a sector of given momentum k: H |ν(k)i = Eν (k) |ν(k)i.
The LF Lk (ω) has poles (sharp peaks) on the energies of stable (metastable)
states of particle. For example, if there is a stable state at energy E(k), the LF
reads Lk (ω) = Z (k) δ(ω − E(k)) + . . ., and the state with the lowest energy

The amplitudes ξk p (g.s.) of this wave function can be obtained [46] from
asymptotic behavior of the following GF (10)

Gkp=p (τ → ∞) =| ξk p (g.s.) |2 e−Eg.s. (k)τ .

(20)

Information on the excited states is obtained by the analytic continuation
of imaginary time GF to real frequencies which requires to solve the Fredholm
equation Gk (τ ) = F̂ [Lk (ω)] (13)
Lk (ω) = F̂ω−1 [Gk (τ )] .

(21)

The equation (13) is a rather general relation between imaginary time GF/correlator and spectral properties of the system. For example, the absorption
coefficient of light by excitons I(ω) is obtained as solution of the same equation

Besides, the real part of the optical conductivity σβδ (ω) is expressed [48] in
terms of current-current correlation function hJβ (τ )Jδ i by relation
σβδ (ω) = π F̂ω−1 [hJβ (τ )Jδ i] /ω .

(23)

2.1 Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Method
DMC Method is an algorithm which calculates GF (10)-(12) without any
systematic errors. This algorithm is described below for the simplest case of
structureless polaron [45], and generalizations to more complex cases can be
found in consequent references4 . DMC is based on the Feynman expansion of
the Matsubara GF in imaginary time in the interaction representation
4

Generalization of described below technique to the case of exciton (1-2) is given
in [46] and its modification for pseudo-Jahn-Teller polaron (4-6) is developed in
[52, 47]. Method for evaluation of current-current correlation function can be
found in [48] and a case of a polaron interacting with two kinds of bosonic fields
is considered in [49].

(ξ )
Function Dmm (τ ; {x′1 , . . . , x′m }) of any order m can be expressed as a factor of GFs of noninteracting quasiparticle, GFs of phonons, and interaction
vortexes V (k, q). For the simplest case of Hamiltonian system expressions

Dq (τ2 − τ1 ) = exp [−ωq (τ2 − τ1 )] (τ2 > τ1 ) are well known.
An important feature of the DMC method, which is distinct from the
row of other exact numerical approaches, is the explicit possibility to include
renormalized GFs into exact expansion without any change of the algorithm.
For example, if a damping of QP, caused by some interactions not included
in the Hamiltonian, is known, i.e. retarded self-energy of QP Σret (k, ω) is

The DMC process is a numerical procedure which, basing on the Metropolis principle [81, 82], samples different FDs in the parameter space (τ, m, ξm , {x′m })
and collects statistics of external variable τ in a way that the result of this
statistics converges to exact GF Gk (τ ). Although sampling of the internal
parameters of one term in (25) and switch between different orders is performed within the the framework of one and the same numerical process,
it is instructive to start with the procedure of evaluation of a specific term

since it is necessary to sample the whole domain for convergence to exact

contains normalized probability function W (q′ , τ ′ , τ ′′ ), which is used for generating of new parameters5. Complementary update B, removing the phonon
propagator, uses ratio M −1 [45].
Note that all updates are local, i.e. do not depend on the structure of the
whole FD. Neither rules nor CPU time, needed for update, depends on the
FD order. DMC method does not imply any explicit truncation of FDs order
due to finite size of computer memory. Ever for strong coupling, where typical
number of phonon propagators Nph , contributing to result, is large, influence
of finite size of memory is not essential. Really, according to Central Limit
Theorem, number of phonon propagators
p obeys Gauss distribution centered
at N̄ph with half width of the order of N̄ph [83]. Hence, if a memory for at
least 2N̄ph propagators is reserved, diagram order hardly surpasses this limit.
2.2 Stochastic Optimization Method
The problem of inverting of integral equation (13) is an ill posed problem.
Due to incomplete noisy information about GF Gk (τ ), which is known with
statistic errors on a finite number of imaginary times in a finite range [0, τmax ],
there is infinite number of approximate solutions which reproduce GF within
some range of deviations and the problem is to chose "the best one". Another
problem, which is a stumbling block for decades, is the saw tooth noise instability. It occurs when solution is obtained by a naive method, e.g. by using
least-squares approach for minimizing deviation measure
Z τmax

have much larger amplitude than the value of actual LF Lk (ω). Standard tools
for saw tooth noise suppression are based on the early 60-es idea of FillipsTikhonov regularization method [84, 85, 86, 87]. A nonlinear functional, which
suppresses large derivatives of approximate solution L̃k (ω), is added to the
linear deviation measure (30). Most popular variant of regularization methods
is the Maximal Entropy Method [61].
However, typical LF of a QP in a boson field consists of δ-functional peaks
and smooth incoherent continuum with a sharp border [45, 54]. Hence, suppression of high derivatives, as a general strategy of the regularization method,
fails. Moreover, any specific implementation of the regularization method uses
predefined mesh in the ω space, which could be absolutely unacceptable for
the case of sharp peaks. If the actual location of a sharp peak is between
predefined discrete points, the rest of spectral density can be distorted beyond recognition. Finally, regularization Maximal Entropy approach requires
assumption of Gauss distribution of statistic errors in Gk (τ ), which might be
invalid in some cases [61].
Recently, a Stochastic Optimization (SO) method, which circumvents
abovementioned difficulties, was developed [45]. The idea of the SO method
is to generate a large enough number M of statistically independent nonreg(s)
ularized solutions {L̃k (ω)}, s = 1, ..., M , which deviation measures D(s) are
smaller than some upper limit Du , depending of the statistic noise of the GF
Gk (τ ). Then, using linearity of expressions (13), (30), the final solution is

found as the average of particular solutions {L̃k (ω)}

choice of initial configuration Csinit . Then, deviation measure is optimized by
a randomly chosen consequence of updates until deviation is less than Du . In
addition to updates, which do not change number of terms in the sum (32),
there are updates which increase or decrease number K. Hence, since the
number of elements K is not fixed, any spectral function can be reproduced
with desired accuracy.

Although each particular solution L̃k (ω) suffers from saw tooth noise at
the area of smooth LF, statistical independence of each solution leads to self
averaging of this noise in the sum (32). Note that suppression of noise happens
without suppression of high derivatives and, hence, sharp peaks and edges
are not smeared out in contrast to regularization approaches. Therefore, saw
tooth noise instability is defeated without corruption of sharp peaks and edges.
Moreover, continuous parameterization (32) does not need predefined mesh in
ω-space. Besides, since the Hilbert space of solution is sampled directly, any
assumption about distribution of statistical errors is not necessary.
SO method was successfully applied to restore LF of Fröhlich polaron
[45], Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron [54], hole-polaron in t-J-model [53, 49],
and many-particle spin system [88]. Calculation of the optical conductivity of
polaron by SO method can be found in [48]. SO method appeared to be helpful
in cases when GF's asymptotic limit, giving information about ground state,
can not be reached. For example, sign fluctuations of the terms in expansion
(25) for a hole in the t-J-model lead to poor statistics at large times [53],
though, SO method is capable of recovering energy and Z-factor even from
GF known only at small imaginary times [53].
2.3 Advantages and Drawbacks of DMC-SO Machinery
Among numerical methods, capable of obtaining quantitative results in the
problem of exciton (1) and (2), one can list time-dependent density functional theory [89], Hanke-Sham technique of correcting particle-hole excitation energy [90, 91], and approaches directly solving Bethe-Salpeter equation
[92, 93, 94]. The latter ones provide rather accurate information on the twoparticle GF. However, usage of finite mesh in direct/reciprocal space, which
is avoided in DMC method, leads to its' failure in Wannier regime [93].
In contrast to DMC method, none of the traditional numeric methods
can give reliable results for measurable properties of excited states of polaron
at arbitrary range of electron-phonon interaction for the macroscopic system
in the thermodynamic limit. Exact diagonalization method [95, 96, 97, 98]
can study excited states though only on rather small finite size systems and
results of this method are not even justified in the variational sense in the
thermodynamic limit [99]. There is a batch of rather effective variational "exact translation" methods [99, 100, 101, 102, 103] where basis is chosen in
the momentum space and, hence, the variational principle is applied in the
thermodynamic limit. Although these methods can reveal few discrete excited
states, its fail for long-range interaction and for dispersive, especially acoustic
phonons due to catastrophic growth of variational basis. A non perturbative
theory, which is able to give information about spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit at least for one electron, is Dynamical Mean Field Theory
[104, 105, 106, 107]. However it gives an exact solution only in the case of
infinite dimension which does not correspond to a realistic system and can be
considered only as a guide for extrapolation to finite dimensions [108].

Recently developed cluster perturbation theory, where exact diagonalization of a cluster is further improved by taking into account inter-cluster interaction [109, 110, 111, 112, 113], is applicable for study of the excited states,
but limited to one-dimensional lattices or two-dimensional systems with shortrange interaction. Traditional density-matrix renormalization group method
[114, 115, 116, 117, 118] is very effective though mostly limited to onedimensional systems and ladders. Finally, recently developed path integral
quantum Monte Carlo algorithm [119, 120, 121, 122] is valid for any dimension and properly takes into account quasi long-range interactions [123]. Path
integral method is capable of obtaining the density of states [119, 120] and
isotope exponents [121, 124]. However calculations of measurable characteristics of excited states, such as ARPES or optical conductivity, by this method
were never reported.
In conclusion, none of methods, except DMC-SO combination, can obtain
at the moment approximation-free results for measurable physical quantities
for a few QPs interacting with a macroscopic bosonic bath in the thermodynamic limit. Indeed, there are limitations of the DMC and SO methods. DMC
method does not work in many-fermion systems due to sign problem and SO
method fails at high temperatures, comparable to energies of dominant spectral peaks, because even very small statistical noise of GFs turns Fredholm
equation (13) into essentially "ill defined" problem [84].

3 Spectral Properties of the Fröhlich Polaron
Before development of DMC-SO methods, the information on the excited
states of polaron models, especially the Fröhlich one, was very limited. Knowledge of LF was based on results of infinite-dimensions approximation [125],
exact diagonalization [126, 96, 97, 97], or strong coupling expansion [127]. No
one of the above techniques was capable of obtaining the LF of polaron without approximations, especially for long-range interaction where difficulties of
traditional numerical methods dramatically increase. In a similar way, optical
conductivity (OC) of Fröhlich model was known only in strong coupling expansion approximation [128], within the framework of the perturbation theory
[129], or was based on the variational Feynman path integral technique [75].
In this sect. we consider exact DMC-SO results on LF [45] and OC [48, 57] of
Fröhlich polaron model.

Comparison of low-energy parts of the LF of the Fröhlich model, obtained
by DMC-SO and taken from (35), shows perfect agreement for α = 0.05: the
accuracy for the polaron energy and Z-factor is about 10−4 . On the other hand,
high-energy part of numeric result (Fig. 2) significantly deviates from that of
the analytic expression (35). This is not surprising since for Fröhlich polaron
the perturbation theory expression is diverging as ω → ωph and, therefore
the perturbation theory breaks down. When perturbation theory is obviously
valid, e.g. for the case of finite κ = 1, there is a perfect agreement between
analytic expression and DMC-SO results (Fig. 2b). Note that the high-energy
part of Lk=0 (ω) is successfully restored by SO method despite the fact that
the total weight of the feature for α = 0.05 is less than 10−2 .
The main deviation of the actual LF from the perturbation theory result
is the extra broad peak in the actual LF at ω ∼ 3.5. To study this feature
Lk=0 (ω) was calculated for α = 0.5, α = 1, and α = 2 (Fig. 2c-e). The peak

is seen for higher values of the interaction constant and its weight grows with
α. √
Near the threshold, ω = 1, LF demonstrates the square-root dependence
∼ ω − 1 (Fig. 2f).
To trace the evolution of the peak at higher values of α the LF was calculated [45] for α = 4, α = 6, and α = 8 (Fig. 3). At α = 4 the peak at
ω ∼ 4 already dominates. Moreover, a distinct high-energy shoulder appears
at α = 4, which transforms into a broad peak at ω ∼ 8.5 in the LF for α = 6.
The LF for α = 8 demonstrates further redistribution of the spectral weight
between different maxima without significant shift of the peak positions.
3.2 Optical Conductivity of the Fröhlich Polaron: Validity of the
Franck-Condon Principle in the Optical Spectroscopy
The FC principle [130, 131] and its validity have been widely discussed in studies of optical transitions in atoms, molecules [132, 133], and solids [134, 9].
Generally, the FC principle means that if only one of two coupled subsystems, e.g. an electronic subsystem, is affected by an external perturbation,
the second subsystem, e.g., the lattice, is not fast enough to follow the reconstruction of the electronic configuration. It is clear that the justification
for the FC principle is the short characteristic time of the measurement process τmp ≪ τic , where τmp is related to the energy gap between the initial
and final states, ∆E, through the uncertainty principle: τmp ≃ h̄/(∆E) and
τic is the time necessary to adjust the lattice when the electronic component
is perturbed. Then, the spectroscopic response considerably depends on the
value of the ratio τmp /τic For example, in mixed valence systems, where the
ionic valence fluctuates between configurations f 5 and f 6 with characteristic
time τic ≈ 10−13 s, spectra of fast and slow experiments are dramatically different [135, 136]. Photoemission experiments with short characteristic times
τmp ≈ 10−16 s (FC regime), reveal two lines, corresponding to f 5 and f 6

17

states. On the other hand slow Mössbauer isomer shift measurements with
τmp ≈ 10−9 s show a single broad peak with mean frequency lying between
signals from pure f 5 and f 6 shells. Finally, according to paradigm of measurement process time, magnetic neutron scattering with τmp ≈ τic revealed
both coherent lines with all subsystems dynamically adjusted and broad incoherent remnants of strongly damped excitation of f 5 and f 6 shells [137, 138].
Actually, the meaning of the times τic and τmp varies with the system and
with the measurement process.
To study the interplay between measurement process time τmp and adjustment time τic , the OC of the Fröhlich polaron was studied in [57] from
the weak to the strong coupling regime by three methods. DMC method gives
numerically exact answer which is compared with memory function formalism
(MFF), which is able to take dynamical lattice relaxation into account, and
strong coupling expansion (SCE) which assumes FC approach. It was found
that near critical coupling αc ≈ 8.5 a dramatic change of the OC spectrum
occurs: dominating peak of OC splits into two satellites. In this critical regime
the upper (lower) one quickly decreases (increases) it's spectral weight as the
value of coupling constant increases. Besides, while OC follows prediction of
MFF at α < αc , its dependence switches to that predicted by SCE for larger
couplings. It was concluded that, for the OC measurement of polaron, the
adjustment time τic ≈ h̄/D is set by typical nonadiabatic energy D. Nonadiabaticity destroys FC classification at α < αc while FC principle rapidly
regains its validity at large couplings due to fast growth of energy separation
between initial and final states of optical transitions.
Comparison of exact DMC-SO data for OC with existing results of approximate methods showed [48] that the Feynman path integral technique
[75] of Devreese, De Sitter, and Goovaerts, where OC is calculated starting
from the Feynman variational model [139], is the only successfully describing
evolution of the energy of the main peak in OC with coupling constant α (see
[58]). However, starting from the intermediate coupling regime this approach
fails to reproduce the peak width. Subsequently, the path integral approach
was rewritten in terms of MFF [140]. Then, in [57] the extended MFF formalism, which introduces dissipation processes fixed by exact sum rules, was
developed [141].
As shown in Fig. 4a, in the weak coupling regime, the MFF, with or without dissipation, is in very good agreement with DMC data, showing significant
improvement with respect to weak coupling perturbation approach [129] which
provides a good description of OC spectra only for very small values of α. For
1 ≤ α ≤ 8, where standard MFF fails to reproduce peak width (Fig. 4b-d)
and even the peak position (Fig. 4c), the damping, introduced to extended
MFF scheme, becomes crucial. Results of extended MFF are accurate for the
peak energy and quite satisfactory for the peak width (Fig. 4b-e). Note that
the broadening of the peak in DMC data is not a consequence of poor quality
of analytic continuation procedure since DMC-SO methods is capable of revealing such fine features as 2- and 3-phonon thresholds of emission (Fig. 4b).

method (circles), the extended MFF (solid line), and SCE (dotted line) for different
values of α. (d) The energy of lower- and higher-frequency features (circles and triangles, respectively) compared with the FC transition energy with the SCE (dashed
line) and with the energy of the peak obtained from the extended MFF (solid line).
In the inset, the weights of FC and adiabatically connected transitions are shown as
a function of α (for η = 1.3.)

However, a dramatic change of OC occurs around critical coupling strength
αc ≈ 8.5. The dominating peak of OC splits into two ones, the energy of lover
one corresponding to the predictions of SCR expansion and that of upper
one obeying extended MFF value (Fig. 5a). The shoulder, corresponding to
dynamical extended MFF contribution, rapidly decreases it's intensity with
increase of α and at large α (Fig. 5b-c) the OC is in good agreement with
strong coupling expansion, assuming FC scheme. Finally, comparing energies
of the peaks, obtained by DMC, extended MFF and FC strong coupling expansion (Fig. 5d), we conclude that at critical coupling αc ≈ 8.5 the spectral
properties rapidly switch from dynamic, when lattice relaxes at transition, to
FC regime, where nuclei are frozen in initial configuration.
In order get an idea of the FC breakdown authors of [57] consider the following arguments. The approximate adiabatic states are not exact eigenstates
of the system. These states are mixed by nondiagonal matrix elements of the

Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo

19

nonadiabatic operator D and exact eigenstates are linear combinations of the
adiabatic wavefunctions. Being interested in the properties of transition from
ground (g) to an excited (ex) state, whose energy correspond to that of the OC
peak, it is necessary to consider mixing of only these states and express exact
wavefunctions as a linear combinations [142, 143] of ground and excited adiabatic states. The coefficients of superposition are determined from standard
techniques [142, 143] where nondiagonal matrix elements of the nonadiabatic
operator [142] are expressed in terms of matrix elements of the kinetic energy
operator M , the gap between excited and ground state ∆E = Eex − Eg and
the number nβ of phonons in adiabatic state:
q
D± = M (∆E)−1 nβ + 1/2 ± 1/2 + M 2 (∆E)−2 .
(36)
The extent to which lattice can follow transition between electronic states,
depends on the degree of mixing between initial and final exact eigenstates
through the nonadiabatic interaction. If initial and ground states are strongly
mixed, the adiabatic classification has no sense and, therefore, the FC processes have no place and lattice is adjusted to the change of electronic states
during the transition. In the opposite limit adiabatic approximation is valid
and FC processes dominate. The estimation for the weight of FC component
IF C [57] is equal to unity in the case of zero mixing and zero in the case
of maximal mixing. The weight of adiabatically connected (AC) transition
IAC = 1 − IF C is defined accordingly. Non-diagonal matrix element M is proportional to the root square of α with a coefficient η of the order of unity.
In the strong coupling regime, assuming that ∆E ≈ γα2 (γ ≈ 0.1 from MC
data), and nβ ≈ ∆E (nβ ≫ 1), one gets
−1

,
(37)
IF C = 1 + 4(τmp /τic )2

where τmp = 1/∆E and τic = 1/D. For η of the order of unity one obtains
qualitative description of a rather fast transition from AC- to FC-dominated
transition, when IF C and IAC exchange half of their weights in the range
of α from 7 to 9. The physical reason for such quick change is the faster
growth of energy separation ∆E ∼ α2 compared to that of the matrix element M ∼ α1/2 . Finally, for large couplings, initial and final states become
adiabatically disconnected. The rapid AC-FC switch has nothing to do with
the self-trapping phenomenon where crossing and hybridization of the ground
and an excited states occurs. This phenomenon is a property of transition
between different states and related to the choice whether lattice can or can
not follow adiabatically the change of electronic state at the transition.

4 Self-Trapping
In this section we consider the self-trapping (ST) phenomenon which, due to
essential importance of many-particle interaction of QP with bosonic bath of

20

A. S. Mishchenko and N. Nagaosa

macroscopic system, was never addressed by exact method before. We start
with a basic definition of the ST phenomenon and introduce the adopted
criterion for it's existence. Then, generic features of ST are demonstrated
on a simple model of Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron in Sect. 4.1. It is shown
in Sect. 4.2 that the criterion is not a dogma since even in one dimensional
system, where ST is forbidden by criterion of existence, one can observe all
main features of ST due to peculiar nature of electronic states.
In general terms [7, 80], ST is a dramatic transformation of a QP properties
when system parameters are slightly changed. The physical reason of ST is a
quantum resonance, which happens at some critical interaction constant γc ,
between "trapped" (T) state of QP with strong lattice deformation around
it and "free" (F) state. Naturally, ST transition is not abrupt because of
nonadiabatic interaction between T and F states and all properties of the QP
are analytic in γ [144]. At small γ < γc , ground state is an F state which is
weakly coupled to phonons while excited states are T states and have a large
lattice deformation. At critical couplings γ ≈ γc a crossover and hybridization
of these states occurs. Then, for γ > γc the roles of the states exchange. The
lowest state is a T state while the upper one is an F state.
First, and up to now the only quantitative criterion for ST existence was
given in terms of the ground state properties in the adiabatic approximation.
This criterion considers stability of the delocalized state in undistorted lattice
∆ = 0 with respect to the energy gain due to lattice distortion ∆′ 6= 0. ST
phenomenon occurs when completely delocalized state with ∆ = 0 is separated
from distorted state with ∆′ 6= 0 by a barrier of adiabatic potential. One of
these states is stable while another one is meta-stable. The criterion of barrier
existence is defined in terms of the stability index
s = d − 2(1 + l) ,

(38)

where d is the system dimensionality. Index l determines the range of the force
limq→0 ψ(q) ∼ q −l , where ψ(R) is the kernel of interaction U (Rn ) = ψ(Rn −
Rn′ )ν(Rn′ ) connecting potential U (Rn ) with generalized lattice distortion
ν(Rn′ ) [7]. The barrier exists for s > 0 and does not exist for s < 0. The
discontinuous change of the polaron state, i.e. ST, occurs in the former case
while does not happen in the latter case. When s = 0, this scaling argument
alone can not conclude the presence or absence of the ST and more detailed
discussion for each model is needed.
4.1 Typical Example of the Self-Trapping: Rasba-Pekar
Exciton-Polaron
Classical example of a system with ST phenomenon is the three dimensional
continuous Rasba-Pekar exciton-polaron in the approximation of intraband
scattering, i.e. when polar electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with dispersionless optical phonons ωph = 1 does not change the wave function of internal

electron-hole motion. System is defined as a structureless QP with dispersion
ǫ(k) = k 2 /2 and short range coupling to phonons [54, 7]. General criterion of
the existence of ST is satisfied for three dimensional system with short range
interaction [54, 7, 50] and, thus, one expects to observe typical features of the
phenomenon.
It is shown [54] that in the vicinity of the critical coupling γc ≈ 18 the
average number of phonons hN i in (18) and effective mass m∗ quickly increase in the ground state by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 6b-c). Besides,
a quantum resonance between polaronic phonon clouds of F and T state is
demonstrated. Distribution of partial n-phonon contributions Z (k=0) (n) in
(17) has one maximum at n = 0 in the weak coupling regime, which corresponds to weak deformation, and one maximum at n ≫ 1 in the strong
coupling regime, which is the consequence of a strong lattice distortion. However, due to F-T resonance there are two distinct peaks at n = 0 and n ≫ 1
for γ ≈ γc (Fig. 6d).
Near the critical coupling γc the LF of polaron has several stable states
(Fig. 7 a-b) below the threshold of incoherent continuum Egs + ωph . Any state
above the threshold is unstable because emission of a phonon with transition
to the ground state at k = 0 with energy Egs is allowed. On the other hand,
decay is forbidden by conservation laws for states below the threshold. Dependence of the energies of ground and excited resonances on the interaction
constant resembles a picture of crossing of several states interacting with each
other (Fig. 7c).
According to the general picture of the ST phenomenon, lowest F state in
the weak coupling regime at k = 0 has small effective mass m∗ ≈ m of the
order of the bare QP mass m. To the contrary, the effective mass of excited
state m∗ ≫ m is large. Hence, below the critical coupling the energy of the
F state, which is lowest at k = 0, has to reach a flat band of T state at
some momentum. Then, F and T state have to hybridize and exchange in

energy. DMC data visualize this picture (Fig. 7 d-e). After F state crosses the
flat band of excited T state, the average number of phonons increases and
dispersion becomes flat.
It is natural to assume that above the critical coupling the situation is
opposite: ground state is the T state with large effective mass while excited
F state has small, nearly bare, effective mass. Indeed, this assumption was
confirmed in the framework of another model which is considered in Sect. 6.1.
Moreover, it was shown that in the strong coupling regime excited resonance
inherits not only bare effective mass around k = 0 but the whole dispersion
law of the bare QP [49].
4.2 Degeneracy Driven Self-Trapping
According to the criterion (38), ST phenomenon in one-dimensional system does not occur. Although this statement is probably valid for the
case of single band in relevant energy range, it is not the case for the
generic multi-band cases. This fact has been unnoticed for many years,

which prevented the proper explanation of puzzling physics of quasi-onedimensional compound Anthracene-PMDA, although it's optical properties
[65, 145, 146, 147, 66, 148] directly suggested resonance of T and F states.
The reason is that in Anthracene-PMDA, in contrast to conditions at which
criterion (38) is obtained, there are two, nearly degenerate exciton bands.
Then, one can consider quasi-degenerate self-trapping mechanism when ST
phenomenon is driven by nondiagonal interaction of phonons with quasidegenerate exciton levels [52]. Such mechanism was already suggested for explanation of properties of mixed valence systems [143] though it's relevance was
never proved by an exact approach.

polaron cloud below ST point at λ12 = 1.0125 (c), at ST point at λ12 = 1.0435 (d),
and above ST coupling at λ12 = 1.0625 (e).

The minimal model to demonstrate the mechanism of quasi-degenerate
self-trapping involves one optical phonon branch with frequency ωph = 0.1
and two exciton branches with energies ǫ1,2 (q) = ∆1,2 + 2[1 − cos(q)], where
∆1 = 0 and ∆2 = 1. Presence of short range diagonal γ22 and nondiagonal

and λ12 = γ12 /(2ω)) leads to classical self-trapping behavior even in onedimensional system [52] (see Fig. 8).

5 Exciton
Despite numerous efforts over the years, there has been no rigorous technique to solve for exciton properties even for the simplest model (1)-(2) which
treats electron-electron interactions as a static renormalized Coulomb potential with averaged dynamical screening. The only solvable cases are the Frenkel
small-radius limit [67] and the Wannier large-radius limit [68] which describe
molecular crystals and wide gap insulators with large dielectric constant, respectively. Meanwhile, even the accurate data for the limits of validity of the

Wannier and Frenkel approximations have not been available. As discussed in
Sects. 1.2 and 2.3, semianalytic approaches has little to add to problem when
quantitative results are needed whereas traditional numerical methods fail to
reproduce them even in the Wannier regime. To the contrary, DMC results
do not contain any approximation.

at zero momentum [46]. For large ratio W = Ec /Eg , when W > 30, exciton binding energy is in good agreement with Wannier approximation results
(Fig. 9a) and probability density of relative electron-hole motion corresponds
(Fig. 9c) to hydrogen-like result. The striking result is the requirement of
rather large valence and conduction bandwidths (W > 20) for applicability of
Wannier approximation. For smaller values of W the binding energy and wave
function of relative motion (Fig. 9d) deviate from large radius results. In the
similar way, conditions of validity of Frenkel approach are rather restricted
too. Moreover, even strong localization of wave function does not guarantee
good agreement between exact and Frenkel approximation result for binding
energy. At 1 < W < 10 the wave function is already strongly localized though
binding energy considerably differs from Frenkel approximation result. For
example, at W = 0.4 relative motion is well localized (Fig. 9e) whereas the
binding energy of Frenkel approximation is two times larger than exact result
(Inset in Fig. 9a).
A study of conditions necessary for formation of charge transfer exciton in
three dimensional systems is crucial to finalize protracted discussion of numerous models concerning properties of mixed valence semiconductors [149]. A
decade ago unusual properties of SmS and SmB6 were explained by invoking
the excitonic instability mechanism assuming charge-transfer nature of the
optically forbidden exciton [150, 151]. Although this model explained quantitatively the phonon spectra [152, 153], optical properties [154, 155], and magnetic neutron scattering data [138], it's basic assumption has been criticized
as being groundless [156, 157]. To study excitonic wavefunction, dispersions
of valence and conduction bands were chosen as it is typical for mixed valence
materials: almost flat valence band is separated from broad conduction band,
having maximum in the centre and minimum at the border of Brillouin zone
[46]. Results presented in Fig. 9b support assumption of [150, 151] since wave
function of relative motion has almost zero on-site component and maximal
charge density at near neighbors.

6 Polarons in Undoped High Temperature
Superconductors
It is now well established that the physics of high temperature superconductors is that of hole doping a Mott insulator [158, 159, 160]. Even a single
hole in a Mott insulator, i.e. a hole in an antiferromagnet in case of infinite
Hubbard repulsion U , is substantially influenced by many-body effects [10] because it's jump to a neighboring site disturbs antiferromagnetic arrangement
of spins. Hence a thorough understanding of the dynamics of doped holes in
Mott insulators has attracted a great deal of recent interest. The two major
interactions relevant to the electrons in solids are electron-electron interactions (EEI) and electron-phonon interactions (EPI). The importance of the
former at low doping is no doubt essential since the Mott insulator is driven

26

A. S. Mishchenko and N. Nagaosa

by strong Hubbard repulsion, while the latter was considered to be largely
irrelevant to superconductivity based on the observations of a small isotope
effect on the optimal Tc [161] and an absence of a phonon contribution to the
resistivity (for review see [162]).
On the other hand, there are now accumulating evidences that the EPI
plays an important role in the physics of cuprates such as (i) an isotope effect
on superfluid density ρs and Tc away from optimal doping [163], (ii) neutron
and Raman scattering [164, 165, 166] experiments showing strong phonon softening with both temperature and hole doping, indicating that EPI is strong
[167, 168]. Furthermore, the recent studies of cuprates by the angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which spectra are proportional to the
LF (7) [32], resulted in the discovery of the dispersion "kinks" at around 4070meV measured from the Fermi energy, in the correct range of the relevant
oxygen related phonons [169, 170, 171]. These particular phonons - oxygen
buckling and half-breathing modes are known to soften with doping [172, 164]
and with temperature [170, 171, 172, 164, 165, 166] indicating strong coupling. The quick change of the velocity can be predicted by any interaction of
a quasiparticle with a bosonic mode, either with a phonon [170, 171] or with
a collective magnetic resonance mode [173, 174, 175]. However, the recently
discovered "universality" of the kink energy for LSCO over the entire doping
range [176] casts doubts on the validity of the latter scenario as the energy
scale of the magnetic excitation changes strongly with doping.
Besides, measured in undoped high Tc materials ARPES revealed apparent contradiction between momentum dependence of the energy and linewidth
of the QP peak. On the one hand the experimental energy dispersion of the
broad peak in many underdoped compounds [31, 177] obeys the theoretical
predictions [178, 179], whereas the experimental peak width is comparable
with the bandwidth and orders of magnitude larger than that obtained from
theory of Mott insulator [53]. Early attempts to interpret this anomalously
short lifetime of a hole by an interaction with additional nonmagnetic bosonic
excitations, e.g. phonons [180], faced generic question: is it possible that interaction with media leaves the energy dispersion absolutely unrenormalized,
while, induces a decay which inverse life-time is comparable or even larger
than the QP energy dispersion? A possibility of an extrinsic origin of this
width can be ruled out since the doping induces further disorder, while a
sharper peak is observed in the overdoped region.
In order to understand whether phonons can be responsible for peculiar
shape of the ARPES in the undoped cuprates, the LF of an interacting with
phonons hole in Mott insulator was studied by DMC-SO [49]. The case of the
LF of a single hole corresponds to the ARPES in an undoped compound. For
a system with large Hubbard repulsion U , when U is much larger than the
typical bandwidth W of noninteracting QP, the problem reduces to the t-J
model [181, 182, 158, 11]

Here cjσ is projected (to avoid double occupancy) fermion annihilation operator, ni (< 2) is the occupation number, Si is spin 1/2 operator, J is an
exchange integral, and hiji denotes nearest-neighbor sites in two dimensional
square lattice. Different theoretical approaches revealed [158, 183, 53] basic
properties of the LF. The LF has a sharp peak in the low energy part of the
spectrum which disperses with a bandwidth WJ/t ∼ 2J and, therefore, the
large QP width in experiment can not be explained. More complicated tt′ t′′ -J
model takes into account hoppings to the second t′ and third t′′ nearest neighbors and, hence, dispersion of the hole changes [184, 185, 186, 178, 179, 32].
However, for parameters, which are necessary for description of dispersion
in realistic high Tc superconductors [31, 178], peak in the low energy part
remains sharp and well defined for all momenta [187].
After expressing spin operators in terms of Holstein-Primakoff spin wave
operators and diagonalizing the spin part of Hamiltonian (39) by Fourier
and Bogoliubov transformations [188, 10, 189, 190], tt′ t′′ -J Hamiltonian is
reduced to the boson-holon model, where hole (annihilation operator is hk )

is chosen in the form ε(k) = 2t[cos(kx ) + cos(ky )], the problem (40), (42) corresponds to standard Holstein model where hole with near neighbor hopping
amplitude t interacts with dispersionless phonons.
We consider the evolution of ARPES of a single hole in t-J-Holstein model
(40)-(42) from the weak to the strong coupling regime and dispersion of the LF
in the strong coupling regime in Sect. 6.1. It occurs that properties of the LF in
the strong coupling regime of the EPI explain the puzzle of broad lineshape
in ARPES in underdoped high Tc superconductors. Therefore, in order to
suggest a crucial test for the mechanism of phonon-induced broadening, we
present calculations of the effect of the isotope substitution on the ARPES in
Sect. 6.2.
6.1 Spectral Function of a Hole Interacting with Phonons in the
t-J Model: Self-Trapping and Momentum Dependence
Previously, the LF of t-J-Holstein model was studied by exact diagonalization
method on small clusters [191] and in the non-crossing approximation (NCA)6
for both phonons and magnons [192, 193]. However, the small system size in
exact diagonalization method implies a discrete spectrum and, therefore, the
problem of lineshape could not be addressed. The latter method omits the
FDs with mutual crossing of phonon propagators and, hence, is an invalid
approximation for phonons in strong and intermediate couplings of EPI. This
statement was demonstrated by DMC, which can sum all FDs for Holstein
model both exactly and in the NCA [49]. Exact results and those of NCA are
in good agreement for small values λ ≤ 0.4 and drastically different for λ > 1.
For example, for Ω0 /t = 0.1 exact result shows a sharp crossover to strong
coupling regime for λ > λcH ≈ 1.2 whereas NCA result does not undergo such
crossover even at λ = 100. On the other hand, NCA is valid for interaction of a
hole with magnons since spin S=1/2 can not flip more than once and number
of magnons in the polaronic cloud can not be large. Note that the t-J-Holstein
model is reduced to problem of polaron which interacts with several bosonic
fields (3)-(4).
DMC expansion in [49] takes into account mutual crossing of phonon propagators and, in the framework of partial NCA, neglects mutual crossing of
magnon propagators, to avoid sign problem. NCA for magnons is justified for
J/t ≤ 0.4 by good agreement of results of NCA and exact diagonalization on
small clusters [188, 10, 194, 195, 190]. Recently results of exact diagonalization
were compared in the limit of small EPI for t-J-Holstein model, boson-holon
model (40-42) without NCA, and boson-holon model with NCA [196]. Although agreement is not so good as for pure t-J model, it was concluded that
NCA for magnons is still good enough to suggest that one can use NCA for a
qualitative description of the t-J-Holstein model.

NCA is equivalent to self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA)

Figures 10a-e show low energy part of LF in the ground state at k =
(π/2, π/2) in the weak, intermediate, and strong coupling regimes of interaction with phonons. Dependence on the coupling constant of energies of
resonances (Fig. 10f), Z k=(π/2,π/2) -factor of lowest peak (Fig. 10g), and average number of phonons in the polaronic cloud hN i (Fig. 10h) demonstrates a
picture which is typical for ST (see [80, 54] and Sect. 4). Two states cross and
hybridize in the vicinity of critical coupling constant λct-J ≈ 0.38, Z k=(π/2,π/2) factor of lowest resonance sharply drops and average number of phonons in
polaronic cloud quickly rises. According to the general understanding of the
ST phenomenon, above the critical couplings λ > λct-J one expects that the
lowest state is dispersionless while the upper one has small effective mass.
This assumption is supported by the momentum dependence of the LF in
the strong coupling regime (Fig. 11a-e). Dispersion of upper broad shake-off
Franck-Condon peak nearly perfectly obeys relation
εk = εmin +WJ/t /5{[cos kx +cos ky ]2 +[cos(kx +ky )+cos(kx −ky )]2 /4}, (43)
which describes dispersion of the pure t-J model in the broad range of exchange constant 0.1 < J/t < 0.9 [194] (Fig. 11f). Note that this property of
the shake-off peak is general for the whole strong coupling regime (Fig. 11f).
Momentum dependence of the shake-off peak, reproducing that of the free
particle, is the direct consequence of the adiabatic regime. Actually, phonon
frequency Ω0 is much smaller than the coherent bandwidth 2J of the t-J

model, giving the adiabatic ratio Ω/2J = 1/6 ≪ 1. Besides, as experience
with the OC of the Fröhlich polaron (Sect. 3.2) shows, there is one more
important parameter in the strong coupling limit. Namely, the ratio between
measurement process time τmp = h̄/∆E where ∆E is the energy separation of
shake-off hump from the ground state pole, and that of characteristic lattice
time τ ≈ 1/Ω0 is much less than unity. Hence, fast photoemission probe sees
the ions frozen in one of possible configurations [197]. The LF in the FC limit
is a sum of transitions between a lower Elow (Q) and an upper Eup (Q) sheets
of adiabatic potential, weighted by the adiabatic wave function of the lower
sheet | ψlow (Q) |2 [198]. If EPI is absent both in initial Elow (Q) = Q2 /2
and final Eup (Q) = D + Q2 /2 states, the LF is peaked at the energy D.
Then, if there is EPI ∆Eup (Q) = −λQ only in the final state, i.e. when hole
is removed from the Mott insulator, the upper sheet of adiabatic potential
Eup (Q) = D − λ2 /2 + (Q − λ)2 /2 has the same energy D at Q = 0. Since the
probability function | ψlow (Q) |2 has maximum at Q = 0, the peak of the LF
broadens but it's energy does not shift [198] (Fig. 11g).

Behavior of the LF is the same as observed in the ARPES of undoped
cuprates. The LF consists of a broad peak and a high energy incoherent continuum (see Fig. 11a). Besides, dispersion of the broad peak "c" in Figs. 11
reproduces that of sharp peak in pure t-J model (Fig. 11b-f). The lowest dispersionless peak, corresponding to small radius polaron, has very small weight
and, hence, can not be seen in experiment. On the other hand, according to ex′
periment, momentum dependence of spectral weight Z (k) of broad resonance
exactly reproduces dispersion of Z (k) -factor of pure t-J model. The reason
for such perfect mapping is that in adiabatic case Ω0 /2J ≪ 1 all weight of
the sharp resonance in t-J model without EPI is transformed at strong EPI
into the broad peak. This picture implies that the chemical potential in the
heavily underdoped cuprates is not connected with the broad resonance but
pinned to the real quasiparticle pole with small Z-factor. This conclusion was
recently confirmed experimentally [177].
Comparing the critical EPI for a hole in the t-J-Holstein model (40-42)
λct-J ≈ 0.38 and that for Holstein model λcH ≈ 1.2 with the same value of
hopping t, we conclude that spin-hole interaction accelerates transition into
the strong coupling regime. The reason for enhancement of the role of EPI is
found in [196]. Comparison of the EPI driven renormalization of the effective
mass in t-J-Holstein and Holstein model shows that large effective mass in the
t-J model is responsible for this effect. The enhancement of the role of EPI
by EEI takes place at least for a single hole at the bottom of the t-J band.
Had the comparison been made with half-filled model, the result would have
been smaller enhancement or no enhancement at all [199]. On the other hand,
coupling constant of half-breathing phonon is increased by correlations [200].
Finally, we conclude that effect of enhancement of the effective EPI by EEI is
not unambiguous and depends on details of interaction and filling. However,
this effect is present for small filling in the t-J-Holstein model.
6.2 Isotope Effect on ARPES in Underdoped High-Temperature
Superconductors
The magnetic resonance mode and the phonon modes are the two major
candidates to explain the "kink" structure of the electron energy dispersion
around 40-70 meV below the Fermi energy, and the isotope effect (IE) on
ARPES should be the smoking-gun experiment to distinguish between these
two. Gweon et al. [201] performed the ARPES experiment on O18 -replaced
Bi2212 at optimal doping and found an appreciable IE, which however can
not be explained within the conventional weak-coupling Migdal-Eliashberg
theory. Namely the change of the spectral function due to O18 -replacement
has been observed at higher energy region beyond the phonon energy (∼
60meV). This is in sharp contrast to the weak coupling theory prediction, i.e.,
the IE should occur only near the phonon energy. Hence the IE in optimal
Bi2212 remains still a puzzle. On the other hand, the ARPES in undoped
materials, as described in Sect. 6.1, has recently been understood in terms of

the small polaron formation [49, 202, 198]. Therefore, it is essential to compare
experiment in undoped systems with presented in this Sect. DMC-SO data,
where theory can offer quantitative results.
In addition to high-Tc problem, strong EPI mechanism of ARPES spectra broadening was considered as one of alternative scenarios for diatomic
molecules [203], colossal magnetoresistive manganites [34], quasi-one-dimensional Peierls conductors [37, 38], and Verwey magnetites [39]. Therefore, exact
analysis of the IE on ARPES at strong EPI is of general interest for conclusive
experiments in a broad variety of compound classes.
Dimensionless coupling constant λ = γ 2 /4tΩ in (42) is an invariant quan√
tity for the simplest case of IE. Indeed, assuming natural relation Ω ∼ 1/ M
between phonon frequency and mass,
p we find that λ does not depend on
the isotope factor κiso = Ω/Ω0 = M0 /M , which is defined as the ratio of
phonon frequency in isotope substituted (Ω) and normal (Ω0 ) systems. We
chose adopted parameters of the tt′ t′′ -J model which reproduce the experimental dispersion of ARPES [178]: J/t = 0.4, t′ /t = −0.34, and t′′ /t = 0.23 .
The frequencypof the relevant phonon [32] is set to Ω0 /t = 0.2 and the isotope
factor κiso = 16/18 corresponds to substitution of O18 isotope for O16 .
To sweep aside any doubts of possible instabilities of analytic continuation,
we calculate
the LF for normal compound (κnor = 1),pisotope substituted
p
(κiso = 16/18) and "anti-isotope" substituted (κant = 18/16) compounds.
Monotonic dependence of LF on κ ensures stability of analytic continuation
and gives possibility to evaluate the error-bars of a quantity A using quantities
Aiso − Anor , Anor − Aant , and (Aiso − Aant )/2.
Since LF is sensitive to strengths of EPI only for low frequencies [55], we
concentrate on the low energy part of the spectrum. Figure 12 shows IE on the
hole LF for different couplings in nodal and antinodal points, respectively. The
general trend is a shift of all spectral features to larger energies with increase
of the isotope mass (κ < 1). One can also note that the shift of broad FCP is
much larger than that of narrow real-QP peak. Moreover, for large couplings
λ the shift of QP energy approaches zero and only decrease of QP spectral
weight Z is observed for larger isotope mass. On the other hand, the shift
of FCP is not suppressed for larger couplings. Except for the LF in nodal
point at λ = 0.62 (Fig. 12a, b), where LF still has significant weight of QP
δ-functional peak, there is one more notable feature of the IE. With increase
of the isotope mass theR height of FCP increases. Taking into account the
+∞
conservation law for LF −∞ Lk (ω) = 1 and insensitivity of high energy part
of LF to EPI strength [55], the narrowing of the FCP for larger isotope mass
can be concluded. To understand the trends of the IE in the strong coupling
regime we analyze the exactly solvable independent oscillators model (IOM)
[60]. The LF in IOM is the Poisson distribution

where ξ0 = γ02 /Ω02 = 4tλ/Ω0 is dimensionless coupling constant for normal
system and Gκ,l (ω) = δ[ω + 4tλ− Ω0 κl] is the δ-function. The properties of the
Poisson distribution quantitatively explain many features of the IE on LF7 .
The energy ωQP = −4tλ of the zero-phonon line l = 0 in (44) depends
only on isotope independent quantities which explains very weak isotope dependence of QP peak energy in insets of Fig. 12. Besides, change of the zero(0)
(0)
phonon line weight Z (0) obeys relation Ziso /Znor = exp [−ξ0 (1 − κ)/κ] in
IOM. These IOM estimates agree with DMC data within 15% in the nodal
point and within 25% in the antinodal one. IE on FCP
in the strong couR +∞

with the above estimate for all couplings. This is consistent with the idea that
the anti-nodal region remains in the strong coupling regime even though the
nodal region is in the crossover region. In the nodal point DMC data well
agree with IOM estimate for λ = 0.75 (D ≈ 1.025) whereas at λ = 0.69 and
7

Cautions should be made about approximate form of EPI (42). Strictly speaking,
actual momentum dependence of the interaction constant σ [204, 205] can slightly
change the obtained differences between nodal and antinodal points though the
general trends have to be left intact because ST is caused solely by the short
range part of EPI [80].

λ = 0.62 influence of the ST point leads to anomalous values of D: D ≈ 1.07
and D ≈ 0.98, respectively. Shift of the low energy edge at half maximum
∆1/2 must√be proportional
to change of the root square of second moment
√
∆√M2 = ξ0 Ω0 [1 − κ]. As we found in numeric simulations of (44) with
Gaussian functions8 Gκ,l (ω), relation ∆1/2 ≈ ∆√M2 /2 is accurate to 10% for
0.62 < λ < 0.75. Also, simulations show that the shift of the edge at one
third of maximum ∆1/3 obeys relation ∆1/3 ≈ ∆√M2 . DMC data with IOM
estimates are in good agreement for strong EPI λ = 0.75 (Fig. 13). However, shift of the FCP top ∆p and ∆1/2 are considerably enhanced in the
self-trapping (ST) transition region. The physical reason for enhancement of
IE in this region is a general property regardless of the QP dispersion, range
of EPI, etc. The influence of nonadiabatic matrix element, mixing excited
and ground states, on the energies of resonances essentially depends on the
phonon frequency. While in the adiabatic approximation ST transition is sudden and nonanalytic in λ [80], nonadiabatic matrix elements turn it to smooth
crossover [144]. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 13a, the smaller the frequency the
sharper the kink in the dependence of excited state energy on the interaction
constant
In the undoped case the present results can be directly compared with
the experiments. It is found that the IE on the ARPES lineshape of a single hole is anomalously enhanced in the intermediate coupling regime while
can be described by the simple independent oscillators model in the strong
coupling regime. The shift of FCP top and change of the FCP height are relevant quantities to pursue experimentally in the intermediate coupling regime
since IE on these characteristics is enhanced near the self trapping point. In

Results are almost
√ independent on the parameter η of the Gaussian distribution
Gκ,l (ω) = 1/(η 2π) exp(−[ω + 4tλ − Ω0 κl]/(2η 2 )) in the range [0.12, 0.2].

contrast, shift of the leading edge of the broad peak is the relevant quantity
√
in the strong coupling regime since this value increases with coupling as λ.
These conclusions, depending on the fact whether self trapping phenomenon
is encountered in specific case, can be applied fully or partially to another
compounds with strong EPI [34, 37, 38, 39].
6.3 Conclusions and Perspectives
In this article, we have focused mainly on the polaron problem in strongly
correlated systems. This offers an approach from the limit of low carrier concentration doped into the (Mott) insulator, which is complementary to the
conventional Eliashberg-Migdal approach for the EPI in metals. In the latter
case, we have the Fermi energy εF as a relevant energy scale, which is usually
much larger than the phonon frequency Ω0 . In this case, the adiabatic Migdal
approximation is valid and the vertex corrections, which correspond to the
multi-phonon cloud and are essential to the self-trapping phenomenon, are
suppressed by the ratio Ω0 /εF . Therefore an important issue is the crossover
from the strong coupling polaronic picture to the weak coupling EliashbergMigdal picture. This occurs as one increases the carrier doping into the insulator. As is observed by ARPES experiments in high temperature superconductors, the polaronic states continue to survive even at finite doping [177].
This suggests a novel polaronic metallic state in underdoped cuprates, which
is common also in CMR manganites [36] and is most probably universal in
transition metal oxides. In the optimal and overdoped region, the EliashbergMigdal picture becomes appropriate [170, 171], but still a nontrivial feature of
the EPI is its strong momentum dependence leading to the dichotomy between
the nodal and anti-nodal regions. It is an interesting observation that the highest superconducting transition temperature is attained at the crossover region
between the two pictures above, which suggests that both the itinerancy and
strong coupling to the phonons are essential to the quantum coherence. It
should be noted that this crossover occurs in a nontrivial way also in the momentum space, i.e., the nodal and anti-nodal regions behave quite differently
as discussed in Sect. 6.2. However, the relevance of the EPI to the high Tc
superconductivity is still left for future investigations.
We hope that this article convinces the readers the vital role of ARPES
experiments and numerically exact solutions to the EPI problem, the combination of them offers a powerful tool for the momentum-energy resolved
analysis of these rather complicated strongly correlated electronic systems.
This will pave a new path to the deeper understanding of the many-body
electronic systems.
