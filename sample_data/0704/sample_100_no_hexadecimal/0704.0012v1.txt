Abstract. Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms f (z) :=

P∞

n=0

af (n)q n ∈

Sλ+ 12 (Γ0 (N ), χ) ∩ Z[[q]] that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo
odd primes p. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to

modular forms of half integral weight for primes p ≥ 5. As applications of our main

theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes p ≥ 5, of traces of singular

moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture
for overpartitions.

1. Introduction and Results
Let Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) and Sλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) be the spaces, respectively, of modular forms
2
2
and cusp forms of weight λ + 12 on Γ0 (N) with a Dirichlet character χ whose conductor
divides N. If f (z) ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ), then f (z) has the form

where q := e2πiz . It is well-known that the coefficients of f are related to interesting
objects in number theory such as the special values of L-function, class number, traces of
singular moduli and so on. In this paper, we study congruence properties of the Fourier
coefficients of f (z) ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]] and their applications.

Recently, Bruinier and Ono proved in [3] that g(z) ∈ Sλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]] has a
2
special form (see (2.1)) by modulo p when p is an odd prime and the coefficients of f (z)
do not satisfy the following property for p:
Property A. If M is a positive integer, we say that a sequence α(n) ∈ Z satisfies Property
A for M if for every integer r

there exists a positive integer n for which gcd(a(n), p) = 1 and gcd(n, p) = 1, then at least
one of the following is true:

As an applications of Theorem 1, we study the distribution of traces of singular moduli
modulo primes p ≥ 5. Let j(z) be the usual j-invariant function. We denote by Fd the
set of positive definite binary quadratic forms
F (x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy 2 = [a, b, c]
with discriminant −d = b2 − 4ac. For each F (x, y), let αF be the unique complex number
in the complex upper half plane, which is a root of F (x, 1). We define ωF ∈ {1, 2, 3} as


 2 if F ∼Γ [a, 0, a],
ωF :=
3 if F ∼Γ [a, a, a],


1 otherwise,

where Γ := SL2 (Z). Here, F ∼Γ [a, b, c] denotes that F (x, y) is equivalent to [a, b, c].
From these notations, we define the Hecke trace of singular moduli.

is the usual trace of singular moduli. Let
h(z) :=

and χ0 is a trivial character. Here, T (m2 , λ, χ) denotes the mth Hecke operator of weight
λ + 21 with a Dirichlet chracter χ (see VI. §3. in [5] or (2.5)). Zagier proved in [11] that
for all m and d
(1.2)

tm (d) = −Bm (1, d).

Using these generating functions, Ahlgren and Ono studied the divisibility properties
of traces and Hecke traces of singular moduli in terms of the factorization of primes in
imaginary quadratic fields (see [2]). For example, they proved that a positive proportion
of the primes l has the property that tm (l3 n) ≡ 0 (mod ps ) for every positive integer n
√

coprime to l such that p is inert or ramified in Q −nl . Here, p is an odd prime, and
s and m are integers with p ∤ m. In the following theorem, we give the distribution of
traces and Hecke traces of singular moduli modulo primes p.

for every integer r, p ∤ r.
As another application we study the distribution of Hurwitz class number modulo
primes p ≥ 5. The Hurwitz class number H(−N) is defined as follows: the class number
of quadratic forms of the discriminant −N where each class C is counted with multiplicity
1
. The following theorem gives the distribution of Hurwitz class number modulo

primes p ≥ 5.

We also use the main theorem to study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions. Newman's conjecture concerns the distribution of the ordinary partition function
modulo primes p.
Newman's Conjecture. Let P (n) be an ordinary partition function. If M is a positive
integer, then for every integer r there are infinitely many nonnegative integer n for which
P (n) ≡ r (mod M).
This conjecture was already studied by many mathematicians (see Chapter 5. in [8]).
The overpartition of a natural number n is a partition of n in which the first occurrence
of a number may be overlined. Let P̄ (n) be the number of the overpartition of an integer
n. As an analogue of Newman's conjecture, the following theorem gives a distribution
property of P̄ (n) modulo odd primes p.

Remark 1.3. When r ≡ 0 (mod p), Theorem 2, 3 and 4 were proved in [2] and [10].

Next sections are detailed proofs of theorems: Section 2 gives a proof of Theorem 1. In
Section 3, we give the proofs of Theorem 2, 3, and 4.

Theorem 2.1 ([3]). Let λ be a non-negative integer. Suppose that g(z) = ∞
n=0 ag (n)q ∈
Sλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]], where χ is a real Dirichlet character. If p is an odd prime and
2
a positive integer n exists for which gcd(ag (n), p) = 1, then at least one of the following
is true:

Moreover, if gcd(p, 4N) = 1, ǫ ∈ {±1}, and l ∤ 4Np is a prime with nli ∈ {0, ǫ}
for 1 ≤ i ≤ t, then (l − 1)g(z) is an eigenform modulo p of the half-integral weight
Hecke operator T (l2 , λ, χ). In particular, we have

(l − 1)g(z)|T (l , λ, χ) ≡ ǫχ(p)

Recall that f (z) = n=0 a(n)q n ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]]. Thus, to apply Theorem
2
2.1, we show that there exists a cusp form fe(z) such that fe(z) ≡ θp−1 (f (z)) (mod p) for
a prime p ≥ 5.

f (z) =
a(n)q n ∈ Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]].

Then, there exists a cusp form fe(z) ∈ Sλ+(p+1)(p−1)+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ) ∩ Z[[q]] such that

(2.4)

Ep−1 (z) ≡ 1 (mod p)

(see [6]). From (2.3) and (2.4), we have
[Ep−1 (z), f (z)]1 ≡ θ(f (z))

(mod p)

and [Ep−1 (z), f (z)]1 ∈ Sλ+p+1+ 1 (Γ0 (N), χ). Repeating this method p − 1 times, we com2
plete the proof.

Using the following lemma, we can deal with the divisibility of ag (n) for positive integers

suppose that λ ≥ 1 and that m ⊂ OK is an ideal norm M.
(1) Then, a positive proportion of the primes Q ≡ −1 (mod 4MN) has the property
that
g(z)|T (Q2 , λ, χ) ≡ 0 (mod m).
(2) Then a positive proportion of the primes Q ≡ 1 (mod 4MN) has the property that
g(z)|T (Q2 , λ, χ) ≡ 2g(z) (mod m).
We can now prove Theorem 1.

We apply Theorem 2.1 with fe(z). Then the purpose of the remaining part of the proof

Thus, (feψ (z) − feψχβ (z))|T (l21 , λ + (p + 1)(p − 1), χ) satisfies the formula (2.2) of Theorem
2.1 for both of ǫ = 1 and ǫ = −1. This results in a contradiction since
(feψ (z) − feψχβ (z))|T (l21 , λ + (p + 1)(p − 1), χ) 6≡ 0

In [2] it was obtained a holomorphic modular form on Γ0 (4p2 ) whose Fourier coefficients
generate traces of singular moduli modulo p (see the formula (3.1) and (3.2)). Since the
level of this modular form is not relatively prime to p, we need the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1 ([1]). Suppose that p ≥ 5 is a prime. Also, suppose that p ∤ N, j ≥ 1 is

p ≡ 2 (mod 3). Note that
that

This results in a contradiction since 2t1 (3) = 24 * 31. Thus, we obtain a proof when m = 1.
For every odd prime l, we have
f1,p (z)|T (l2 , λ′ , χ0 ) ≡ θp−1 (h1,p (z))|T (l2 , λ′ , χ0 )

≡ θp−1 (h1,p (z)|T (l2 , 1, χ0 )) ≡ θp−1 (hl,p (z))

(mod p).

Moreover, Lemma 2.3 implies that a positive proportion of the primes l satisfies the
property
f1,p (z)|T (l2 , λ′ , χ0 ) ≡ 2f1,p

This completes the proof.

We claim that there exists a positive integer β such that G(z) is a holomorphic modular
form of half integral weight on Γ0 (16p2 ). To prove our claim, we follow the arguments
of Ahlgren and Ono ([1], Lemma 4.2). Note that, by a well-known criterion, Fp (z) is a
holomorphic modular form on Γ0 (4p2 ) that vanishes at each cusp ac ∈ Q for which p2 ∤ c
(see [7]). This implies that G(z) is a weakly holomorphic modular form on Γ0 (16p2 ). If β

is sufficiently large, then G(z) is holomorphic except at each cusp ac′ for which p2 |c′ .
Thus, we prove that G(z) is holomorphic at 2m1p2 for 0 ≤ m ≤ 3. Let, for odd d,

Note that W (z) has its only pole at z ∼ 0 up to Γ0 (16). Since γv,m ∈ Γ0 (16), the
formula (3.3) implies that Wχp (z) is holomorphic at 2m p2 for 1 ≤ m ≤ 3. Thus, G(z) is
holomorphic at 2m p2 for 1 ≤ m ≤ 3.
If m = 0, then we have

This implies that G(z) is a holomorphic modular form of half integral weight on Γ0 (16p2 ).
Noting that
P̄ (3) = 8,
the remaining part of the proof is similar to that in Theorem 3. Thus, it is omitted.
