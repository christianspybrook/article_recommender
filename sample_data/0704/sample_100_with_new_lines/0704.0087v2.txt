abstract our main result in this paper is the following given h m  h n
hyperbolic spaces of dimensional m  2 and n corresponding and given a
holder function f  f 1   f n1   h m  h n between geometric boundaries of h m and h n  then for each   0 there exists a harmonic map
u  h m  h n which is continuous up to the boundary in the sense of euclidean and uh m  f 1   f n1  
1 introduction
let h m and h n are hyperbolic spaces with dimensions m  2 and n correspondingly for convenience we use the upperhalf space models for h m and h n  so
h m  x1   xm   irm  xm  0 h n  y 1   y n   irn  y n  0 with
metrics
dx1 2    dxm 2

where 0 is the euclidean gradient and 0 is the euclidean laplacian
a c 2 map u  h m  h n is called a harmonic map if  us  0 for all s 
1 2  n the literature about harmonic maps between riemannian manifolds are
abundant we refer the readers to the classical work 4
one of the interesting problems for harmonic maps is that of the dirichlet problem at infinity given h m and h n geometric boundaries of h m and h n  and
given a continuous map f  m  n here continuity is understood in the sense

of euclidean is there a harmonic map u  h m  h n such that in euclidean sense
u is continuous up to the boundary h m and takes boundary value f 
for this problem with some more requirements for the smoothness of f  there are
many results in three papers 8 9 and 7 li and tam established the existence
and uniqueness of a harmonic function u which is c 1 up to the boundary and has
boundary value f  provided f is c 1  but for more general types of f  according to
our knowledge there is no answer to the existence of a solution u
in this paper we establish the existence of approximate solutions to the dirichlet
problem for harmonic maps between two hyperbolic spaces with prescribed boundary value more explicitly we prove the following result
theorem 1 let f  h m  h n be a bounded
r 1uniformly continuous let functions
g and  be as in section 2 assume that 0 t1 gtdt   in particular this
condition is satisfied if f is holder continuous for each   0 there exists a
harmonic map u  h m  h n which is continuous up to the boundary h m and
uh m  f 1   f n1  
our strategy for proving this result is the follows first we construct an initial
map ie a c 2 map v  v 1   v n1  v n   h m  h n which has boundary value
f for any continuous map f  h m  h n  for this step we follows the ideas in
9 with some changes since the function f needs not to differentiable we can
not take v n as in 9 and the function v n of ours is a function of one variable xm 
then we use this function to produce harmonic maps u  h m  h n which takes
boundary value f 1   f n1  v n   for every   0
2 initial maps
in this part we use the techniques in 9 to construct good initial maps v having
the map f  h m  h n as the boundary value
let f  irm1  irn1 be a uniformly continuous bounded function let
g  h m  0 be c 2  bounded and
lim gx  xm   0
xm 0
uniformly in x 
we denote by v  f g  h m  h n the extension of f defined as follows
xm f  y  
dy  
v  x  xm  
mm rm1 x  y  2  xm 2 m2
for 1    n  1 and
v n x  xm   gx  xm 
by results in 9 pp 628630 we have
i v is c 2 and up to the boundary given by xm  0 it is continuous
ii if 1    n  1 then
lim xm 0 v    0
xm 0
uniformly in x 
moreover by estimates of elliptic pdes see theorem 210 in 5 noting that
v  is bounded there exists constants c  0 such that
maxxm 3 d3 v   xm 2 d2 v   xm 0 v    c
approximate solutions to the dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between hyperbolic spaces
we put
gr 
f y    f x 
sup
x y  i
and
 x y  r
gsds
s2  r 2
since g is monotone it follows that g is lebesgue measurable moreover since g is
bounded we see that  is welldefined
using polar coordinates with center at x we see that there exists a constant
c  0 such that
xm f y    f x 
 cxm 
irm1 x  y  2  xm 2 m2
for all x  irm1 
since f is uniformly continuous we see that
lim gr  0
now we show that
lim xm   0
xm 0
indeed for any   0 we find   0 such that
gs  
if 0  s   so if k  supsir gs we have
gsds 
gsds
2  r2
2  r2
k 2
s r
s  r2
  arctanr  k2  arctanr
letting r  0 we see that
lim sup r  2
since   0 is arbitrary we see that
lim r  0
thus if we put v  f xm  we see that v is an extension of f  moreover we
have the following result
lemma 1 let f  h m  h n be nonconstant uniformly continous and
bounded put v  f xm  as above then v is smooth up to the boundary
it is continuous virm1  f and there exists c  0 such that for xm near 0 we
have
 v2  c

proof by section 6 in 9 we have
xm 0 v    c3 xm 
where 1    n  1 and c3 is a positive constant
directly computation gives

s2  r2 2

s  r 
s2  r2 3
maxr r r2 r  c4 r
where c4 is a constant
since g is increasing g  exists almost everywhere and g   0 using integration
s2 r 2
 s2s
by parts noting that ds
r 2   s2 r 2 2  we have
z  2
s  r2

gsds
s2  r2 2

s2  r 2
g  sds
2  r2
differentiating the last term in above equality we get
2rs
r  
g  sds
2  r2 2
since f is nonconstant we see easily that g  6 0 in fact we dont need this
restriction since we can add g with a nonconstant positive function for example
xm 12  so since g   0 it follows from above equalities that
 r  0
and
rr  c5  r
where c5 is a positive constant then use the formula for the tension field we are
done
3 proof of theorem 1
proof fixed   0 we define v  h m  h n as follows
v x  v 1 x v 2 x  v n1 x xm   
for each   0 denote u  h m k   xm    h n the harmonic map
taking value v on  
by inequality 21 in 2 and properties of v and v see lemma 1 we have
h m dh n u  v    v   c
xm 
 c xm 
xm   
for all x    and here c is one constant from lemma 1

we claim that the function
u2 u du ds
is welldefined for r  0 in fact using the formula for  we have
z rz 
z rz z 
u  du ds 
u1 u2  t2 1 gtdt du ds
since the integrand is nonnegative using fubinis theorem we have
z rz z 
z rz z 
u1 u2  t2 1 gtdt du ds 
u1 u2  t2 1 gtdu dt ds
z rz 
log1  2 gtdt ds
z z r
log1  2 gtds dt
0 2t
z  2
t 2
t  2 arctan r t  r log1  rt 2 
gtdt
now since gt is bounded we have
z  2
t  2 arctan rt t2
gtdt
is convergent fixed r  0 near t  0 we have
r log1 
and when t   we have
r2 
r log1 
r2 
gt  t1 gt
gt  t3 gt
hence since gt is bounded and the assumption that 0 t1 gt converges our claim
is verified
we use the same  to denote the function   h m  ir defined
by x  xm 
r  2
for x  x   x
 x   h  now we have  r  r u  du  0 and
r  r2 r since m  2 we have
h m x  xm 2 xm  
m  2  m
 x   xm 2 xm   r
hence
h m dh n u  v   c
  0
for x    hence by maximum principle we have
sup dh n u  v   c xm 
this bound for dh n u  v  is independent of  hence by standard arguments see
the proof of theorem 64 in 9 we have a harmonic map u  h m  h n which is
the subsequent limit of u  moreover for all x  h m we have
dh n u  v   c xm 
duong minh duc and truong trung tuyen
hence
lim dh n u  v   0
xm 0
which shows that u is continuous up to the boundary and takes boundary value
