special attention to the inclusion of nsiinduced resonant conversions which may take place in the
most deleptonised inner layers we study the possibility of detecting nsi effects in a megaton water
cherenkov detector either through modulation effects in the e spectrum due to i the passage
of shock waves through the sn envelope ii the time dependence of the electron fraction and iii
the earth matter effects or finally through the possible detectability of the neutronization e
burst we find that the e spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal nsiinduced
resonant conversion this occurs for nonuniversal nsi strengths of a few  and for very small
flavorchanging nsi above a few105

introduction
tions may arise from renormalization andor threshold
effects 21
the very first data of the kamland collaboration 1
have been enough to isolate neutrino oscillations as the
correct mechanism explaining the solar neutrino problem 2 3 indicating also that large mixing angle lma
was the right solution the 7663 tonyr kamland data
sample further strengthens the validity of the lma oscillation interpretation of the data 4
we stress that nonstandard interactions strengths are
highly modeldependent in some models nsi strengths
are too small to be relevant for neutrino propagation
because they are either suppressed by some large mass
scale or restricted by limits on neutrino masses or both
however this need not be the case and there are many
theoretically attractive scenarios where moderately large
current data imply that neutrino have mass for an
updated review of the current status of neutrino oscillations see 5 theories of neutrino mass 6 7 typically require that neutrinos have nonstandard properties such as neutrino electromagnetic transition moments 8 9 10 or nonstandard fourfermi interactions
nsi strengths are possible and consistent with the smallness of neutrino masses in fact one can show that
nsi may exist even in the limit of massless neutrinos 14 15 16 17 18 such may also occur in the
context of fully unified models like so10 22
nsi for short 11 12 13 the expected magnitude of
the nsi effects is rather modeldependent
nation of the oscillation parameters it is necessary to
test for subleading nonoscillation effects that could arise
from nonstandard neutrino interactions these are natural outcome of many neutrino mass models and can be of
two types flavorchanging fc and nonuniversal nu
these are constrained by existing experiments see below and with neutrino experiments now entering a precision phase 23 an improved determination of neutrino
seesawtype models lead to a nontrivial structure of
the lepton mixing matrix characterizing the charged and
neutral current weak interactions 6 the nsi which
are induced by the charged and neutral current gauge
interactions may be sizeable 14 15 16 17 18 alternatively nonstandard neutrino interactions may arise in
models where neutrinos masses are radiatively calculable 19 20 finally in some supersymmetric unified
models the strength of nonstandard neutrino interac
we argue that in addition to the precision determi
parameters and their theoretical impact constitute an important goal in astroparticle and high energy physics 5
here we concentrate on the impact of nonstandard
neutrino interactions on supernova physics we show
how complementary information on the nsi parameters could be inferred from the detection of corecollapse
supernova neutrinos the motivation for the study is
twofold first if a future sn event takes place in our

of the e e    cross section measured at lep ii
leads to a bound on ep
    05 33 future prospects
to improve the current limits imply the measurement of
galaxy the number of neutrino events expected in the
current or planned neutrino detectors would be enormous o104  105  24 moreover the extreme conditions under which neutrinos have to travel since they
are created in the sn core in strongly deleptonised regions at nuclear densities until they reach the earth
lead to strong matter effects in particular the effect of
small values of the nsi parameters can be dramatically
sin2 w leptonically in the scattering off electrons in the
target as well as in neutrino deep inelastic scattering in
a future neutrino factory the main improvement would
be in the case of feep  and fep  where values as small
as 103 and 002 respectively could be reached 31
enhanced possibly leading to observable consequences
this paper is planned as follows in sec ii we summarize the current observational bounds on the parameters
describing the nsi including previous works on nsi in
sne in sec iii we describe the neutrino propagation
formalism as well as the sn profiles which will be used
in sec iv we analyze the effect of nsi on the  propagation in the inner regions near the neutrinosphere and in
the outer regions of the sn envelope in sec v we discuss
the possibility of using various observables to probe the
presence of nsi in the neutrino signal of a future galactic
sn finally in sec vi we present our conclusions
the search for flavor violating processes involving
charged leptons is expected to restrict corresponding neutrino interactions to the extent that the su 2 gauge
symmetry is assumed however this can at most give
indicative orderofmagnitude restrictions since we know
su 2 is not a good symmetry of nature using radiative
corrections it has been argued that for example   e

nonstandard interactions can also affect neutrino
propagation through matter probed in current neutrino
oscillation experiments the bounds so obtained apply to
the vector coupling constant of the nsi f
since only this appears in neutrino propagation in matter 91
preliminaries
a large class of nonstandard interactions may be
parametrized with the effective lowenergy fourfermion
operator
ln si  f

where p  l r and f is a first generation fermion
e u d the coefficients f
denote the strength of the
nsi between the neutrinos of flavors  and  and the
p handed component of the fermion f 
current constraints on f
come from a variety of different sources which we now briefly list
the role of neutrino nsis as subleading effects on the
solar neutrino oscillations and kamland has been recently considered in ref 34 35 36 with the following

cosmology
if nonstandard interactions with electrons were large
they might also lead to important cosmological and astrophysical implications for instance neutrinos could
be kept in thermal contact with electrons and positrons
longer than in the standard case hence they would share
a larger fraction of the entropy release from e annihilations this would affect the predicted features of the
cosmic background of neutrinos as recently pointed out
in ref 40 required couplings are though larger than
the current laboratory bounds
nsi in supernovae
on the other hand it has been noted since long ago
that the existence of nsi plays an important role in the
propagation of sn neutrinos through the envelope leading to the possibility of a new resonant conversion in
contrast to the well known msw effect 44 45 it would
take place even for massless neutrinos 13 two basic
ingredients are necessary universal and flavor changing
nsi in the original scheme neutrinos were mixed in the
leptonic charged current and universality was violated
thanks to the effect of mixing with heavy gauge singlet
leptons 6 14 such resonance would induce strong neutrino flavor conversion both for neutrinos and antineutrinos simultaneously possibly affecting the neutrino signal of the sn1987a as well as the possibility of having
rprocess nucleosynthesis this was first quantitatively
considered within a twoflavor e  scheme and bounds
on the relevant nsi parameters were obtained using both
arguments 46
one of the main features of the such internal or
massless resonant conversion mechanism is that it requires the violation of universality its position being
according to the currently accepted supernova sn
paradigm neutrinos are expected to play a crucial role
in sn dynamics as a result sn physics provides
a laboratory to probe neutrino properties moreover
many future large neutrino detectors are currently being discussed 41 the enormous number of events
o104  105  that would be seen in these detectors indicates that a future sn in our galaxy would provide a
very sensitive probe of nonstandard neutrino interaction
determined only by the matter chemical composition
namely the value of the electron fraction ye  and not by
the density in view of the experimental upper bounds
on the nsi parameters such new resonance can only take
place in the inner layers of the supernova near the neutrinosphere where ye takes its minimum values in this
region the values of ye are small enough to allow for
resonance conversions to take place in agreement with
existing bounds on the strengths of nonuniversal nsi
effects
parameters
the presence of nsi can lead to important consequences for the sn neutrino physics both in the highly
dense core as well as in the envelope where neutrinos
basically freely stream
the sn physics implications of another type of nsi
present in supersymmetric rparity violating models
the role of nonforward neutrino scattering processes
on heavy nuclei and free nucleons giving rise to flavor
change within the sn core has been recently analyzed in
have also been studied in ref 47 again for a system
of two neutrinos for definiteness nsi on dquarks were
considered in two cases i massless neutrinos without
mixing in the presence of flavorchanging fc and nonuniversal nu nsis and ii neutrinos with ev masses
and fc nsi different arguments have been used in
order to constrain the parameters describing the nsi
namely the sn1987a signal the possibility to get successful rprocess nucleosynthesis and the possible enhancement of the energy deposition behind the shock
wave to reactivate it
on the other hand several subsequent articles 48 49
50 considered the effects of nsi on the neutrino propagation in a threeneutrino mixing scenario for the case
ye  04 typical for the outer sn envelope together
with the assumption that dv
this prevents the
  10
appearance of internal resonances in contrast to previous
references
motivated by supersymmetric theories without r parity in ref 48 the authors considered the effects of
smallstrength nsi with dquarks following the formalism developed in refs 51 52 they studied the corrections that such nsi would have on the expressions
for the survival probabilities in the standard resonances
mswh and mswl a similar analysis was performed
in ref 49 assuming zinduced nsi interactions originated by additional heavy neutrinos a phenomenological generalization of these results was carried out in
ref 50 the authors found an analytical compact expression for the survival probabilities in which the main
effects of the nsi can be embedded through shifts of the
mixing angles 12 and 13  in contrast to similar expressions found previously these directly apply to all mixing
angles and in the case with earth matter effects the
main phenomenological consequence was the identification of a degeneracy between 13 and e  similar to the
analogous confusion between 13 and the corresponding nsi parameter noted to exist in the context of longbaseline neutrino oscillations 53 54
we have now reconsidered the general threeneutrino
mixing scenario with nsi in contrast to previous
work 48 49 50 we have not restricted ourselves to
large values of ye  discussing also small values present
in the inner layers this way our generalized description includes both the possibility of neutrinos having the
massless nsiinduced resonant conversions in the inner layers of the sn envelope 13 46 47 as well as the
outer oscillationinduced conversions 48 49 50 92
iii
neutrino evolution
in this section we describe the main ingredients of our
analysis our emphasis will be on the use of astrophysically realistic sn matter and ye profiles characterizing
its density and the matter composition their details
in particular their time dependence are crucial in determining the way the nonstandard neutrino interactions
affect the propagation of neutrinos in the sn medium
evolution equation
as discussed in sec ii in an unpolarized medium the
neutrino propagation in matter will be affected by the
vector coupling constant of the nsi f
the way the neutral current nsi modifies the neutrino evolution will be parametrized phenomenologically
through the effective lowenergy fourfermion operator
described in eq 1 we also assume f  r neglecting possible cp violation in the new interactions
under these assumptions the hamiltonian describing
the sn neutrino evolution in the presence of nsi can be
cast in the following form 94
  hkin  hint   
where hkin stands for the kinetic term
hkin  u
m2 
with m 2  diagm21  m22  m23  and u the threeneutrino
lepton mixing matrix 6 in the pdg convention 55 and
with no cp phases
the second term of the hamiltonian accounts for the
interaction of neutrinos with matter and can be split into
two pieces
std
nsi

the first term hint
describes the standard interaction

with matter and can be written as hint

up to one loop corrections due to different masses of the
muon and tau leptons 56 the standard matter poten
tial for neutrinos is given by
vcc 
2gf ne  v0 ye 
where v0  76  1014 ev the density is given in gcm 
and ye stands for the relative number of electrons with
respect to baryons for antineutrinos the potential is
identical but with the sign changed
the term in the hamiltonian describing the non

take place ye  05 this value can further increase in
the most outer layers of the sn envelope due to the presence of hydrogen

expressed as

to propagate outwards and eventually ejects the sn envelope the evolution of the shock wave will strongly modify the density profile and therefore the neutrino propa

to the case of nsi on uptype quarks the existence of
nsi with electrons brings no drastic qualitative differences with respect to the pure oscillation case see below therefore the nsi potential can be expressed as
follows
vnsi
  d v0 2  ye  
from now on we will not explicitely write the superindex
d in order to further simplify the problem we will redefine the diagonal nsi parameters so that   0 as one
can easily see that subtracting a matrix proportional to
the identity leaves the physics involved in the neutrino
oscillation unaffected
supernova matter profiles
neutrino propagation depends on the supernova matter and chemical profile through the effective potential
this profile exhibits an important time dependence during the explosion fig 1 shows the density t r and the
electron fraction ye t r profiles for the sn progenitor as
well as at different times postbounce
progenitor density profiles can be roughly
parametrized by a powerlaw function
r  0
where 0  104 gcm3  r0  109 cm and n  3 the
electron fraction profile varies depending on the matter
composition of the different layers for instance typical
values of ye between 042 and 045 in the inner regions
gation 58 59 following ref 60 we shall assume that
the structure of the shock wave is more complicated and
an additional reverse wave appears due to the collision
of the neutrinodriven wind and the slowly moving material behind the forward shock as seen in the upper panel
of fig 1 95
on the other hand the electron fraction is also affected
by the time evolution as the sn explosion proceeds once
the collapse starts the core density grows so that the neutrinos become eventually effectively trapped within the
so called neutrinosphere at this point the trapped
electron fraction has decreased until values of the order of
033 61 when the inner core reaches the nuclear density
it can not contract any further and bounces as a consequence a shock wave forms in the inner core and starts
propagating outwards when the newly formed supernova shock reaches densities low enough for the initially
trapped neutrinos to begin streaming faster than the
shock propagates 62 a breakout pulse of e is launched
in the shockheated matter which is still rich of electrons and completely disintegrated into free neutrons and
protons a large number of e are rapidly produced by
electron captures on protons they follow the shock on
its way out until they are released in a very luminous
flash the breakout burst at about the moment when
the shock penetrates the neutrinosphere and the neutrinos can escape essentially unhindered as a consequence
the lepton number in the layer around the neutrinosphere
decreases strongly and the matter neutronizes 63 the
value of ye steadily decreases in these layers until values of the order of o102  outside the neutrinosphere
there is a steep rise until ye  05 this is a robust
feature of the neutrinodriven baryonic wind neutrino
heating drives the wind mass loss and causes ye to rise
within a few 10 km from low to high values between 045
and 055 64 see bottom panel of fig 1 inspired in the
numerical results of ref 60 we have parametrized the
behavior of the electron fraction near the neutrinosphere
phenomenologically as
ye  a  b arctanr  r0 rs  
where a  023  026 and b  016  020 the parameters r0 and rs describe where the rise takes place and
how steep it is respectively as can be seen in fig 1
both decrease with time
varies between r  108 cm and 109 cm depending on the
time considered this way one can fully characterize all
resonances that can take place in the propagation of supernova neutrinos both the outer resonant conversions
related to neutrino masses and indicated as the upper
bands in fig 1 and the inner resonances that follow
from the presence of nonstandard neutrino interactions
indicated by the band at the bottom of the same figure
here we pay special attention to the use of realistic matter and chemical supernova profiles and threeneutrino
flavors thus generalising previous studies
neutrino evolution in the inner regions
let us first write the hamiltonian in the inner layers
where hint  hkin  in this case the hamiltonian can be
written as
2ye  ee e e
h  hint  v0 2  ye  
0   
when the value of the  is of the same order as the
electron fraction ye internal resonances can arise 13
taking into account the current constraints on the s
discussed in sec ii one sees that small values of ye are
required 46 47 as a result these can only take place
in the most deleptonised inner layers close to the neutrinosphere where the kinetic terms of the hamiltonian
fig 1 density upper panel and electron fraction bottom
panel profiles for the sn progenitor and at different instants
after the core bounce from ref 60 the regions where the
h yellow and the l cyan resonance take place are also
indicated as well as the nsiinduced i gray resonance for
the parameters ee  0    007 and    005
the two regimes
in order to study the neutrino propagation through
the sn envelope we will split the problem into two different regions the inner envelope defined by the condition
vcc  m2atm 2e with m2atm  m23  m22  and the
outer one where m2atm 2e  vcc  from the upper
panel of fig 1 one can see how the boundary roughly
are negligible
given the large number of free parameters  involved we consider one particular case where e  and
e  are small enough to neglect a possible initial mixing
between e and  or   barring fine tuning this basically amounts to e  e   102  according to the
discussion of sec ii e automatically satisfies the condition whereas one expects that the window e   102
will eventually be probed in future experiments
since the initial fluxes of  and  are expected to be
basically identical it is convenient to redefine the weak
basis by performing a rotation in the    sector
    u 23       0 c23 s23

where c23 and s23 stand for cos23  and sin23  respectively the angle 23 can be written as

ing to eq 19 for different values of ye  the region in yel
with our initial assumptions on e one notices that
the new basis  basically diagonalizes the hamiltonian
and therefore coincides roughly with the matter eigenstate basis a novel resonance can arise if the condition
hee
 h  is satisfied we call this iresonance i standing for internal 96 the corresponding resonance condition can be written as
yei

fig 2 contours of yei as function of ee and   accord
where i is defined as    ee  in fig 2 we represent
the range of ee and   leading to the iresonance for
an electron fraction profile between different yemin s and
yemax  05 it is important to notice that the value
of yemin depends on time right before the collapse the
minimum value of the electron fraction is around 04
hence the window of nsi parameters that would lead
to a resonance would be relatively narrow as indicated
by the shaded yellow band in fig 2 as time goes on
yemin decreases to values of the order of a few  and
as a result the region of parameters giving rise to the iresonance significantly widens for example in the range
ee   103 possibly accessible to future experiments one
sees that the iresonance can take place for values of  
of the order of o102  this indicates that the potential
sensitivity on nsi parameters that can be achieved in supernova studies is better than that of the current limits
low represents the region of parameters that gives rise to iresonance before the collapse the arrows indicate how this
region widens with time
as seen in fig 1 in order to fulfill the iresonance condition for such small values of the nsi parameters the
values of ye must indeed lie as already stated in the
inner layers
several comments are in order first in contrast to
the standard h and lresonances related to the kinetic
term the density itself does not explicitly enter into the
resonance condition provided that the density is high
enough to neglect the kinetic terms analogously the energy plays no role in the resonance condition which is
determined only by the electron fraction ye  moreover
in contrast to the standard resonances the iresonance
occurs for both neutrinos and antineutrinos simultaneously 13 finally as indicated in fig 3 the e s e  are
not created as the heaviest lightest state but as the intermediate state therefore the flavor composition of the
neutrinos arriving at the hresonance is exactly the opposite of the case without nsi as we show in sec v this
fact can lead to important observational consequences
in order to calculate the hopping probability between
matter eigenstates at the iresonance we use the landau
zener approximation for two flavors

value is of the order o1 in the range of parameters we
are interested in taking all these factors into account
it follows that the internal resonance will be adiabatic
provided that e  105  well below the current limits
in full numerical agreement with e g ref 47
in fig 4 we show the resonance condition as well as
the adiabaticity in terms of   and e assuming the
other   0 in order to illustrate the dependence on
time we consider profiles inspired in the numerical profiles
of fig 1 at t  2 s upper panel and 157 s bottom

fraction at which the density has value of 5  1011 gcm3 
for comparison with fig 2 we have assumed yemin 
102 in the case of 157 s we observe how the border
of adiabaticity depends on   through the value of the
density at ri which in turn depends on time
before moving to the discussion of the outer resonances
a comment is in order namely how does the formalism
change for other nonstandard interaction models first
note that the whole treatment presented above also applies to the case of nsi on uptype quarks except that
the position of the internal resonance shifts with respect
to the downquark case indeed in this case the nsi

fies the properties of the h and l transitions 48 49 50
in particular one finds that the effects of the nsi can be
described as in the standard case by embedding the s
into effective mixing angles 50 an analogous confusion between sin 13 and the corresponding nsi parameter e has been pointed out in the context of longbaseline neutrino oscillations in refs 53 54
in this section we perform a more general and complementary study for slightly higher values of the nsi
parameters    few 102  still allowed by current
limits and for which the iresonance could occur
the phenomenological assumption of hierarchical
squared mass differences m2atm   m2  allows for
not too large s a factorization of the 3 dynamics
into two 2 subsystems roughly decoupled for the h
and l transitions 65 to isolate the dynamics of the
h transition one usually rotates the neutrino flavor basis by u  23  and extracts the submatrix with indices
13 48 50 whereas this method works perfectly for
small values of  it can be dangerous for values above
102  in order to analyze how much our case deviates
from the simplest approximation we have performed a
rotation with the angle 23  23   instead of just
23  by requiring that the new rotation diagonalizes the
submatrix 23 at the hresonance layer one obtains the
following expression for the correction angle 
tan2 
would induce a similar internal resonance for the condition ye  i 1  i 
in contrast for the case of nsi with electrons the
nsi potential is proportional to the electron fraction and
therefore no internal resonance would appear
neutrino evolution in the outer regions
in the outer layers of the sn envelope neutrinos can undergo important flavor transitions at those points where
the matter induced potential equals the kinetic terms
in absence of nsi this condition can be expressed as
vcc  m2 2e neutrino oscillation experiments indicate two mass scales m2atm and m2  m22  m21 5
hence two different resonance layers arise the socalled

 c212 c213  c2 s213   s2 s212  21 s2 s212 s13 27
it can be easily checked how in the limit of   0 one
recovers the standard resonance condition
v0 h yeh  atm c213 
in the region where the hresonance occurs yeh  05
taking into account eqs 24 and 27 one can already
estimate how the value of  changes with the nsi parameters in fig 5 we show the dependence of  on the  
after fixing the value of the other nsi parameters one
can see how for    102 the approximation of neglecting  significantly worsens assuming 23  4 and a
fixed value of  one can easily see that   basically
affects the numerator in eq 24 therefore one expects
a rise of  as the value of   increases as seen in fig 5
the dependence of  on  is correlated to the relative sign of the mass hierarchy and   for instance
for normal mass hierarchy and positive values of  the
dependence is inverse namely higher values of  lead
to a suppression of  apart from this general behavior  also depends on the diagonal term ee as seen in
fig 5 this effect occurs by shifting the resonance point
through the resonance condition in eq 27
one can now calculate the jump probability between matter eigenstates in analogy to the iresonance
by means of the landauzener approximation see
eqs 20 21 and 22

where h represents the adiabaticity parameter at the
fig 5 angle  as function of   for different values of ee
and   in the case of neutrinos of energy 10 mev with
normal mass hierarchy and s213  105  the other nsi parameters take the following values e  0 and e  103 
hresonance which can be written as
4he
  ee
where the expressions for h
are given in eqs 26
let us first consider the case    102  in this case
  0 and one can rewrite the adiabaticity parameter as

where
13  13  e 2  ye ye
in agreement with ref 50 for slightly larger s there
can be significant differences in fig 6 we show plz
the e   plane for antineutrinos with energy 10 mev
in the case of inverse mass hierarchy using eq 29 with
upper panel and without bottom panel the  correction the values of 13 and e have been chosen so
that the jump probability lies in the transition regime between adiabatic and strongly non adiabatic in the limit
of small     becomes negligible and therefore both results coincide from eq 31 one sees how as the value of
e increases h gets larger and therefore the transition
becomes more and more adiabatic for negative values
of e there can be a cancellation between e and 13 
and as a result the transition becomes nonadiabatic
an additional consequence of eq 32 is that a degeneracy between e and 13 arises this is seen in fig 7
which gives the contours of plz
in terms of e and 13
for    10  one sees clearly that the same landauzener hopping probability is obtained for different combinations of e and 13  this leads to an intrinsic confusion between the mixing angle and the corresponding
nsi parameter which can not be disentangled only in
the context of sn neutrinos as noted in ref 50
we now turn to the case of     102  as   
increases the role of  becomes relevant whereas in the
bottom panel plz
remains basically independent of   
one can see how in the upper panel plz
becomes strongly
sensitive to   for     10 
one sees that for positive values of   it tends to adiabaticity whereas for negative values to nonadiabaticity
this follows from the dependence of he
on  essentially through the term  c13 s s212  see eq 26 for
    102 one sees that sin  starts being important
and as a result this term eventually becomes of the same
 at this point the sign of
order as the others in he
   and so the sign of sin  is crucial since it may con
tribute to the enhancement or reduction of he
 this
directly translates into a trend towards adiabaticity or
nonadiabaticity seen in fig 6 thus for the range of
  relevant for the nsiinduced internal resonance the
adiabaticity of the outer h resonance can be affected in
a nontrivial way
turning to the case of the l transition a similar expression can be obtained by rotating the original hamiltonian
by u 13  u 23  48 50 however in contrast to the
case of the hresonance where the mixing angle 13 is
still unknown in the case of the l transition the angle
12 has been shown by solar and reactor neutrino experiments to be large 5 as a result for the mass scale 
this transition will always be adiabatic irrespective of the
values of   and will affect only neutrinos

observables and sensitivity
as mentioned in the introduction one of the major motivations to study nsi using the neutrinos emitted in a
sn is the enhancement of the nsi effects on the neutrino
propagation through the sn envelope due to the specific
extreme matter conditions that characterize it in this
section we analyze how these effects translate into observable effects in the case of a future galactic sn
schematically the neutrino emission by a sn can be divided into four stages infall phase neutronization burst
accretion and kelvinhelmholtz cooling phase during
the infall phase and neutronization burst only e s are
emitted while the bulk of neutrino emission is released
in all flavors in the last two phases whereas the neutrino
emission characteristics of the two initial stages are basi
wards on the other hand it is also believed that due to
the composition in matter of the protoneutronstar pns
the mean energies of the different neutrino spectra obey
hee i  hee i  he  i this means that a resonant conversion between e e  and    between
the neutrinosphere and the position of the stalled shock
wave would make the e e  spectra harder and therefore the energy deposition would be larger giving rise to
a shock wave regeneration effect
another argument used in the literature was the possibility that the rprocess nucleosynthesis responsible
for synthesizing about half of the heavy elements with
mass number a  70 in nature could occur in the region
above the neutrinosphere in sne 71 72 a necessary
fig 7 landauzener jump probability isocontours at the
hresonance in terms of e and 13 for    104  antineutrinos with energy 10 mev and inverted mass hierarchy
has been assumed
cally independent of the features of the progenitor such
as the core mass or equation of state eos the details
of the neutrino spectra and luminosity during the accretion and cooling phases may significantly change for
different progenitor models as a result a straightforward extraction of oscillation parameters from the bulk
of the sn neutrino signal seems hopeless only features
in the detected neutrino spectra which are independent
of unknown sn parameters should be used in such an
analysis 66
the question then arises as to how can one obtain information about the nsi parameters taking into account that the main effect of nsi is to generate new internal neutrino flavor transitions one possibility is to invoke theoretical arguments that involve different aspects
of the sn internal dynamics
condition is ye  05 in the nucleosynthesis region the
value of the electron fraction depends on the neutrino
absorption rates which are determined in turn by the
e e  luminosities and energy distribution these can
be altered by flavor conversion in the inner layers due to
the presence of nsi therefore by requiring the electron
fraction be below 05 one can get information about the
values of the nsi parameters
while it is commonly accepted that neutrinos will play
a crucial role in both the shock wave reheating as well
as the rprocess nucleosynthesis there are still other astrophysical factors that can affect both while the issue
remains under debate we prefer to stick to arguments
directly related to physical observables in a large water
cherenkov detector there are several possibilities
a the modulations in the e spectra due to the passage of shock waves through the supernova 58 59
b the modulation in the e spectra due to the time
dependence of the electron fraction induced by the
iresonance
in ref 47 it was argued that such an internal flavor
conversion during the first second after the core bounce
might play a positive role in the socalled sn shock reheating problem it is observed in numerical simula
d detectability of the neutronization e burst 77 78
tions 67 68 69 70 that as the shock wave propagates it loses energy until it gets stalled at a few hundred km it is currently believed that after neutrinos
escape the sn core they can to some extent deposit energy right behind and help the shock wave continue out
three of these observables 1 3 and 4 have already been
considered in the literature in the context of neutrino
oscillations here we discuss the potential of the above
promising observables in providing information about the

terms of the hierarchy the value of 13  and the presence
of nsi as described in the text the values of the survival
probabilities for e psurv  and e psurv  for each case are
also indicated
nsi parameters it is important to pay attention to the
possible ocurrence of the internal iresonance and to its
effect in the external h and lresonances the first can
induce a genuinely new observable effect item 2 above
here we concentrate on neutral currenttype nonstandard interactions hence there will be not effect in the
main reaction in water cherenkov and scintillator detectors namely the inverse beta decay e  p  e  n 98
for definiteness we take nsi with d down quarks in
which case the nsi effects will be confined to the neutrino evolution inside the sn and the earth through the
vector component of the interaction
during approximately the first two seconds after the
core bounce the neutrino survival probabilities are constant in time and in energy for all cases mentioned in table i only the earth effects could introduce an energy
dependence however at t  2 s the hresonance layer is
reached by the outgoing shock wave see fig 1 the way
the shock wave passage affects the neutrino propagation
strongly depends on the neutrino mixing scenario in the
absence of nsi cases a and c will not show any evidence
of shock wave propagation in the observed e spectrum
either because there is no resonance in the antineutrino
channel as in scenario a or because the hresonance is
always strongly nonadiabatic as in scenario c however in scenario b the sudden change in density breaks
the adiabaticity of the resonance leading to a time and
energy dependence of the electron antineutrino survival
probability psurv e t in the upper panel of fig 8 we
show psurv e t in the particular case that two shock
waves are present one forward and a reverse one 60
the presence of the shocks results in the appearance of
bumps in survival probability at those energies for which
the resonance region is passed by the shock waves all
these structures move in time towards higher energies as
the shock waves reach regions with lower density leading
to observable consequences in the e spectrum
from all possible combinations of nsi parameters we
we now turn to the case where nsi are present which
opens the possibility of internal resonances when such
iresonance is adiabatic the situation will be similar to
the case without nsi for normal mass hierarchy ai and
cia e will not feel the hresonance and therefore the
will concentrate on those for which the internal i transition does take place namely i   102  see fig 2
concerning the fc nsi parameters we will consider e 
between few  105 and 102  range in which the iresonance is adiabatic see fig 4 in the following discussion we will focus on the extreme cases defined in table i
one of the motivations for considering these cases is the
fact that the resonances involved become either adiabatic
adiabaticitybreaking effect will not basically alter their
propagation in contrast for inverted mass hierarchy
and large 13  case bi the hresonance occurs in the
antineutrino channel and therefore e will feel the shock
wave passage however in contrast to case b now e will
reach the hresonance in a different matter eigenstate
1m instead of 3m  see fig 3 that means that before
the shock wave reaches the hresonance the e survival
or strongly non adiabatic and hence the survival probabilities in the absence of earth effects or shock wave
passage become energy independent this assumption
simplifies the task of relating the observables with the
neutrino schemes
probability will be psurv  cos2 12  07 once the
adiabaticity of the hresonance is broken by the shock
wave then e will partly leave as 3m and therefore the
survival probability will decrease as a consequence one
expects a pattern in time and energy for the survival
servable effect in the right panels of fig 9 we show
the same as in the left panels but for sin2 13  107 
whereas for large values of 13  left panels the hresonance is always adiabatic and one has only to ensure
the adiabaticity of the iresonance for smaller values of
13 the adiabaticity of the hresonance strongly depends
on the values of e and    as discussed in sec iv b
this can be seen as a significant reduction of the yellow area only large values of either e or   would
still allow for a clear identification of the opposite shock
wave effects in darkshaded cyan we show the region
of parameters for which ph lies in the transition region
between adiabatic and strongly nonadiabatic and therefore could still lead to some effect
fig 8 survival probability psurv e t for e as function
of energy at different times averaged in energies with the energy resolution of superkamiokande for the profile shown in
fig 1 upper panel case b is assumed for sin2 13  102 
bottom panel case bi with    007 e  104 and the
rest of nsi parameters put to zero
probability in the case bi to be roughly opposite than in
the case b see bottom panel of fig 8 the position of
the peaks and dips en each panel do not exactly coincide
as the value of   roughly shifts the position of the hresonance
in the left panels of fig 9 we represent in lightshaded
yellow the range of e and   for which this opposite
shock wave imprint would be observable in the upper
panels we have assumed a minimum value of the electron
fraction of 006 based on the numerical profiles at t 
2 s of fig 1 in the bottom panels yemin is set to 001
inspired in the profiles at t  157 s it can be seen how as
time goes on the range of   s for which the iresonance
takes place widens towards to smaller and smaller values
this is a direct consequence of the steady deleptonization
of the inner layers
for smaller 13  case cib the situation is different
except for relatively large e values the hresonance will
be strongly nonadiabatic as in case c therefore the
passage of the shock waves will not significantly change
the e survival probability and will not lead to any ob
a useful observable to detect effects of the shock propagation is the average of the measured positron energies
hee i produced in inverse beta decays in fig 10 we
show hee i together with the one sigma errors expected for
a megaton water cherenkov detector and a sn at 10 kpc
distance with a time binning of 05 s for different neutrino schemes case b and case bi with different values of
   for the neutrino fluxes we assumed the parametrization given by refs 79 80 with he0 e i  15 mev and
he0  i  18 mev and the following ratio of the total
neutrino fluxes 0 e 0    08 99
one can see how the features of the average positron
energy are a direct consequence of the shape of the survival probability where dips have to be translated into
bumps and viceversa
thus it is important to stress that whereas in case
b one expects the presence of one or two dips depending on the structure of the shock wave see ref 60 or
nothing in the other cases one or two bumps are expected in case bi as seen in the upper left panel of
fig 10 as discussed in ref 60 the details of the
dipsbump will depend on the exact shape of the neutrino fluxes but as long as general reasonable assumptions like hee i  he i are considered the dipsbumps
should be observed
time variation of ye
we have just seen how the distorsion of the density
profile due to the shock wave passage through the outer
fig 9 range of   and e for which the effect of the shock
fig 10 the average energy of p  ne events binned in
wave will be observed in the upper panels a minimum value
time for case b dashed blue and bi solid red in each
of yemin  006 based on the numerical profiles at t  2 s
panel different values of   have been assumed the error
has been assumed see fig 1 in the lower panels we have
bars represent 1  errors in any bin e  104 
considered a case with
yemin
 001 inspired in the profile
at t  157 s the value of sin2 13 has been assumed to
be 102 and 107 in the left and right panels respectively
increases with time as can be seen in fig 2
we have also superimposed isocontours of constant hopping
let us first discuss the observational consequences of
the time dependence of the electron fraction in case bi
if   i in general is large enough the iresonance will
take place right after the core bounce in this case as
seen in the upper left panel of fig 10 the two bumps we
have just discussed in sec v a would be clearly observed
however for smaller nsi parameter values it could hap
probability 01 blue and 09 red in the i solid lines and
h dashed lines resonances for inverted mass hierarchy and
e  10 mev and antineutrinos the area in yellow represents
the parameter space where both resonances will be adiabatic
in the cyan area the iresonance is assumed to be adiabatic
whereas h lies in the transition region
as discussed in sec iv a the region of nsi parameters leading to iresonance is basically determined by the
pen that the iresonance occurs only after several seconds in particular for the specific ye profile considered
we show how this delay could be of roughly 2 4 or 9 sec
for values of   of 0025 002 or 0015 respectively see
last three panels fig 10 as can be inferred from the
figure this delay effect can lead to misidentification of
the pure nsi effect so for instance in the upper right
panel one sees how the two bumps might also be inter
minimum and maximum values of the electron fraction
yemin and yemax  the crucial point is that as the deleptonization of the protoneutron star goes on the value of
yemin steadily decreases with time as a result the range
of nsi strengths for which the iresonance takes place
preted as two dips given the astrophysical uncertainties
this subtle degeneracy can only be solved by extra information on for example the time dependence of the
spectra or the velocity of the shock wave given the supernova model however the time structure of the signal
sn envelope can induce a timedependent modulation in
the e spectrum in cases b and bi however the time
dependence of the electron fraction ye can also reveal the
presence of nsi leaving a clear imprint in the observed
e spectrum as we now explain
could eventually not only point out the presence of nsi
but even potentially indicate a range of nsi parameters
let us now turn to the normal mass hierarchy scenario cases ai and cia in analogy to the bi case
if i is relatively large the onset of the iresonance will
take place early on as can be inferred from fig 3 that
implies that e will escape the sn as 2  for smaller
values though it may happen that the iresonance becomes effective only after a few seconds this means
that during the first seconds of the neutrino signal e
would leave the star as 1 cases a and c then
after some point the electron fraction would be low
enough to switch on the iresonance and consequently
e would enter the earth as 2  this would result in
a transition in the electron antineutrino survival probability from psurv  cos2 12  07 to sin2 12  03
given the expected hierarchy in the average neutrino energies hee i  he i it follows that the change in ye
would lead to a hardening of the observed positron spectrum the effect is quantified in fig 11 for different
values of    the figure shows the average energy of
the p  ne events for the case of a megaton water
cherenkov detector exactly as in fig 10 but for scenarios ai and cia one can see how for    007 the iresonance condition is always fulfilled and therefore there
is no time dependence however for smaller values one
can see a rise at a certain moment which depends on the
magnitude of    a similar effect would occur in case
cib
earth matter effects
fig 11 the average energy of p  ne events binned in
time for case ai and cia and different values of    the
error bars represent 1  errors in any bin e  104 
in the presence of nsi e will arrive at the earth as 1
in cases bi and as 2 in case ai and cia therefore
its observation would exclude cases b and cib this
distortion in the spectra could be measured by comparing the neutrino signal at two or more different detectors
such that the neutrinos travel different distances through
the earth before reaching them 73 74 however these
earth matter effects can be also identified in a single detector 75 76
by analyzing the power spectrum of the detected neutrino events one can identify the presence of peaks located
at the frequencies characterizing the modulation these
before the shock wave reaches the hresonance layer
the dependence of the neutrino survival probability in the
cases we are considering on the neutrino energy e is very
weak however if neutrinos cross the earth before reaching the detector the conversion probabilities may become
energydependent inducing modulations in the neutrino
energy spectrum these modulations may be observed
do not dependend on the primary neutrino spectra and
can be determined to a good accuracy from the knowledge of the solar oscillation parameters the earth matter
density and the position of the sn in the sky 76 the
latter can be determined with sufficient precision even if
the sn is optically obscured using the pointing capability
of water cherenkov neutrino detectors 81
in the form of local peaks and valleys in the spectrum of
the event rate fde plotted as a function of 1e these
modulations arise in the antineutrino channel only when
e leave the sn as 1 or 2  in the absence of nsi this
happens in cases a and c where e leave the star as 1 
this method turns out to be powerful in detecting the
modulations in the spectra due to earth matter effects
and thus in ruling out cases b and cib however the position of the peaks does not depend on how e enters the
earth as 1 or 2  hence it is not useful to discriminate
case ai and cia from the cases a c and bi
the time dependence of ye  however can transform
case b into bi and c with inverse hierarchy into cib
leading respectively to an appearance and disappearance
of these earth matter effects in case bi the presence of
the shock wave modulation can spoil a clear identification
of the earth matter effects nevertheless the disappearance of the earth matter effects in the transition from
case c to cib allows us to pin down case cib
neutronization burst
the prompt neutronization burst takes place during
the first  25 ms after the core bounce with a typical
full width half maximum of 57 ms and a peak luminosity of 33351053 erg s1 the striking similarity of the
neutrino emission characteristics despite the variability
in the properties of the precollapse cores is caused by
a regulation mechanism between electron number fraction and target abundances for electron capture this
effectively establishes similar electron fractions in the inner core during collapse leading to a convergence of the
structure of the central part of the collapsing cores with
only small differences in the evolution of different progenitors until shock breakout 77 78
taking into account that the sn will be likely to be
obscured by dust and a good estimation of the distance
will not be possible the time structure of the detected
neutrino signal should be used as signature for the neutronization burst in ref 78 it was shown that such a
time structure can be in principle cleanly seen in the
case of a megaton water cherenkov detector it was
also shown how the time evolution of the signal depends
strongly on the neutrino mixing scheme in the absence
of nsi the e peak could be observed provided that the
e survival probability pe e is not zero as can be seen
in table i this happens for cases b and c however
for case a normal mass hierarchy and large 13  e
leaves the sn as 3  this leads to a survival probability
pe e  sin2 13  101  and therefore the peak remains
hidden
let us now consider the situation where nsi are
prensent for normal mass hierarchy e  which is born
as 2m passes through three different resonances i h
and l whereas i and l will be adiabatic the fate of
h will depend on the value of 13  for large values
case ai the hresonance will also be adiabatic this
implies that e s will leave as 2  the survival probability
will be pe e  sin2 12  03 and therefore the peak
will be seen as in cases b and c if 13 happens to
be very small case cia then h will be strongly nonadiabatic and therefore e will leave the star as 3  as a
consequence the neutronization peak will not be seen
for inverse mass hierarchy e is born as 1m and traverses adiabatically i and l this implies that they will
leave the star as 1 and therefore the peak will also be
observed however now the survival probability will be
larger pe e  cos2 12  07 thus for a given known
normalization ie the distance to the sn one expects a
larger number of events during the neutronization peak
in this case in fig 12 we show the expected number
of events per time bin in a water cherenkov detector in
the case of a sn exploding at 10 kpc for two different
neutrino schemes c and bi and for different sn progenitor masses one can see how the difference due to
the larger survival probability is bigger than the typical error bars associated to the lack of knowledge of the
progenitor mass
two comments are in order the neutronization e
burst takes place during the first milliseconds before
strong deleptonization takes place as a result in contrast to other observables we have considered in this paper here the iresonance will only occur for i  101 
on the other hand in the presence of additional nsi with
electrons this would significantly affect the   e cross
sections and consequently the results presented here
summary
we have analyzed the possibility of observing clear signatures of nonstandard neutrino interactions from the
detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova
in secs iii and iv we have reconsidered effect of   d
nonstandard interactions on the neutrino propagation
through the sn envelope within a threeneutrino framework in contrast to previous works we have analyzed
the neutrino evolution in both the more deleptonized in
earth matter effects and finally through the possible
detectability of the neutronization e burst note that
observable ii turns out to be complementary to the observation of the shock wave passage i and offers the
possibility to probe nsi effects also for normal hierarchy
neutrino spectra
in table ii we summarize the results obtained for different neutrino schemes we have found that observable
i can clearly indicate the existence of nsi in the case
of inverse mass hierarchy and large 13 case bi on
the other hand observable ii allows for an identification
of nsi effects in the other cases normal mass hierarchy
cases ai and cia and inverse mass hierarchy and small
13 case cib therefore a positive signal of either ob
fig 12 number of events from the elastic scattering on electrons per time bin in a megaton water cherenkov detector for
a sn at 10 kpc for cases c dashed lines and bi solid lines
different progenitor masses have been assumed 13 m n13
in red 15 m s15s7b2 in black and 25 m s25a28 in blue
1sigma errors are also shown for the 15 m case
ner layers and the outer regions of the sn envelope we
have also taken into account the time dependence of the
sn density and electron fraction profiles
first we have found that the small values of the electron fraction typical of the former allows for internal nsiinduced resonant conversions in addition to the standard
mswh and mswl resonances of the outer envelope
these new flavor conversions take place for a relatively
large range of nsi parameters namely   between
102  101  and e   few  105  currently allowed
by experiment for this range of strengths in particular    nonstandard interactions can significantly affect
the adiabaticity of the hresonance on the other hand
the nsiinduced resonant conversions may also lead to
the modulation of the e spectra as a result of the time
dependence of the electron fraction
in sec v we have studied the possibility of detecting
nsi effects in a megaton water cherenkov detector using the modulation effects in the e spectrum due to i
the passage of shock waves through the sn envelope ii
the time dependence of the electron fraction and iii the
servable i or ii would establish the existence of nsi in
the latter case this would however leave a degeneracy
among cases ai cia and cib such degeneracy can
be broken with the help of observables iii and the observation of the neutronization e burst the detection
of earth matter effects during the whole supernova neutrino signal would rule out case cib since as discussed in
sec v c a disappearance of earth matter effects would
take place due to a transition from c to cib finally
the non observation of the neutronization burst can be
used to distinguish between cases ai and cia
similarly other degeneracies in table ii may be lifted
by suitably combining different observables for example a negative of observable ii could mean either negligible nsi strengths or nu nsi parameter values so
large that the internal resonance is always present in
this case one could use the observation of the neutronization burst in order to establish the presence of nsi for
the case of inverse mass hierarchy in addition the observation of the shock wave imprint in the e spectrum
would provide additional information on 13 
in conclusion by suitably combining all observables
one may establish not only the presence of nsi but also
the mass hierarchy and probe the magnitude of 13

91 axial couplings would affect neutrino propagation in polarized media see ref 82
92 however we have confined ourselves to values of e small
enough not to lead to drastic consequences during the
core collapse
93 for the sake of simplicity we will omit the superindex v 
94 the importance of collective flavor neutrino conversions
driven by neutrinoneutrino interactions has been recently noted in refs 83 84 85 86 here we consider
only the case where the effective potential felt by neutrinos comes from their interactions with electrons protons
and neutrons in a future work we plan to include this
effect and have a complete picture of the neutrino propagation
here we neglect the possible effects of density fluctuations 87 88 taking place during the shock wave propagation for a detailed study of the phenomenological
consequences see refs 89 90
the alternative condition hee
would give rise to
another internal resonance which can be studied using
the same method for brevity we will not pursue this in
this paper
note that in the limit of high densities one recovers
the rotation angle obtained for the internal iresonance
23  23 after neglecting the kinetic terms
for the case of nsi with electrons both the vector and
axial components of e will contribute to the   e cross
section
we assume that for the values of the nsi parameters considered the initial neutrino spectra do not significantly
change
