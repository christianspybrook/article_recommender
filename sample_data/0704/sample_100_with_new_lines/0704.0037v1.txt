abstract
in this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the discrete dipole approximation
dda to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the
incident light and describe an optimized publicly available dda computer program that
processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations numerical simulations of
light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index
m  105 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the mie theory
errors of both integral and angleresolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and
show no systematic dependence on x computational times increase steeply with both x and
m reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors the main distinctive
feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single dda simulation over a
cluster of computers which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles like
the ones that are considered in this manuscript current limitations and possible ways for
improvement are discussed

1 introduction
the discrete dipole approximation dda is a general method to calculate scattering and
absorption of electromagnetic waves by particles of arbitrary geometry and composition the
dda was first proposed by purcell and pennypacker 1 and was reviewed by draine and
flatau in 1994 2 a recent review 3 describes the current state of the dda and its
historical development it also explains the equivalence of the dda and methods based on the
volume integral equation formulation the reader is referred to this review for an indepth
discussion of the dda
there are a number of computer programs based on the dda some of which were
recently compared by penttila et al 4 the most popular among them is ddscat 5
which has been widely used by many researchers for more than 10 years in this paper we
present a new program amsterdam dda adda which recently has been put in the public
domain 1 its main distinctive feature is the ability to parallelize a single dda simulation over
a cluster of computers which allows simulation of light scattering by very large particles
this is demonstrated for a number of test cases in this manuscript validation of adda by
simulating light scattering by wavelengthsized particles and comparing it with other dda
programs was reported elsewhere 4
section 2 describes in detail the adda computer code showing its advantages
compared to other codes a number of numerical tests are shown in section 3 demonstrating
that dda is actually capable processing large particles and showing the current capabilities
of adda results of these simulations are discussed in section 4 the errors are compared
with previous results for much smaller particles section 5 concludes the manuscript and
discusses possible future work
2 adda computer code
adda has been developed over a period of more than 10 years at the university of
amsterdam 68 its main feature distinctive from other dda codes has always been the
capability of running on a cluster of computers parallelizing a single dda computation in
contrast with eg ddscat 5 that allows farming several instantiations of a dda
simulation to different processors this allows using a practically unlimited number of
dipoles since adda is not limited by the memory of a single computer 89 recently the
overall performance of the code has been improved significantly together with some
optimizations specifically for singleprocessor mode addas source code and
documentation is freely available
most of adda is written in ansi c which ensures wide portability on the sourcecode
level the code is fully operational under linux and in sequential mode on windows based
systems the parallelization over multiple processors is based on a geometric decomposition
of the particle and the singleprogrammultipledata paradigm of parallel computing the
code is written for distributed memory systems using the message passing interface mpi 2
note that adda should in principle also run on shared memory computers but so far this
was not explicitly tested the fast fourier transform fft used for the matrixvector products
in the iterative solver is performed either using routines by temperton 10 or the more
advanced package fastest fourier transform in the west fftw 11 the latter is
generally considerably faster but requires a separate package installation
adda has four options implemented for dipole polarizabilities clausiusmossotti 1

cg 16 and quasi minimal residual qmr 16 the last two iterative methods employ the
complexsymmetric property of the dda interaction matrix to halve the calculation time 16
the default stopping criterion of the iterative method in adda is the relative norm of the
residual  which must be  10 5 
the usual formulation of dda can be written as 23
 i1pi   g ij p j  einc
j i
where  i is the tensor of dipole polarizability e inc
is incident electric field g ij is the freei
space greens tensor complex symmetric and pi is the unknown dipole polarization if the
polarizability tensor is diagonal for all dipoles then there always exists a  i such that
 i  i   i  ie  i   i  moreover  i is then complex symmetric and so is the matrix with
elements
i  i  j
a ij  
  i g ij  j  i  j
where i is an identity tensor a is the interaction matrix that is used in adda ie the
following system of linear equations is solved
 a ij x j  x i    i g ij  j x j   i einci 
j i
where x i   i pi is a new unknown vector eq 3 is equivalent to the use of jacobipreconditioning 15 together with keeping the interaction matrix complexsymmetric for any
distribution of refractive index inside the scatterer and for any of the supported polarization
prescriptions we have not studied however whether this jacobipreconditioning improves
the convergence of the iterative solver flatau showed 17 that in some test cases it helps
while in others there is no improvement it is important to note also that dda is not limited to
diagonal or symmetric polarizabilities any other tensor may be used but then the interaction
matrix is not complexsymmetric hence qmr and bicg are less efficient
adda can perform orientation averaging of the scattering quantities over three euler
angles    of the particle orientation averaging over the angle  is done with a single
computation of internal fields by computing scattering in different scattering planes which is
comparably fast averaging over the other two euler angles is done by independent dda
simulations the averaging itself is performed using a romberg integration 18 which may
be used adaptively ie automatically simulating the required number of different orientations
to reach a prescribed accuracy but limits the possible number of values for each orientation
angle to be 2 n  1  where n is an integer moreover symmetries of the scatterer may be used
to decrease the intervals of euler angles over which to average and hence accelerate the
calculation this feature of adda was tested in a recent benchmark study 4
other features of adda include computation of scattering by a tightly focused
gaussian beams 6 a checkpoint system to allow for long runs on queuing systems that
enforce upper limits on wall clock time for execution as is usually the case on massively
parallel supercomputers calculation of radiation forces on each of the dipoles 19 use of
rotational symmetry of the scatterer to halve the simulation time and an extended command
line interface some other features such as applicability to anisotropic scatterers and a large
set of predefined shapes are planned to be implemented in the near future
there are several factors that allow addas performance to compare favorably with
other codes which was shown in a benchmark study by penttila et al 4 first of all the
fftw 3 package that is used automatically adapts itself to optimally perform on any
particular hardware moreover adda does not perform complete 3d fft transforms in one
run but decomposes them into a set of 1d transforms with data transposition in between this
allows employing the fact that input data for the forward transform contains many zeros and

see main text for explanation
only part of the output data of the backward transform is used 8 second we have
implemented four different krylovspacebased iterative solvers allowing us to choose the
most suitable one for a particular application as is known from the literature 172021 and
demonstrated in section 3 there is not a best iterative solver for dda depending on all
details of the scattering problem any of the methods may outperform the others third
dynamic memory allocation and optimized data structures allow all computations except the
fft to be performed only for the real nonvoid dipoles and not for the whole computational
box this also decreases addas memory consumption moreover symmetry of the
interaction matrix is used to decrease memory required for its fourier transform finally all
float variables in adda are represented in double precision this accelerates convergence in
cases when machine precision becomes important moreover basic operations with doubleprecision numbers can be faster than with singleprecision ones on modern processors this
acceleration comes at a cost of increased memory consumption which is however still lower
than for other computer codes 4
more information on adda can be found in an extensive manual included in the
distribution package

the scattering quantities only slightly we remove such results from further consideration
because a separate study is required to quantify this effect see section 4 for fully converged
results the errors of scattering quantities due to the numerical convergence are much smaller
than the total errors data not shown
a complete set of xm pairs for which adda converged is shown in table 1 it also
shows the number of dipoles per wavelength in the medium    md where d is the size of the
dipole we tried to keep it equal to 10 according to the rule of thumb as formulated by
draine and flatau 2 however it was slightly different because we varied the size of the
dipole grid to optimize the parallel efficiency of adda 4 the total number of dipoles in a
rectangular computational grid shown in table 1 was varied from 26105 to 13108 it can
the best parallel performance is obtained when grid size divides the number of processors however adda
works with any grid size

simulations 70 gb respectively
for each sphere we computed the extinction efficiency the asymmetry parameter and
all mueller matrix elements in one scattering plane which is a symmetry plane of the cubical
discretization of the sphere exact results for the same spheres were obtained using the mie
theory 22 spherical symmetry was used by adda to get all results from calculations for
only one polarization state of the incident field therefore computation time is a factor of two
smaller than for nonsymmetric scatterers with the same x and m we employed a volume
correction to ensure equal volumes of sphere and its dipole representation 2 note however
that for the very large spheres this correction is extremely small

4 discussion
the convergence of the qmr iterative solver shown in fig 2 featuring plateaus and steep
descents is in agreement both with its behavior in general 16 and with particular examples
of its application to dda 2023 a distinctive feature of this graph compared to the
literature data is that the convergence slows down with iteration number ie the logarithm of
the residual norm decreases slower than linearly this is probably due to the large size of the
scatterer and loss of numerical precision see discussion below
the total computation times t increase steeply both with x and m fig 3 the time is
displayed in a logarithmic scale covering a range from 4 seconds to more than 2 weeks for
m  105  the increase of t with x is mostly due to the increasing number of dipoles to model
the scatterer since the number of iterations increase at a slower pace table 1 for larger m
these two effects are comparable combining into a very unfavorable scaling which can be
approximately described by a power law t  c m x  m  where   6 for m  12  it should
be noted that both the number of iterations and t do not always increase monotonically with x
for example for x  80  m  12 and x  30  m  14 the execution times are unusually high
this may be caused by a large condition number of dda interaction matrices for these two
particular particles moreover when the convergence is slow it may suffer from machine
precision the latter determining the limit of x and m for which adda will converge at all
therefore current size limitations of the dda for m  12 are due to the practically
unbearable computation times and not due to memory requirements 5 simulations for larger
m are far from the memory limit shown in fig 1 moreover simply using more processors
does not solve the problem improving numerical performance is required eg dedicated
preconditioning of the iterative solver 15 on the other hand extension to larger sizes for
m  12 is feasible if more computer resources are available this facilitates for example
simulating scattering of visible light by almost all biological cells in suspension
the increase of the number of iterations with m is a wellknown fact 12172124
however there is still no theoretical foundation to describe it in details rahola 24 provided
theoretical predictions of the dependence of the number of iterations on m valid for scatterers
smaller than the wavelength however these conclusions are not applicable to the scatterers
studied in this manuscript the general reason for the slowing down of the convergence with
increasing m is increased interaction between dipoles and hence an increased condition
number of the interaction matrix absorption if present should decrease the overall
interaction between dipoles in a large scatterer therefore it is expected that convergence for
complex refractive indices should be better than for the purely real ones that we consider here
the same was suggested by budko and samokhin 25 based on the analysis of the spectrum
of the integral scattering operator however this proposition is still to be verified by
numerical tests
another parameter that may greatly affect the computation time is the convergence
threshold  in this paper it is set to a defacto default value of 105 2 which ensures
negligibly small numerical errors compared to the model errors however in many cases
numerical errors are small enough already for   10 3  ie the difference of the scattering
quantities between simulations with   10 3 and   10 5 is significantly smaller than the
difference between the latter and the exact values data not shown fig 2 shows that qmr
for a particular case converges to   10 3 and   2  103 three and six times faster
respectively than to   10 5  results for other simulated particles and iterative solvers show
similar trends and even larger acceleration with increasing  in some cases data not shown
therefore if one can determine an optimum  for a particular case it can decrease the
computation time significantly however we do not pursue this issue further in this
manuscript
fig 4 shows the deterioration of the accuracy of qext with increasing m while there is
no clear dependence on x the only exception is a single result for m  2  results for
 cos  fig 5 behave in a similar way these results are in good agreement with results of
other researchers for smaller size parameters 21326 both in terms of the errors themselves
and their dependence on m to express errors on the angular dependencies of s11 we use two
integral parameters the maximum  and rms relative errors fig 6 and fig 7 respectively
although these parameters are not completely objective as they are significantly influenced
by the values of s11 in deep minima which are completely irrelevant to most real
experiments they do provide a consistent measure of the dda accuracy to relate these
integral parameters to some other criteria eg visual agreement three examples are presented
in fig 8  fig 10 errors of s11  show the same tendencies as the integral scattering
quantities except that errors for m  105 are relatively large larger than those for m  12 in
the range x  60  and generally decrease with x this is due to the relative nature of the
measured errors and the huge dynamical range of s11  for small refractive indices see fig
8 results for smaller size parameters found in the literature 226 show a similar increase of
the boundary value of m is not welldefined as it depends on particular hardware and restrictions on
computation time 12 is just a convenient value to guide the reader
errors with m however the errors themselves are considerably smaller for instance
maximum relative errors of s11  for x  10 and m up to 25  14i are smaller than 04 this
is due to the general differences between functions s11  for particles comparable to and
much larger than the wavelength the latter has deeper minima and a larger overall dynamic
range it is important to note that refractive indices as small as 105 are rarely used in dda
simulations 26 therefore it is hard to make any definite conclusions concerning the behavior
of errors in this case
in what follows the traditional rule of thumb 2 is discussed which states that for
  md  10 errors of cross sections and asymmetry parameter are expected to be a few
percents and maximum errors in the angular dependence of s11 on the order of 2030 
results for both qext and  cos  do satisfy the rule of thumb however this rule does not
describe the decrease of errors by two orders of magnitude with decreasing m the latter can
be used to cut down the number of dipoles and hence computation time in cases when only
integral scattering quantities need to be calculated for small m relative errors of s11  are
much larger than that predicted by the rule of thumb which is due to the fact that the latter
was derived based on test simulations for x smaller than 10 2 see however the discussion
below on possible changes for complex refractive index and nonspherical shapes to
conclude the rule of thumb has very limited application for the range of x and m here more
elaborate empirical functions are required to estimate the number of dipoles needed to reach a
prescribed accuracy they will also allow a more realistic estimate of dda computational
complexity ie the computation time needed to reach a certain accuracy of some scattering
quantities for particular x and m this topic is left for the future study
the test results shown in this paper are limited to real refractive indices and spherically
shaped scatterers in the following we try to generalize our conclusions to complex refractive
index and nonspherical shapes however we want to stress that this generalization is
speculative and more numerical tests are clearly needed to verify them it is expected that
accuracies of integral scattering quantities should not change significantly for more general
cases their accuracy should deteriorate both with increasing real and imaginary parts of the
refractive index the situation for angleresolved scattering quantities is expected to be
different large relative errors observed in this paper are due to deep minima that are a
consequence of both spherical symmetry and purely real refractive index it is expected that
visual agreement between the dda results and the exact solution as shown in fig 8  fig
10 should not change significantly for more general cases however it will result in smaller
relative errors especially for larger x and smaller m
5 conclusion
in this paper we present the adda a computer program to simulate light scattering by
arbitrarily shaped particles adda can parallelize a single dda simulation which allows it
not to be limited by the memory of a single computer moreover adda is heavily optimized
which allows it to compare favorably with other programs based on dda when running on a
single processor we showed its capabilities for simulating light scattering by spheres with x
up to 160 and m up to 2 the maximum reachable x on a cluster of 64 modern processors
decrease rapidly with increasing m it is 160 for m  105 and only 2040 depending on the
convergence threshold for m  2  this is mostly due to the slow convergence of the iterative
solver leading to practically unbearable computation times it is expected that larger particle
sizes can be reached if m has a significant imaginary part
errors of both integral and angleresolved scattering quantities show no systematic
dependence on x but generally increase with m errors of qext and  cos  range from less
than 001  to 6  maximum  and rms relative errors of s11  are in the ranges 0218
and 0041 respectively error predictions of the traditional rule of thumb have very limited
application in this range of x and m it describes the upper limit of errors of qext and  cos  
however it does not account for the decrease of the errors with m
currently the adda is capable of simulating light scattering by almost all biological
cells in suspension however its performance for other cases can be improved these
improvements left for future work may include improving the convergence of the iterative
solver by preconditioning it also is desirable to conduct a detailed study of the dependence of
the accuracy of the final results on the size of the dipole and convergence thresholds of the
iterative solver for different scatterers such a study should result in a reduction of the
computation time and provide a realistic estimate of dda complexity over a wide range of x
and m
