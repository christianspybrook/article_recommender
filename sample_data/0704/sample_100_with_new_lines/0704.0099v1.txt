introduction
in 1 ando proved the following inequalities for positive semidefinite psd
matrices a b and any unitarily invariant ui norm for any nonnegative
operator monotone function f t on 0 
f a  f b  f a  b
and when f 0  0 and f    and g is the inverse function of f 
ga  gb  ga  b
in a later paper 2 ando and zhan proved the related inequalities with the
same conditions on f and g
f a  f b  f a  b
ga  gb  ga  b
the conditions on f are satisfied by every operator concave function f with
f 0  0
inequality 4 was generalised by kosem 7 to nonnegative convex functions
g on 0  with g0  0 inequality 3 was generalised very recently to any
nonnegative concave function on 0  by bourin and uchiyama 5 who
also gave a simpler proof of kosems result
in the same spirit we consider the question whether inequalities 1 and 2
can also be generalised to nonnegative concave f and convex g respectively
after introducing the necessary prerequisites in section 2 we present our main
results concerning this question in section 3 regrettably most of our results
are negative answers and we give counterexamples to this generalisation the
answer is even negative for the special case a  b although the apparent
hardness of finding counterexamples had led us temporarily into believing
that in that case the generalisation might actually hold
all is not bad news however in section 4 we answer the question affirmatively
in the special case when a  b in section 5 we introduce the novel notion
of y dominated majorisation between the spectra of two hermitian matrices
where y is itself a hermitian matrix we prove a certain property of this
relation namely proposition 3 which we subsequently use first in a rather
destructive fashion to wit the proposition has been instrumental in finally
discovering a counterexample to the generalisation of 1 for a  b this will
be reported in section 6 on the more constructive side the proposition also
allows to strengthen the results of bourinuchiyama and kosem mentioned
above this is the topic of the final section along with a few other applications
preliminaries
in this section we introduce the notations and necessary prerequisites a more
detailed exposition can be found eg in 4 we will use the abbreviations lhs
and rhs for lefthand side and righthand side respectively
we denote the vector of diagonal entries of a matrix a by diaga
we denote the absolute value by    both for scalars and for matrices for
matrices this is defined as a  a a12  similarly we denote the positive
part of a real scalar or hermitian matrix by   and define it by a 
a  a2
in this paper we are mainly concerned with monotonously increasing convex
and concave functions from r to r kosem noted in 7 that any such function
can be approximated by a sum of angle functions x 7 ax  bx  x0   where
a  0 and b  0 for a convex angle function b  0 for a concave one
we are also concerned with the unitarily invariant ui matrix norms which
we denote by    and which are defined in terms of the singular values
j  of the matrix only we adopt the customary convention that the singular
values are sorted in nonincreasing order 1  2      d  special cases
of these norms are the operator norm    which is just equal to the largest
singular value 1  and the ky fan norms   k  which are defined as the
sum of the k largest singular values
ak 
j a
the famous ky fan dominance theorem states that a matrix b dominates
another matrix a in all ui norms if and only if it does so in all ky fan norms
the latter set of relations can be written as a weak majorisation relation
between the vectors of singular values of a and b
a w b 
j a 
j b k
for psd matrices the above domination relation translates to a weak majorisation between the vectors of eigenvalues a w b
weyls monotonicity theorem 4 corollary iii23 states that
k a  k a  b
for hermitian a and positive semidefinite b here  a denotes the real
vector of eigenvalues of a sorted in nonincreasing order
finally we refer the reader to chapter 2 of 6 for an exposition of a number
of important functional analytic properties of eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenspaces of a hermitian matrix which we will need in the proof of proposition 2
main results
the question we start with is about the straightforward generalisation of inequality 2 to nonnegative convex functions
question 1 for all a b  0 for all ui norms and for nonnegative convex
functions g on 0  with g0  0 does the inequality ga  gb 
ga  b hold
the answer to this question is negative as shown by the following counterexample we consider the convex angle function gx  x  x  1 and the
operator norm for the 2  2 psd matrices
0 06
08 05 
05 04
the eigenvalues of ga  b are 065249 and 035249 while those of ga 
gb are 065010 and 048862 thus ga  b  065249 which is
larger than ga  gb  065010 
under the additional restriction a  b the absolute value in the argument
of g in the righthand side vanishes leading to a simplified statement and a
second question with better hopes for success introducing the matrix  
a  b
question 2 for all b   0 for all ui norms and for nonnegative convex
functions g on 0  with g0  0 does the inequality gb gb 
g hold
this restricted case also turns out to have a negative answer counterexamples however were much harder to find and required a reduction of the prob4
lem based on certain results about a novel majorisationlike relation which
we call the y dominated majorisation this will be the subject of sections 5
and 6 where a number of propositions of independent interest are proven
it is also very reasonable to ask
question 3 for all b   0 for all ui norms and for nonnegative concave
functions f on 0  does the inequality f b    f b  f 
hold
in fact if this were true a positive answer to question 2 would easily follow
using the same reasoning that was used in 5 to derive the generalisation of
3 from the generalisation of 4
again this statement is false as the following counterexample shows consider
the concave angle function f x  minx 1  x  x  1  and the 3  3
psd matrices
0701816
0317887

0 0455416
one gets
f   0455416
while
f b    f b  0455776
in section 4 we consider an even more restricted special case in which the
inequalities 1 and 2 finally do hold we actually prove that a stronger
relationship holds in this special case
proposition 1 for nonnegative monotonously increasing and concave functions g and a b  0 such that a  b we have
 ga  b   ga  gb
an easy corollary is the corresponding statement for monotonously increasing
convex functions
corollary 1 let f be a nonnegative convex function on 0  with f 0  0
let a b  0 such that a  b then
 f a  b   f a  f b
proof let f  g 1  with g satisfying the conditions of proposition 1 replace
in 6 a by f a and b by f b yielding
 gf a  f b   a  b
applying the function f on both sides does not change the ordering because
of monotonicity of f  and yields validity of inequality 7 
these two results obviously imply the corresponding majorisation relations
and by ky fan dominance relations in any ui norm
proof of proposition 1
we want to prove inequality 6
 ga  gb   ga  b
for a b  0 a  b and concave monotonously increasing and nonnegative g
wlog we will assume b  1 since any other value can be absorbed in
the definition of g
it is immediately clear that if 6 holds for g that in addition satisfy g0  0
then it must also hold without that constraint ie for functions gx  c with
c  0 this is because the additional constant c drops out in the lhs while
 ga  b  c   ga  b
furthermore 6 remains valid when replacing gx with agx for a  0
thus wlog we can assume g0  0 and g1  1 together with concavity
of g this implies that for 0  x  1 gx  x while for x  1 the derivative
g  x  1
since 0  b  11 and for 0  x  1 gx  x holds we have gb  b
or gb  b by weyl monotonicity this implies  ga  gb 
 gab thus statement 6 would be implied by the stronger statement
 ga  b   ga  b
now note that the argument of g in the lhs a is never below 1 thus in
principle we could replace gx in the lhs by another function hx defined
hx 
 gx
if x  1
otherwise
if we also do that in the rhs we get a stronger statement than 8 indeed
hx  gx for x  0 and a  b  0 and therefore ha  b  ga  b
holds by weyl monotonicity again we see that 8 is implied by
 ha  b   ha  b
the importance of this move is that hx is still a monotonously increasing
and concave function because g  x  1 for x  1 but now has gradient
h x  1 for x  0
defining c  a  b which is positive semidefinite we now have to show the
inequality
k hc  b  b  k hc  hk c
for every k fixing k and introducing the shorthand x0  k c we can
exploit concavity of h to upper bound it as hx  ax  x0   hx0  where
a  h x0   1 again by weyl monotonicity we find
k hc  b  b  k ac  b  x0   hx0   b
 k ac  a  1b  ax0  hx0 
 k ac  ax0  hx0   hx0 
where in the second line we could remove the term a1b because it is negative this being true for all k we have proved 10 and all previous statements
that follow from it including the statement of the theorem 
on y dominated majorisation
to answer question 2 we have to consider the property that a convex function
f satisfies
f  w f b    f b
for all psd b and  which is equivalent to the statement
f a  b w f a  f b
for all a  b  0
the monotone convex angle functions x 7 ax  x  1 a  0 already
have proven their valour as a testing ground for similar statements in section
3 numerical experiments using angle functions for inequality 11 did not
directly lead to any counterexamples however this temporarily increased
our belief that the inequality might actually hold and led us to investigate
as an initial step towards a proof whether the inequality
j ay  b 
j ay  c
might be true for all a  0 where b  f y  and c  f x  y   f x and
f x  x  1  the crucial observation is now that if this holds for all a  0
then actually a much stronger relationship than just majorisation must hold
between ay  b and ay  c
to describe this phenomenon well consider a somewhat broader setting let
g and c be hermitian matrices and let f1 and f2 be monotonously increasing
real functions on r suppose that for all a  0 the following holds
j aa  b 
j aa  c
with a  f1 g and b  f2 g
it is easily seen that if 13 holds for a certain value of a it also holds for all
smaller positive values let b be a scalar such that 0  b  a because both
a and b exhibit their eigenvalues as diagonal elements in the eigenbasis of g
and both in nonincreasing order we get
j aa  b 
j ba  b  a  b
j a
on the other hand for aa  c we only have the subadditivity inequality
j aa  c 
j ba  c  a  b
j a
as a consequence we obtain that indeed
j ba  b 
j ba  c
follows from 13
we are therefore led to consider what happens when a tends to infinity because
that value dominates all others subtracting kj1 j aa from both sides and
substituting a  1t we obtain
j a  tb  j a 
j a  tc  j a
t j1
t j1
in the limit of t going to 0 this yields a comparison between derivatives
j a  tb 
t0 j1
j a  tc
t0 j1
 a  tc are the diagonal
we will show below that the derivatives t
t0 j
elements of c in a certain basis depending on g and c let us first introduce
the vector c a whose entries satisfy the following relation
j c a 
j a  tc
t0 j1
with this notation relation 14 becomes
j b g 
j c g
that is the entries of b g are majorised by those of c g however this is a much stronger relation than ordinary majorisation since the
rearrangement of the entries in decreasing order is absent
introducing the symbol dw for weak majorisation with missing rearrangement
a dw b 
aj 
bj 
relation 14 is expressed as
b g dw c g
to justify these notations we now show
proposition 2 let a and c be hermitian matrices with c a defined by
15 the entries of the vector c a are the diagonal entries of c in a certain
basis in which a is diagonal and its diagonal entries appear sorted in nonincreasing order when all eigenvalues of a are simple ie have multiplicity
1 this basis is just the eigenbasis of a and does not depend on c
proof there are three cases to consider according to whether a is nondegenerate a  tc has an accidental degeneracy at t  0 or a  tc is
permanently degenerate
1 the most important case is when all eigenvalues of a are simple ie when
they have multiplicity 1 we then show that the derivative is given by
j a  tc  trpk a c
t0 j1
where pk a denotes the projector on the subspace spanned by the k eigenvectors of a corresponding to its k largest eigenvalues
by the simplicity of the eigenvalues of a the eigenvalues of a  tc are also
simple for small enough values of t this follows easily from weyls inequalities
j a  n tc  j a  tc  j a  1 tc
thus if tc is strictly less than one half the minimal difference between
all pairs of eigenvalues of a the difference between all pairs of eigenvalues of
atc is bounded away from 0 therefore for small enough t every eigenvalue
of a  tc has a unique eigenvector and as a result pk a  tc is welldefined
as the sum of the projectors on the eigenvectors pertaining to the k largest
eigenvalues
it is wellknown that the eigenvalues of a tc as functions of the real variable
t can be so ordered that they are analytic functions of t see 6 chapter 2
and hence continuous this implies that the kth largest eigenvalue of a  tc
is also a continuous function of t for any k
if furthermore an eigenvalue t of a  tc is simple in an interval of t
then the projector p t on the eigenvector xt associated to it with p t 
xtxt  is also analytic and therefore continuous in t on this interval we
conclude that pk a  tc is analytic in t and therefore differentiable
by the maximality of pk a in the variational characterisation
j a  max tra qk   tra pk a
where qk runs over all rankk projectors we have
tra pk a  tc  0
which implies
j a  tc
t0 j1
tra  tc pk a  tc
tra pk a  tc 
t t0
 trc pk a
tra  tc pk a
let u be the unitary that diagonalises a ie uau    a then
trc pk a 
ucu  jj 
and the statement of the proposition follows
2 when a has degenerate eigenvalues the situation becomes somewhat more
complicated but there are no really significant changes there is no longer
a unique eigenbasis of a so that pk a is not welldefined for all k we will
first consider the case where c is such that it removes the degeneracy of the
eigenvalues of a in a  tc for small enough positive t in that case pk a  tc
will be uniquely defined for all positive t less than some value t0  which is the
smallest positive t for which a  tc has an accidental degeneracy which is
what also happens at t  0
this occurs for instance when c has simple eigenvalues indeed by analyticity of the eigenvalues of a  tc in t degeneracy is either accidental for
isolated values of t or permanent for all values of t since all eigenvalues
are simple for large enough t they have to remain simple for all values of t
except possibly for some isolated values such as t  0 in this case let t0
be the smallest positive such value then a  tc has simple eigenvalues for
0  t  t0 
we can therefore define pk a in a unique way as the limit limt0 pk a 
tc this is an allowed choice because of the continuity of the eigenvalues
j0 k a  trlimt0 pk a  tc a using the same argument as in the
previous case we obtain c a  trlimt0 pk a  tc c
let l be the eigenvalues of a multiplicity not counted and ql the projections onto the corresponding eigenspaces of a with ql the corresponding inclusion operators the rank of ql equals the multiplicity of l  which we denote
by ml  to obtain c a we first construct the diagonal blocks cl  ql cql
of size ml  then take the eigenvalues  cl  in nonincreasing order of each
block and then concatenate the obtained sequences of eigenvalues
c a   c1       cm 
if all eigenvalues of a are distinct this reduces to the vector of diagonal
elements of c in the eigenbasis of a that we encountered in case 1
for exampleif  a 
 5 5 3 1 then c a  1 c1  2 c1  c33  c44 
 c11
where c1  
c12 
c21 c22
and all entries of c are taken in the eigenbasis of a
let u be a unitary which in this case is not unique that diagonalises a as
uau     and take the diagonal blocks cl of ucu   as above each block
can be diagonalised using a unitary vl  together with u we obtain the total
basis rotation w  u l vl  by construction l vl leaves  invariant and
resolves the ambiguity in u we obtain that c a is the vector of diagonal
entries of c in the basis obtained by applying the unitary w 
3 finally we look at the case when a  tc is permanently degenerate ie
when it has degenerate eigenvalues for all values of t wlog we just have to
look at t in an interval 0 t0  where t0 is the smallest positive value for which
a  tc has an accidental degeneracy let us denote by j t the eigenvalues
of a  tc in nonincreasing order multiplicity mj not counted and by pj t
the projectors on the corresponding eigenspaces in that case pk a  tc is
only welldefined if there is a j  such that k  m1  m2      mj   then we
have pk a  tc  p1 t  p2 t      pj  t
if there is no such j   let j  be the largest integer such that k  m1  m2 
    mj   k   thus 0  k  k   mj  1  then we have
j a  tc
mi i t  k  k  j 1 t
 tra  tc p1 t      pj  t 
k  k
pj  1 t
mj  1
 tra  tc 
k  k
k  k
pkmj 1 a  tc  1 
pk a  tc
mj  1
mj  1
thus if we define   k  k  mj  1  kj1 j a  tc interpolates linearly
pk mj  1 
between kj1 j a  tc and j1
j a  tc with parameter 
proceeding in the same way as in the two previous cases we obtain for the
derivative
j a  tc  trcpkmj 1 a  1  pk a
t0 j1
where the pk a have to be replaced with the limits limt0 pk a  tc if in
addition there are accidental degeneracies at t  0 let us consider the entries
of c again as before in an eigenbasis of a in which the eigenvalues of a appear
on the diagonal in nonincreasing order we get
k  mj  1
c ak  1  
cii  
cii 
because of the permanent degeneracy an eigenbasis is determined up to local rotations within the various eigenspaces we consider a partitioning of
c in such an eigenbasis corresponding to these eigenspaces that is in c we
can single out diagonal blocks each of which corresponds to the eigenspace of
eigenvalue j  we can use our freedom to choose the local rotations to make
all diagonal elements of c equal within each diagonal block this allows us to
get rid of the interpolation in 18 and we finally obtain that again
c ak 
cii 
with the entries of c taken in the eigenbasis that we have just chosen 
the upshot of this proposition is that there exists a unitary u such that
uau    a and c a  diagucu   in the generic case that all
i a are distinct u is unique and does not depend on c
a number of easy consequences follow immediately from this proposition
corollary 2 let g and c be hermitian matrices f be any monotonously
increasing real function on r and g any strictly increasing real function on
r then
i f g g  f  g
ii c g obeys schurs majorisation theorem c g   c
iii c g  a f g  c  af g g a  0
iv c f a  c a
along with the previously demonstrated equivalence of 13 with 17 the
corollary immediately leads to the following proposition
proposition 3 for hermitian g c monotonously increasing real functions
f1  f2 on r and a  f1 g b  f2 g the following are equivalent
aa  b w aa  c a  0
b g dw c g
aa  b g dw aa  c g a  0
proof
19 implies 20 this is just proposition 2
20 implies 21 add a a to both sides and invoke statement iii of the
corollary
21 implies 19 by statement i of the corollary the lhs of 21 is equal
to  aa  b while by statement ii of the corollary its rhs is majorised
by aa  c 
counterexample to question 2
if the answer to question 2 is to be affirmative it should at least hold for all
angle functions f x  ax  bx  x0   by proposition 3 this is equivalent to
the statement
y  11  y  dw x  y  11  x  11  y 
consider the 3  3 matrices
035614 0053243 010116 
 0053243

040559 082474
010116
and
 053642
042018
0 0094866
the eigenbasis of y is therefore the standard basis then y  11  y  
0 0 0 and
x  y  11  x  11 
 000018194
 000052449

000052449 00016345 
02573
012368
012368 
004
so that x y 11 x 11  y   000018194 02573 004 the first
entry is negative violating the dw relation and thereby answering question
2 in the negative 
further applications of y dominated majorisation
one issue we had to address during our attempts at giving a positive answer
to question 2 dealt with the possibility of reducing the question for convex
functions to convex angle functions one way of doing so would have been
possible if the set of monotonously increasing and convex functions satisfying
11 were closed under addition while we were unable to prove this particular
statement which is most likely false anyway proposition 3 enables us to
prove the corresponding statement for the relation
f y  y  dw f x  y   f x y 
proposition 4 let all the eigenvalues of y be distinct let f and g be functions from r to r satisfying 22 then f  g also satisfies 22
proof by the assumption on the eigenvalues of y  a y  equals diaga in
a basis only depending on y and is therefore a linear function of a we can
therefore add up the inequalities 22 for f and g and obtain the corresponding
inequalities for f  g 
a second application of proposition 3 is a strengthening of the following proposition which we also obtained in the course of our attempts at positively
answering question 2
 with a  0 the following
proposition 5 for x y  0 and ga x  ax  x1
majorisation statement holds
ga y  w ga x  y   ga x
proof from the proof of lemma x14 in 4 we have for x y  0
j x  111  x  y  111   j 11  y  111 
defining the function f x 
 1  x  11  this turns into
j f x  y   f x  j f y 
this implies the majorisation statement
j f x  y   f x 
j f y 
we want to prove a somewhat similar statement for the function ga x since
both f and ga are monotonously increasing over r  and noting that ga x 
a  1x  f x we have
j ga y   ga j y   a  1j y   f j y 
j f y   f j y 
so that
j ga y   a  1j y   j f y 
this implies in particular
j ga y
  a  1
j y
j y  
 a  1
j f y 
j f x  y   f x
where we have inserted 23 exploiting the wellknown relation 4 th
iii41
j a

j b
for a  a  1y  f x  y   f x and b  f x  y   f x then yields
j ga y  
j a  1y  f x  y   f x
j ga x  y   ga x
proposition 3 with a  g  y  b  f y  c  f x  y   f x where
f x  x2 x  1 then yields the following strengthening of proposition 5
proposition 6 for x y  0 and ga x  ax 
with a  0
ga y  y  dw ga x  y   ga x y 
here we noted that ga x  y   ga x  ay  f x  y   f x
to end this section we present a third application of proposition 3 namely
to the results of kosem and bourinuchiyama consider first inequality 3
which holds for all nonnegative concave functions f x in particular it holds
for all functions f  ax  f0 x where f0 is nonnegative concave and a  0
inserting this in the eigenvaluemajorisation form of inequality 3 we get the
a  bdominated majorisation relation
aa  b  f0 a  b w aa  b  f0 a  f0 b
for a b  0 proposition 3 then immediately yields the stronger form
f a  b a  b dw f a  f b a  b
for all nonnegative concave functions f  the strengthening of inequality 4
is performed in a completely identical way and yields the reversed inequality
of 24 for nonnegative convex functions g such that g0  0
