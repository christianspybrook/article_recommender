we employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas we consider largescale hydrodynamic motions where
the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas
dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions we employ lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact nonstationary analytical solutions
that depend only on one spatial coordinate these solutions exhibit a new type of singularity where
the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions the density
blowups signal formation of closepacked clusters of particles as the density blowup time tc is
approached the maximum density exhibits a power law  tc  t2  the velocity gradient blows
up as   tc  t1 while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp rather than
a shock discontinuity at the singularity the gas temperature vanishes at the singularity and the
singularity follows the isobaric scenario the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform
in space and constant in time close to the singularity an additional exact solution shows that the
density blowup of the same type may coexist with an ordinary shock at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite we confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect
to small onedimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically
furthermore numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions

introduction
structure formation in manybody systems is one of
central problems of nonequilibrium physics a most
spectacular phenomena of structure formation is clustering of matter here an initially structureless almost homogeneous distribution of particles of matter
selfassembles into clusters such an evolution cannot
proceed indefinitely in a gas where interactions between
the particles are i shortrange and ii hamiltonian
there are two important classes of gases where one of
these two properties is violated and clustering can occur in the first one longrange forces such as gravity
are present clustering provides here a natural mechanism of star formation1 and of the largescale structure of the universe2  the second class of systems are
dissipative systems where interactions between the particles at the level of an effective description are nonhamiltonian one wellknown example is optically thin
gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation and
dense condensations develop345  in this paper we consider a more basic nonhamiltonian manybody system
a gas of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles or
granular gas here particles lose energy to their internal
degrees of freedom
the granular gas is the lowdensity limit of granular
flows67  in its simplest version the granular gas model
deals with a dilute assembly of identical hard spheres
with diameter  and unit mass who lose energy at instantaneous binary collisions in such a way that the normal component of the relative velocity of particles is re
duced by a constant factor 0  r  1 the coefficient of
normal restitution upon each collision granular gases
exhibit a plethora of structure forming instabilities including the clustering instability of a freely cooling homogeneous inelastic gas8910111213141516171819  this
instability brings about the generation of a macroscopic
flow and formation of dense clusters of particles
the natural language for a theoretical description of
macroscopic flows of a granular gas is the navierstokes
granular hydrodynamics67  although the criteria of its
validity are quite restrictive see below granular hydrodynamics is instrumental for theoretical investigations
and often prediction of a host of collective effects in
granular flows recently applications of granular hydrodynamics have been extended to nonstationary flows
of granular gases17202122  the nonstationary settings
provide sharp tests to continuum models of granular flows
and help evaluate their domains of validity this is especially true when the timedependent solutions of the
continuum equations develop finitetime singularities23 
such as the recently predicted density blowup in freely
cooling granular gases at zero gravity1722  and at finite
gravity21
we will assume throughout this paper nearly elastic
particle collisions a very small gas density that we denote by  and a very small knudsen number
1r  1
 d  1 
and
lf ree l  1 
here d  1 is the dimension of space lf ree is the
mean free path of the particles and l is the characteristic length scale of the hydrodynamic fields under
these assumptions the navierstokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leadingorder theory for
granular gases67  previous works910 employed hydrodynamic equations to show that for sufficiently large
systems the homogeneously cooling state of the granular gas is linearly unstable the unstable perturbations
grow via two linearly independent modes the shear
mode corresponding to the development of a macroscopic
solenoidal flow and the clustering mode corresponding
to the development of a potential flow that causes formation of clusters of particles how does the clustering mode develop beyond the linear regime and do the
hydrodynamic nonlinearities arrest the density growth
for the clustering instability in large systems as well as
for the gravitational instability2  the growing perturbations bring the system into a fully developed nonlinear
regime91114161718  therefore one has to deal with fully
nonlinear hydrodynamic equations not restricting ourselves to a close proximity to the homogeneously cooling state we can formulate the problem in a more general way and explore different nonlinear flows of a freely
evolving granular gas
solving the hydrodynamic equations analytically and
even numerically is a difficult task and additional simplifications are needed we will make two additional simplifying assumptions in this work first assuming a largescale flow we will neglect the viscous and heat conduction terms in the hydrodynamic equations second we
will assume that the macroscopic flow is onedimensional
a natural environment for the second assumption is provided by the geometry of a narrow channel with perfectly
elastic side walls that we adopt here following refs1718 
although the microscopic motion of particles in the channel remains two or threedimensional 2d or 3d the
macroscopic flow depends only on one spatial coordinate
the coordinate along the channel this is because in a
narrow channel both the shear mode and the clustering mode in the transverse directions are suppressed see
refs 1718 for detail as a result one can focus on the
development of the onedimensional clustering mode as
it enters a strongly nonlinear regime
working in the channel geometry efrati et al17 considered the longwavelength limit of the clustering instability when the linear growth rate of the instability is
the highest in this case the inelastic energy loss of the
gas is the fastest process and the gas pressure drops almost instantaneously to a very small value the further
dynamics are then almost purely inertial which would
bring about a finitetime blowup of the velocity gradient and therefore of the density this is the well known
blowup of the free flow24  its signatures were observed in
the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations17
until the maximum gas density became so high that the
numerical scheme lost accuracy the numerical results of
ref17 were tested in molecular dynamics md simulations in 2d of a freely cooling gas of inelastically colliding disks in a long and narrow channel18  the md simulations supported the freeflow blowup scenario until
the time when the gas density approached the hexagonal
closepacking value and the further density growth was
arrested
as we have recently found22  the free flow asymptotics
does not hold all the way to the density blowup very
close in time and in space to the attempted freeflow
singularity the compressional heating starts to act and
temporarily stabilizes the gas temperature at a small
but finite value as a result the gas pressure again becomes important it breaks the purely inertial dynamics
and though unable to stop the density blowup dramatically changes the local blowup properties it turns out
that after a brief crossover the further dynamics obey a
new blowup scenario not limited to the longwavelength
limit22  the new scenario has the following features as
the blowup time tc is approached the maximum density exhibits a power law  tc  t2  the velocity
gradient blows up as  tc  t1  whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp rather
than a shock discontinuity at the singularity the gas
temperature vanishes at the singularity but the pressure
there remains finite this blowup which obeys the above
asymptotic laws near the singularity emerges universally
that is for generic initial and boundary conditions note
that in the longwavelength limit the crossover from the
free flow regime to the finitepressure regime does not
happen when the initial gas density is not very small
in this case excluded particle volume effects interfere in
the dynamics and arrest the density growth before the
crossover has a chance to occur as indeed was observed
in ref18 
these findings are based on extensive numerical simulations numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations for a host of initial and boundary conditions and a
family of exact analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic
equations without and with shocks briefly announced in
ref22  in the present work we give a detailed account of
the exact solutions and investigate their structure close
to the singularity we verify the exact solutions numerically we show that the singularity follows the isobaric
scenario the gas pressure is approximately uniform in
space and constant in time in a close vicinity of the developing singularity finally we evaluate the validity of
the exact solutions close to the singularity by estimating
the role of additional physical processes the viscosity
heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects
the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in
section ii we introduce the equations of ideal granular
hydrodynamics ighd and discuss their general properties in section iii we employ lagrangian coordinates
and derive a family of exact solutions of the ighd equations consider some particular cases of the solutions and
investigate global and local properties of the solutions
in section iv we adapt the exact solutions to describe a
different setting where a piston moves into a granular gas
at rest and a density blowup developing at the piston
coexists with an ordinary shock wave propagating into
the gas besides demonstrating the presence of the two
different types of singularities in the same system this solution allows an arbitrary initial density profile at large
distances showing that the density blowup is a local process section v presents the results of numerical solutions
of the ighd equations that confirm stability of the exact
solutions with respect to small onedimensional perturbations and establish universality of the density blowup
for different initial conditions in section vi we discuss
the role of nonideal effects neglected in our solutions
close to the singularity in section vii we summarize our
results and discuss their bearing on cluster formation
ideal hydrodynamics of a freely
cooling granular gas
under the three strong inequalities 1 the navierstokes granular hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively
accurate leadingorder theory for granular gases it deals
with three coarsegrained fields the mass density x t
the mean flow velocity vx t and the granular temperature t x t an additional coarsegrained field the pressure px t is related to the density and temperature
by the perfect gas equation of state p  t  assuming
a onedimensional macroscopic flow we can write these
equations as

  is the gamma
function in addition
and 0  40 in
2d and 0  53 2 1 and 0  150 8 in 3d see
ref 6 the only difference between eqs 24 and
the standard gas dynamic equations for a dilute gas of
elastically colliding spheres is the presence in eq 4 of
the inelastic energy loss term t 32 
there are three types of dissipative terms in eqs 24 the viscous terms in eqs 3 and 4 the heat
conduction term in eq 4 and the energy loss term in
eq 4 the viscous and heat conduction terms include
spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields whereas
the energy loss term is independent of the gradients
when the characteristic hydrodynamic length scale of the
flow is sufficiently large the viscous and heat conduction
terms can be neglected while the energy loss term should
be kept and we arrive at the equations of ideal granular
hydrodynamics ighd

for consistency all the assumptions must be checked a
posteriori after a hydrodynamic problem in question is
solved and the hydrodynamic length and time scales are
found
the basic state of the freely cooling gas is the homogeneously cooling state described by the haff law25 
  0 
v  0
1  0 t0 t2
this state corresponds to the initial conditions x t 
0  0  const t x t  0  t0  const and vx t 
0 obviously the ighd equations reproduce the haffs
law exactly as the homogeneously cooling state does not
include gradients of the hydrodynamic fields
a more meaningful example of a situation where the
ighd applies is provided by the linear stability analysis of the homogeneously cooling state this analysis in the framework of the complete nonideal navierstokes hydrodynamics 24 and its extensions was performed by many workers starting from goldhirsch and
collaborators9 and mcnamara10 the main results of the
linear stability analysis can be described at the level of
orderofmagnitude estimates as follows the evolution
of a small sinusoidal perturbation with the wave number k is determined by two competing processes the
inelastic energy loss tends to enhance thefluctuations
on the cooling time scale 1  r2  d1  t 1 which
is kindependent in its turn the viscosity and thermal conduction tend
to erase the perturbation on a time
scale k 2 lf2 ree  d1 t 1  where lf ree  1n d1  is
the mean free path and lf2 ree  d1 t is the characteristic value of the viscosityheat conductivity balancing these two timescales one obtains the critical wave
number kc  lf1
ree 1  r so that the perturbations with
k  kc grow while the shortwavelength perturbations
k  kc  decay910  in a narrow channel such that perturbations in the transverse direction with wave numbers smaller than kc are not allowed only perturbations
along the channel will grow as a result by the end of
the linear stage the hydrodynamic fields are effectively
onedimensional and
 have characteristic length scales of
the order of lf ree  1  r or longer the validity of the
navierstokes hydrodynamics 24 for the description
of the whole range of
 unstable perturbations demands
a strong inequality 1  r  1 on the other hand
the ighd model 5 and 6 is valid if we demand a
strong inequality k  kc  indeed one can check that in
this case the growth rate of the clustering instability as
obtained from the ighd coincides in the leading order
in kkc with that obtained from the full hydrodynamic
equations
in section vi we will perform a consistency check and
establish the validity domain of our exact nonlinear solutions of the ighd equations 5 and 6 now let us
discuss the basic properties of these equations although
much simpler than the nonideal equations 24 the
nonlinear ighd equations still present a hard mathematical problem going back to elastic particle collisions
  0 one recovers the ordinary ideal gas dynamics in
one dimension among most interesting solutions are
those describing the development of wavebreaking singularities when starting from smooth initial data2627  note
that even for   0 the general initial value problem is
not soluble analytically except for the particular case of
an isentropic flow where
the entropy per unit volume
s t    ln t 1 is uniform in space and constant
in time2627  needless to say at   0 eqs 5 and 6
do not allow isentropic
solutions the total entropy of
the fluid s  s t  dx governed by eq 5 and 6
is monotone decreasing
  2 t 12 dx 
where we have assumed that there is no net entropy
flux from the boundaries as expected from the microscopic picture the local entropy loss rate in eq 8 is
proportional to the particle collision rate the entropy
loss implies that the system may exhibit selforganization
phenomena28 as is indeed observed in the process of clustering instability
before deriving a family of exact solutions exhibiting a finitetime density blowup we note two rescaling
symmetries of eqs 5 and 6 the first symmetry
relates solutions at different   0 if x t vx t
and t x t solve eqs 5 and 6 at some  then the
rescaled fields  x  t v x  t
and t  x  t solve the same system with the
cooling coefficient   therefore the general mathematical properties of eqs 5 and 6 such as the existence
of singularities are the same for any   0 the second symmetry relates solutions of eqs 5 and 6 at the
same  if  v and t solve eqs 5 and 6 then  
and t defined by
x t  x  t x t  vx  t
t x t  t x  t 
with any   0 and   0 also solve eqs 5 and 6
these symmetries are exploited in the following

the family of exact solutions presented in this section
are smooth initially but become singular in a finite time
tc  at the singularity the density blows up in contrast
to the ordinary wavebreaking singularity of the ideal
gas dynamics   0 where only the gradients of the
hydrodynamic fields blow up2627  an exact solution of a
different type presented in section iv includes a shock
already at t  0 that solution also exhibits a density
blowup and the local properties of the blowup are the
same as in the initially smooth solutions
let us introduce lagrangian coordinates the coordinates xm t of the fluid particles obey the equation
xm t
 vxm t t
where m is a continuous label a lagrangian coordinate
of particles the defining property of the exact solutions
that we are going to present is independence of the particle accelerations t2 xm t of time the fluid particle
coordinates xm t satisfy the equation
xm t  xm 0  vm 0t 
am 0t2
where vm 0 and am 0 are the initial velocities and
accelerations of the fluid particles respectively as we
will see later the total mass of gas is finite for our solutions as a result the pressure must vanish at the boundaries implying existence of a point with a zero pressure
gradient and therefore a zero particle acceleration in
between a fluid particle that has a zero acceleration
that is conserved in our solutions moves with a constant velocity and we choose to work in such a frame of
reference where this particle is at rest so that the conditions vx  0 t  0 and x px  0 t  0 are obeyed
it is convenient to choose the lagrangian coordinate
m to be the mass coordinate29

where we have used eqs 12 and 16 for the solutions obeying eq 13 the lagrangian pressure gradient
m pm t should be independent of time since the pressure pm t is timeindependent and zero at the gas
boundaries it can depend only on m then eqs 16
and 17 yield

in view of the zero acceleration at the origin m p0 t

now let us consider what types of initial conditions
evolve according to eqs 2022 and discuss the density
blowup that is brought by this evolution
initial conditions and density blowup for the
exact solutions
a particular member of our family of exact solutions
2022 is determined by a specific choice of the constant a  0 and of the initial density m 0  0 defined on the interval 2 2 in the eulerian
coordinates one can specify an arbitrary initial density
profile x 0 that has a fixed total mass 
x 0dx  
where we have used the condition vm  0 t  0 this
family of solutions describes a compression flow the velocity gradient is negative everywhere as the compressional heating is balanced in eq 17 by the inelastic
cooling the solutions include an arbitrary nonnegative
function m 0 the initial gas density the arbitrary
constant a  0 that together with m 0 determines
the timedependent mach number of the flow appears
due to the rescaling symmetry of the equations and corresponds to the constant  in eq 9 one can check that
the constant  in eq 9 corresponds to the freedom of
multiplying m 0 and a by 
as the pressure p must be nonnegative and vanish
at the finite or infinite boundaries of the freely moving
gas the solutions 20 can hold only on a finite interval
2 2 we assume that the gas region is singleconnected and the interval includes m  0 therefore
the total mass of the gas in these
r solutions is finite and
fixed by parameters  and   x 0dx   
once the solutions 2022 in the lagrangian coordinates are known we can return to the eulerian coordinates by using at any time t eq 15 depending
on the particular choice of the initial density there are
two possible types of solutions 2022 first the fixed
mass of the gas  can be distributed at t  0 over
either an infinite or a finite xinterval this is determined by the behavior of m 0 near m   2 for
example let m 0  2  m1a near m  2
then it follows from eq 15 that the gas occupies an
infinite correspondingly a finite interval of positive x
if a  0 correspondingly a  0 the velocity can
be either finite or infinite at the gas boundaries for
example for the same behavior of the initial density
m t  0  2  m1a near m  2 one obtains a finite correspondingly infinite gas velocity at
m  2 for a  2 correspondingly a  2
once x 0 and a are specified one needs to choose the
origin so that the gas masses to the left and to the right
of the origin are the same and equal to 2 then
the initial gas pressure in the eulerian coordinates is
 z x
px 0  2a cos 
x  0dx 
now using eq 22 we calculate the velocity gradient
in the eulerian coordinate at t  0
vx 0
vm 0
 m 0
p m
 2 am 0 cosm
which in view of the condition vx  0 t  0 yields
z xp
vx 0  
2x  0px  0dx
with px 0 from eq 24 equations 24 and 26 show
that once x 0 is a smooth function of x then the
initial pressure and velocity are smooth functions as well
let us now proceed to the properties of the solutions
as we already noted these solutions describe a motion of
fluid particles with a timeindependent acceleration see
eq 13 this timeindependent acceleration is
am 0  
pm 0
 2a sinm
the evolution described by eqs 2022 brings about a
singularity of this initially smooth flow m t blows up
in a finite time while the rest of the flow variables  the
pressure and velocity  remain finite the density blow up
occurs at the lagrangian point m0 where m 0 cosm
reaches its maximum
m0  0 cosm0   max m 0 cosm 
interestingly the point m0 corresponds in view of
eq 25 to the point of the absolute negative minimum of the velocity gradient in the eulerian coordinates
just as in the case of the free flow that is zero pressure
singularity24  the singularity occurs when the jacobian
of the lagrangian transformation of the fluid particles
vanishes for the first time m xm  m0  tc   0 for
the time tc and the eulerian coordinate of the singularity

finally the finite pressure is conserved on the lagrangian trajectory

note that the pressure does not have a minimum at the
singularity point so this flow does not conform to the
popular pressure instability scenario9
it is instructive to consider several particular examples
of solutions starting with the mass distributed over an
infinite interval of x
solutions with mass distributed over an infinite
interval of x

where we have introduced the characteristic inelastic
cooling length scale l  10  whose meaning will become clear shortly we use eq 34 to express m 0

the singularity still develops at x  0 indeed it is the
maximum of the function m 0 cosm rather than
of m 0 that determines in view of eq 28 the singularity point for acr  a  cr this maximum is still
at m  m0  0 as time progresses the two symmetric
density peaks move toward the origin reaching it precisely at the time of singularity the pressure still has a
maximum at x  0 whilein view of eqs 47 the time of
singularity is still tc   cosh a instead of looking for
the maxima of m it is convenient to look for the minima of the inverse density which by virtue of eq 21
can be written as
m t
cosm 1  tanh2 a cos2 m
cosm 48
1  tanh a cos m
if m 0 does not vanish at m  2 or vanishes
slower than linearly there then the integral in eq 15
converges and the total gas mass  is distributed over
a finite interval of x it follows from eq 22 that the
velocity which vanishes at x  m  0 and has a negative
gradient everywhere takes finite values at the ends of the
interval over which the mass is distributed as a result
the xinterval occupied by the gas shrinks in the course
of evolution assuming for simplicity that m 0 is an
even function of m we find from eqs 15 and 21 that
the interval lt lt occupied by the gas shrinks
with time as

using the first of eq 29 we find tc 
334 212 tanh a in this case the pressure gradient is
nonzero in the singularity point so the pressure is neither maximum nor minimum
and reaches its minimum at t  tc  this minimum is always positive except in the degenerate case of m 0 
0  cosm when the whole gas collapses into the point
x  0 at the time of singularity it turns out that in this
degenerate case the solution is selfsimilar in the eulerian coordinates x and t and separable in the lagrangian
coordinates m and t it can be shown that all selfsimilar
solutions with a finite energy have an infinite density at
some locations already at t  0 such initial conditions
do not correspond to a dilute gas so they will not be
considered here
differentiating this function
with respect to m one can
verify that at t   cosh a the minimum is indeed at
m  0 finally at a  cr the density blows up symmetrically at two eulerian points x   xm0  tc  6 0

a generic example of the solution on a finite eulerian interval is provided by the uniform initial density

we can express the decay rate of the total energy as

using eqs 20 and 21 we obtain
energy decay for the exact solutions
a useful global characteristics of the clustering process
is provided by the evolution of the total kinetic energy of
all particles versus time et  0 this quantity is convenient to follow in experiment and in md simulations
in the language of hydrodynamics it is

where the first term under the integral is the thermal
energy density and the second term is the macroscopic

whether this quantity is finite or not depends on the
behavior of m 0 near m  2 for example assuming as before that m 0  2  m1a near
m  2 we find that eth 0 is finite at a  1 and
infinite otherwise a simple example of the initial condition with an infinite energy is m 0  0 cos2 m

one can check that the decay of the thermal and macroscopic kinetic energies separately is also quadratic in
time one also observes that at the time of the density
blowup t  tc  the energy constitutes a finite and nonzero fraction of the initial energy so the time tc is not
special for the function et
as a simple example consider the initial density

local structure of the exact solutions near the
singularity
to analyze the local structure of the developing singularity we consider the taylor expansion of the inverse
density um t  1m t in a close vicinity of m  m0
at times close to tc  to calculate the mderivatives it
is convenient to p
write um t  um 01  tm2 
where m   am 0 cosm satisfies the conditions m0   1tc and  m0   0 see eqs 28 and

where all the derivatives of  are evaluated at m  m0 
and   1  ttc  the first nonvanishing mderivative
at t  tc is therefore of the fourth order and we obtain

um0  0
where we have introduced a positive dimensionless constant b  tc  m0 22 recall that m has a maximum at m  m0  so that  m0   0 using the expression for tc from eq 29 and the definition of  one
finds that b is independent of a and can be written as
1 d2
ln m 0 cosm

where we have used m 0 cosm m  m0

where the latter estimate assumes that the initial density
m 0 varies over a scale of order 1 equation 62
shows that at the singularity u  1 vanishes faster
than quadratically in m as expected in general when a
singularity is analytic goingrback to the eulerian coorm
dinates xm t  xm0  t  m0 um  tdm  we rewrite
eq 62 as
ux tc 
x  xc
5 bx  xc 
ux0  0
 1 64
where x0  xm0  0 the spatial coordinate of the singularity xc is determined by eq 29 and l  1x0  0
is the inelastic cooling length scale the validity condition in x in eq 64 corresponds to the validity condition
in m in eq 62 thus at t  tc the density profile is
singular in a vicinity of x  xc  and exhibits a power law
with exponent 45
x tc 
x0  0
5 b x  xc 
this powerlaw singularity is integrable that is has a
finite mass and symmetric with respect to xc  for comparison the density singularity of a free flow see eg24 
exhibits the exponent 23 instead of 45 
as the velocity itself is finite at singularity the velocity
gradient is of interest we obtain
 m t
xxmt
1  tm
where the last equality follows from the continuity equation and definition of m as a result
 t  tc  t  btc 2 m  m0 2 
x v
up to higher order terms in tc  t and m  m0  using
eqs 67 and 62 we find that
um tc 
tc x vx tc 
um0  0
this relation combined with eq 64 yields
vx tc 
tc 5 b x  xc 
note that while the exponent 25 of this power law is
different from the exponent 45 of the power law for the
density the two power laws have the same region of validity in x see eq 64 though the velocity gradient
diverges at the singularity the velocity itself is continuous there and has a cusp  xc x35  this is in contrast
with the wave breaking singularity of ordinary gas dynamics where the velocity becomes discontinuous at the
point where the velocity gradient blows up
it is clear from the above that the local profiles of the
density and velocity at t  tc do not depend on the details
of the initial density m 0 this is not so for the pressure for which two types of spatial behavior are possible
for the special case where m 0 cosm is maximum
at m  0 and so m0  0 the density blows up at the origin x  0 as a result the pressure versus x has a local
maximum at x  0 and the value of the maximum stays
constant in time px  0 t  2a the pressure profile
in a vicinity of x  0 can be obtained from a taylor expansion of eq 20 pm ta  2  2 m2  o4 m4 
at t  tc this leads to

in the generic case where the maximum of
m 0 cosm is not at zero so that m0 6 0
the singularity develops at a point which is not special
for the pressure here the taylor expansion of eq 20
yields
pma  2 cosm0   2m  m0  sinm0

in this case we find

the applicability condition 76 is determined by the
z  1 asymptote of f z and simplifies to
x  xc t
that holds at x  xc l15  1 note that the local
xdependence of the pressure at t  tc is very different
from that of the density or velocity gradient first the
pressure remains finite at t  tc  second even though
the pressure gradient diverges at x  xc  the divergence
stems from a small correction term to a constant pressure see eq 69 and 71 as we discuss later this
difference in behavior is crucial for understanding the
physical nature of the singularity
now let us investigate the local structure of the flow
immediately before the singularity at tc  t  tc  the
leading terms of the double taylor expansion of the inverse density um t  um 01  tm2 in a vicinity
of m  m0 and t  tc that is at m  m0   1 and

whereas the timeindependent profile 71 sets in the

x  xc tl15  1 the pressure is approximately constant this suggests that the sound waves are the fastest
physical process near the singularity before we consider
the hierarchy of time scales in more detail let us reiterate that the finitetime singularity described here is quite
different from the freeflow singularity24 where the density blows up as tc  t1  the plateau of the inner region
shrinks with time as tc  t32  the power law tail in the
outer region is  x23  and where the lagrangian velocity rather than the lagrangian acceleration is constant
in time
time scale separation and isobaric scenario
in general there are three time scales that characterize
the dynamics described by the nonlinear ighd equations
5 and 6 the sound traveltime tsound  l t  the
cooling time tcooling  1 t  and the inertial time
tinertial  lv here  t  and v are typical values of the
fields while l  lt is the characteristic spatial scale
of the flow the evolution of the hydrodynamic fields
can produce time scale separation a strong inequality
between the time scales moreover the hierarchy of the
time scales can be different in different regions of space
let us evaluate the time scales for our exact solutions
2022 here there are only two independent time
scales the sound travel and the cooling time scales this
stems from the fact that the compressional heating and
the inelastic cooling balance each other in the equation
for the pressure so that tinertial  tcooling  consider the
inner region x  xc  
 l1 
ttc    from the results
of the previous subsection t  t0 1  ttc  while
lt  l1  ttc 52  as l t0    tc  we obtain
tsound  tc 1 
now using   0 1  ttc 2  we find
tcooling  tc 1 
we observe that except close to tc  tsound  tcooling  tc 
however as the singularity is approached the sound
travel time in the inner region becomes much shorter
than the cooling time in this situation the pressure
in the inner region is expected to become constant5 as
our solutions indeed show
to further elucidate this point let us estimate the
size of the spatial region at t  tc such that within
this region the time scales obey the strong inequality
tsound
p  tcooling  equations 84 and 85 show that
at 1  ttc  1 tsound  tcooling in the inner region
at these times the size lt of the shrinking inner region obeys the inequality ll15  1 as we saw in the
previous subsection the shrinking inner region leaves behind stationary profiles of the fields therefore at t  tc 
the local time scales at some x  x0  l can be estimated by their values at those times when lt shrinks
to the size x0  that is at t  tc the time scale separation tsound  tcooling  tinertial holds in the region
x  xc l15  1 which is precisely the region where
the pressure is approximately constant therefore the
density blowup as featured by our exact solutions locally follows the isobaric scenario previously suggested
in the context of condensation processes developing in
gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation530 
this fact has important consequences for the theory of
clustering that will be explored elsewhere
we now proceed to the derivation of an additional solution that would allow us to demonstrate two important
features of the developing density singularity its locality
and its possible coexistence with shock singularities of
ordinary gas dynamics
iv a piston moving into a granular
gas at rest a blowup with a shock
the family of exact solutions describing the finite time
density blowup and reported in section
 iii have a special
value of the total gas mass    2 here we
relax this requirement by constructing an exact solution
that can have an arbitrarily large mass in this solution
both the finitetime density blowup and an ordinary
shock discontinuity are present
first we note that formation of a density singularity
in hydrodynamics is a local process the set of eqs 1011 is hyperbolic and has a finite speed of propagation
of information therefore a finitetime density blowup
developing at a point with a finite x cannot be affected
by a change in the initial conditions sufficiently far away
provided the velocity is finite there in particular this
is true for initial density variations that change the total
mass of the gas possibly making it infinite the solution
that we are going to present here illustrates this point
as it has an arbitrary density distribution sufficiently far
from the developing singularity
the solution also illustrates another point that is absent in the solutions reported in section iii appearance
of shocks at   0 eqs 1011 become the equations
of classical ideal gas dynamics which produce shocks initially smooth hydrodynamic fields develop shock discontinuities in a finite time2627  shocks can also appear at
  0 the case of our interest the following argument
can be helpful in elucidating the comparative role of the
two types of singularities the density blowup and the
shock let the initial conditions be fixed then as 
goes down the development of a density blow up will
be delayed in time the delay time becoming infinite as
  0 on the other hand the time of shock formation must obviously approach a finite limit as   0
therefore for sufficiently small  the shock formation
will typically precede the density blowup in the exact
solution that we are going to present the shock is present
in the solution from the very beginning
we choose for this solution an extended version of
a basic setting of ideal onedimensional gas dynamics
at t  0 a piston starts moving at a constant speed v0
into an undriven granular gas at rest because such a
gas has a zero temperature everywhere the initial state
of the gas is uniquely characterized by the initial density profile say 0 x it is convenient to go over to
the frame moving with the piston where the piston rests
at x  0 there one needs to solve eqs 5 and 6
with the initial conditions x 0  0 x vx 0  v0 
t x 0  0 and the boundary conditions vx  0 t  0
and vx   t  v0  at t  0 the gas hits the
piston wall at x  0 and a shock forms instantaneously
and starts propagating into the gas each of the hydrodynamic fields experiences a discontinuity at the shock front
x0 t that obeys x0 0  0 the solution at x  x0 t
is of course x t  0 x  v0 t vx t  v0 and
t x t  0 while at 0  x  x0 t nontrivial distributions of the hydrodynamic fields develop we show below
that a special choice of 0 x yields a solution that at
x  x0 t is of the same type as that described in section
iii
the jump conditions at the shock front are provided by
the same rankinehugoniot conditions as in the ordinary
gas26  indeed these conditions can be obtained by considering the equations of mass momentum and energy
balance in an infinitesimal volume x0 t   x0 t  
in the limit of   0 while the mass and momentum
balances are exactly the same as in the ordinary gas the
inelastic loss correction to the energy balance is proporr x t
tional to x00t 2 t 32 dx see subsection iii e and it
vanishes at   0 despite the discontinuity of the integrand the rankinehugoniot conditions state that
in the frame moving with the piston the mass momentum and energy fluxes should be continuous through the
shock26

this solution is shown in fig 6 note that at fixed 0
and v0  the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of
the solution behave as 1 for this solution the gas
density blows up in a finite
time at the point m where
the function m    1 m has its minimum
one can easily see that for   2 this function is monotone increasing with m as a consequence the density
blows up at the piston
 that is at m  0 and this
happens at t  tc    1 t  at this time the shock
front location
 m  mf t  is described by the relation
m     1 which yields m  108031    for
  2 in 2d and 087915    for   53 in 3d that
is by the time t  tc when the density blows up at
the piston the shock has traveled only a finite distance
both in the m and in the xspace from the piston it is
obvious therefore that our solution allows an arbitrary
modification of the density profile 0 x at sufficiently
large x that are unreachable for the shock this clearly
shows that initial states with an arbitrary large mass of
gas can develop a finitetime density blowup
numerical solutions
we confirmed the exact solutions presented in figs 14 and 6 by solving numerically the ighd equations 16
and 17 in the lagrangian coordinates in each case
we used the initial and boundary conditions provided
by the exact solutions themselves we employed the
classical artificial viscosity staggered grid scheme of von
neumann and richtmyer31  the number of cells grid
points used varied between 1000 and 2000 and showed
numerical convergence until close to the singularity as
the solution developed a density blowup the simulation
had to be terminated at a very high but finite maximum
density usually at about 107 0  where 0 is the initial
density we also enforced the simulations to stop when
the density jump between two adjacent cells exceeded a
prescribed value usually 50 percent when such jumps
develop near the singularity the accuracy of the simulation degrades and can be restored only by a rezoning
algorithm that was not employed one example of the
numerical solution is shown in fig 1 alongside with the
analytical solution and very good agreement is observed
very good agreement was also obtained for the solutions
shown in figs 3 4 and 6 not shown the numerical
solutions inevitably add some effective noise to the system because of the spatial and temporal discretization
and roundoff errors the fact that the analytical solutions are accurately reproduced numerically confirms
their stability with respect to small onedimensional perturbations
we also performed extensive numerical simulations
with eqs 16 and 17 for a variety of initial and boundary conditions that did not correspond to any of the
exact solutions as already briefly reported in ref22

these simulations show that for generic initial conditions a finitetime density blowup always occurs remarkably the numerical solutions exhibit close to the

of the symmetry of the problem with respect to x  0 we
actually solved it on the halfinterval 0  x  10 replacing the boundary condition at x  10 by the condition

here we present one typical example of such a simulation briefly mentioned
in ref22  the parameters are
  05 v0  t0 and   2 the one half of the
simulated flow is shown in fig 7 panel a provides a
general view of one half of the system the gas inflow
creates a compression in the central region a compression wave propagates outwards and steepens this steepening would lead to a wave breaking singularity but the
numerical scheme resolves this singularity by means of
the artificial viscosity as a shock wave that continues
propagating outward at the same time the gas density
at the origin continues growing and ultimately blows up
the density growth in a vicinity of the origin is presented
in panel b panel c focuses on the density and pressure history at the origin while the density blows up at
t  tc  the pressure hardly varies there so the isobaric scenario holds the inset of panel c verifies that close to
tc  the density blowup proceeds as tc  t2  panels d
and e add more tests of the spatial and temporal scaling behavior near the singularity panel d shows a plot
of the rescaled density x ttc  t2 versus the rescaled
coordinate xtc  t52  the collapse of the curves at
different times proves the local selfsimilarity note that
the gas density at the origin varies for these times by
four orders of magnitude finally panel e verifies the
presence of the inner and outer regions described by our
theory see subsection iii f the density plateau whose
size shrinks as  tc  t52  represents the inner region
while in the outer region a timeindependent density profile forms with a powerlaw behavior   x45 as predicted by our exact solutions
the same universal features of the singularity were also
observed when starting from smallamplitude sinusoidal
density or velocity perturbations around a homogeneous
state
nonideal effects near the
singularity
having found the exact nonlinear solutions of the
ighd equations 5 and 6 we are in the position to test
the assumptions behind these equations and establish the
domain of validity of the solutions as accurate leadingorder descriptions in the presence of nonideal effects
first the validity of the navierstokes hydrodynamics
eqs 24 demands that the knudsen number lf ree l
remain much smaller than unity the smallest hydrody
namic length scale of the solution can be estimated as
lt  l1  ttc 52  see subsections iii f and iii g the
mean free path lf ree  1 d1   1ttc2 0  d1 
as l  10  and   1  r d1  we obtain

at t 
 tc the knudsen number is small by the assumption 1r  1 however as t approaches tc  the knudsen
number grows indefinitely which invalidates the hydrodynamics we shall see however that one of the assumptions of the ighd breaks down even earlier
now consider the ratio of the viscous stress term to
the pressure gradient term in the momentum

that is the viscous stress is always negligible in our solutions as long as 1  r  1

in contrast to the viscous terms the heat conduction

the density becomes comparable with the fraction

when 0   1  r the heat conduction becomes
important when the gas is still dilute this happens at
time
 1  ttc  1  r so that lvalid  l1  r  as long
as 1  r  1 the knudsen number is still small at that
time and the complete navierstokes hydrodynamics is
still applicable
therefore as the blowup time tc is approached either
the heat conduction or the excluded particle volume effects become important and invalidate our theory in the
inner region in this sense our solutions describe an intermediate asymptotic regime of formation of a dense
cluster of particles importantly in the outer region our
solutions remain valid until much later times indeed as
the inner region shrinks it leaves behind stationary profiles of the fields see subsection iii f the ratios of the
different terms governing the ighd validity are given
at some x from the outer region by the corresponding
ratios in the inner region estimated at the time when
lt  x  xc  as a result at some time close to tc
see above our solutions break down in the inner region which size at that time is lvalid  while in the outer
region x  xc   lvalid  our solutions continue to hold
the fact that the ighd description breaks down only
locally in a small region of space can be exploited for
derivation of an effective description of the clustering dynamics beyond the singularity time in this description
closepacked clusters appear as finitemass pointlike singularities of the density22  this effective description is
similar in spirit to the description of shocks that actually have finite widths as discontinuities in ordinary
ideal gas dynamics

summary

the same estimate is obtained for the ratio of the heat
conduction term to the compressional heating term this
ratio becomes of order
 unity at 1  ttc  1  r  1 at
this time lf ree l  1  r  1 see eq 109 so the
ighd equations break down while the full navierstokes
hydrodynamics eqs 24 is still valid
in its turn the dilute gas assumption  d  1 breaks
down and excluded particle
p volume effects become important at 1  ttc  0  d  1 the relative role
of the heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects in the breakdown of our analytic solutions near
the attempted singularity is determined
p by the competition between
the small parameters 0  d and 1  r
when 0   1  r our solutions remain valid until
let us briefly summarize the main results of this work
we introduced ideal granular hydrodynamics ighd
equations that provide a simple but informative description of nonstationary largescale flows of dilute granular
gases with nearly elastic collisions between the particles
we employed the ighd equations to investigate analytically and numerically the paradigmatic phenomenon of
particle clustering in freely cooling granular gases we
believe that the ighd will provide a useful framework
for a host of other problems involving largescale flows of
driven granular gases
we focused on a onedimensional granular hydrodynamic flow characteristic of an idealized channel geometry and derived a family of exact nonlinear and nonstationary analytic solutions of the ighd that describe a
finitetime blowup of the gas density the derivation was
made possible by a transformation of the hydrodynamic
equations to lagrangian coordinates the exact solutions
are characterized by a constant in time accelerations in
the lagrangian frame and they are not selfsimilar we
investigated the local structure of the flow near the singularity and determined local spatial and temporal scaling
laws for the hydrodynamic quantities in question we
also found an instructive soluble case of the problem of
a piston entering at a constant speed a granular gas
at rest here a density singularity developing at the
piston coexists with a shock wave that is located elsewhere besides demonstrating the presence of the two
different types of singularities in the same system this
solution allows an arbitrary density profile at large distances showing that the density blowup is a local process in all of these solutions the developing singularity
obeys locally the isobaric scenario530  the gas pressure
remains approximately uniform in space and constant in
time in a close vicinity of the blowup point this finding
has important consequences for the theory of clustering
indeed by imposing in the zeroth order of theory the
isobaricity condition on the hydrodynamic equations one
arrives at a powerful reduced description of the nonlinear
clustering process this description is valid for a much
broader class of initial conditions than those giving rise
to the exact solutions reported in the present work the
corresponding results will be presented elsewhere
our numerical solutions of the ighd equations accurately reproduce the analytic solutions thus confirming
their stability with respect to small onedimensional perturbations furthermore numerical simulations with a
variety of initial and boundary conditions showed that
that the local scaling laws near the singularity are universal that is independent of details of the initial and
boundary conditions
we also analyzed additional physical effects neglected
in ighd which become important in a narrow spatial
region near the attempted singularity depending on the
parameters either excluded particle volume effects or
heat conduction invalidate our solutions there in the
former case the density growth should directly cross over

to the formation of closepacked clusters of particles in
the latter case the final outcome of the nonlinear density
growth is yet unknown the future work should find out
whether the heat conduction arrests the density blowup
or only modifies the singularity law in any case our
exact solutions can be viewed as instructive intermediate
asymptotics describing a broad class of strongly nonlinear clustering flows of granular gases no less important
as breakdown of these solutions occurs only in the narrow
regions around the density peaks it is possible to continue the ideal solutions beyond the singularity by introducing into the theory finitemass pointlike singularities
of the density this procedure yields a simple effective
description of granular gases with embedded closepacked
clusters in much the same way as the ideal gas dynamics
describes a gas flow with shock discontinuities22 
very recently one of our exact solutions has been successfully tested against md simulations of the dynamics
of a very dilute gas of nearly elastically colliding identical
hard disks in a very long and narrow 2d channel the
results will be presented elsewhere
finally we note that the power law of the density
blowup near the singularity  tc  t2  is the same as
the one recently found in a different setting that of an
initially thermalized granular gas freely cooling and collapsing under gravity21  in each of the two problems the
momentum equation is fast while the energy equation
is slow in a small vicinity of the collapse this suggests
common physics behind the two collapse phenomena and
demands further investigation
