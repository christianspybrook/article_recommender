introduction
over the last two decades lattice gauge theory was
turned into a powerful qualitative tool for analyzing
qcd this progress is in part due to the advances in
algorithms and computer technology but also on the conceptual side important breakthroughs were made most
prominent among these is the correct implementation of
chiral symmetry on the lattice based on the ginspargwilson equation for the dirac operator 1
an application of lattice techniques which has seen a
lot of attention in recent years is the study of qcd at
finite temperature the lattice implementation of the
chemical potential  necessary for such an analysis is
not straightforward however it is well known 2 that
a naive introduction leads to 2 a2 contributions which
diverge in the continuum limit when the lattice spacing
a is sent to zero for more traditional formulations such
as the wilson or staggered dirac operators the problem
has been solved by introducing the chemical potential in
the same way as the 4component of the gauge field
a satisfactory implementation of the chemical potential should be compatible with chiral symmetry on the
lattice based on the ginspargwilson equation when
attempting to introduce the chemical potential into the
only solution of the ginspargwilson equation know in
closed form the overlap operator 3 a potential problem quickly surfaces defining the sign function of a nonhermitian matrix in 4 bloch and wettig proposed a
solution based on an analytic continuation of the sign
function into the complex plane it was shown that the
eigenvalue spectra of this construction match the expectations from random matrix theory
in this letter we analyze the proposal 4 further
and study the energy density of free massless overlap
fermions with chemical potential the dependence of the
energy density on  and the temperature t allows for a
detailed analysis of the lattice formulation at finite density of particular interest will be the question whether
the analytic continuation of the sign function produces
divergent 2 a2 terms our study indicates the absence
of such contributions and we find that the  and t dependence of the energy density is approached correctly
setup of the calculation
the overlap dirac operator d for fermions with a
chemical potential  is given as
1  5 sign h 
h  5 1  adw  
the sign function may be defined through the spectral
theorem for matrices dw  denotes the usual wilson
dirac operator

for later use we distinguish between the lattice spacing
a in spatial direction and the temporal lattice constant
a4  periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial
directions while in time direction we apply antiperiodic
boundary conditions the chemical potential  is coupled in the usual exponential form 2
for vanishing  the wilson dirac operator is 5 hermitian ie 5 dw 05  dw 0  this implies that
h0 is a hermitian matrix as soon as the chemical potential  is turned on 5 hermiticity no longer holds and
h is a nonhermitian general matrix this fact has
two important consequences firstly the eigenvalues of
h are no longer real and the sign function for a complex number has to be defined in the spectral representation of sign h secondly the spectral representation
has to be formulated using left and right eigenvectors
this latter problem will be dealt with later when we discuss the evaluation of sign h for the sign function
of a complex number we use the analytic continuation
proposed in 4 and define the sign function through the
sign of the real part
sign x  iy  sign x 
the observable we study here is the energy density
defined as
 hn 
hhi 
1  ln z
ln tr ehn 
v  c
here h is the hamiltonian of the system n denotes the
number operator and   1t is the inverse temperature
in our units the boltzmann constant k is set to k  1
the derivatives in the second line are taken such that
  c  const

evaluation of the eigenvalues
according to 6 for the evaluation of  the eigenvalues n of the dirac operator d have to be computed
this is done in three steps first we bring the dirac operator for free fermions to 4  4 blockdiagonal form using
fourier transformation subsequently the spectral representation is applied to the 4  4 blocks of h to evaluate
sign h finally the eigenvalues of the blocks of d are
computed and by summing over the discrete momenta
all eigenvalues are obtained
following this strategy one finds for the fourier transb of h
form h

when working on the lattice the inverse temperature  is given by the lattice extent in 4direction ie
  n4 a4  thus the derivative  in 4 turns into

fermion determinant det d which we write as the product over all eigenvalues n  we thus find

plugging this back into the overlap formula 1 and diagonalizing the remaining 4  4 problem one finds two
different eigenvalues for the overlap operator at a given
momentum
sign  h2  h25  h5  i h2
h2  h25
where each of the two eigenvalues is twofold degenerate
the momentum dependence enters through the components h  h5 defined in 8 in the spectral sum 6 the label n runs over all momenta and the eigenvalues at fixed
momentum as given in 13 the necessary derivative
with respect to a4 is straightforward to compute in closed
form and the spectral sum 6 can then be summed numerically the argument of the sign function cannot become purely imaginary on a finite lattice and no like
terms occur we remark that after taking the derivative
with respect to a4  we set a  a4  1 ie all the results
we present are in lattice units

results
we begin the discussion of our results with fig 1
where we show the subtracted energy density   0
as a function of 4 for three different lattice volumes for
those lattices all 4 sides have equal length ie in the
thermodynamic limit they correspond to zero temperature thus according to 5 we expect the data symbols in fig 1 to approach the continuum form 4 4 2
dashed line as the 4d volume is sent to infinity
the figure clearly shows that the lattice data are predominantly linear when plotted versus 4 and that for
small  they approach the continuum curve when the
volume is increased it is however obvious that also on
our largest lattice still a discrepancy remains for larger
 in particular one finds a slight curvature upwards a
discretization effect which here since the lattice spacing
is just the inverse lattice extension is also a finite size
effect furthermore for small  one expects to see finite
temperature corrections according to 5
in order to study these finite temperature corrections
systematically we analyzed lattices with short temporal extent ie lattices with nonvanishing temperature
fig 2 shows the corresponding results where we again
plot the subtracted energy density as a function of 4 
the lattice with the shortest temporal extent 1283 8
which corresponds to the largest temperature shows a
clear curvature this curvature is due to the t 2 2 2
term in 5 which appears as a square root when plotted
as function of 4  the effect is visible also for the other
lattices but becomes less pronounced as the temporal
extent is increased ie the temperature t is lowered
in order to study this effect quantitatively we fit the
finite temperature results to the continuum form 5 plus
two terms even in  which parameterize the cutoff effects
due to 5 the coefficient of the quadratic term should
scale with the temperature such that one expects
c2  t 2 2  n42 2 
the coefficient for the quartic term should be constant
c4  14 2  002533 
the results of the fit for the data used in fig 2 and for
the largest lattice of fig 1 are given in table 1
the table shows that with increasing n4 the two physically significant parameters c2 and c4 approach the values expected from the continuum formula 5 c2 gets
closer to n42 2 as listed in the second column and c4
approaches 14 2  002533 for the largest finite temperature lattice 1283  24 the discrepancy is down to 9

fig 3 the ratio   04 as a function of  in
lattice units we compare the results for overlap to those
from wilson fermions
for c2  and 2  for c4  the larger discrepancy for small
n4 can be understood as a discretization effect since the
temporal lattice spacing a4 is related to the temporal extension through a4  1n4 and thus larger n4 implies a
smaller a4  for comparison we also display the fit results
for the 1284 lattice which corresponds to zero temperature there we find excellent agreement less than 1
discrepancy for the parameter c4  governing the leading
term at t  0 the overall picture obtained from the fit
results is that overlap fermions with chemical potential
reproduce very well both the 4 term as well as the finite temperature contribution t 2 2 2 we conclude that
the analytic continuation of the sign function does not introduce lattice artifacts such as the 2 a2 term known
to be present in a naive implementation of the chemical
potential
in the final step of our analysis we study the discretization effect for larger values of  and compare the re

14 2  002533 indicated by the horizontal line for
small  up to about   07 the wilson and overlap data
fall on top of each other for very small  both operators show a prominent increase which is a leftover finite
temperature effect which for the ratio   04
shows up as a 12 term in the range between   01
and 05 the data are close to the continuum value beyond 05 the discretization effects kick in and the overlap
and wilson results start to differ a comparison with
the equivalent plot in 6 where the results from various
other lattice dirac operators were presented shows that
the discretization effects of the overlap operator at large
 are comparable to other formulations
summary
in this article we have analyzed the energy density of
the overlap operator at finite chemical potential following 4 the sign function in the overlap was implemented
through the spectral theorem using the analytic continuation of the sign into the complex plane the subtracted
energy density   0 was analyzed for finite and
zero temperature lattices fits of the data show that the
expected continuum behavior is approached no trace
of unphysical 2 a2 terms was found we conclude that
overlap fermions with chemical potential 4 provide both
chiral symmetry and the correct description of fermions
at finite density
