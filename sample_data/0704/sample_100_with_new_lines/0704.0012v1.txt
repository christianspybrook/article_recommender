s 12 0 n    zq that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo
odd primes p in this paper using rankincohen bracket we extend this result to
modular forms of half integral weight for primes p  5 as applications of our main
theorem we derive distribution properties for modulo primes p  5 of traces of singular

for overpartitions
1 introduction and results
let m 1 0 n  and s 1 0 n  be the spaces respectively of modular forms
and cusp forms of weight   12 on 0 n with a dirichlet character  whose conductor
divides n if f z  m 1 0 n  then f z has the form
f z 
anq n 
where q  e2iz  it is wellknown that the coefficients of f are related to interesting
objects in number theory such as the special values of lfunction class number traces of
singular moduli and so on in this paper we study congruence properties of the fourier
coefficients of f z  m 1 0 n   zq and their applications
recently bruinier and ono proved in 3 that gz  s 1 0 n   zq has a
special form see 21 by modulo p when p is an odd prime and the coefficients of f z
do not satisfy the following property for p
property a if m is a positive integer we say that a sequence n  z satisfies property
a for m if for every integer r

using rankincohen bracket see 23 we prove that there exists
fez  sp1 1 0 4n   zq
such that f z  fez mod p we extend the results in 3 to modular forms of half
integral weight
theorem 1 let  be a nonnegative integer we assume that f z  
n0 anq 
m 1 0 4n   zq where  is a real dirichlet character if p  5 is a prime and
there exists a positive integer n for which gcdan p  1 and gcdn p  1 then at least
one of the following is true
1 the coefficients of p1 f z satisfies property a for p
2 there are finitely many squarefree integers n1  n2      nt for which
f z

moreover if gcd4n p  1 and an odd prime l divides some ni  then
pl  1ll  1n or l  n
remark 11 note that for every odd prime p  5
p1 f z 
anq n mod p
as an applications of theorem 1 we study the distribution of traces of singular moduli
modulo primes p  5 let jz be the usual jinvariant function we denote by fd the
set of positive definite binary quadratic forms
f x y  ax2  bxy  cy 2  a b c
with discriminant d  b2  4ac for each f x y let f be the unique complex number
in the complex upper half plane which is a root of f x 1 we define f  1 2 3 as
 2 if f  a 0 a
3 if f  a a a
1 otherwise
where   sl2 z here f  a b c denotes that f x y is equivalent to a b c
from these notations we define the hecke trace of singular moduli
distribution of integral fourier coefficients modulo primes
definition 12 if m  1 then we define the mth hecke trace of the singular moduli of
discriminant d as
x jm f 
tm d 
f fd 
where fd  denotes a set of equivalence classes of fd and
d1 
x x
az  b
jm z  jzt0 m

here t0 m denotes the normalized mth weight zero hecke operator
note that t1 d  td where

x jf   744
f fd 
is the usual trace of singular moduli let
hz 
z2 e4 4z
2z 4z6
and bm 1 d denote the coefficient of q d in hzt m2  1 0 where
e4 z  1  240

1  q n  
and 0 is a trivial character here t m2    denotes the mth hecke operator of weight
  21 with a dirichlet chracter  see vi 3 in 5 or 25 zagier proved in 11 that
for all m and d
tm d  bm 1 d
using these generating functions ahlgren and ono studied the divisibility properties
of traces and hecke traces of singular moduli in terms of the factorization of primes in
imaginary quadratic fields see 2 for example they proved that a positive proportion
of the primes l has the property that tm l3 n  0 mod ps  for every positive integer n
coprime to l such that p is inert or ramified in q nl  here p is an odd prime and
s and m are integers with p  m in the following theorem we give the distribution of
traces and hecke traces of singular moduli modulo primes p

theorem 2 suppose that p  5 is a prime such that p  2 mod 3
1 then for every integer r p  r
 1  n  x  t1 n  r
mod p rp
logx
if r 6 0 mod p
if r  0 mod p
2 then a positive proportion of the primes l has the property that
if r 6 0 mod p
logx
 1  n  x  tl n  r mod p rp
if r  0 mod p
for every integer r p  r
as another application we study the distribution of hurwitz class number modulo
primes p  5 the hurwitz class number hn is defined as follows the class number
of quadratic forms of the discriminant n where each class c is counted with multiplicity
 the following theorem gives the distribution of hurwitz class number modulo
autc
primes p  5
theorem 3 suppose that p  5 is a prime then for every integer r
if r 6 0 mod p
logx
 1  n  x  hn  r mod p rp
if r  0 mod p
we also use the main theorem to study an analogue of newmans conjecture for overpartitions newmans conjecture concerns the distribution of the ordinary partition function
modulo primes p
newmans conjecture let p n be an ordinary partition function if m is a positive
integer then for every integer r there are infinitely many nonnegative integer n for which
p n  r mod m
this conjecture was already studied by many mathematicians see chapter 5 in 8
the overpartition of a natural number n is a partition of n in which the first occurrence
of a number may be overlined let p n be the number of the overpartition of an integer
n as an analogue of newmans conjecture the following theorem gives a distribution
property of p n modulo odd primes p
theorem 4 suppose that p  5 is a prime such that p  2 mod 3 then for every
integer r
if r 6 0 mod p
logx
 1  n  x  p n  r mod p rp
if r  0 mod p
remark 13 when r  0 mod p theorem 2 3 and 4 were proved in 2 and 10
distribution of integral fourier coefficients modulo primes
next sections are detailed proofs of theorems section 2 gives a proof of theorem 1 in
section 3 we give the proofs of theorem 2 3 and 4
2 proof of theorem 1
we begin by stating the following theorem proved in 3
theorem 21 3 let  be a nonnegative integer suppose that gz  
n0 ag nq 
s 1 0 4n   zq where  is a real dirichlet character if p is an odd prime and
a positive integer n exists for which gcdag n p  1 then at least one of the following
is true
1 if 0  r  p then
 1  n  x  ag n  r
mod p rm
logx
if r 6 0 mod p
if r  0 mod p
2 there are finitely many squarefree integers n1  n2      nt for which
gz 
t x
ag ni m2 q ni m
mod p
i1 m0
moreover if gcdp 4n  1   1 and l  4np is a prime with nli  0 
for 1  i  t then l  1gz is an eigenform modulo p of the halfintegral weight
hecke operator t l2    in particular we have
l  1gzt l     p
l  l1 l  1gz mod p
recall that f z  n0 anq n  m 1 0 4n   zq thus to apply theorem
21 we show that there exists a cusp form fez such that fez  p1 f z mod p for
a prime p  5
lemma 22 suppose that p  5 is a prime and
f z 
anq n  m 1 0 n   zq
then there exists a cusp form fez  sp1p1 1 0 n   zq such that
e  p1 f z
mod p
proof of lemma 22 for f z  m k1 0 n 1  and gz  m k2 0 n 2  let
f z  gz  f z  gz
this operator is referred to as a rankincohen 1bracket and it was proved in 4 that
f z gz1

if k2i  z and
where   1 if k21 and k22  z  d  4

if k21 and k22  12  z

for even k  4 let

ek z  1

k3i
 z and
be the usual normalized eisenstein series of weight k here the number bk denotes the
kth bernoulli number the function ek z is a modular form of weight k on sl2 z and
ep1 z  1 mod p
see 6 from 23 and 24 we have
ep1 z f z1  f z
mod p
and ep1 z f z1  sp1 1 0 n  repeating this method p  1 times we com2
plete the proof
using the following lemma we can deal with the divisibility of ag n for positive integers
n p  n where gz  
n1 ag nq  s 21 0 n   zq
lemma 23 see chapter 3 in 8 suppose that gz  
n1 ag nq  s 21 0 n 
has coefficients in ok  the algebraic integers of some number field k furthermore
suppose that   1 and that m  ok is an ideal norm m
1 then a positive proportion of the primes q  1 mod 4mn has the property
that
gzt q2     0 mod m
2 then a positive proportion of the primes q  1 mod 4mn has the property that
gzt q2     2gz mod m
we can now prove theorem 1
proof of theorem 1 from lemma 22 there exists a cusp form
fez  sp1p1 1 0 n   zq
such that
e  p1 f z
mod p
note that for f z 
 mk 1 0 n  and each prime q  n the
n0 af nq
halfintegral weight hecke operator t q2    is defined as
f zt q2  k 
2k1
distribution of integral fourier coefficients modulo primes
where  n   n 1
and af nq2   0 if q2  n if f zt q2  k   0
mod p for a prime q  n then we have
qk1 af qn   q2 q2k1 af qnq2
af q  qn   q
 af q3 n  0 mod p
for every positive integer n such that gcdq n  1 thus we have the following by
lemma 231
 1  n  x  an  0 mod p and gcdp n  1  x
we apply theorem 21 with fez then the purpose of the remaining part of the proof
is to show the following if gcdp 4n  1 an odd prime l divides some ni  and
f z 
t x
ani m2 q ni m
mod p
i1 m0
then pl  1ll  1n or l  n we assume that there exists a prime l1 such that l1 n1 
p  l1  1l1 l1  1n and l  n we also assume that nt  1 and that ni  n1 for every
i 2  i  t  1 then we can take a prime li for each i 2  i  t  1 such that li ni
and li  n1  for convention we define
1n1 8
if n is odd
otherwise
and q d 
for a prime q let d 
qt1
li d we take a prime  such that
n1  n1   1 if we denote the twist of fez by fe z and the  twist of fz
by fe z then
an1 m2 q n1 m mod p
fe2 z  fe z  2
gcdm
j2 lj 1
and fe z  sp1p1 1 0 n2  2    zq see chapter 3 in 8 note that
gcdn2  2  p  gcdn2  2  l1   1
thus fe z  fe zt l21    p  1p  1  satisfies the formula 22 of theorem
21 for both of   1 and   1 this results in a contradiction since
fe z  fe zt l21    p  1p  1  6 0
and p  5 thus we complete the proof

3 proofs of theorem 2 3 and 4
 e44z is a meromorphic modular form
31 proof of theorem 2 note that hz  z
2z 4z6
in 2 it was obtained a holomorphic modular form on 0 4p2  whose fourier coefficients
generate traces of singular moduli modulo p see the formula 31 and 32 since the
level of this modular form is not relatively prime to p we need the following proposition
proposition 31 1 suppose that p  5 is a prime also suppose that p  n j  1 is
an integer and
anq n  s 1 0 npj   zq
gz 
then there exists a cusp form gz  s  1 0 n  zq such that
gz  gz
where  
mod p
   12 pj  pe p  1 for a sufficiently large e  n
using theorem 1 and proposition 31 we give the proof of theorem 2
proof of theorem 2 let
h1p z  hz 
hp z
where hp z is the p twist of hz from 12 we have
h1p z  2

t1 dq d
tm dq d

mod 4
and
hmp z  h1p zt m2  1 0

tm dq d  2
0d03 mod 4

for every positive integer m let

it was proved in 2 that if  is a sufficiently large positive integer then h1p zfp z 
m 3 k0 0 4p2  and
h1p zfp z  h1p z
mod p
distribution of integral fourier coefficients modulo primes
where k0    p 21  lemma 22 and proposition 31 imply that there exists f1p z 
s  1 0 4  zq such that
f1p z  2
tm dq d mod p
0d03
mod 4
where   k0  1  p  1p  1  21 p2  pe p  1 for a sufficiently large e  n
we assume that the coefficients
  of f1p z do not satisfy property a for an odd prime
p  2 mod 3 note that
that
 1 and that p  3  133  1 so theorem 1 implies
2t1 3  0
mod p
this results in a contradiction since 2t1 3  24  31 thus we obtain a proof when m  1
for every odd prime l we have
f1p zt l2    0   p1 h1p zt l2    0 
 p1 h1p zt l2  1 0   p1 hlp z
mod p
moreover lemma 23 implies that a positive proportion of the primes l satisfies the
property
f1p zt l2    0   2f1p
mod p
this completes the proof
32 proofs of theorem 3 the following theorem gives the formula for the hurwitz
class number in terms of the fourier coefficients of a modular form of half integral weight
theorem 32 let t z  1  2 
n1 q  if integers r3 n are defined as
r3 nq n  t z3 
then
12h4n
 24hn
rn 
rn4
n  1 2 mod 4
n  3 mod 8
n  0 mod 4
n  7 mod 8
note that t z is a half integral weight modular form of weight 21 on 0 4 combining
theorem 1 and theorem 32 we derive the proof of theorem 3
proof of theorem 3 let gz be the 4 twist of t z3  then from theorem 32 we
have
gz  1 
12h4nq n 
24hnq n
mod 4
mod 8
d choi
and gz  m 3 0 16 note that 24h3  8 this gives the complete proof by
theorem 1
33 proofs of theorem 4 in the following we prove theorem 4
proof of theorem 4 let
w z 
it is known that
w z 
p nq n
and that w z is a weakly holomorphic modular form on 0 16 let
gz  w z 
wp z fp zp 
where fp z 
4zp
4p2 z
and  are positive integers then we have
p nq n 
gz  2
p nq n mod p
we claim that there exists a positive integer  such that gz is a holomorphic modular
form of half integral weight on 0 16p2  to prove our claim we follow the arguments
of ahlgren and ono 1 lemma 42 note that by a wellknown criterion fp z is a
holomorphic modular form on 0 4p2  that vanishes at each cusp ac  q for which p2  c
see 7 this implies that gz is a weakly holomorphic modular form on 0 16p2  if 
is sufficiently large then gz is holomorphic except at each cusp ac for which p2 c 
thus we prove that gz is holomorphic at 2m1p2 for 0  m  3 let for odd d
1 if d  1 mod 4
i if d  3 mod 4
if f z is a function on the complex upper half plane   z and    ac db   0 4 then
we define the usual slash operator by

choose an integer kv satisfying

then we have

where

22m p2 16vp  16kv p
 16kv  2m4 v 2 p  vkv p
2m4 vp  2m4 kv p  1
note that w z has its only pole at z  0 up to 0 16 since vm  0 16 the
formula 33 implies that wp z is holomorphic at 2m p2 for 1  m  3 thus gz is
holomorphic at 2m p2 for 1  m  3
if m  0 then we have
p vp  kv p

w z 1 v0

note that

   q  16  o1
where  is a nonzero complex number the qexpansion of wp z at
1 0
p2 1
wp z 1
is given by
using 33 and 34 the only term in 35 with a negative exponent on q is the term
p1  
g 1 x v
e p vkv  
q 16
if n is defined by 16n  1 mod p then we have
p1  
p1  
g 1 x v
 q 16
 q 16 
q  16 
q 16
thus we have that
w z  wp z 1
1 0
p2 1
 o1
this implies that gz is a holomorphic modular form of half integral weight on 0 16p2 
noting that
p 3  8
the remaining part of the proof is similar to that in theorem 3 thus it is omitted
