abstract
a general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic
loading numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression and
ramp decompression generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state the numerical
methods were found to be flexible and robust and matched analytic results to a high accuracy
the basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation
paths such as shockinduced impacts and shock interactions with a planar interface between
different materials these calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments without requiring spatiallyresolving simulations example calculations were made of
loading histories in metals illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in
quasiisentropic and shockrelease experiments and the effect of a phase transition

introduction
the continuum representation of matter is widely used for material dynamics in science and engineering spatiallyresolved continuum dynamics simulations are the most
widespread and familiar solving the initial value problem by discretizing the spatial domain
and integrating the dynamical equations forward in time to predict the motion and deformation of components of the system this type of simulation is used for instance to study
hypervelocity impact problems such as the vulnerability of armor to projectiles 1 2 the
performance of satellite debris shields 3 and the impact of meteorites with planets notably
the formation of the moon 4 the problem can be divided into the dynamical equations
of the continuum the state field of the components sr and the inherent properties of
the materials given the local material state s the material properties allow the stress 
to be determined given the stress field  r and mass density field r the dynamical
equations describe the fields of acceleration compression and thermodynamic work done
on the materials
the equations of continuum dynamics describe the behavior of a dynamically deforming
system of arbitrary complexity particular simpler deformation paths can be described more
compactly by different sets of equations and solved by different techniques than those used
for continuum dynamics in general simpler deformation paths occur often in experiments
designed to develop and calibrate models of material properties these paths can be regarded
as different ways of interrogating the material properties the principal examples in material
dynamics are shock and ramp compression 5 6 typical experiments are designed to induce
such loading histories and measure or infer the properties of the material in these states
before they are destroyed by release from the edges or by reflected waves
the development of the field of material dynamics was driven by applications in the
physics of hypervelocity impact and high explosive systems including nuclear weapons 7
in the regimes of interest typically components with dimensions ranging from millimeters to meters and pressures from 1 gpa to 1 tpa material behavior is dominated by the
scalar equation of state eos the relationship between pressure compression or mass
density and internal energy other components of stress specifically shear stresses are
much smaller and chemical explosives react promptly so can be treated by simple models of complete detonation eos were developed as fits to experimental data particularly
to series of shock states and to isothermal compression measurements 8 it is relatively
straightforward to construct shock and ramp compression states from an eos algebraically
or numerically depending on the eos and to fit an eos to these measurements more
recently applications and scientific interest have grown to include a wider range of pressures
and time scales such as laserdriven inertial confinement fusion 9 and experiments are
designed to measure other aspects than the eos such as the kinetics of phase changes constitutive behavior describing shear stresses incomplete chemical reactions and the effects of
microstructure including grain orientation and porosity theoretical techniques have also
evolved to predict the eos with 1 accuracy 10 and elastic contributions to shear stress
with slightly poorer accuracy 11
a general convention for representing material states is described and numerical methods
are reported for calculating shock and ramp compression states from general representations
of material properties
conceptual structure for material properties
the desired structure for the description of the material state and properties under dynamic loading was developed to be as general as possible with respect to the types of material
or models to be represented in the same framework and designed to give the greatest amount
of commonality between spatiallyresolved simulations and calculations of shock and ramp
compressions
in condensed matter on submicrosecond time scales heat conduction is often too slow to
have a significant effect on the response of the material and is ignored here the equations
of nonrelativistic continuum dynamics are in lagrangian form ie along characteristics
moving with the local material velocity ur
dr t
 r tdiv ur t
dur t
div  r t
r t
der t
  r tgrad ur t
where  is the mass density and e the specific internal energy changes in e can be related
to changes in the temperature t through the heat capacity the inherent properties of
each material in the problem are described by its constitutive relation or equation of state
 s as well as experiencing compression and work from mechanical deformation the local
material state sr t can evolve through internal processes such as plastic flow in general
dsr t
 sr t ur t
u  grad ur t
which can also include the equations for t and et thus the material properties must
describe at a minimum  s and sr t ur t for each material if they also describe t s
the conductivity and  then heat conduction can be treated other functions may be
needed for particular numerical methods in continuum dynamics such as the need for wave
speeds eg the longitudinal sound speed which are needed for time step control in explicit
time integration internally within the material properties models it is desirable to reuse
software as much as possible and other functions of the state are therefore desirable to allow
models to be constructed in a modular and hierarchical way arithmetic manipulations must
be performed on the state during numerical integration and these can be encoded neatly
using operator overloading so the operator of the appropriate type is invoked automatically
without having to include ifthenelse structures for each operator as is the case in nonobjectoriented programming languages such as fortran77 for instance if  is calculated
in a forwardtime numerical method then changes of state are calculated using numerical
evolution equations such as
st  t  st  t
thus for a general state s and its time derivative  which has an equivalent set of components it is necessary to multiply a state by a real number and to add two states together
for a specific software implementation other operations may be needed for example to
create copy or destroy a new instance of a state
the attraction of this approach is that by choosing a reasonably general form for the
constitutive relation and associated operations it is possible to separate the continuum
dynamics part of the problem from the inherent behavior of the material the relations
describing the properties of different types of material can be encapsulated in a library form
where the continuum dynamics program need know nothing about the relations for any specific type of material and vice versa the continuum dynamics programs and the material
properties relations can be developed and maintained independently of each other provided
that the interface remains the same table i this is an efficient way to make complicated
material models available for simulations of different types including lagrangian and eulerian hydrocodes operating on different numbers of dimensions and calculations of specific
loading or heating histories such as shock and ramp loading discussed below software interfaces have been developed in the past for scalar eos with a single structure for the state
12 but objectoriented techniques make it practical to extend the concept to much more
complicated states to combinations of models and to alternative types of model selected
when the program is run without having to find a single superset state encompassing all
possible states as special cases
a very wide range of types of material behavior can be represented with this formalism
at the highest level different types of behavior are characterized by different structures for
the state s table ii for each type of state different specific models can be defined such
as perfect gas polytropic and grneisen eos for each specific model different materials
are represented by choosing different values for the parameters in the model and different
local material states are represented through different values for the components of s in the
jargon of objectoriented programming the ability to define an object whose precise type
is undetermined until the program is run is known as polymorphism for our application
polymorphism is used at several levels in the hierarchy of objects from the overall type of a
material such as one represented by a pressuredensityenergy eos or one represented by
a deviatoric stress model through the type of relation used to describe the properties of that
material type such as perfect gas polytropic or grneisen for a pressuredensityenergy
eos or steinbergguinan 13 or prestontonkswallace 14 for a deviatoric stress model
to the type of general mathematical function used to represent some of these relations such
as a polynomial or a tabular representation of  in a polytropic eos table iii states
or models may be defined by extending or combining other states or models  this can be
implemented using the objectoriented programming concept of inheritance thus deviatoric
stress models can be defined as an extension to any pressuredensityenergy eos they are
usually written assuming a specific type such as steinbergs cubic grneisen form homogeneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of any pressuredensitytemperature eos
and heterogeneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of materials each represented
by any type of material model
trial implementations have been made as libraries in the c and java programming
languages 15 the external interface to the material properties was general at the level
of representing a generic material type and state the type of state and model were then
selected when programs using the material properties library were run in c objects
which were polymorphic at run time had to be represented as pointers requiring additional
software constructions to allocate and free up physical memory associated with each object
it was possible to include general reusable functions as polymorphic objects when defining
models real functions of one real parameter could be polynomials transcendentals tabular
with different interpolation schemes piecewise definitions over different regions of the one
dimensional line sums products etc again defined specifically at run time objectoriented
polymorphism and inheritance were thus very powerful techniques for increasing software
reuse making the software more compact and more reliable through the greater use of
functions which had already been tested
given conceptual and software structures designed to represent general material properties suitable for use in spatiallyresolved continuum dynamics simulations we now consider
the use of these generic material models for calculating idealized loading paths
iii
idealized onedimensional loading
experiments to investigate the response of materials to dynamic loading and to calibrate
parameters in models of their behavior are usually designed to apply as simple a loading
history as is consistent with the transient state of interest the simplest canonical types of
loading history are shock and ramp 5 6 methods of solution are presented for calculating
the result of shock and ramp loading for materials described by generalized material models
discussed in the previous section such direct solution removes the need to use a timeand spaceresolved continuum dynamics simulation allowing states to be calculated with
far greater efficiency and without the need to consider and make allowance for attributes of
resolved simulations such as the finite numerical resolution and the effect of numerical and
artificial viscosities
ramp compression
ramp compression is taken here to mean compression or decompression if the material
is represented by an inviscid scalar eos ie ignoring dissipative processes and nonscalar
effects from elastic strain ramp compression follows an isentrope this is no longer true
when dissipative processes such as plastic heating occur the term quasiisentropic is
sometimes used in this context particularly for shockless compression here we prefer to
refer to the thermodynamic trajectories as adiabats since this is a more appropriate term
no heat is exchanged with the surroundings on the time scales of interest
for adiabatic compression the state evolves according to the second law of thermodynamics
de  t ds  p dv
where t is the temperature and s the specific entropy thus
  t   p v  t  
pdivu
or for a more general material whose stress tensor is more complicated than a scalar pressure
de  t ds  n dv
  t  
n divu
where n is the component of stress normal to the direction of deformation the velocity
gradient was expressed through a compression factor     and a strain rate  in all
ramp experiments used in the development and calibration of accurate material models
the strain has been applied uniaxially more general strain paths for instance isotropic or
including a shear component can be treated by the same formalism and that the working
rate is then a full inner product of the stress and strain tensors
the acceleration or deceleration of the material normal to the wave as it is compressed
or expanded adiabatically is
from which it can be deduced that
where cl is the longitudinal wave speed
as with continuum dynamics internal evolution of the material state can be calculated
simultaneously with the continuum equations or operator split and calculated periodically
at constant compression 16 the results are the same to second order in the compression
increment operatorsplitting allows calculations to be performed without an explicit entropy if the continuum equations are integrated isentropically and dissipative processes are
captured by internal evolution at constant compression
operatorsplitting is desirable when internal evolution can produce highly nonlinear
changes such as reaction from solid to gas rapid changes in state and properties can
make numerical schemes unstable operatorsplitting is also desirable when the integration
time step for internal evolution is much shorter than the continuum dynamics time step
neither of these considerations is very important for ramp compression without spatial resolution but operatorsplitting was used as an option in the ramp compression calculations
for consistency with continuum dynamics simulations
the ramp compression equations were integrated using forwardtime rungekutta numerical schemes of second order the fourth order scheme is a trivial extension the
sequence of operations to calculate an increment of ramp compression is as follows
1 time increment
t  
 ln 
2 predictor
m st 
st  t2  st 
3 corrector
st  t  st  tm st  t2 
4 internal evolution
st  t  st  t 
i st   dt
where m is the modeldependent state evolution from applied strain and i is internal
evolution at constant compression
the independent variable for integration is specific volume v or mass density  for
numerical integration finite steps are taken in  and v the step size  can be controlled so
that the numerical error during integration remains within chosen limits a tabular adiabat
can be calculated by integrating over a range of v or  but when simulating experimental
scenarios the upper limit for integration is usually that one of the other thermodynamic
quantities reaches a certain value for example that the normal component of stress reaches
zero which is the case on release from a high pressure state at a free surface specific
end conditions were found by monitoring the quantity of interest until bracketed by a finite
integration step then bisecting until the stop condition was satisfied to a chosen accuracy
during bisection each trial calculation was performed as an integration from the first side
of the bracket by the trial compression
shock compression
shock compression is the solution of a riemann problem for the dynamics of a jump
in compression moving with constant speed and with a constant thickness the rankinehugoniot rh equations 5 describing the shock compression of matter are derived in
the continuum approximation where the shock is a formal discontinuity in the continuum
fields in reality matter is composed of atoms and shocks have a finite width governed by
the kinetics of dissipative processes  at a fundamental level matter does not distinguish
between shock compression and ramp compression with a high strain rate  but the rh
equations apply as long as the width of the region of matter where unresolved processes
occur is constant compared with the isentropic states induced by ramp compression in
a material represented by an eos a shock always increases the entropy and hence the
temperature with dissipative processes included the distinction between a ramp and a
shock may become blurred
the rh equations express the conservation of mass momentum and energy across a
moving discontinuity in state they are usually expressed in terms of the pressure but are
readily generalized for materials supporting shear stresses by using the component of stress
normal to the shock ie parallel with the direction of propagation of the shock n 
n  n0
u2s  v02
v0  v
n  n0 v0  v
up 
e  e0  n  n0 v0  v
where us is the speed of the shock wave with respect to the material up is the change in
material speed normal to the shock wave ie parallel to its direction of propagation and
subscript 0 refers to the initial state
the rh relations can be applied to general material models if a time scale or strain rate
is imposed and an orientation chosen for the material with respect to the shock shock
compression in continuum dynamics is almost always uniaxial
the rh equations involve only the initial and final states in the material if a material
has properties that depend on the deformation path  such as plastic flow or viscosity 
then physically the detailed shock structure may make a difference 17 this is a limitation
of discontinuous shocks in continuum dynamics it may be addressed as discussed above
by including dissipative processes and considering ramp compression if the dissipative processes can be represented adequately in the continuum approximation spatiallyresolved
simulations with numerical differentiation to obtain spatial derivatives and forward time
differencing are usually not capable of representing shock discontinuities directly and an
artificial viscosity is used to smear shock compression over a few spatial cells 18 the
trajectory followed by the material in thermodynamic space is a smooth adiabat with dissipative heating supplied by the artificial viscosity if plastic work is also included during this
adiabatic compression the overall heating for a given compression is greater than from the
rh equations to be consistent plastic flow should be neglected while the artificial viscosity
is nonzero this localized disabling of physical processes particularly timedependent ones
during the passage of the unphysically smeared shock was previously found necessary for
numerically stable simulations of detonation waves by reactive flow 19
detonation waves are reactive shock waves steady planar detonation the chapmanjouguet state 20 may be calculated using the rh relations by imposing the condition
that the material state behind the shock is fully reacted
several numerical methods have been used to solve the rh equations for materials represented by an eos only 21 22 the general rh equations may be solved numerically for a
given shock compression  by varying the specific internal energy e until the normal stress
from the material model equals that from the rh energy equation eq 17 the shock and
particle speeds are then calculated from eqs 15 and 16 this numerical method is particularly convenient for eos of the form p e as e may be varied directly solutions may still
be found for general material models using  by which the energy may be varied until
the solution is found
numerically the solution was found by bracketing and bisection
1 for given compression  take the lowenergy end for bracketing as a nearby state
s eg the previous state of lower compression on the hugoniot compressed adiabatically to state s and cooled so the specific internal energy is es 
2 bracket the desired state apply successively larger heating increments e to s evolv10
ing each trial state internally until n s from the material model exceeds n e  e0 
from eq 17
3 bisect in e evolving each trial state internally until n s equals n e  e0  to the
desired accuracy
as with ramp compression the independent variable for solution was mass density 
and finite steps  were taken each shock state was calculated independently of the rest
so numerical errors did not accumulate along the shock hugoniot the accuracy of the
solution was independent of  a tabular hugoniot can be calculated by solving over a
range of  but again when simulating experimental scenarios it is usually more useful to
calculate the shock state where one of the other thermodynamic quantities reaches a certain
value often that up and n match the values from another simultaneous shock calculation
for another material  the situation in impact and shock transmission problems discussed
below specific stop conditions were found by monitoring the quantity of interest until
bracketed by a finite solution step then bisecting until the stop condition was satisfied to a
chosen accuracy during bisection each trial calculation was performed as a shock from the
initial conditions to the trial shock compression
accuracy application to air
the accuracy of these numerical schemes was tested by comparing with shock and ramp
compression of a material represented by a perfect gas eos
p    1e
the numerical solution requires a value to be chosen for every parameter in the material
model here  air was chosen as an example material with   14 air at standard temperature and pressure has approximately   103 gcm3 and e  025 mjkg isentropes

the numerical solutions reproduced the principal isentrope and hugoniot to 103 and 01
respectively for a compression increment of 1 along the isentrope and a solution tolerance
of 106 gpa for each shock state fig 1 over most of the range the error in the hugoniot
was 002 or less only approaching 01 near the maximum shock compression
complex behavior of condensed matter
the ability to calculate shock and ramp loci in state space ie as a function of varying loading conditions is particularly convenient for investigating complex aspects of the
response of condensed matter to dynamic loading each locus can be obtained by a single
series of shock or ramp solutions rather than having to perform a series of time and spaceresolved continuum dynamics simulations varying the initial or boundary conditions and
reducing the solution we consider the calculation of temperature in the scalar eos the
effect of material strength and the effect of phase changes
temperature
the continuum dynamics equations can be closed using a mechanical eos relating stress
to mass density strain and internal energy for a scalar eos the ideal form to close the
continuum equations is p e with s   e the natural choice for the primitive state
fields however the temperature is needed as a parameter in physical descriptions of many
contributions to the constitutive response including plastic flow phase transitions and
chemical reactions here we discuss the calculation of temperature in different forms of the
scalar eos
densitytemperature equations of state
if the scalar eos is constructed from its underlying physical contributions for continuum
dynamics it may take the form e t  from which p t  can be calculated using the
second law of thermodynamics 10 an example is the sesame form of eos based on
interpolated tabular relations for p e t  23 a pair of relations p e t  can be
used as a mechanical eos by eliminating t  which is equivalent to inverting e t  to find
t  e then substituting in p t  for a general e t  relation for example for the
sesame eos the inverse can be calculated numerically as required along an isochore in
this way a p e t  can be used as a p e eos
alternatively the same p t  relation can be used directly with a primitive state field
including temperature instead of energy s   t  the evolution of the state under
mechanical work then involves the calculation of   ie the reciprocal of the specific heat
capacity which is a derivative of e t  as this calculation does not require e t  to be
inverted it is computationally more efficient to use p e t  eos with a temperaturebased rather than energybased state the main disadvantage is that it is more difficult
to ensure exact energy conservation as the continuum dynamics equations are integrated in
time but any departure from exact conservation is at the level of accuracy of the algorithm
used to integrate the heat capacity
both structures of eos have been implemented for material property calculations taking
a sesame type eos thermodynamic loci were calculated with  e or  t  primitive
states for comparison fig 2 for a monotonic eos the results were indistinguishable
within differences from forward or reverse interpolation of the tabular relations when
the eos or the effective surface using a given order of interpolating function was nonmonotonic the results varied greatly because of nonuniqueness when eliminating t for the
 e primitive state
temperature model for mechanical equations of state
mechanical eos are often available as empirical algebraic relations p e derived from
shock data temperature can be calculated without altering the mechanical eos by adding
a relation t  e while this relation could take any form in principle one can also follow
the logic of the grneisen eos in which the pressure is defined in terms of its deviation
p e  er  from a reference curve pr  er  thus temperatures can be calculated by
reference to a compression curve along which the temperature and specific internal energy
are known tr  er  and a specific heat capacity defined as a function of density cv 
in the calculations this augmented eos was represented as a mechanicalthermal form
comprising any p e eos plus the reference curves  an example of software inheritance
and polymorphism
one natural reference curve for temperature is the cold curve tr  0 k the cold curve
can be estimated from the principal isentrope es0 using the estimated density variation
of the grneisen parameter

24 in this work the principal isentrope was calculated in tabular form from the mechanical
eos using the ramp compression algorithm described above
empirical eos are calibrated using experimental data shock and adiabatic compression
measurements on strong materials inevitably include elasticplastic contributions as well as
the scalar eos itself if the elasticplastic contributions are not taken into account selfconsistently the eos may implicitly include contributions from the strength a unique
scalar eos can be constructed to reproduce the normal stress as a function of compression
for any unique loading path shock or adiabat for a constant or smoothlyvarying strain
rate such an eos would not generally predict the response to other loading histories the
eos and constitutive properties for the materials considered here were constructed selfconsistently from shock data  this does not mean the models are accurate for other loading
paths as neither the eos nor the strength model includes all the physical terms that real
materials exhibit this does not in any case matter for the purposes of demonstrating the
properties of the numerical schemes
this mechanicalthermal procedure was applied to al using a grneisen eos fitted to the
same shock data used to calculate the p e t  eos discussed above 24 temperatures
were in good agreement fig 2 the mechanicalthermal calculations required a similar
computational effort to the tabular p e t  eos with a  t  primitive states and
were thus much more efficient than the tabular eos with  e states and described the
eos far more compactly
strength
for dynamic compressions to o10 gpa and above on microsecond time scales the flow
stress of solids is often treated as a correction or small perturbation to the scalar eos
however the flow stress has been observed to be much higher on nanosecond time scales
25 and interactions between elastic and plastic waves may have a significant effect on
the compression and wave propagation the rankinehugoniot equations should be solved
selfconsistently with strength included
preferred representation of isotropic strength
there is an inconsistency in the standard continuum dynamics treatment of scalar pressure and tensor stress response the scalar eos expresses the pressure p e as the
dependent quantity which is the most convenient form for use in the continuum equations
standard practice is to use subhookean elasticity hypoelastic form 16 table ii in
which the state parameters include the stress deviator  evolved by integration
  gs
where g is the shear modulus and  the strain rate deviator thus the isotropic and deviatoric contributions to stress are not treated in an equivalent way the pressure is calculated
from a local state involving a strainlike parameter mass density whereas the stress deviator evolves with the timederivative of strain this inconsistency causes problems along
complicated loading paths because g varies strongly with compression if a material is subjected to a shear strain  then isotropic compression increasing the shear modulus from
g to g  leaving  unchanged then shear unloading to isotropic stress the true unloading
strain is  whereas the hypoelastic calculation would require a strain of gg  using
be and the steinbergguinan strength model as an example of the difference between hypoelastic and hyperelastic calculations consider an initial strain to a flow stress of 03 gpa
followed by isothermal isotropic compression to 100 gpa the strain to unload to a state
of isotropic stress is 020 hyperelastic and 009 hypoelastic the discrepancy arises
because the hypoelastic model does not increase the deviatoric stress under compression at
constant deviatoric strain
the stress can be considered as a direct response of the material to the instantaneous state
of elastic strain  t  this relation can be predicted directly with electronic structure
calculations of the stress tensor in a solid for a given compression and elastic strain state 11
and is a direct generalization of the scalar equation of state a more consistent representation
of the state parameters is to use the strain deviator  rather than  and to calculate  from
scratch when required using
  gs
 a hyperelastic formulation the state parameters are then  e  p 
the different formulations give different answers when deviatoric strain is accumulated
at different compressions in which case the hyperelastic formulation is correct if the shear
modulus varies with strain deviator  ie for nonlinear elasticity  then the definition of
g must be adjusted to give the same stress for a given strain
many isotropic strength models use scalar measures of the strain and stress to parameterize work hardening and to apply a yield model of flow stress
f 2 
f  2 
inconsistent conventions for equivalent scalar measures have been used by different workers
in the present work the common shock physics convention was used that the flow stress
component of n is 23 y where y is the flow stress for consistency with published speeds
and amplitudes for elastic waves f  f  32  in contrast to other values previously used
for lowerrate deformation 26 in principle the values of f and f do not matter as long as
the strength parameters were calibrated using the same values then used in any simulations
beryllium
the flow stress measured from laserdriven shock experiments on be crystals a few tens
of micrometers thick is at around 59 gpa 25 much greater than the 0313 gpa measured on microsecond time scales a timedependent crystal plasticity model for be is being
developed and the behavior under dynamic loading depends on the detailed time dependence of plasticity calculations were performed with the steinbergguinan strength model
developed for microsecond scale data 24 and for the purposes of rough comparison with
elasticperfectly plastic response with a flow stress of 10 gpa the elasticperfectly plastic
model neglected pressure and work hardening
calculations were made of the principal adiabat and shock hugoniot and of a release
adiabat from a state on the principal hugoniot calculations were made with and without
strength considering the state trajectories in stressvolume space it is interesting to note
that heating from plastic flow may push the adiabat above the hugoniot because of the
greater heating obtained by integrating along the adiabat compared with jumping from
the initial to the final state on the hugoniot fig 3 even with an elasticperfectly plastic
strength model the withstrength curves do not lie exactly 23 y above the strengthless curves
because heating from plastic flow contributes an increasing amount of internal energy to the
eos as compression increases
an important characteristic for the seeding of instabilities by microstructural variations
in shock response is the shock stress at which an elastic wave does not run ahead of the
shock in be with the high flow stress of nanosecond response the relation between shock
and particle speeds is significantly different from the relation for low flow stress fig 4 for
low flow stress the elastic wave travels at 132 kms a plastic shock travels faster than this
for pressures greater than 110 gpa independent of the constitutive model the speed of a
plastic shock following the initial elastic wave is similar to the low strength case because the
material is already at its flow stress but the speed of a single plastic shock is appreciably
higher
for compression to a given normal stress the temperature is significantly higher with
plastic flow included the additional heating is particularly striking on the principal adiabat the temperature departs significantly from the principal isentrope thus rampwave
compression of strong materials may lead to significant levels of heating contrary to common assumptions of small temperature increases 27 plastic flow is largely irreversible so
heating occurs on unloading as well as loading thus on adiabatic release from a shockcompressed state additional heating occurs compared with the nostrength case these
levels of heating are important as shock or release melting may occur at a significantly lower
shock pressure than would be expected ignoring the effect of strength fig 5
phase changes
an important property of condensed matter is phase changes including solidsolid polymorphism and solidliquid an equilibrium phase diagram can be represented as a single
overall eos surface as before multiple competing phases with kinetics for each phase transformation can be represented conveniently using the structure described above for general
material properties for example by describing the local state as a set of volume fractions
fi of each possible simpleeos phase with transition rates and equilibration among them
this model is described in more detail elsewhere 19 however it is interesting to investigate the robustness of the numerical scheme for calculating shock hugoniots when the eos
has the discontinuities in value and gradient associated with phase changes
the eos of molten metal and the solidliquid phase transition can be represented to a
reasonable approximation as an adjustment to the eos of the solid

and hm is the specific latent heat of fusion taking the eos and a modified lindemann
melting curve for al 24 and using hm  0397 mjkg the shock hugoniot algorithm was
found to operate stably across the phase transition fig 6
composite loading paths
given methods to calculate shock and adiabatic loading paths from arbitrary initial
states a considerable variety of experimental scenarios can be treated from the interaction
of loading or unloading waves with interfaces between different materials in planar geometry
for uniaxial compression the key physical constraint is that if two dissimilar materials are
to remain in contact after an interaction such as an impact or the passage of a shock the
normal stress n and particle speed up in both materials must be equal on either side of the
interface the change in particle speed and stress normal to the waves were calculated above
for compression waves running in the direction of increasing spatial ordinate left to right
across an interface the sense is reversed for the material at the left thus a projectile
impacting a stationary target to the right is decelerated from its initial speed by the shock
induced by impact
the general problem at an interface can be analyzed by considering the states at the
instant of first contact  on impact or when a shock traveling through a sandwich of materials first reaches the interface the initial states are ul  sl  ur  sr  the final states are
uj  sl  uj  rr  where uj is the joint particle speed n sl   n sr  and si is connected to si
by either a shock or an adiabat starting at the appropriate initial velocity and stress and
with orientation given by the side of the system each material occurs on each type of wave
is considered in turn looking for an intersection in the up  n plane examples of these
wave interactions are the impact of a projectile with a stationary target fig 7 release of a
shock state at a free surface or a material eg a window of lower shock impedance hence
reflecting a release wave into the shocked material  fig 8 reshocking at a surface with a
material of higher shock impedance fig 8 or tension induced as materials try to separate
in opposite directions when joined by a bonded interface fig 9 each of these scenarios
may occur in turn following the impact of a projectile with a target if the target is layered
then a shock is transmitted across each interface with a release or a reshock reflected back
depending on the materials release ultimately occurs at the rear of the projectile and the
far end of the target and the oppositelymoving release waves subject the projectile and
target to tensile stresses when they interact fig 10
as an illustration of combining shock and ramp loading calculations consider the problem
of an al projectile initially traveling at 36 kms impacting a stationary composite target
comprising a mo sample and a lif release window 28 29 the shock and release states were
calculated using published material properties 24 the initial shock state was calculated to
have a normal stress of 639 gpa on reaching the lif the shock was calculated to transmit
at 271 gpa reflecting as a release in the mo these stresses match the continuum dynamics
simulation to within 01 gpa in the mo and 03 gpa in the lif using the same material
properties fig 11 the associated wave and particle speeds match to a similar accuracy
wave speeds are much more difficult to extract from the continuum dynamics simulation
an extension of this analysis can be used to calculate the interaction of oblique shocks
with an interface 30
conclusions
a general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in
dynamic loading suitable for software implementation in objectoriented programming languages numerical methods were devised to calculate the response of matter represented
by the general material models to shock and ramp compression and ramp decompression
by direct evaluation of the thermodynamic pathways for these compressions rather than
spatiallyresolved simulations this approach is a generalization of earlier work on solutions
for materials represented by a scalar equation of state the numerical methods were found
to be flexible and robust capable of application to materials with very different properties
the numerical solutions matched analytic results to a high accuracy
care was needed with the interpretation of some types of physical response such as plastic flow when applied to deformation at high strain rates the underlying timedependence
of processes occurring during deformation should be taken into account the actual history
of loading and heating experienced by material during the passage of a shock may influence
the final state  this history is not captured in the continuum approximation to material
dynamics where shocks are treated as discontinuities thus care is also needed in spatially resolved simulations when shocks are modeled using artificial viscosity to smear them
unphysically over a finite thickness
calculations were shown to demonstrate the operation of the algorithms for shock and
ramp compression with material models representative of complex solids including strength
and phase transformations
the basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths such as shockinduced impacts and shock interactions with a planar interface
between different materials such calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments without requiring spatiallyresolving simulations the results
of direct solution of the relevant shock and ramp loading conditions were compared with
hydrocode simulations showing complete consistency

are defined by extending those of the mechanical equation of state spalling materials can be
represented by a solid state plus a void fraction fv  with operations defined by extending those of
the solid material homogeneous mixtures are defined as a set of thermal equations of state and
the state is the set of states and mass fractions for each heterogeneous mixtures are defined as a
set of pure material properties of any type and the state is the set of states for each component
