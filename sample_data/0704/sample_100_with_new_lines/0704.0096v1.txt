abstract
in this note we present three representations of a 248dimensional lie
algebra namely the algebra of lie point symmetries admitted by a system
of five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order fortyfour that
admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each
of order twentyeight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential
equation of order two hundred and fortyfour
introduction
a system of n ordinary differential equations each of order m  1
 fk uj  t
j k  1 n
s  0 m  1
has a variable number of lie point symmetries depending upon the structure of
the functions fk  the maximal dimension d of the algebra of admitted lie point
symmetries can be obtained by the formulae 9
m  2  d  n2  4n  3
m  2  d  n2  mn  3
some explicit numbers are given in table 1
recently the elaboration of the elements of the lie algebra e8 of order 248 has
been variously announced 3 7 13 17 16 in the serious popular media the authoritative source is the atlas of lie groups and representations 2 which is funded
by the national science foundation through the american institute of mathematics
1 the results of the e8 computation were announced in a talk at mit by david
vogan on monday march 19 2007 and the details may be found at 15 the atlas
of lie groups and representations is a project to make available information about
representations of semisimple lie groups over real and padic fields of particular
importance is the problem of the unitary dual ie the classification of all of the irreducible unitary representations of a given lie group the goal of the atlas of lie

groups and representations is to classify the unitary dual of a real lie group g
by computer a step in this direction is to compute the admissible representations
of g including their kazhdanlusztigvogan polynomials the computation for e8
was an important test of the technology while the computation is an impressive
achievement it is only a small step towards the unitary dual and should not be
ranked as important as the original work of kazhdan lusztig vogan beilinson
bernstein et al see for example 4 5 6 11 12 14 18 8 nevertheless the result
was regarded as being suitable for a concerted campaign of publicity to heighten
awareness of mathematics in the community at large
symmetrie ist mglicherweise das erfolgreichste prinzip der physik berhaupt 7
un groupe de chercheurs amricains et europens parmi lesquels on trouve deux
franais est parvenu  dcoder une des structures les plus vastes de lhistoire des
mathmatiques 13
it may be that some day this calculation can help physicists to understand the
universe 17
eighteen mathematicians spent four years and 77 hours of supercomputer computation to describe this structure 16
in this note we demonstrate three representations of a lie algebra of dimension
248 the two of us spent four hours and 77 seconds of pocketcalculator computation
to describe these three structures
three simple systems
for d  248 formula 2 does not have integral solutions and so there is no system
of secondorder ordinary differential equations of maximal symmetry possessing a
248dimensional algebra of its lie point symmetries1  about formula 3 the factors
of 2483245 are 1 5 and 7 49 is out of question because 492  245 consequently
is this another instance of the intrinsically uniqueness of classical mechanics
possible values of n are 1 5 and 7 the corresponding values of m are 244 44 and 28
respectively the systems of maximal symmetry are easily obtained as one simply
puts fk  0  k thus the systems we construct are the simplest representations of
the equivalence class under point transformation of systems of equations of maximal
symmetry
firstly we consider the following system
k  1 5
it is easy to show that this simple system admits a 248dimensional algebra of its
lie point symmetries since 52  5  44  3  248 the algebra is generated by the
operators

k  1 5 i  1 5
i5s  ts ui 
s  0 43 i  1 5
secondly we consider the system
u28
r  1 7
this equally simple system admits a 248dimensional algebra 72  7  28  3  248
of its lie point symmetries generated by

thirdly and finally the scalar equation

admits a 248dimensional lie algebra 12  1  244  3  248 of its point symmetries

conclusion
we have demonstrated three representations of lie algebras of dimension 248 which
is the dimension of e8 although the algebras we present are not simple their
method of construction is the reason for this simplicity is that we used representations for systems of equations of maximal symmetry we do not deny that larger
systems be that in order or number of less than maximal symmetry could possibly
have an algebra of dimension 248 but even on the assumption that such systems
be linear the complexity of the calculation becomes immense 10 and defeats the
purpose of the present note
note that we have used the simplest forms for the generators of the algebras of
the three systems 4 6 and 8 for our primary interest is the demonstration of
the existence of the algebras normally one would use combinations which reflect
subalgebraic structures for example in the case of 8 for which the algebra is
obviously sl250 ir one would replace 2 with 2  2tt  243uu to underline the
subalgebraic structure sl2 ir  a1  s 244a1  where 1  2 and 3 constitute a
representation of sl2 ir 4 reflects the homogeneity of the equation in the dependent variable and the 244element abelian subalgebra is composed of the solution
symmetries so called because the coefficient functions are solutions of 8
