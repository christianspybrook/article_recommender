we investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electronphonon interactions using dmft in the regime
where itinerant electrons instantaneous electronphonon driven correlations
and static distortions compete on similar energy scales we find several interesting results including 1 a crossover from band to mott behavior in the
spectral function leading to hybrid bandmott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width 2 since the
optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function
we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency
form of the optical conductivity 3 the resistivity has a double kondo peak

introduction
mounting experimental evidence from hightc cuprates 1  nickelates 2 
manganites 34 and other interesting materials suggests that large electronphonon interactions may play a more important role in the physics of strongly
correlated electron systems than previously thought migdaleliashberg and
bcs theories have proved extremely successful in describing the effects of
phonons in many materials however if the coupling between electrons and
the underlying lattice is large andor the phonons can not be treated within
an adiabatic approximation conventional approaches fail
the holstein model contains most of the fundamental physics of the
electronphonon problem 5  tightbinding electrons are coupled to the lattice through a local interaction with einstein modes for large phonon
frequencies electrons interact with a strongly correlated hubbardlike attraction while for small phonon frequencies the lattice gives rise to a static
potential which is essentially uncorrelated between these two extreme limits of correlated and uncorrelated behavior levels of correlation are tuned
by the size of the phonon frequency and novel physics is expected in particular it is normally the strength of interaction which is said to tune the
correlation in eg the hubbard model whereas in the holstein model it can
be seen that both interaction strength and phonon frequency may compete
with each other to play this role
the dynamical meanfield theory dmft approach has proved successful in treating the holstein and other models 678  dmft treats the
selfenergy as a momentumindependent quantity and is accurate as long as
the variation across the brillouin zone is small for many aspects of the
electronphonon problem in 3d correlations are short ranged and dmft
can be successfully applied the weak coupling phase diagram was studied
by ciuchi et al where competing chargeorder co and superconducting
states were found 7  freericks et al developed a quantum montecarlo
qmc algorithm 89 and examined the applicability of several perturbation theory based techniques to the electronphonon problem 101112  the
prediction of measurable quantities away from certain welldefined limits is
severely restricted owing to difficulties inherent in the analytic continuation
dynamic properties such as spectral functions can be computed in the case
of static phonons 13  and close to the static limit 14  alternatively the limit
of high phonon frequency attractive hubbard model has been studied with
a qmc algorithm 15 
in the current study we are concerned with the behavior of dynamical
properties that could be measured directly with experiment we use the iterated perturbation theory approximation which has been demonstrated to be
accurate for the hubbard model and use maximum entropy to analytically
continue the results we compare the resulting singleparticle spectral functions over a wide range of electronphonon coupling strengths and phonon
frequencies the results obtained using iterated perturbation theory ipt
are promising and capture generic weak and strong coupling behavior for
all phonon frequencies at intermediate phonon frequencies we find that
electronphonon interactions produce a spectral function which is simultaneously characteristic of both uncorrelated band static and strongly correlated motthubbard regimes we also find that the competition between
bandlike and correlated states causes unusual structures in the optical conductivity and resistivity provided a material with high enough phonon
frequency can be identified it is possible that such a state could be observed
experimentally
this paper is organized as follows first we introduce the holstein
model the dynamical meanfield theory and analytic continuation techniques
fig 1 second order contributions to the selfenergy straight lines represent electron greens functions of the host and wavy lines phonon greens
functions
section 2 in section 3 we use ipt to determine the spectral functions of
the holstein model we compare ipt with exactly known results in the static
limit this in conjunction with the conclusions of ref 11 leads us to argue
that ipt is a reasonable approximation for the calculation of dynamical
properties in the intermediate phonon frequency regime we compute the
density of states optical conductivity and resistivity and give a heuristic
explanation for their behavior
formalism
the holstein hamiltonian is written as
h  t
ci cj
gxi  ni 
m 02 x2i
the first term in this hamiltonian represents a tight binding model with
hopping parameter t the second term couples the local ion displacement
xi to the local electron density the final term can be identified as the
noninteracting phonon hamiltonian ci ci  create annihilate electrons at
site i pi is the ion momentum m the ion mass  the chemical potential
and g the electronphonon coupling the phonons are dispersionless with
frequency 0 
the perturbation theory of this model may be written down in terms
of electrons interacting via phonons with the effective interaction
u is   
m s2  02 
here s  2st are the matsubara frequencies for bosons and s is an
integer taking the limit 0   g   while keeping the ratio g0
finite leads to an attractive hubbard model with a nonretarded onsite
interaction u  g2 m 02  iteratedperturbation theory ipt is known to
be a reasonable approximation to the halffilled hubbard model 1617  taking
the opposite limit 0  0 m   keeping m 02   finite the phonon
kinetic energy term vanishes and the phonons depend on a static variable
xi  as such the model may be considered as uncorrelated
we solve the holstein model using dynamical meanfield theory dmft
dmft freezes spatial fluctuations leading to a theory which is completely
momentum independent while fully including dynamical effects of excitations in spite of this simplification dmft predicts nontrivial correlated
physics and may be used as an approximation to 3d models 18  as discussed
in ref 6 dmft involves the solution of a set of coupled equations which
are solved selfconsistently the greens function for the single site problem
gin  can be written in terms of the selfenergy in  as
g1 in   g01 in   in 
where  is a functional of g0  the greens function for the host of a single
impurity model here n  2t n  12 are the usual matsubara frequencies the assumptions of dmft are equivalent to taking the selfenergy of
the original lattice problem to be local hence g is also given by
gin  
d dk 
in    in   k
where d the density of states dos of the noninteracting problem in
our case g  0 we work with a gaussian dos
which corresponds to a
hypercubic lattice  d  exp 2t t 2 equations 3 and 4
are solved according to the following selfconsistent procedure compute
the greens function from equation 4 and the host greens function of the
effective impurity problem g0  from equation 3 then calculate a new selfenergy from the host or full greens functions in the following we will take
the hopping parameter t  05 which sets the energy scale
once the algorithm has converged and after analytically continuing to
the real axis response functions can be computed we use the maxent
method for the determination of spectral functions from matsubara axis
data maxent treats the analytic continuation as an inverse problem
the greens function gz is given by the integral transform
gz 
19 
where x is the spectral function   img  i the problem
of finding  is therefore one of inverting the integral transform since the
data for gn are incomplete and noisy for any finite set of matsubara frequencies the inversion of the kernel of the discretised problem is illdefined
the maxent method selects the distribution x which assumes the least
structure consistent with the calculated or measured data these methods
have been extensively reviewed in the context of the inversion of the kernel
in refs 1920 the applicability to the current problem has been thoroughly
tested and is found to be accurate
within the dmft formalism many response functions follow directly
from the oneelectron spectral function and the electron selfenergy essentially because of the neglect of all connected higher point functions apart
from g0  here we will be interested in the conductivity 6 
re 
d     f   f    6
where f x is the fermidirac distribution taking the limit   0 leads
to the dc conductivity the conductivity is in units of e2 v ha2  where a
is the lattice spacing v the volume of the unit cell and e and h are the
electron charge and plancks constant respectively
results
in this section we examine the validity of an approximation to the selfenergy constructed from only first and second order terms with respect to the
spectral functions calculated at very high and very low phonon frequencies
finally we calculate the optical conductivity and resistivity
spectral functions are shown in figures 2 and 3 the perturbation theory
is carried out in the host greens function ie both electrons and phonons
are bare all diagrams in fig 1 are considered

this also gives the correct weak coupling limit for the electronic greens
function
we consider first the calculation of spectral functions close to the static
and hubbard limits in the instantaneous limit the perturbation theories
for the holstein and hubbard models are equivalent it is well known that
second order perturbation theory in the host greens function provides a
good approximation to the hubbard model 21  in the static limit the exact
solution can easily be calculated 13  figure 2 shows spectral functions from
the exact solution computed for a hypercubic lattice and spectral functions
computed using 2nd order perturbation theory at a temperature of t  008
the phonon frequency 0  t 20 was chosen so that the effects of the
phonon kinetic energy are negligible compared to thermal fluctuations this
allows a direct comparison to be made between the exact and approximate
results the comparison shows that the widths and positions of the major
features are closely related
the results in figure 2 for the static limit 0  0 together with the
fact that second order ipt is known to give reasonable results in the instantaneous limit 0   suggest that the calculation of spectral functions
should also be reliable at intermediate frequencies we note that freericks et
al also find a reasonable agreement between the ipt and qmc selfenergies
at halffilling and that this should lead to a good agreement in the matsubara axis greens function we have therefore solved the ipt equations for
the spectral functions at intermediate frequencies we show the results in
fig 3
the results of the ipt calculations in the regime of intermediate coupling fig 3 are consistent with known results for the limiting cases for
frequencies   0  the system has the qualitative behavior of the static
limit the original unperturbed density of states splits into two subbands
centered around u2 for small frequencies   u 0  and interaction
strength u  less than some critical value the system behaves as an interacting electron hubbard model since the retarded interaction between
particles u is  see equation 2 is effectively constant for s  0  there is
then a narrow quasiparticle band at the fermi energy with density of states
at the fermi energy pinned at its noninteracting value 6  we also note that
the results for small coupling and small frequencies are in good agreement
with those calculated using me theory in the metallic phase 22 
the recent renormalization group nrg calculations of meyer et al
2324
also report the spectral function in the intermediate regime the nrg
is in principle an exact method for solving the impurity problem onto which
the dmft equations map our results are largely consistent with theirs
adding further support to the use of ipt in the intermediate regime when
comparing with the results of meyer et al 23  one should note that the hamiltonian
exactly the one considered in ref 23 but with the quantity
 1 is p
g 2m 0  u 0 2 denoted by g in ref 23 and with energies measured
in terms of the full bandwidth instead of the halfbandwidth used here
in this paper we work with the gaussian density of states for the noninteracting electron dos whereas reference 23 uses the semielliptic dos
in general we would expect the critical values for the opening of a gap to
be larger for the gaussian case than for the semielliptic case the critical
coupling for the parameters in figure 3c lies just above u  20 corresponding in the units used in ref 23 to g  1 compared with the critical
value found for the semielliptic dos of g  069 note that because of the
different energy scales 0  2 in our results corresponds to 0  1 in the
units of 23 however the shapes of the spectral functions are similar in
both cases with a fivepeaked structure below and four peaked structure
above the transition the peaks are narrower in the ipt results than in the
nrg results and there is less weight in the high energy peaks this may
reflect the different dos or inaccuracies in the nrg method at frequencies
far from the fermi energy resulting from the logarithmic discretisation but
more likely the limitations of the ipt method
using the method outlined in section 2 it is possible to calculate the
realaxis selfenergy the temperature evolution of the imaginary part of the
selfenergy may be seen in figure 4 for u  2 and 0  2 the selfenergy
at low temperatures and small frequencies shows a quadratic fermiliquid
like behavior consistent with the narrow quasiparticle peak seen in the spectral function fig 3 and develops to a broad central peak at higher temperatures there are also peaks corresponding to the hubbard subbands
with increasing temperature these phononinduced peaks move together and
merge into the single central maximum associated with incoherent onsite
scattering this peak is naturally characterized within the framework of
the selfconsistent impurity model formulation of the dmft equations 6 in
terms of a kondo resonance in this formulation the dynamical mean field
g0  is written in terms of a hybridization  between the site orbital and
a bath of conduction electrons and is therefore equivalent to an anderson
impurity model with the added complication that  is frequencydependent
and needs to be computed selfconsistently however many of the properties
in the metallic state are similar to those of the anderson impurity model
in particular the central peak in the spectral function can be viewed as the
kondo resonance of the impurity model
as all connected pointfunctions with order higher than g0 are neglected
within dmft the computation of q  0 response functions is straightforward as an example we show in fig 5 the real part of the optical conductivity for various temperatures with u  2 and 0  2 the structure
seen in the curves reflects the structure of the density of states there is a
strong response at low frequencies as particlehole pairs are excited within
the kondolike quasiparticle resonance at the fermi energy the second
peak at frequencies   1 arises from excitations between the quasiparticle resonance and the large satellite hubbard band while the third peak
around   50 involves excitations between the satellites the first dip
at   05 is the signature of the small mott bands close to the kondo
resonance and is the feature most likely to be observable experimentally
also calculated is the resistivity as a function of temperature figure 6
the curves reflect the structure of the selfenergy shown in figure 4 at low
temperatures the resistivity rises quadratically as expected for interacting
electrons the temperature scale is given by the quasiparticle bandwidth
kondo temperature above this temperature the resistivity drops as the
onsite kondo scattering amplitude for electrons reduces there is a slight
second peak at higher temperatures the structures in  can be traced back
to the behavior seen in the selfenergy this second peak is the result of an
increase in scattering off the phonons these soften slowly with increasing
temperature and around the second peak in the resistivity curve outweigh
the reduction in kondolike scattering as the temperature increases this
effect clearly involves a partial cancellation between two effects and hence
may be sensitive to the accuracy of the analytic continuation which at higher
temperatures starts from reduced information since the majority of matsubara points simply show asymptotic behaviour
summary
we have discussed the result of changing the ratio of electron and
phonon energies as a method for tuning the amount of correlation in a model
of electronphonon interactions we use approximate schemes to solve for
the spectral functions of the holstein model on the basis that secondorder
iterated perturbation theory predicts the correct qualitative behavior at a
range of couplings in the static limit as well as describing correctly the limit
of infinite phonon frequency we have computed the spectral function at intermediate frequencies and couplings we have used an adaptation of the
standard maximum entropy scheme to obtain the spectral function the self
energy and the conductivity of the model by analytic continuation these
quantities had not previously been studied
the results for the intermediate frequency regime are consistent with
what might be expected on the basis of the limiting cases high and low
frequencies at energy scales smaller than 0  the system shows behavior similar to that of the hubbard model found in the instantaneous limit
0   there is a narrow central kondoresonance or quasiparticle band
at large energies the model behaves as it does in the static regime with a
welldefined band splitting at intermediate frequencies the picture is complicated by the interplay of the loss of coherence in the quasiparticle band
and the effective renormalization of the phonon frequency as a function of
coupling and temperature we suggest that if systems with anomalously
large phonon frequencies and couplings exist then the optical conductivity
should bear the hallmark of the correlation tuned regime

bottom in the low frequency limit 0  0125 the spectral functions

a renormalized phonon frequency which is less than the bare phonon frequency in the ungapped phases for 0  05 and 2 the low energy behavior

fig 6 the resistivity as a function of temperature for the holstein model
for 0  2 for varying electronphonon coupling strengths the resistivity is
in units of e2 v ha2 with v the unit cell volume and a the lattice cell spacing
the behavior reflects what is seen in the selfenergy at low temperatures
the behavior is similar to that in a kondo lattice the resistivity rises
sharply with temperature for temperatures smaller than the quasiparticle
bandwidth the resistivity then drops for temperatures larger than this
lattice coherence temperature a simple logarithmic decay with temperature
is not visible because in addition to the kondolike scattering processes
the electrons are scattered from thermally excited phonons whose spectral
weight broadens and shifts towards lower frequencies as the temperature
rises this leads to a second peak in contrast the second peak is not
visible for the hubbard model and indicates the presence of two energy
scales in the holstein model
