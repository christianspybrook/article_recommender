origin of adaptive mutants a quantum measurement
sir  several recent works described nonrandom induction of adaptive mutations by
environmental stimuli 13 the most obvious explanation of this striking phenomenon would be
that activation of gene expression leads to the enhancement of its mutation rate4 however this
does not work with the lacz mutations described by cairns and coworkers as the true inducer of
the lacoperon is not lactose as such but allolactose a byproduct of the galactosidase
reaction5 so in lacz mutants the operon is not induced by lactose6 besides induction of
respective genes would not explain the high fraction among the revertants of suppressor
mutations in trna genes17
other explanations suggest some special mechanisms for the acceleration of adaptive
evolution like selection of useful protein coupled to specific reverse transcription1 however
any mechanism of this type also should have emerged in evolution i propose that to explain the
adaptive mutation phenomenon there is no need for any new ad hoc mechanism the only thing
that is necessary is to return to the old discussion of the role of quantum concepts in our
understanding of life this alone will allow the explanation of this manifestly lamarckian
phenomenon by darwinian selection occurring not in a population of organisms as usual but in a
population of virtual in the direct quantum theory sense states of each distinct cell thus this
hypothesis may be called selection of virtual mutations detailed substantiation of this concept
will be presented in a special publication below i briefly show how this explanation might work
it has been shown by the cairns group that the mutations ensuring cell growth begin to
accumulate not immediately after plating but only after conditions are created under which such
mutations become useful as if the mutations are induced by these conditions1 i suggest that to
explain this phenomenon we should change our ideas about what a cell is and consider not
actual but virtual mutations an important distinction of virtual mutations is that they do not
accumulate with time in stationary cell whereas the number of actual mutants would grow
linearly from the moment of plating and this would yield drastically different results in
experiments like those shown in fig 3 of ref 1 virtual mutations produce delocalization of
the cell among different states similarly to the delocalization of electron in physical space
however for a virtual mutation to become an actual one certain conditions are necessary
namely the possibility to grow leading the system away irreversibly from the initial state such
conditions arise when for example lactose is added to a plate with lacz bacteria briefly this is
the essence of the proposed explanation
what is a virtual mutation the main cause of usual spontaneous mutations is the wellknown base tautomerization8 having the in vitro frequency of about 104 thus could we reduce
virtual mutation to such tautomerization i believe that this view is not consistent with
experiments as it implies that the same rare tautomeric form should work both in transcription
and in replication if these processes are considered independent we logically arrive to the leaky
mutant which was refuted by cairns and coworkers1 thus we need to postulate a correlation
between the recognition of the tautomeric forms in transcription and in replication making us to
define virtual mutation as a certain state of the cell as a whole analogous reasoning is
applicable to the adaptive transpositions discussed by cairns in other words we consider the
whole cell as a quantum system with nonnegligible nonlocality inherent in such systems most
of all it resembles the systems of generalized rigidity9 such as superfluid or superconducing
states of matter whose behavior is linked to quantum correlations and i believe similar
correlations take place in the cell too
i would like to emphasize that the proposed approach does not require detalization of
molecular processes in the cell its main focus is the behavior of the cell as a whole similarly to
explain gyroscopic precession there is no need to consider interactions between elements inside
the gyroscope its enough to know some motion invariants defined by spacetime symmetries
starting from this general view one may express the above ideas using the operator
formalism and considering experiments conducted by cairns as measurement of the cells
capability to propagate under given conditions i suggest that the trait ability to reproduce on
lactose as an example can be represented by an operator which one may designate lac
importantly this new operator will act on the state  of the whole cell because the ability to
reproduce is a property of the cell as a whole and not of any part of it generally lac  will
decompose this  into a superposition of some eigenfunctions the components of this
superposition are those functions that do not change upon the action of this operator but are only
multiplied by a constant it reflects the essence of operator formalism in quantum theory which
chooses states compatible with given experimental conditions there are three such
eigenfunctions i intentionally simplify the situation 1 corresponds to cell death 2 to the
stationary state and 3 to the selfreproduction that is the virtual mutation in our case each
function will enter the decomposition of  with a coefficient ci related to the probability of this
or that outcome ie
  c1 1  c2 2  c3 3
where  ci 2  1
by plating the cells on lactose agar we in fact begin to measure their ability to grow
under these particular conditions the rate of accumulation of lac revertants ie the probability to
obtain a cell in the mutant state will correspond to c32 being a small but finite quantity
appearing for example due to base tautomerization here the role of cell growth is dual on the
one hand it is a factor of irreversibility amplifying the quantum fluctuation and on the other
hand it is a selection criterion as each kind of virtual mutants capable of growth under these
conditions can lead to colony formation another situation ie glucosevaline agar will be
represented by another operator valr which will decompose the same  function according to
another basis and valr mutants will be obtained with certain rate in fact this is the essence of
adaptive mutation phenomenon where a particular condition induces emergence of respective
mutants
thus the proposed change of our view on the cell suggests that in accord with quantum
concepts we are not dealing with the probability for a cell to mutate by itself independent of
experimental conditions rather we are dealing with the probability to observe the cell in the
mutant state by plating it on lactose we are certainly simplifying situation as spontaneous
mutations that accumulate during cell growth before plating make our ensemble mixed
however this complication does not change the essence of the explanation according to which
adaptive mutations emerge by measurement of pure state this resembles the passage of a
polarized photon through a polarizer turned under some angle to the photon polarization it will
be incorrect to say that the polarization of the photon could turn by the necessary angle by
chance prior to interaction it is the specific experimental situation that makes us to decompose
the state vector according to the respective basis states and to evaluate the fraction of the
component that will pass through polarizer on the other hand one may speak about adaptation
of photon polarization by selection of fit eigenstate and consider this case as the model for our
phenomenon
how are all these ideas applicable to the living bacterial cell discussion of the possible
role of quantum concepts in biology has a rather long history initiated by niels bohr the
complementarity principle briefly one might reduce the essence of this discussion to the
principal impossibility to predict precisely the fate of an individual cell for example any attempt
to determine whether it is able to reproduce under certain conditions will lead to irreversible
change of the state of the cell even to its death this is reminiscent of the twoslit diffraction
experiment where an attempt to determine through which of the two slits the electron actually
passes will lead to disappearance of the interference the two trajectories of the electron can be
made physically discernable only by the cost of changing the experimental situation similarly
the notorious phenomenon of the wholeness of the living organism can be formally expressed
according to the feynman rules of calculating probabilities different indiscernible in the given
experimental conditions variants should be included in the pure state ie their amplitudes and
not probabilities should be summed leading to interference and other quantum effects thus as
long as a whole cell exists and is alive we are obligated to treat its different indiscernible states
in this way such consideration of operational limitations allows us to explain the adaptive
mutation phenomenon and hopefully other adaptations too as the consequence of unavoidable
quantum scatter in measurement of the cells capability to propagate under given conditions
in spite of its apparent formal character this hypothesis allows us to make some
predictions of applied in particular medical interest it predicts that in processes involving
somatic mutations eg oncogenesis or specific antibody generation the mutations may be
induced by conditions allowing the cell that happened to be in the state of virtual mutation to
proliferate irreversibly i believe this possibility can be tested experimentally
