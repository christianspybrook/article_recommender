1 introduction
the quantisation of the tendimensional superstring using pure spinors as worldsheet
ghosts 1 has overcome many difficulties encountered in the greenschwarz gs and
ramondneveuschwarz rns formalisms most notably by maintaining manifest spacetime supersymmetry the pure spinor formalism has yielded superpoincar covariant multiloop amplitudes leading to new insights into perturbative finiteness of superstring theory
2 3
counting fermionic zero modes is a powerful technique in the computation of loop
amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism and has for example been used to show that
at least four external states are needed for a nonvanishing massless loop amplitude 2
furthermore the structure of massless fourpoint amplitudes is relatively simple because all
fermionic worldsheet variables contribute only through their zero modes in the expressions
derived for the oneloop 2 and twoloop 4 amplitudes supersymmetry was kept manifest
by expressing the kinematic factors as integrals over pure spinor superspace 5 involving
three pure spinors  and five fermionic superspace coordinates 
k1loop  a m w  n w fmn 
k2loop   mnpqr  s w fmn fpq frs 
where the pure spinor superspace integration is denoted by h   i and a x  w  x 
and fmn x  are the superfields of tendimensional yangmills theory
the kinematic factors in 11 have been explicitly evaluated for neveuschwarz states
at two loops 6 and one loop 7 and were found to match the amplitudes derived in
the rns formalism 8 this provided important consistency checks in establishing the
validity of the pure spinor amplitude prescriptions related oneloop calculations had
been reported in 9
in this paper it will be shown how to compute the kinematic factors in 11 when
the superfields are allowed to contribute fermionic fields as is relevant for the scattering
of fermionic closed string states as well as ramondramond bosons it turns out that
the calculation of fermionic amplitudes presents no additional difficulties making 11
a good practical starting point for the computation of fourpoint loop amplitudes in a
unified fashion this practical aspect of the supersymmetric pure spinor amplitudes was
also emphasised in 10 where the treelevel amplitudes were used to construct the fermion
and ramondramond form contributions to the fourpoint effective action of the type ii
theories
this paper is organised as follows in section 2 different methods to compute pure
spinor superspace integrals are explored these methods are then applied to the explicit
evaluation of the kinematic factors of massless fourpoint amplitudes at the oneloop level
in section 3 and at the twoloop level in section 4 in both these sections the bosonic calculations are briefly reviewed before separately considering the cases of two and four ramond
states particular attention will be paid to the constraints imposed by simple exchange
symmetries an appendix contains algorithms which were used to reduce intermediate
expressions encountered in the amplitude calculations to a canonical form
2 zero mode integration
the calculation of scattering amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism leads to integrals over
zero modes of the fermionic worldsheet variables  and  both  and  are 16component
weyl spinors the  are commuting and the  anticommuting and  is subject to the pure
spinor constraint  m   0 the amplitude prescriptions 1 2 require three zero modes
of  and five zero modes of  to be present and a lorentz covariant object
t 1 5      1     5  t 1 5 
was constructed such that the yangmills antighost vertex operator
v   m  n  p mnp 
has
v  1
in this section different methods of computing such pure superspace integrals are explored as an example a typical correlator encountered in the twoloop calculations of
section 4 is considered

here ki and ui are the momenta and spinor wavefunctions of the four external particles
21 symmetry considerations and tensorial formulae
one systematic approach to evaluate the zero mode integrals is to find expressions for all
tensors that can be formed from 21 by fierz transformations one can always write the
product of two  spinors as  3  where  k denotes the antisymmetrised product of k
gamma matrices due to the pure spinor constraint the only bilinear in  is  5  and
it is thus sufficient to consider the three cases
 5  1 or  3 or  5  3  3  
lorentz invariance then implies that it must be possible to express these tensors as sums of
suitably symmetrised products of metric tensors resulting in a parityeven expression plus
a parityodd part made up from terms which in addition contain an epsilon tensor the
parityeven parts may be constructed 6 starting from the most general ansatz compatible
with the symmetries of the correlator and then using spinor identities along with the
normalisation 22 to determine all coefficients in the ansatz duality properties of the
spinor bilinears can be used to determine the parityodd part 7 an extensive and almost
exhaustive list of correlators is found in 11 including the  1  and  3  cases of
the above list

f ghjklf ghjkl
here the brackets f gh  jkl denote symmetrisation under simultaneous interchange of
f gh with ijk with weight one the remaining correlator with the  5  factor can be
derived in the same way using an ansatz consisting of six parityeven structures taking
a trace between the two  5 factors and noting that
ar  mnpqr  abcde      4  mnpqb  cde     
one finds a relation to 26 this is sufficient to determine all coefficients in the ansatz
and the result is

one may find it surprising that the derivation of these tensorial expressions only made
use of properties of pure spinors and of the normalisation condition 22 however it
can be seen from representation theory that the correlator 21 is uniquely characterised
up to normalisation by its symmetry to see this note that 12 the spinor products 3
and  5 transform in

alt5 s   00030  11010 
here  and  are taken to be in the s  irrep of so19 with dynkin label 00001 the
tensor product of these contains only one copy of the trivial representation this applies
to any spinors  which means that the pure spinor property cannot be essential to the
derivation of the tensorial identities the use of the pure spinor constraint merely allows
for simpler derivations of the same identities
as an illustration of this approach consider the correlator of eq 23 leaving the
2 k 3 k 4 f  the task is to compute
momenta aside for the moment by setting f  ka2 km

one obtains a combination of the fundamental correlators listed in 25 26 and 27
a reliable evaluation of the numerous index symmetrisations is made possible by the use of
a computer algebra program in doing these calculations with mathematica an essential
tool is the gamma package 13 expanding the products of gamma matrices in a  k basis

the epsilon tensors in the second part can be eliminated using the fact that the ui are

22 a spinorial formula
while the derivation of tensorial identities for correlators of the form 24 is relatively
straightforward and elegant it may be a tedious task to transform the expressions encountered in amplitude calculations to match this pattern as seen in the example calculated
above this is particularly true if additional spinors are involved making it necessary to apply fierz transformations it is therefore desirable to use a covariant correlator expression
with open spinor indices such an expression was given in 1 2
215

where n is a normalisation constant and the brackets  denote antisymmetrisation
with weight one note that the right hand side is automatically gammamatrix traceless
any gammatrace
 r    m 1   n 2   p 3 mnp 4 5    mnr 1 2 mnp 3 4  p 5   0
vanishes due to the doubletrace identity ab   abc   0 which follows from the
fact that the tensor product alt3 s    s  does not contain a vector representation and
therefore the vector ab  abc  has to vanish for all spinors  and can also be shown
by applying a fierz transformation this prescription was originally motivated 2 by the
fermionic expansion of the yangmills antighost vertex operator v 
v  t1 5     1     5
with
t1 5   m 1  n 2  p 3 mnp 4 5 1 5  
216
where t is related to t by a parity transformation up to the overall constant n  since
t is uniquely determined by its symmetries any covariant expression will be proportional
to t  after symmetrisation of the spinor indices and this is merely the simplest choice
equation 215 immediately yields an algorithm to convert any correlator into traces
of gamma matrices or if additional spinors are involved bilinears in those spinors it
is however already very tiresome to determine the normalisation constant n by hand
the main advantage of this approach is that it clearly lends itself to implementation on
a computer algebra system which can easily carry out the spinor index symmetrisations
simplify the gamma products again using the gamma package and compute the traces
for example
n hv i   m 1  n 2  p 3 mnp 4 5
x 1 y 2 z 3  xyz 4 5

60 terms
 5160960 
the correct normalisation is therefore obtained by setting n  5160960
returning to the example correlator 23 one finds that the calculation is by far
simpler than with the previous method after carrying out the symmetrisations i 
one obtains
n f 
trx  ab n y  mnpqr u3 q  xyz s u4 u1  s z b u2     
u2 b  xyz q u3 u1 s y  ab n x  mnpqr z  s u4

24 terms
where elementary index resorting has reduced the number of terms from 60 to 24 expanding the gamma products leads to

476 p
u2 u3  mpr i1 i2 i3 i4 u4  
5 r u1  u4 u2  u3       15 u1 
294 terms
which in contrast to 210 contains no epsilon terms as there are not enough free indices
present note that this intermediate result contains terms with with u1 paired with u3
or u4  so it is not possible to directly compare to eqs 29 and 213 however after
2 k 3 k 4 and decomposing the result in the basis b    b 
contracting with the momenta ka2 km
p r
one again obtains
14 16 0 2 8 8 0 5 5 0b1 b10 
217
f  10080
in agreement with 214
the algorithm just outlined will be the method of choice for all correlator calculations
in the later sections of this paper and can easily be applied to a wider range of problems
the only limitation is that the larger the number of gamma matrices and open indices
of the correlator the slower the computer evaluation will be for example the correlator
considered in eq 52 of 11

can still be verified with this method but this already requires substantial runtime
23 componentbased approach
a third method to evaluate the zero mode integrals consists of choosing a gamma matrix
representation expanding the integrand as a polynomial in spinor components and then
applying 215 to the individual monomials this procedure seems particularly appealing
if at some stage of the calculation one works with a matrix representation anyhow in
order to reduce the results to a canonical form eg as outlined in appendix a an
efficient decomposition algorithm of k4 u1 u2 u3 u4 scalars say only needs a few nonzero
momentum and spinor wavefunction components to distinguish all independent scalars and
therefore k and u can be replaced by sparse vectors furthermore a trivial observation
allows for a much quicker numeric evaluation of correlator components than a naive use
of 215 in view of 216 one can equivalently compute the components of the paritytransformed expression v   m  n  p mnp  where  and  are spinors of
chirality opposite to that of   in the representation given in appendix b v coincides
with v   and
v  192 9 9 9  1  2  3  4  9      480 1 2 3  1  9  10  13  15    
100352 terms
the monomials in the fermionic expansion of v then correspond to the arguments of
nonzero correlators and the coefficients of those monomials are up to normalisation and
symmetry factors the correlator values
unfortunately it turns out that the complexity of typical correlators eg the one
given in 23 makes it difficult to carry out the expansion in fermionic components in
any straightforward way and limits this method to special applications for example the
coefficients in 218 can be checked relatively easily by choosing particular index values
such as
 p  12  q  21  r  34  0  0 pqr  43 
 12 1 1 1  1  9  10  11  12      12 16 16 16  5  6  7  8  16 
for fixed values of pqr one gets no more than about 105 monomials of the form 3  5 
this approach may thus still be helpful in situations where the result has been narrowed
down to a simple ansatz

facilitate computer calculations involving polynomials in the spinor components and for
easier comparison with the literature it will be more convenient to work with commuting
fermion wavefunctions u  fortunately as the kinematic factors with fermionic external
states are multilinear functions of the distinctly labelled spinors i  it is straightforward to
translate between the two conventions any monomial expression in 1    4 and possibly
fermionic coordinates  corresponds to the same expression in u1    u4  multiplied by the

with this solution at hand one has all ingredients to evaluate the kinematic factor 32
for the three cases of zero two or four fermionic states
31 review four bosons
the kinematic factor involving four bosons was considered in 7 and this calculation will
now be reviewed briefly first note that the outcome is not fixed by symmetry the result
must be gauge invariant 2 and therefore expressible in terms of the field strengths f1    f4 
the cyclic symmetrisation in 32 yields expressions symmetric in f2  f3  f4  and acting
on scalars constructed from the fi only the 234 symmetrisation is equivalent to complete
symmetrisation in all labels 1234 thus the result must be a linear combination of the
thanks to carlos mafra for pointing this out
two gauge invariant symmetric f 4 scalars namely the single trace trf1 f2 f3 f4  and
double trace trf1 f2  trf3 f4  leaving one relative coefficient to be determined
since all four states are of the same kind one may first evaluate the correlator for one
labelling and then carry out the cyclic symmetrisation

note that x1310 and x1130 are related by exchange of the labels 2 and 3 this exchange
can be carried out after computing the correlator an operation which will in the following

the sum x3110  x1112 has the right ratio of single and doubletrace terms to be proportional to the wellknown result t8 f 4  and the last line exhibits the right ratio by itself the

32 four fermions
the fourfermion kinematic factor could be evaluated in the same way as in the fourboson
case by summing up all terms xabcd  a  b  c  d  5 now with a b c even
and d odd note however that this time the outcome is fixed by symmetry the cyclic
symmetrisation in 32 leads to a completely symmetric dependence on 2  3  4  and
therefore to a completely antisymmetric dependence on u2  u3  u4  acting on scalars of
the form k2 u1 u2 u3 u4  antisymmetrising over 234 is equivalent to antisymmetrising over
1234 and there is only one completely antisymmetric k2 u1 u2 u3 u4 scalar without further
calculation one can infer that the kinematic factor is proportional to that scalar

which of course agrees with the rns amplitude see eg 16 eq 367
33 two bosons two fermions
in evaluating 32 for two bosons and two fermions the cyclic symmetrisations affect
whether the w and f superfields contribute bosons or fermions only the label of the a
superfield stays unaffected and one has to choose whether it should contribute a boson
or a fermion since its fermionic expansion starts with the bosonic polarisation vector
a1  
 1   the calculation can be simplified by choosing a labelling where particle 1 is
a fermion of course the final result must be independent of this choice the assignment
of the other three labels is then irrelevant and will be chosen as f1 f2 b3 b4  writing out
the cyclic permutations two of the three terms are essentially the same because they are
related by interchange of the labels 3 and 4 the kinematic factor is then

41 review four bosons
the case of four neveuschwarz states was considered in 6 and will be briefly reviewed
here as all three kinematic factors k12  k13 and k14 are equivalent it is sufficient to
consider k12 in detail with all external states being identical the symmetrisations of
41 can be carried out at the end of the calculation

the neveuschwarz states come from terms of the form yabcd  yabcd 1234 with a odd

it is worth noting at this point that on the sixteendimensional space of lorentz scalars
built from the four field strengths fi and two momenta the symmetriser s4b has rank four
the correlators were computed in 6 using the method outlined in section 21 two are

in reducing those two contributions to a set of independent scalars one finds that they

the calculation involving four ramond states is very similar to the bosonic one focussing
on the k12 part the symmetrisations in 41 can again be rewritten as action of symmetrisation operators on the correlator of superfields with one particular labelling

the last step follows from the fact that all scalars of the form k4 u4 see appendix a2
and therefore all k4 4 scalars are invariant under 13 24 and have 12  34  this time
on expanding the superfields one collects the terms yabcd with a even and b c d odd

with four fermions present the method of section 22 is preferred as it does not involve rearranging the fermions using fierz identities the first correlator was covered as an example

43 two bosons two fermions
as in the oneloop calculation of section 33 in the mixed case one has to pay some attention
to the permutations in 41 since they affect which superfields contribute fermionic fields
the complete symmetrisation makes it irrelevant which labels are assigned to the two

this sign change is crucial to avoid the erroneous conclusion that the twoboson twofermion kinematic
factor cannot be of the same product form as in the fourboson or fourfermion cases which would be in

5 discussion
in this paper different methods were discussed to efficiently evaluate the superspace integrals appearing in multiloop amplitudes derived in the pure spinor formalism extending
previous calculations 6 7 restricted to neveuschwarz states it was then shown how the
treatment of ramond states poses no additional difficulties
while the bosonic calculations of 6 7 have in conjunction with supersymmetry
already established the equivalence of the massless fourpoint amplitudes derived in the
pure spinor and rns formalisms it would be interesting to make contact between the
results of sections 42  43 and twoloop amplitudes involving ramond states as computed
in the rns formalism see for example 19
the assistance of a computer algebra system seems indispensible in explicitly evaluating pure spinor superspace integrals to avoid excessive use of custommade algorithms
it would be desirable to implement these calculations in a wider computational framework
particular adapted to field theory calculations 20
the methods outlined in this paper should be easily applicable to future higherloop
amplitude expressions derived from the pure spinor formalism and it is hoped to other
superspace integrals

a reduction to kinematic bases
in calculating scattering amplitudes one encounters kinematic factors which are lorentz
invariant polynomials in the momenta polarisations andor spinor wavefunctions of the
scattered particles it can be a nontrivial task to simplify such expressions taking into
account the onshell identities i ki  0 ki2  0 ki  i  0 ki ui  0 and in the case of
fermions rearrangements stemming from fierz identities
more generally one would like to know how many independent combinations of some
given fields subject to onshell identitites there are and how to reduce an arbitrary expression with respect to some chosen basis this appendix outlines methods to address these
problems with an emphasis on algorithms which can easily be transferred to a computer
algebra system these methods are not limited to dealing with pure spinor calculations
but the scope will be restricted to amplitudes of four massless vector or spinor particles in
ten dimensions
a1 four bosons
it is not difficult to reduce polynomials in the momenta and polarisations to a canonical
form the momentum conservation constraint
i ki  0 is solved by eliminating one
momentum for example k4  all ki are set to zero and one of the two remaining quadratic
combinations of momenta is eliminated for example s23  s12  s13  where sij  ki  kj 
then all products ki  i are set to zero and one extra k   product is replaced when
eliminating k4  the replacement is k3  4  k1  k2   4  the remaining monomials are
then independent this is at least the case with the low powers of momenta encountered
in the calculations of sections 3 and 4 where there are enough spatial directions for all
momentapolarisations to be linearly independent
the implementation of these reduction rules on a computer is straightforward the
easiest way to obtain scalars which are also invariant under the gauge symmetry ki  i
is to start with expressions constructed from the field strengths fiab  2 a i  for the
oneloop calculations of section 31 the relevant basis consists of gauge invariant scalars
containing only the four field strengths f1    f4  one finds six independent combinations
trf1 f2 f3 f4 
trf1 f2  trf3 f4 
trf1 f2 f4 f3 
trf1 f3  trf2 f4 
trf1 f3 f2 f4 
trf1 f4  trf2 f3 
in the twoloop calculations of section 41 all monomials have two more momenta there
are sixteen independent gauge invariant scalars of the form kkf1 f2 f3 f4  and twelve of
them may be constructed from the previous basis by multiplication with s12 and s13 
a1  s12 trf1 f2 f3 f4  a2  s13 trf1 f2 f3 f4  etc one choice for the additional four is
a13  k3  f1  f2  k3 trf3 f4 
a14  k4  f1  f3  k2 trf2 f4 
a15  k3  f1  f4  k2 trf2 f3 
a16  k4  f2  f3  k4 trf1 f4  
 17 
as an example application of the computer algorithms one may check that the symmetrisation operator of section 41
s4b  1  12 1  34 1  13 24 1  23 1  24  
acts as
s4b a1  8a1  4a2  4a3  4a4  8a5  16a6
s4b a16  6a1  6a3  6a5  12a6  32 a7  3a8  23 a9  3a10  23 a11  3a12
and has rank four
a2 four fermions
in dealing with the spinor wavefunctions ui one has to face two issues fierz identities and
the dirac equation fierz identities not only allow one to change the order of the spinors
but also give rise to relations between different expressions in one spinor order the dirac
equation often simplifies terms with momenta contracted into ui  n uj  bilinears
in this section it is shown how to construct bases for terms of the form k2 or k4  
u1 u2 u3 u4  a significant simplification comes from noting that the dirac equation allows
one to rewrite ui  n uj  bilinears into terms with lower n if more than one momentum is
contracted into the  n  a good first step is therefore to disregard the momenta temporarily
and find all independent scalars and twoindex tensors built from u1      u4  from the
so10 representation content
s  4  2  1  6 
 3  f  tensors with rank  2 
one expects two scalars and nine 2tensors the scalars are easily found by considering as
in 21
t1 1234  u1  a u2 u3 a u4  
t3 1234  u1  abc u2 u3 abc u4  
and similarly for the other two inequivalent orders of the four spinors note there is no t5
because of selfduality of the  5  from fierz transformations one learns that all t3 terms
can be reduced to t1 by t3 1234  12t1 1234  24t1 1324 and permutations and the
identity a   a   0 implies that t1 1234  t1 1324  t1 1423  0 leaving for
example t1 1234 and t1 1324 as independent scalars
generalising this approach to twoindex tensors it turns out that it is sufficient to
start with
t11 1234  u1  m u2 u3  n u4  
t31 1234  u1  a  m  n u2 u3 a u4  
t33 1234  u1  ab  m u2 u3 ab  n u4  
 18 
and permutations of the spinor labels it would be very tiresome to systematically apply
a variety of fierz transformations by hand and to find an independent set fortunately
by choosing a gamma matrix representation such as the one listed in appendix b and
reducing all expressions to polynomials in the independent spinor components u1i      u16
this problem can be solved with computer help as expected one finds that the tij abcd
span a ninedimensional space and a basis can be chosen as
t11 1234 t11 1324 t11 1423 t11 3412 t11 2413 t11 2314
t31 1234 t31 1324 t31 2314  a1
a typical relation reducing the other tij abcd to this basis is
t31 3412  2t11 1234  2t11 3412  t31 1324  t31 2314  2mn t1 1234 
having solved the first step it is now easy to include the two or four momenta taking
the dirac equation into account consider first the case of two momenta starting from
the twotensors in a1 one gets the three independent scalars
u1 k3 u2 u3 k1 u4  
u1 k2 u3 u2 k1 u4  
u1 k2 u4 u2 k1 u3  
in addition there are four products of the two independent scalars t1 1234 and t1 1324
with the two independent momentum invariants s12 and s13  by contracting a2 with
momenta one can show that
s12 t1 1324  s13 t1 1234
 u1 k3 u2 u3 k1 u4   u1 k2 u3 u2 k1 u4   u1 k2 u4 u2 k1 u3   a3
and this relation can be used to eliminate s12 t1 1324 it will become clear later that
there are no independent other relations like this one there are thus six independent
k2 u1    u4 scalars
u1 k3 u2 u3 k1 u4 
s12 t1 1234
u1 k2 u3 u2 k1 u4 
s13 t1 1234
u1 k2 u4 u2 k1 u3 
s13 t1 1324
note that there is only one completely antisymmetric combination of those given by the
right hand side of a3 similarly in the case of four momenta one finds ten independent
k4 u1    u4 scalars

working in a gamma matrix representation it is again simple to construct a computer
algorithm which reduces any given k2 u1    u4 or k4 u1    u4 scalar into polynomials of the
spinor and momentum components the dirac equation can then be solved by breaking
up the sixteencomponent spinors ui into eightdimensional chiral spinors usi and uci  as in
eq b1 one obtains polynomials in the momentum components kia and the independent
spinor components uci 18  however a great disadvantage of this procedure is that it
breaks manifest lorentz invariance for example one encounters expressions which contain
subsets of terms proportional to the square of a single momentum and are therefore equal
to zero but it is difficult to recognise this with a simple algorithm the easiest solution
is to choose several sets of particular vectors ki satisfying ki2  0 and i ki  0 and to
evaluate all expressions on these vectors by choosing integer arithmetic one easily avoids
issues of numerical accuracy substituting these sets of momentum vectors in the bases
a4 and a5 gives full rank six and ten respectively showing they are indeed linearly
independent
equipped with a computer algorithm for these basis decompositions one finds for
example that the symmetriser s4f of section 42
s4f  41  12 1  23 1  24  
acts on the b1    b10 basis as
s4f b1  12b4  12b5  12b6 
s4f b10  8b1  16b2  8b3  16b4  8b5  16b6  24b7  24b8  24b9
and has rank three
a3 two bosons two fermions
the combined methods of the last two sections can easily be extended to the mixed case
of two bosons and two fermions in the oneloop calculation of section 33 one encounters
scalars of the form ku1 u2 f3 f4  a basis of such objects is given by
3 4
c1  u1  a u2 ka3 fbc
fbc
3 4 1
c2  u1  a u2 fab
fbc kc
4 3 1
fbc kc
c3  u1  a u2 fab
c4 
c5 
3 4 3
fcd kd
u1  u2 fab
abc
3 4 1
u1  u2 fab fcd kd
abc
there are two combinations antisymmetric in 12 and symmetric in 34
c1  4c2  c4
and
c2  c3 
finally there are ten independent scalars of the form k3 u1 u2 f3 f4 relevant to the twoloop
calculation of section 43 and they can all be obtained by multiplication of c1    c5 with
the two momentum invariants s12 and s13

b a gamma matrix representation
a convenient representation of the so19 gamma matrices is given by the 3232 matrices
 a 
 a 
where
 0   116   0  
  9

0 18
and  a    a   a  1    8 is a real symmetric 16 16 representation for the so8
clifford algebra
a  18
 a  
 a t 0
as given in appendix 5b of 21 the matrices a satisfy the so19 clifford algebra
relations
a  b   2 ab 132 
 ab         
and bilinears of chiral spinors with say positive chirality are constructed as
ua1 ak  v  u a1 ak  v  u  a1   a2      ak   v  
this representation is particularly suitable for the calculations outlined in appendix a
because it allows a simple decomposition of so19 spinors into so8 spinors due to its
block structure
18 0 0 0
 0 1 0 0 
116 0
1    8  
0    9 
 0 0 18 0 
0 116
0 0 0 18
therefore the dirac equation for a chiral 16component spinor u
 a  a u  0 
can be solved by splitting u into two chiral eightcomponent spinors of so8
18 u
with
one obtains the coupled equations
0  9 us    uc  0
0  9 uc   t  us  0
with eightdimensional dot products these can be solved for us in terms of uc

where k  i
