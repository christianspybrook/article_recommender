we present an algorithm that produces the classification list of
smooth fano dpolytopes for any given d  1 the input of the algorithm is a single number namely the positive integer d the algorithm
has been used to classify smooth fano dpolytopes for d  7 there
are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth fano 6polytopes and 72256
isomorphism classes of smooth fano 7polytopes
introduction
isomorphism classes of smooth toric fano varieties of dimension d correspond
to isomorphism classes of socalled smooth fano dpolytopes which are fully
dimensional convex lattice polytopes in rd  such that the origin is in the
interior of the polytopes and the vertices of every facet is a basis of the
integral lattice zd  rd  smooth fano dpolytopes have been intensively
studied for the last decades they have been completely classified up to
isomorphism for d  4 1 18 3 15 under additional assumptions
there are classification results valid in every dimension
to our knowledge smooth fano dpolytopes have been classified in the following cases
 when the number of vertices is d  1 d  2 or d  3 92
 when the number of vertices is 3d which turns out to be the upper
bound on the number of vertices 6
 when the number of vertices is 3d  1 19
 when the polytopes are centrally symmetric 17
 when the polytopes are pseudosymmetric ie there is a facet f 
such that f is also a facet 8
 when there are many pairs of centrally symmetric vertices 5
2 smooth fano polytopes
 when the corresponding toric dfolds are equipped with an extremal
contraction which contracts a toric divisor to a point 4 or a curve
recently a complete classification of smooth fano 5polytopes has been announced 12 the approach is to recover smooth fano dpolytopes from
their image under the projection along a vertex this image is a reflexive
d  1polytope see 3 which is a fullydimensional lattice polytope containing the origin in the interior such that the dual polytope is also a lattice
polytope reflexive polytopes have been classified up to dimension 4 using
the computer program palp 1011 using this classification and palp
the authors of 12 succeed in classifying smooth fano 5polytopes
in this paper we present an algorithm that classifies smooth fano dpolytopes
for any given d  1 we call this algorithm sfp for smooth fano polytopes the input is the positive integer d nothing else is needed the
algorithm has been implemented in c and used to classify smooth fano
dpolytopes for d  7 for d  6 and d  7 our results are new
theorem 11 there are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth fano 6polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth fano 7polytopes
the classification lists of smooth fano dpolytopes d  7 are available on
the authors homepage httphomeimfaudkoebro
a key idea in the algorithm is the notion of a special facet of a smooth fano
dpolytope defined in section 31 a facet f of a smooth fano dpolytope
is called special if the sum of the vertices of the polytope is a nonnegative
linear combination of vertices of f  this allows us to identify a finite subset
wd of the lattice zd  such that any smooth fano dpolytope is isomorphic to
one whose vertices are contained in wd theorem 36 thus the problem of
classifying smooth fano dpolytopes is reduced to the problem of considering
certain subsets of wd 
we then define a total order on finite subsets of zd and use this to define a
total order on the set of smooth fano dpolytopes which respects isomorphism section 4 the sfpalgorithm described in section 5 goes through
certain finite subsets of wd in increasing order and outputs smooth fano
dpolytopes in increasing order such that any smooth fano dpolytope is
isomorphic to exactly one in the output list
as a consequence of the total order on smooth fano dpolytopes the algorithm needs not consult the previous output to check for isomorphism to
decide whether or not to output a constructed polytope
smooth fano polytopes
we fix a notation and prove some simple facts about smooth fano polytopes
the convex hull of a set k  rd is denoted by convk a polytope is
the convex hull of finitely many points the dimension of a polytope p is
the dimension of the affine hull affp  of the polytope p  a kpolytope is
a polytope of dimension k a face of a polytope is the intersection of a
supporting hyperplane with the polytope faces of polytopes are polytopes
faces of dimension 0 are called vertices while faces of codimension 1 and 2
are called facets and ridges respectively the set of vertices of a polytope
p is denoted by vp 
definition 21 a convex lattice polytope p in rd is called a smooth fano
dpolytope if the origin is contained in the interior of p and the vertices of
every facet of p is a zbasis of the lattice zd  rd 
we consider two smooth fano dpolytopes p1  p2 to be isomorphic if there
exists a bijective linear map   rd  rd  such that zd   zd and
p1   p2 
whenever f is a d1simplex in rd  such that 0 
 afff  we let uf  rd 
be the unique element determined by huf  f i  1 for every w  vf 
we define uw
f  r  to be the element where huf  wi  1 and huf  w i  0
for every w  vf  w 6 w then uf w  vf  is the basis of rd 
dual to the basis vf  of rd 
when f is a facet of a smooth fano polytope and v  vp  we certainly
have huf  vi  z and
huf  vi  1  v  vf 
and
huf  vi  0  v 
 vf 
the lemma below concerns the relation between the elements uf and uf  
when f and f  are adjacent facets
lemma 22 let f be a facet of a smooth fano polytope p and v  vf 
let f  be the unique facet which intersects f in a ridge r of p  v 
 vr
let v   vf    vr
then
1 huvf  v  i  1
2 huf  v  i  huf   vi
3 huf   xi  huf  xi  huvf  xihuf  v  i  1 for any x  rd 
4 in particular
 huvf  xi  0 iff huf   xi  huf  xi
 huvf  xi  0 iff huf   xi  huf  xi
 huvf  xi  0 iff huf   xi  huf  xi
for any x  rd 
2 smooth fano polytopes
5 suppose x 6 v  is a vertex of p where huvf  xi  0 then huf  v  i 
huf  xi
proof the sets vf  and vf   are both bases of the lattice zd and the
first statement follows
we have v  v   spanf  f   and then the second statement follows
use the previous statements to calculate huf   xi
huw
huf   xi  huf  
f  xiwi
wvf 
huw
f  xi  huf  xihuf   vi
wvf v
 huf  xi  huvf  xi huf   vi  1
 huf  xi  huvf  xi huf  v  i  1 
as huf  v  i  1  0 the three equivalences follow directly
suppose there is a vertex x  vp  such that huvf  xi  0 and huf  v  i 
huf  xi then
huf   xi  huf  xi  huvf  xihuf  v  i  1  huf  xi  huf  v  i  1  1
hence x is on the facet f   but this cannot be the case as vf    v   
vf   v thus no such x exists
and were done
in the next lemma we show a lower bound on the numbers huw
f  vi w  vf 
for any facet f and any vertex v of a smooth fano dpolytope
lemma 23 let f be a facet and v a vertex of a smooth fano polytope p 
then
huf  vi  1
huw
f  vi  0
huf  vi huf  vi  0
for every w  vf 
proof when huf  vi  1 the statement is obvious
suppose huf  vi  0 and huw
f  vi  0 for some w  vf  let f be the
unique facet intersecting f in the ridge convvf   w by lemma 22
huf   vi  0 as huf   vi  z we must have huf   vi  1 this implies
huf  vi  1
suppose huf  vi  0 and huw
f  vi  huf  vi  1 for some w  vf  let
f 6 f be the facet containing the ridge convvf   w and let w be
the unique vertex in vf    vf  then by lemma 22
huf   vi  huf  vi  huw
f  vihuf  w i  1  huf  vi  huf  vi
if huf  vi  huw
f  vi  0 then v is on the facet f  but this is not the case
as huw
f  vi  1 we conclude that huf  vi  huf  vi
when f is a facet and v a vertex of a smooth fano dpolytope p  such that
huf  vi  0 we can say something about the face lattice of p 
lemma 24 7 section 23 remark 52 13 lemma 55 let f be a facet
and v be vertex of a smooth fano polytope p  suppose huf  vi  0
then convv  vf   w is a facet of p for every w  vf  with
huw
f  vi  1
proof follows from the proof of lemma 23
special embeddings of smooth fano polytopes
in this section we find a concrete finite subset wd of zd with the nice property that any smooth fano dpolytope is isomorphic to one whose vertices
are contained in wd  the problem of classifying smooth fano dpolytopes
is then reduced to considering subsets of wd 
special facets
the following definition is a key concept
definition 31 a facet f of a smooth fano dpolytope p is called special
if the sum of the vertices of p is a nonnegative linear combination of vf 
that is
aw w  aw  0
vvp 
wvf 
clearly any smooth fano dpolytope has at least one special facet
let f be a special facet of a smooth fano dpolytope p  then
0  huf 
vi  d 
huf  vi
vvp 
vvp huf vi0
which implies d  huf  vi  1 for any vertex v of p  by using the lower
bound on the numbers huw
f  vi w  vf  see lemma 23 we can find an
explicite finite subset of the lattice zd  such that every v  vp  is contained
in this subset in the following lemma we generalize this observation to
subsets of vp  containing vf 
lemma 32 let p be a smooth fano polytope let f be a special facet of
p and let v be a subset of vp  containing vf  whose sum is 
then
huf  i  0
3 special embeddings of smooth fano polytopes
and
huw
f  i  huf  i  1
for every w  vf 
proof for convenience we set u  vp   v and   vu v since f is a
special facet we know that
0  huf 
vi  huf  i  huf  i
vvp 
the set vf  is contained in v so huf  vi  0 for every v in u  hence
huf  i  0
suppose that for some w  vf  we have huw
f  i  huf  i  1 by lemma
23 we know that
huf  vi  0
huf  vi 
huf  vi huf  vi  0
for every vertex v  vp   vf  there is at most one vertex v of p 
huf  vi  0 with negative coefficient huw
f  vi lemma 24 so
huw
f  i  huf  i  1
now consider huw
huw
vvp  vi
vi  huw
f  i  huf  i  huf  i  huf  i  huf 
vvp 
but this implies that huxf 
contradiction
vvp 
vvp  vi
is negative for some x  vf  a
corollary 33 let f be a special facet and v any vertex of a smooth fano
dpolytope then d  huf  vi  1 and
 huf  vi  1
huf  vi  0
 huw
huf  vi
d  huf  vi  huf  vi  0
for every w  vf 
proof for huf  vi  1 the statement is obvious when huf  vi  0 the
coefficients of v with respect to the basis vf  is bounded below by 1
lemma 23 so no coefficient exceeds d  1
so the case huf  vi  0 remains the lower bound is by lemma 23 use
lemma 32 on the subset v  vf   v to prove the upper bound
special embeddings
special embeddings
let e1      ed  be a fixed basis of the lattice zd  rd 
definition 34 let p be a smooth fano dpolytope any smooth fano
dpolytope q with conve1      ed  as a special facet is called a special
embedding of p  if p and q are isomorphic
obviously for any smooth fano polytope p  there exists at least one special
embedding of p  as any polytope has finitely many facets there exists only
finitely many special embeddings of p 
now we define a subset of zd which will play an important part in what
follows
definition 35 by wd we denote the maximal set with respect to inclusion of lattice points in zd such that
1 the origin is not contained in wd 
2 the points in wd are primitive lattice points
3 if a1 e1      ad ed  wd  then d  a  1 for a  a1      ad and
 a1
 ai 
d1  a0
da  a0
for every i  1     d
the next theorem is one of the key results in this paper it allows us to
classify smooth fano dpolytopes by considering subsets of the explicitely
given set wd 
theorem 36 let p be an arbitrary smooth fano dpolytope and q any
special embedding of p  then vq is contained in the set wd 
proof follows directly from corollary 33 and the definition of wd 
total ordering of smooth fano polytopes
in this section we define a total order on the set of smooth fano dpolytopes
for any fixed d  1
throughout the section e1      ed  is a fixed basis of the lattice zd 
total ordering of smooth fano polytopes
the order of a lattice point
we begin by defining a total order  on zd 
definition 41 let x  x1 e1      xd ed  y  y1 e1      yd ed be two
lattice points in zd  we define x  y if and only if
x1      xd  x1      xd  lex y1      yd  y1      yd 
where lex is the lexicographical ordering on the product of d  1 copies of
the ordered set z 
the ordering  is a total order on zd 
example 0 1  1 1  1 1  1 0
let v be any nonempty finite subset of lattice points in zd  we define max v
to the maximal element in v with respect to the ordering  similarly min v
is defined to be the minimal element in v 
a important property of the ordering is shown in the following lemma
lemma 42 let p be a smooth fano dpolytope such that conve1      ed 
is a facet of p  for every 1  i  d let vi 6 ei denote the vertex of p  such
that conve1      ei1  vi  ei1      ed  is a facet of p 
then vi  minv  vp   huefi  vi  0
proof by lemma 221 the vertex vi is in the set v  vp   huefi  vi  0
and by lemma 225 and the definition of the ordering  vi is the minimal
element in this set
in fact we have chosen the ordering  to obtain the property of lemma 42
and any other total order on zd having this property can be used in what
follows
the order of a smooth fano dpolytope
we can now define an ordering on finite subsets of zd  the ordering is
defined recursively
definition 43 let x and y be finite subsets of zd  we define x  y if
and only if x   or
y 6   min x  min y  min x  min y xmin x  y min y 
example   0 1  0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1  1 1
when w is a nonempty finite set of subsets of zd  we define max w to be the
maximal element in w with respect to the ordering of subsets  similarly
min w is the minimal element in w 
now we are ready to define the order of a smooth fano dpolytope
permutation of basisvectors and presubsets
definition 44 let p be a smooth fano dpolytope the order of p 
ordp  is defined as
ordp   minvq  q a special embedding of p 
the set is nonempty and finite so ordp  is welldefined
let p1 and p2 be two smooth fano dpolytopes we say that p1  p2 if
and only if ordp1   ordp2  this is indeed a total order on the set of
isomorphism classes of smooth fano dpolytopes
permutation of basisvectors and presubsets
the group sd of permutations of d elements acts on zd is the obvious way
by permuting the basisvectors
a1 e1      ad ed   a1 e1      ad ed    sd 
similarly sd acts on subsets of zd 
x  x  x  x
in this notation we clearly have for any special embedding p of a smooth
fano dpolytope
ordp   minvp     sd 
let v and w be finite subsets of zd  we say that v is a presubset of w  if
v  w and v  w whenever v  v and w  w  v 
example 0 1 1 1 is a presubset of 0 1 1 1 1 1 while
0 1 1 1 is not
lemma 45 let p be a smooth fano polytope then every presubset v of
ordp  is the minimal element in v    sd 
proof let ordp   v1      vn  v1      vn  suppose there exists a
permutation  and a k 1  k  n such that
v1      vk   w1      wk   v1      vk 
where w1      wk  then there is a number j 1  j  k such that
wi  vi for every 1  i  j and wj  vj 
let  act on v1      vn 
v1      vn   x1      xn   x1      xn 
then xi  vi for every 1  i  j and xj  vj  so ordp   ordp  but
this contradicts the definition of ordp 
5 the sfpalgorithm
the sfpalgorithm
in this section we describe an algorithm that produces the classification list
of smooth fano dpolytopes for any given d  1 the algorithm works by
going through certain finite subsets of wd in increasing order with respect
to the ordering defined in the previous section it will output a subset v
iff convv is a smooth fano dpolytope p and ordp   v 
throughout the whole section e1      ed  is a fixed basis of zd and i denotes
the d  1simplex conve1      ed 
the sfpalgorithm
the sfpalgorithm consists of three functions
sfp addpoint and checksubset
the finite subsets of wd are constructed by the function addpoint which
takes a subset v  e1      ed   v  wd  together with a finite set f
i  f of d  1simplices in rd as input it then goes through every v in
the set
v  wd  max v  v
in increasing order and recursively calls itself with input v  v and some
set f  of d  1simplices of rd  f  f   in this way subsets of wd are
considered in increasing order
whenever addpoint is called it checks if the input set v is the vertex set of
a special embedding of a smooth fano dpolytope p such that ordp   v 
in which case the polytope p  convv is outputted
for any given integer d  1 the function sfp calls the function addpoint
with input e1      ed  and i in this way a call sfpd will make the
algorithm go through every finite subset of wd containing e1      ed  and
smooth fano dpolytopes are outputted in strictly increasing order
it is vital for the effectiveness of the sfpalgorithm that there is some
efficient way to check if a subset v  wd is a presubset of ordp  for some
smooth fano dpolytope p  the function addpoint should perform this
check before the recursive call addpointv f  
if p is any smooth fano dpolytope then any presubset v of ordp  is the
minimal element in the set v   sd  by lemma 45 in other words if
there exists a permutation  such that v  v  then the algorithm should
not make the recursive call addpointv 
but this is not the only test we wish to perform on a subset v before the
recursive call the function checksubset performs another test it takes
a subset v  e1      ed   v  wd as input together with a finite set of
d1simplices f i  f and returns a set f  of d1simplices containing
f if there exists a special embedding p of a smooth fano dpolytope such
that
an example of the reasoning in checksubset
1 v is a presubset of vp 
2 f is a subset of the facets of p
this is proved in theorem 51 if no such special embedding exists then
checksubset returns false in many cases but not always only when
checksubsetv f returns a set f  of simplices we allow the recursive
call addpointv f  
given input v  wd and a set f of d  1simplices of rd  the function
checksubset works in the following way suppose v is a presubset of vp 
for some special embedding p of a smooth fano dpolytope and f is a subset
of the facets of p  deduce as much as possible of the face lattice of p and
look for contradictions to the lemmas stated in section 2 the more facets
we know of p  the more restrictions we can put on the vertex set vp  and
then on v  if a contradiction arises return false otherwise return the
deduced set of facets of p 
the following example illustrates how the function checksubset works
an example of the reasoning in checksubset
let d  5 and v  v1      v8  where
v1  e1  v2  e2  v3  e3  v4  e4  v5  e5
v6  e1  e2  e4  e5  v7  e2  e3  e4  v8  e4  e5 
suppose p is a special embedding of a smooth fano 5polytope such that
v is a presubset of vp  certainly the simplex i is a facet of p 
notice that v does not violate lemma 32
v1      v8  e2  e5 
if v did contradict lemma 32 then the polytope p could not exist and
checksubsetv i should return false
for simplicity we denote any ksimplex convvi1      vik  by i1      ik 
since hui  v6 i  0 the simplices f1  2 3 4 5 6 and f2  1 3 4 5 6
are facets of p lemma 24
there are exactly two facets of p containing the ridge 1 2 4 5 one of
them is i suppose the other one is 1 2 4 5 9 where v9 is some lattice
point not in v  v9  vp  then hui  v9 i  hui  v7 i by lemma 225
and then v9  v7 by the definition of the ordering of lattice points zd 
but then v is not a presubset of vp  this is the nice property of the
ordering of zd  and the reason why we chose it as we did we conclude that
f3  1 2 4 5 7 is a facet of p  and by similar reasoning f4  1 2 3 5 8
and f5  1 2 3 4 8 are facets of p 
5 the sfpalgorithm
now for each of the facets fi and every point vj  v  we check if hufi  vj i 
0 if this is the case then by lemma 24 convvj   vfi   w is a facet
of p for every w  vfi  where huw
fi  vj i  0 in this way we get that
2 4 5 6 7  1 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 7 8  1 3 5 7 8
are facets of p 
we continue in this way until we cannot deduce any new facet of p  every
time we find a new facet f we check that v is beneath f that is huf  vi  1
and that lemma 23 holds for any v  v  if not then checksubsetv i
should return false
if no contradiction arises checksubsetv i returns the set of deduced
facets

justification of the sfpalgorithm
the following theorems justify the sfpalgorithm
theorem 51 let p be a special embedding of a smooth fano dpolytope
and v a presubset of vp  such that e1      ed   v  let f be a set of
facets of p 
then checksubsetv f returns a subset f  of the facets of p and f  f  
classification results and where to get them
proof by lemma 32 the subset v will pass the tests in step 2 and 3 in
checksubset
the function checksubset constructs a set f  of d  1simplices containing the input set f we now wish to prove that every simplex f in f  is a
facet of p  by the assumptions the subset f  f  consists of facets of p 
consider the addition of a simplex fi  1  i  d in step 5
fi  convmax v   vi  ei 
as max v is the only element in the set v  v hueii  vi  0 and v is a
presubset of vp  fi is a facet of p by lemma 42
consider the addition of simplices in step 9 if f is a facet of p  then by
lemma 24 the simplex convv  vf   w is a facet of p 
by induction we conclude that every simplex in f  is a facet of p  then
any simplex f  f  will pass the tests in steps 68 use lemma 23 to see
that the last test is passed
this proves the theorem
theorem 52 the sfpalgorithm produces the promised output
proof let p be a smooth fano dpolytope clearly p is isomorphic to at
most one polytope in the output list
let q be a special embedding of p such that vq  ordp  we need to
show that q is in the output list let vq  e1      ed  q1      qk  where
q1      qk  and let vi  e1      ed  q1      qi  for every 1  i  k
certainly the function addpoint has been called with input e1      ed 
and i
by theorem 51 the function call checksubsetv1  i returns a set f1 of
d  1simplices which are facets of q i  f1  by lemma 45 the set v1
passes the test in 2b in addpoint then addpoint is called recursively
with input v1 and f1 
the call checksubsetv1  f1  returns a subset f2 of facets of q and the
set v2 passes the test in 2b in addpoint so the call addpointv2  f2  is
made
proceed in this way to see that the call addpointvk  fk  is made and then
the polytope q  convvk is outputted in step 1 in addpoint
classification results and where to get them
a modified version of the sfpalgorithm has been implemented in c
and used to classify smooth fano dpolytopes for d  7 on an average
home computer our program needs less than one day january 2007 to construct the classification list of smooth fano 7polytopes these lists can be
downloaded from the authors homepage httphomeimfaudkoebro

an advantage of the sfpalgorithm is that it requires almost no memory
when the algorithm has found a smooth fano dpolytope p  it needs not
consult the output list to decide whether to output the polytope p or not
the construction guarentees that vp   minvp     sd  and it
remains to check if vp   ordp  thus there is no need of storing the
output list
the table below shows the number of isomorphism classes of smooth fano
dpolytopes with n vertices
