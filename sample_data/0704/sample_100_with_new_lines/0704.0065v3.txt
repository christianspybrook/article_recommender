abstract
we introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters a distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised
by analogues of the schur functions the corresponding structure coefficients
are polynomials in the parameters which we call the littlewoodrichardson
polynomials we give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying
an earlier result of b sagan and the author the new rule provides a formula
for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of w graham
we apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant schubert classes on grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients the first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion
was given by a knutson and t tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while
the stability property was not apparent from that formula we also use the
littlewoodrichardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the
algebra of the casimir elements for the general linear lie algebra in the basis
of the quantum immanants constructed by a okounkov and g olshanski
introduction
let a  ai  i  z be a sequence of variables consider the ring of polynomials
za in the variables ai with integer coefficients introduce another infinite set of
variables x  x1  x2      and for each nonnegative integer n denote by n the ring
of symmetric polynomials in x1      xn with coefficients in za the ring n is
filtered by the usual degrees of polynomials in x1      xn with the ai considered to
have the zero degree the evaluation map
n  n  n1 
p x1      xn  7 p x1      xn1  an 
is a homomorphism of filtered rings so that we can define the inverse limit ring  by
  lim n 
n  
where the limit is taken with respect to the homomorphisms 11 in the category of
filtered rings when a is specialized to the sequence of zeros this reduces to the usual
definition of the ring of symmetric functions see eg macdonald 14 in that case
a distinguished basis of  is comprised by the schur functions s x parameterized
by all partitions  the respective analogues of the s x in the general case are the
double schur functions s xa which form a basis of  over za we introduce the
littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a as the structure coefficients of the ring 
in the basis of double schur functions
s xa s xa 
c a s xa
in the specialization a  0 the polynomials c a become the classical littlewood
richardson coefficients c  see 12 these are remarkable nonnegative integers which
occupy a prominent place in combinatorics representation theory and geometry see
eg fulton 5 macdonald 14 and sagan 21
the main result of this paper is a combinatorial rule for the calculation of the
littlewoodrichardson polynomials which provides a manifestly positive formula in
the sense that c a is written as a polynomial in the differences ai  aj  i  j with
positive integer coefficients
we consider two applications of the rule the results of knutson and tao 9
imply that under an appropriate specialization the polynomials c a describe the
multiplication rule for the equivariant schubert classes on grassmannians see also
fulton 6 for a more direct argument let n and n be nonnegative integers with
n 6 n and let grn n denote the grassmannian of the ndimensional vector subspaces of c n  the torus t  c  n acts naturally on grn n the equivariant
cohomology ring ht grn n is a module over the polynomial ring zt1      tn 
which can be identified with ht pt the equivariant cohomology ring of a point
this module has a basis of the equivariant schubert classes  parameterized by all
diagrams  contained in the n  m rectangle m  n  n see eg 5 6 then
where d
a with the sequence a specialized by
am1  t1  am2  t2 
an  tn 
while the remaining parameters ai are set to zero the ti should be replaced with
yi in the notation of 9 the coefficients d
are given explicitly as polynomials
in the ti  tj  i  j with positive integer coefficients this positivity property was
established by graham 8 in the general context of the equivariant schubert calculus
the first manifestly positive formula for the coefficients in the expansion 14 was
obtained by knutson and tao 9 by using combinatorics of puzzles an earlier rule
of molev and sagan 17 also calculates d
but lacks the explicit positivity property
our new rule implies a stability property of the coefficients d
see corollary 31
below even though this property was not pointed out in 9 it can be derived
directly from the puzzle rule see also fulton 6 for its geometrical interpretation and
an extension to the equivariant schubert calculus on the flag variety
as another application we obtain a rule for the positive integer expansion of the
product of two virtual quantum immanants or the corresponding higher capelli
operators of okounkov and olshanski 18 19 cf 17 the quantum immanants
s n are elements of the center zgln  of the universal enveloping algebra ugln 
parameterized by partitions  with at most n parts see 18 the elements s n form
a basis of zgln  so that we can define the coefficients f
by the expansion
s n s n 
s n 
a for the specialization ai  i for i  z as n   this yields
then f
a multiplication rule for the virtual quantum immanants s   see section 32 for the
definitions
we define the double schur function s xa as the sequence of the double schur
polynomials
s x1      xn a
n  1 2    
which are compatible with respect to the homomorphisms 11
n  s x1      xn a 7 s x1      xn1 a
the polynomials 16 are closely related to the factorial or double schur polynomials s xu with x  x1      xn  the latter were introduced by goulden and
greene 7 and macdonald 13 as a generalization of the factorial schur polynomials
of biedenharn and louck 1 2 and they are also a special case of the double schubert polynomials of lascoux and schtzenberger see lascoux 11 we follow chen
li and louck 4 and fulton 6 and use the name double schur polynomials for
the related polynomials s xa as well
in a more detail consider a partition  which is a sequence   1      n 
of integers i such that 1      n  0 we will identify  with its diagram
represented graphically as the array of left justified rows of unit boxes with 1 boxes
in the top row 2 boxes in the second row etc the total number of boxes in  will
be denoted by  the transposed diagram   1      p  is obtained from  by
applying the symmetry with respect to the main diagonal so that j is the number
of boxes in the jth column of 
let u  u1  u2      be a sequence of variables the polynomials s xu can be
defined by
xt   ut c 
s xu 
where t runs over all semistandard columnstrict tableaux of shape  with entries
in 1     n t  is the entry of t in the box    and c  j  i is the content
of the box   i j in row i and column j
by a reverse tableau t we will mean the tableau obtained by filling in the boxes
of  with the numbers 1 2     n in such a way that the entries weakly decrease along
the rows and strictly decrease down the columns if   i j is a box of  we let
t   t i j denote the entry of t in the box  we define the double schur
polynomials s xa by
s xa 
xt   at c 
summed over the reverse tableaux t  then we have
s xa  s xu
110
for the sequences a and u related by ani1  ui with i  1 2     in particular the
polynomial s xa only depends on the variables ai with i 6 n i  z the relation
110 is verified easily by replacing xi with xni1 in 18 for all i  1     n and using
the fact that s xu is a symmetric polynomial in x the property 17 of the double
schur polynomials is immediate from their definition in the specialization of the
sequence a with ai  i i  z formula 19 defines the shifted schur polynomials
of okounkov and olshanski 18 19 in the variables yi  xi  i the use of the reverse
tableaux was significant in their study of the vanishing and stability properties of
these polynomials and associated central elements of the universal enveloping algebra
for the lie algebra gln  see also section 32 below
note that the stability property 17 extends to the double schubert polynomials
and to the equivariant schubert calculus on the flag manifold this follows easily
from the cauchy formula for the schubert polynomials eg put x1  y1 in 15
formula in 255 in a more general context this was also pointed out in 3
the double schur polynomials s xa parameterized by the diagrams  with at
most n rows form a basis of the ring n  due to the stability property 17 the
littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a can be defined by the expansion 13
where x is understood as the set of variables x  x1      xn  for any positive integer
n such that the diagrams   and  have at most n rows this allows us to work
with a finite set of variables for the determination of the polynomials c a for
the proof of the main theorem theorem 21 we follow the general approach of 17
using the techniques of barred tableaux and modify the corresponding arguments
in order to obtain manifestly positive polynomials this is achieved by imposing a
boundness condition on the barred tableaux
it was observed by goulden and greene 7 and macdonald 13 that s xu
regarded as a formal power series in the infinite sets of variables x and u admits
a supertableaux representation we show that this representation has its finite
counterpart where x is a finite set of variables we derive the corresponding formula
by choosing a certain specialization of the 9th variation in 13 this representation leads to a supertableau expression for the littlewoodrichardson polynomials
c a although that expression is neither manifestly positive nor stable
after the first version of this paper was completed we have learned of an independent work of v kreiman 10 where a positive equivariant littlewoodrichardson
rule was given that rule is equivalent to our theorem 21 although the proof in 10
is different moreover kreimans paper also provides a weightpreserving bijection
between the knutsontao puzzles and the barred tableaux used in theorem 21
this work was inspired by bill fultons lectures 6 i am grateful to bill for
stimulating discussions
multiplication rule
let r denote a sequence of diagrams
  0  1      l1  l  
where    means that  is obtained from  by adding one box let ri denote
the row number of the box added to the diagram i1  the sequence r1 r2    rl is
called the yamanouchi symbol of r introduce the ordering on the set of boxes of
a diagram  by reading them by columns from left to right and from bottom to top
in each column we call this the column order  we shall write    if  strictly
precedes  with respect to the column order given a sequence r construct the
set t  r of barred reverse tableaux t with entries from 1 2     such that t
contains boxes 1      l with
1      l
and
t i   ri 
1 6 i 6 l
we will distinguish the entries in 1      l by barring each of them so an element
of t  r is a pair consisting of a reverse tableau and a chosen sequence of barred
entries compatible with r we shall keep the notation t for such a pair for example
let r be the sequence
3 1  3 2  3 2 1  3 3 1  4 3 1
so that the yamanouchi symbol is 2 3 2 1 then for   5 5 3 the following barred
tableau belongs to t  r
5 5 4 2 2
4 3 2 1 1
2 1 1
for each box  with i    i1  0 6 i 6 l set   i  the barred entries
r 1      rl divide the tableau into regions marked by the elements of the sequence r
as illustrated
finally a reverse tableau t will be called bounded if
t 1 j 6 j
for all j  1     1 
note that bounded tableaux exist only if   
we are now in a position to state a rule for the calculation of the littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a defined by 13
theorem 21 the polynomial c a is zero unless    if    then
a t 
 a t c 
c a 
t  unbarred
summed over all sequences r of the form 21 and all bounded reverse tableaux
t  t  r moreover for each factor occurring in the formula 22 we have
t   c
before proving the theorem let us point out some properties of the littlewoodrichardson polynomials which are immediate from the rule and consider some examples the polynomial c a is zero unless both diagrams  and  are contained in
 and      in this case c a is a homogeneous polynomial in the ai of
degree      if       0 then the theorem reproduces a version
of the classical littlewoodrichardson rule see corollary 29 below note also that
by the definition the polynomials have the symmetry c a  c a which is not
apparent from the rule
example 22 for the product of the double schur functions s2 xa and s21 xa
we have
s2 xa s21 xa  s41 xa  s32 xa  s311 xa  s221 xa
 a1  a2  a2  a0 s31 xa  a1  a2 s22 xa
 a1  a0 s211 xa  a1  a2 a1  a0 s21 xa
for instance the coefficient of s31 xa is calculated by the following barred 2tableaux
1 1
1 1
2 1
compatible with the sequence 2 1  3 1 they contribute respectively a1  a1 
a2  a0  a1  a2 which sums up to the coefficient a1  a2  a2  a0  alternatively
using the symmetry c a  c a we can calculate the coefficient of s31 xa by
considering the barred 2 1tableaux
2 1
2 1
compatible with the sequences 2  3  3 1 and 2  2 1  3 1 respectively their contributions to the coefficient are a2  a0 and a1  a2 
522
example 23 for the calculation of c421 22 a take   4 2 1   2 2 and
  5 2 2 we have ten sequences r of the form 21 but the set t  r contains
bounded tableaux only for three of them for the sequence r1 with the yamanouchi
symbol 1 3 3 1 1 the set t  r1  contains two bounded barred tableaux
3 3 1 1
2 2
3 3 1 1
2 1
whose contributions to the littlewoodrichardson polynomial are a0  a3 a0  a2 
and a0  a3 a2  a1  respectively for the sequence r2 with the yamanouchi
symbol 1 3 1 3 1 the set t  r2  contains the bounded tableaux
3 3 1 1
2 1
3 3 1 1
2 1
with the respective contributions a0  a3 a4  a2  and a0  a3 a3  a1  for
the sequence r3 with the yamanouchi symbol 3 1 3 1 1 the set t  r3  contains the
only bounded tableau
3 3 1 1
2 1
with the contribution a1  a3 a0  a3  hence
522
c421 22 a  a0  a3  a4  a3  a0  a1  a2  a3 
taking   2 2   4 2 1 and   5 2 2 we get two sequences with the
yamanouchi symbols 1 3 and 3 1 the corresponding sets t  r consist of five
and four bounded barred tableaux respectively thus leading to a slightly longer
calculation
proof of theorem 21 we present the proof as a sequence of lemmas due to the
stability property 17 we may and will work with a finite set of variables x 
x1      xn  accordingly possible entries of the tableaux are now elements of the set
1     n introduce another sequence of variables b  bi  i  z and define the
littlewoodrichardson type coefficients c a b by the expansion
s xb s xa 
c a b s xa
lemma 24 the coefficient c a b is zero unless    if    then
a t 
 b t c 
c a b 
t  unbarred
summed over all sequences r of the form 21 and all reverse tableaux t  t  r
proof this is essentially a reformulation of the main result of 17 theorem 31
note that the summation in 24 is taken over all barred tableaux t  t  r not
just over the bounded ones as in 22 rather than repeating the whole argument
of 17 we only sketch the main steps of the proof and indicate the necessary changes
to be made we refer the reader to 17 for the details
we assume that all diagrams here have at most n rows if   1      n  is a
such diagram we set
a  a11      ann 
and
a   a11      ann 
under the correspondence 110 we have a  u  u1 n      un 1  the latter
notation was used in 17
the starting point is the vanishing theorem of 18 whose proof was also reproduced in 17 by that theorem
s a a  0
and
s a a 
unless   
aii  aj j1 
the first claim of the lemma follows from the vanishing theorem which also implies
c a b  s a b
this proves 24 for the case    now we suppose that     1 and proceed
by induction on    the induction step is based on the recurrence relation
c a b 
c a b
c a b 
a   a 
which was proved in 17 proposition 34 see also 9 suppose that the diagram 
is obtained from  by adding one box in row r then
c a b 
s a b  s a b
a r  a r
now use the definition 19 of the double schur polynomials since the ntuples a
and a only differ at the rth component the ratio on the right hand side of 26
can be expanded by taking into account the entries r of the reverse tableaux t 
we need the following formula where we are thinking of y  a r  z  a r and
mi  bt c as  runs over the boxes of t with t   r in column order
i1 y
 mi   ki1 z  mi  x
z  m1     z  mj1 y  mj1     y  mk 
the right hand side of 26 can now be interpreted as the right hand side of 24
where r is the only sequence    and the sum is taken over the reverse tableaux
t with one barred entry r as illustrated
here    for all boxes  preceding the box occupied by the barred r and
   for all boxes  which follow that box in column order note that the
variables y and z are now swapped on the right hand side of the above expansion
as compared to 17 this does not change the polynomial due to the symmetry in y
and z consequently the column order used in 17 is the opposite to the order on
the boxes of  we use here
we can represent the above calculation of c a by the diagrammatic relation
a   a 
consider now the next case where     2 and apply the recurrence relation
25 we have three subcases the diagram  is obtained from  by adding two boxes
in different rows and columns by adding two boxes in the same row or by adding
two boxes in the same column the first two subcases are dealt with in a way similar
to the case     1 an additional care is needed for the third subcase where we
suppose that  is obtained from  by adding the boxes in rows r and r  1 denote
by  the diagram obtained from  by adding the box in row r then 25 gives
c a b 
c a b  c a b
a   a 
set s  r 1 exactly as in the case   1 we have the following diagrammatic
relations
a   a 
a   a 
and
hence the desired formula for c a b will follow if we prove the relation
we construct a weightpreserving bijection between the barred reverse tableaux
which are represented by the left and right hand sides of this diagrammatic relation
here the weight is the product on the right hand side of 24 corresponding to a
barred tableau let such a tableau with a barred entry r in the box i j be given
suppose first that the box i  1 j belongs to the diagram and it is occupied by
s  r  1 then the image of the tableau under the map is the same tableau but the
entry t i j  r is now unbarred while t i  1 j  r  1 is barred since
a r1  a r
and
t i  1 j  ci  1 j  t i j  ci j
the weights of the tableaux are preserved under the map
suppose now that the entry in the box i  1 j is greater than r  1 or this
box is outside the diagram consider all entries r in the row i to the left of the box
i j and suppose that they occupy the boxes i j  m i j  m  1     i j  1
then the image of the tableau under the map is the tableau obtained by replacing
the entries in each of the boxes i j  m     i j with s  r  1 and barring the
entry in the box i j  m the weights of the tableaux are again preserved
the inverse map is described in a similar way this gives the desired weightpreserving bijection the general argument uses similar calculations with the barred
diagrams and a similar bijection described in 17
remark 25 i a cohomological interpretation of the coefficients c a b and their
puzzle computation can be found in 9
ii the definition 23 of the coefficients c a b can be extended to the case
where  is a skew diagram lemma 24 and its proof remain valid see 17
iii in contrast with the littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a the coefficients c a b do not have the stability property as they depend on n
lemma 24 implies that the littlewoodrichardson polynomials can be calculated by 24 with b  a that is c a  c a a our strategy now is to show
that unlike the formula of theorem 31 in 17 the formula 24 with b  a is
nonnegative in the sense that all nonzero products which occur in the formula are
polynomials in the ai  aj with i  j then we demonstrate that the boundness
condition serves to eliminate the unwanted zero terms
lemma 26 let r be a sequence of the form 21 and let t  t  r suppose
that
a t 
 a t c 6 0
t  unbarred
then t   c for all    with unbarred t 
proof suppose on the contrary that there exists a box   i j with an unbarred
t i j and the condition i jt ij  j  i the equality i jt ij  j  i is
excluded since this would violate 27 choose such a box with the minimum possible
value of j if all the entries t i 1     t i j  1 of t are barred then i j is
obtained from  by adding boxes in rows t i 1      t i j  1 and possibly
by adding other boxes since t i j  1  t i j we have i jt ij  j  1 a
contradiction so at least one of the entries t i 1     t i j  1 must be unbarred
take such an unbarred entry t i k which is the closest to t i j that is all entries
t i k  1     t i j  1 are barred then i j is obtained from i k by adding
boxes in rows t i k  1      t i j  1 and possibly by adding other boxes
hence
i jt ij  i kt ik  j  k  1
which implies i kt ik  k  i  1 however if i kt ik  k  i then the
factor in 27 corresponding to   i k is zero which is impossible therefore
i kt ik  k  i which contradicts the choice of j
lemma 27 suppose that r is a sequence of the form 21 and t  t  r if
27 holds then t is bounded
proof by lemma 26 for all unbarred entries t 1 k of the first row of the tableau
t we have 1 kt 1k  k this implies t 1k  k if the entry t 1 j is barred
then 1 kt 1k  k for the nearest unbarred entry t 1 k on its left if it exists
then  is obtained from 1 k by adding boxes in rows t 1 k  1      t 1 j
and possibly by adding other boxes this implies t 1j  j thus this inequality
holds for all j  1     1  this is equivalent to the boundness of t 
lemma 28 suppose that r is a sequence of the form 21 and t  t  r is
bounded then t   c for all    with unbarred t 
proof we argue by contradiction taking into account lemma 26 we find that for
some   i j with unbarred t  we have i jt ij  j  i set t  t i j
and consider all barred entries of t assuming for now they exist which are equal
to t and occur to the right of the column j since t is a reverse tableau these
entries t can only occur in rows 1 2     i let r k be the box with the maximum
column number k containing t then the total number of such entries t does not
exceed k  j this implies that the number of boxes t in row t of  does not exceed
i jt  k  j  k  i hence k 6 t  1 on the other hand by the boundness
of t we have t  t r k 6 t 1 k 6 k  a contradiction
if none of the boxes to the right of the column j contains t then t  i jt  ji
however by the assumption t  t 1j  j a contradiction
this completes the proof of the theorem
by the column word of a tableau t we will mean the sequence of all entries of t
written in the column order
corollary 29 suppose that      the littlewoodrichardson coefficient
c equals the number of bounded reverse tableaux t whose column word coincides
with the yamanouchi symbol of a certain sequence r of the form 21
this can be shown to be equivalent to a wellknown version of the littlewood
richardson rule corollary 29 also holds with the boundness condition dropped
see lemma 27 by the corollary c counts the cardinality of the intersection of two
finite sets the set of column words of bounded reverse tableaux and the set of
yamanouchi symbols of the sequences of the form 21
remark 210 due to 110 the multiplication rule for the polynomials s xu is
obtained from theorem 21 by replacing ai with uni1 for each i the corresponding
coefficients are polynomials in the ui uj  i  j with positive integer coefficients
corollary 211 suppose that the polynomials c a are defined by the expansion
13 with x  x1      xn  then c a is independent of n as soon as n  1 
moreover if n  1 then c a  0
proof this follows from the boundness condition on the reverse tableaux
applications
equivariant schubert calculus on the grassmannian
as in the introduction consider the equivariant cohomology ring ht grn n as
a module over zt1      tn  let x1      xn denote the chern roots of the dual s 
of the tautological subbundle s of the trivial bundle c n
gr nn  so that for the total
equivariant chern class of s we have
c s 
1  xi 
then due to 6 lecture 8 proposition 11 see also 16 the equivariant schubert
classes  can be expressed by
  s xu
u  tn      t1  0    
hence theorem 21 yields a multiplication rule for the equivariant schubert classes
the corresponding stability property is implied by corollary 211
corollary 31 we have
where
t  unbarred
t mt c  t mt 
summed over all sequences r of the form 21 and all bounded reverse tableaux
t  t  r in particular the d
are polynomials in the ti  tj  i  j with positive
integer coefficients moreover the coefficients d
 regarded as polynomials in the
variables ai defined in 15 are independent of n and m as soon as the inequalities
n  1  1 and m  1  1 hold
example 32 for any n  3 and m  4 we have
2 21  41  32  311  221
 tm2  tm1  tm  tm2  31  tm2  tm1  22
 tm  tm1  211  tm2  tm1  tm  tm1  21 
this follows from example 22
the first manifestly positive rule for the expansion of   was given by knutson
and tao 9 by using combinatorics of puzzles although the stability property was not
pointed out in 9 it can be deduced directly from the puzzle rule or by applying the
weightpreserving bijection between the puzzles and the barred tableaux constructed
by kreiman 10
quantum immanants and higher capelli operators
let gln denote the general linear lie algebra over c consider the center zgln  of
the universal enveloping algebra ugln  the algebra ugln  is equipped with the
natural filtration for all n we identify gln1 as a subalgebra of gln in a usual way
and denote by gl the corresponding inductive limit
gln 
gl 
due to olshanski 20 there exist filtrationpreserving homomorphisms
on  zgln   zgln1 
n  1
which allow one to define the algebra z of the virtual casimir elements for the lie
algebra gl as the inverse limit
z  lim zgln 
n  
in the category of filtered algebras
the quantum immanants s n are elements of the center zgln  of the universal
enveloping algebra ugln  parameterized by the diagrams  with at most n rows
see 18 the elements s n form a basis of zgln  and they are consistent with the
olshanski homomorphisms 32 so that
on  s n 7 s n1 
where we assume s n  0 if the number of rows of  exceeds n for any diagram 
the corresponding virtual quantum immanant s  is then defined as the sequence
s    s n  n  0
the elements s  parameterized by all diagrams  form a basis of the algebra z so
that we can define the coefficients f
by the expansion
s s 
note that the same coefficients f
determine the multiplication rule for the higher
capelli operators   which are defined as the sequences of the images of the quantum
immanants s n  where each image is taken under a natural representation of gln by
differential operators see 18 19
corollary 33 the coefficient f
is zero unless    if    then
t  unbarred
t   c 
summed over all sequences r of the form 21 and all bounded reverse tableaux
t  t  r in particular the f
are nonnegative integers
proof due to the stability property 33 of the quantum immanants it suffices to
calculate the corresponding coefficients for the expansion of the products s n s n 
the images of the quantum immanants s n under the harishchandra isomorphism
can be identified with the double schur polynomials s xa where the sequence a is
specialized to ai  i see 18 therefore the coefficients in question coincide with
the corresponding specializations of the littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a
example 34 using example 22 we get
s 2 s 21  s 41  s 32  s 311  s 221  5 s 31  3 s 22  s 211  3 s 21 
in the course of the proof of corollary 33 we also calculated the coefficients
for the expansion of the products s n s n for any n some other formulas for these
coefficients were obtained in 17 in particular it was shown that the f
are integers
although their positivity property was not established there
note also that the algebra of virtual casimir elements z is isomorphic to the
algebra of shifted symmetric functions   see 19 the latter can be regarded as the
specialization of  or rather its extension over c at ai  i for all i  z
supertableau formulas for sxa and c a
here we obtain one more rule for the calculation of the littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a it relies on a supertableau representation of the double schur polynomials s xa which is implied by the results of 13 this representation provides
a finite version of the supertableau formulas of 7 and 13 cf 4
fix a positive integer n for r  1 set ur  u1      ur  and use the 9th variation
in 13 with the indeterminates hrs specialized by
hrs  hr unrs1 
if r  s 6 n
and 0 otherwise where hr denotes the rth complete symmetric polynomial let us
write sb u for the corresponding schur functions then 82 and 91 in 13 give
x y
sb u 
ut  
summed over semistandard tableaux t of shape  such that the entries of the ith
row do not exceed n  i  i furthermore using 6181 and 96   in 13 we get
s x b
s  u
s xu 
equivalently this can be interpreted as a combinatorial expression for the polynomials
s xu in terms of supertableaux identify the indices of u with the symbols
1  2      a supertableau t is obtained by filling in the diagram of  with the indices
1     n 1 2     in such a way that in each row resp column each primed index is
to the right resp below of each unprimed index unprimed indices weakly increase
along the rows and strictly increase down the columns primed indices strictly increase
along the rows and weakly increase down the columns primed indices in column j
do not exceed n  j  j relation 45 implies the following
proposition 41 we have
s xu 
xt 
t  unprimed
ut  
t  primed
summed over all supertableaux t 
using 110 we get an analogous representation for the double schur polynomials
s xa a reverse supertableau t is obtained by filling in the diagram of  with
this formula in 13 should be corrected by replacing aj nj with ai ni 
the indices 1     n n  n  1     including nonpositive primed indices in such
a way that in each row resp column each primed index is to the right resp
below of each unprimed index unprimed indices weakly decrease along the rows and
strictly decrease down the columns primed indices strictly decrease along the rows
and weakly decrease down the columns primed indices in column j are not less than
j  j  1 the following supertableau representation of the polynomials s xa
follows from proposition 41
corollary 42 we have
s xa 
xt 
t  unprimed
at  
t  primed
summed over all reverse supertableaux t 
example 43 let n  2 and   2 1 by the definition 19
s21 xa  x2  a2 x1  a0 x1  a2   x2  a2 x2  a1 x1  a2 
on the other hand the reverse 2 1supertableaux are

which yield

 x2 a0 a2  x2 a1 a2  x2 a22  x1 a0 a2  x1 a1 a2  x1 a22  a0 a22  a1 a22 
formula 45 implies a supertableau representation of the coefficients c a b
and hence of the littlewoodrichardson polynomials c a the representation
for the latter is neither manifestly positive nor stable it provides an expression for
c a as an alternating sum of monomials in the ai  given a sequence r of the form
21 construct the set s r of barred reverse supertableaux by analogy with
t  r a tableau t  s r must contain boxes 1      l occupied by unprimed
indices r1  r2      rl listed in the column order which is restricted to the subtableau of
t formed by the unprimed indices as before we distinguish the entries in 1      l
by barring each of them for each box  with i    i1  0 6 i 6 l which is
occupied by an unprimed index set   i 
corollary 44 the coefficients c a b defined in 23 can be given by
c a b 
a t 
bt  
t  primed
t  unprimed unbarred
summed over sequences r of the form 21 and reverse supertableaux t  s r
proof applying formula 45 we can reduce the calculation of c a b to the particular case of the sequence b  0 now 48 follows from lemma 24
example 45 in order to calculate the littlewoodrichardson polynomial c21 2 a
we may take n  2 see corollary 211 the barred reverse supertableaux compatible
with the sequence 2  2 1 are
