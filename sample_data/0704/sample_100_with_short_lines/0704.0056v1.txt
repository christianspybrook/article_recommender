we study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive gaussian law after identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through
a careful zerotemperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures we determine
the melting temperature for various pressure values also with the help of exact free energy calculations among the prominent features of this model are pressuredriven reentrant melting and the
stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures

introduction

since five decades now numerical simulation has imposed as an invaluable tool for the determination of equilibrium statistical properties of manyparticle systems
despite a long history however a precise numerical evaluation of the helmholtz free energy of a simple model
fluid in its solid phase has resisted all attacks for many
years until in a remarkable 1984 paper 1 frenkel and
ladd showed how a reference einstein solid can be used
right to this purpose since then it has become possible to trace a numerically accurate and complete equilibrium phase diagram for simplefluid systems by monte
carlo simulation methods the only real limitation of
the frenkelladd method is the necessity of a preliminary
identification of all relevant solid structures depending
on the complexity of the model potential some structure could be skipped neither it does necessarily show
up spontaneously in the simulation due to the effective
fragmentation of the system phase space into inescapable
ergodic basins
in a series of papers 2 3 4 we have employed
the frenkelladd technique in combination with the
standard thermodynamicintegration method in order to
trace the phase diagram of some reference simplefluid
models in particular we have provided the first accurate determination of the phase diagram for the socalled
gaussiancore model which is meant to describe dilute
solutions of polymer coils 5 6 the thermodynamics
of this model is ruled by the competition between the
fluid and two different bodycenteredcubic bcc and
facecenteredcubic fcc crystal structures its peculiar features are reentrant melting by isothermal compression and in a narrow range of temperatures bcc
reentrance in the solid sector
following earlier simulational work by frenkel and collaborators on hard ellipsoids and spherocylinders 7 8 9
10 as well as by other authors on hard dumbbells 11
we aim here to provide another demonstration of the use

of simulation for the description of thermodynamic properties of elongated particles such molecules can exist in a
number of partiallyordered mesophases with longrange
orientational order possibly in combination with one or
twodimensional translational order as in smectic and
in columnar liquid crystals respectively 12 13 liquid
crystals do also usually give rise to numerous solid phases
which as a rule can hardly be anticipated from just a
glance at the interaction potential between the molecules
very recently an interesting liquidcrystal model was
introduced by de miguel and martin del rio 14 whose
phase diagram shows a stable smectic phase as well as
pressuredriven reentrance of the nematic phase the
model consists of equallyoriented hard ellipsoids that are
further equipped with an attractive spherical well there
is no isotropic phase in this model since the particles
are artificially constrained to stay parallel to each other
hence the fluid phase is a nematic liquid crystal initially we thought of this model as an ideal candidate for
a complete reconstruction of the phase diagram unfortunately the model potential turns out to be not simple
enough to allow for a straightforward identification of
the structure of its solid phases and in this respect
the original paper is in fact reticent we have made
an attempt to resolve the solid structure in terms of
stretched cubic lattices but a direct inspection of many
equilibrated solid configurations reveals more complicate
yet periodically repeated patterns probably this results
from a difficult matching between the optimization requirements of the different pairpotential components
ie a cylindricallysymmetric hardcore repulsion and a
sphericallysymmetric steplike attraction
to retain nematic reentrance and possibly also the
smectic phase we have considered a more tractable test
case that is a uniaxial deformation of the repulsive gaussian potential which we expect to provide a model nematic fluid whose phase diagram can fully be worked out
also in its solid region it can plausibly be argued on symmetry grounds and also expected from the smoothness of

the potential that all solid phases of the model will now
be found within the class of uniaxiallystretched cubic
crystals
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section ii we present our liquidcrystal model together with
a catalogue of crystal structures that are possibly relevant to it next in section iii we outline the numerical methods by which the phase diagram of the model
is being drawn results are exposed in section iv while
further comments and conclusions are deferred to section

model

we consider a nematic fluid of n parallel ellipsoids
of revolution whose geometric boundaries are smeared
out by a pair interaction u that smoothly depends on
the ratio between the centertocenter distance r and the
contact distance  which is the distance of closest approach in case of sharp boundaries  is a function of the
angle  that the ray r joining the two molecular centers
forms with the direction  of the axis of revolution its
closedform expression is easily found to be

d and l being the transversal with respect to  and the
longitudinal diameter respectively we hereafter consider
only the prolate case l  d for uniaxial particles the
functional dependence of  is actually on cos  as exemplified by eq 21 we also note that hard ellipsoids
do correspond to an interaction strenght being  for
r   and zero otherwise
for the efficiency of numerical calculation sufficiently
shortrange interaction in all directions is highly desirable and among smooth interactions a good choice is a
gaussiandecaying twobody repulsion

  0 being an arbitrary energy scale eq 22 defines
the gaussiancore nematic gcn fluid it is evident
that upon increasing the aspect ratio ld larger and
larger system sizes are needed in order to pull down any
roundingoff error that is implicit eg in the numerical
calculation of the total energy
another crucial quantity to determine in a simulation
is the pressure for a v volume system of n parallel
ellipsoids in contact with a heat bath at temperature

a virial theorem that generalizes the one valid for a simple fluid let the total potential

be of the general form u  ij uri  rj  cos ij 
where ri is the centerofmass position of particle i and

anyway a practical implementation of eq 24 or 25
in a simulation requires a precise evaluation of the twoargument function g which ordinarily is a difficult task
to accomplish with negligible statistical errors a much
better solution is to switch to the isothermalisobaric ensemble by simulating the system under constantt and
constantp conditions see section iii
as was mentioned in the introduction one main inconvenience of liquidcrystal simulations is the correct
identification of the solid phases of the system since
a plethora of such phases are conceivable and there is
no unfailing criterion for choosing those that are really
relevant to the specific model under investigation the
actual importance of a given crystal phase can only be
judged a posteriori after proving its mechanical stability
in a long simulation run and ultimately on the basis of
the calculation of its gibbs free energy but nothing can
nevertheless ensure that no important phase was skipped
besides these vague indications we adopted a more stringent test in order to select the phases for which it is worth
performing the numericallyexpensive calculation of the
free energy with specific reference to the model 22
we did a comprehensive t  0 study of the chemical potential  as a function of the pressure for many stretched
cubic and hexagonal phases in such a way as to identify the stable ground states and leave out from further
consideration all solids with a very large  at zero temperature in fact it is unlikely that such phases can ever
play a role for the thermodynamics at nonzero temperatures
for the interaction potential describing the gcn
model we surmise that all of its stable crystal phases
are to be sought among the structures obtained from

3
the common cubic and hexagonal lattices by a suitable stretching along a highsymmetry crystal axis with
optimal stretching ratios  that are probably close to
ld take eg the case of bcc we can stretch
it along 001 110 or 111 this way defining new
bcc001 bcc110 and bcc111 lattices the
number within parentheses is the stretching ratio for instance bcc0012 is a bcc crystal whose unit cell has
been expanded by a factor of 2 along  the same can
be done with the simplecubic sc and fcc structures
we further consider hexagonalclosepacked hcp and
simplehexagonal sh lattices that are stretched along
111 this way arriving at a total of eleven potentially
relevant crystal phases

method

for fixed t and p values the most stable of several
thermodynamic phases is the one with lowest chemical
potential  gibbs free energy per particle at t 
0 only crystal phases are involved in this competition
and once a list of relevant phases has been compiled
searching for the optimal one at a given p becomes a
simple computational exercise an exact property of the
gaussiancore model which is the ld  1 limit of the
gcn model is that on increasing pressure the bcc
crystal takes over the fcc crystal at p   p d3  
0055 3 hence in the gcn model with ld  1 a
leading role is naturally expected for the stretched fcc
and bcc crystals
for an assigned crystal structure we calculate the t 
0 chemical potential p  of the gcn model for a given
pressure p by adjusting the stretching ratio p  and the
density p  until the minimum of u  p v n is found
once the profile of  as a function of p is known for each
structure it is straightforward to draw the t  0 phase
diagram for the given ld
the known thermodynamic behavior at zero temperature provides the general framework for the further simulational study at nonzero temperatures in fact it is safe
to say that the same crystals that are stable at t  0
also give the underlying lattice structure for the stable
solid phases at t  0 as we shall see in more detail in
the next section the only complication is the existence
of three degenerate t  0 structures for not too small
pressures which obliged us to consider each of them as a
potentially relevant lowtemperature gcn phase
we perform a monte carlo mc simulation of the
gcn model with ld  3 in the isothermalisobaric
ensemble using the standard metropolis algorithm with
periodic boundary conditions and the nearestimage convention for the solid phase four different types of
lattices are considered namely fcc0013 bcc1103
bcc1113 and bcc0013 see section iv the number of particles in a given direction is chosen so as to guar

antee a negligible contribution to the interaction energy
from pairs of particles separated by half a simulationbox length in that direction more precisely our samples
consist of 10  20  8  1600 particles in the fcc0013
phase of 8  24  6  1152 particles in the fluid and in
the solid bcc1103 phase of 10  12  18  2160 particles in the bcc1113 phase and of 12  12  10  1440
particles in the bcc0013 phase considering the large
system sizes employed we made no attempt to extrapolate our finitesize results to infinity
at given t and p  equilibration of the sample typically
took a few thousand mc sweeps a sweep consisting of
one average attempt per particle to change its centerofmass position plus one average attempt to change the
volume by a isotropic rescaling of particle coordinates
the maximum random displacement of a particle and
the maximum volume change in a trial mc move are adjusted once a sweep during the run so as to keep the
acceptance ratio of moves close to 50 and 40 respectively while the above setup is sufficient when simulating a nematic fluid system it could have harmful
consequences on the sampling of a solid state to operate
with a fixed box shape since this would not allow the
system to release the residual stress that is why after a
first rough optimization with a fixed box shape the equilibrium mc trajectory of a solid state is generated with a
modified so called constantstress metropolis algorithm
which makes it possible to adjust the length of the various sides of the box independently from each other see
eg 8 ordinarily however the simulation box will deviate only very little from its original shape when the
opposite occurs this indicates a mechanic instability of
the solid in favor of the fluid hence it gives a clue as to
where melting is located we note that mc simulations
with a varying box shape are not well suited for the fluid
phase since in this case one side of the box usually becomes much larger or smaller than the other two a fact
that seriously prejudicates the reliability of the simulation results
in order to locate the melting point for a given pressure we generate separate sequences of simulation runs
starting from the cold solid on one side and from the hot
fluid on the other side the last configuration produced
in a given run is taken to be the first of the next run at a
slightly different temperature the starting configuration
of a solid chain of runs was always a perfect crystal with
  3 and a density equal to its t  0 value usually
this series of runs is carried on until a sudden change is
observed in the difference between the energiesvolumes
of solid and fluid so as to prevent us from averaging over
heterogeneous thermodynamic states thermodynamic
averages are computed over trajectories 104 sweeps long
much longer trajectories are constructed for estimating
the chemical potential of the fluid see below
estimating statistical errors is a critical issue whenever
different candidate solid structures so closely compete for

4
thermodynamic stability to this aim we divide the mc
trajectory into ten blocks and estimate the length of the
error bars to be twice as large as the standard deviation of
the block averages typically the relative errors affecting
the energy and the volume of the fluid are found to be
very small a few hundredths percent at the most for a
solid they are even smaller
a more direct clue about the nature of the phases
expressed by the system for intermediate temperatures
can be got from a careful monitoring across the state
space of a smectic order parameter op and of two
different transversal and longitudinal with respect to 
distribution functions dfs the smectic op is defined
as

this quantity is able to notice the existence of a layered
structure along  in the system be it solidlike or smecticlike in particular the  at which  takes its largest value
gives the nominal distance max between the layers a
large value of  at max signals a strong layering along z
with period max  in order to discriminate between solid
and smectic fluid layers we can rely on the inplane
df g r  with r  r  r   which informs on
how much rapid is the decay of crystallike spatial correlations in directions perpendicular to  the persistence
of crystal order along  is measured through another df
gk z which gives similar indications as   a liquidlike profile of g along with a sharply peaked  or gk will
be faithful indication of a smectic phase conversely
a sharply peaked g along with a structureless gk will
be the imprints of a columnar phase both g r  and
gk z are normalized in such a way as to approach 1 at
large distances in case of fully disordered centerofmass
distributions in the respective directions slight deviations from this asymptotic value may occur as a result
of the variation of box sidelengths during a simulation
run the two dfs were constructed with a spatial resolution of r  d20 and z  l20 respectively and
updated every 10 mc sweeps
we compute the difference in chemical potential between any two equilibrium states of the system  say
1 and 2  within the same phase or even in different
phases provided they are separated by a secondorder
boundary by the standard thermodynamicintegration
method as adapted to the isothermalisobaric ensemble

to prove really useful however the above equations require an independent estimate of  for at least one reference state in each phase for the fluid a reference
state can be any state characterized by a very small density a nearly ideal gas since then the excess chemical
potential can be estimated accurately through widoms
particleinsertion method 15 the use of this technique
for small but finite densities avoids the otherwise necessary extrapolation to the ideal gas limit as a reference
state for thermodynamic integration
in order to calculate the excess helmholtz free energy
of a solid we resort to the method proposed by frenkel
and ladd 1 based on a different kind of thermodynamic integration see ref 4 for a full description of this
method and of its implementation on a computer we
note that the ellipsoidal symmetry of the gcn particles
is not a complication at all since the particle axes are
frozen and the only degrees of freedom been left are the
centers of mass the solid excess helmholtz free energy is
calculated through a series of n v t simulation runs ie
for fixed density and temperature as far as the density
is concerned its value is chosen in a way such that complies with the pressure of the lowtemperature reference
state that is the one from which the n p t sequence of
runs is started we wish to emphasize that thanks to the
large sample sizes employed the density histogram in a
n p t run always turned out to be sharply peaked indicating very limited density fluctuations hence negligible
ensemble dependence of statistical averages

results
zerotemperature calculations

for various ld values in the interval between 11
and 3 we have calculated the t  0 chemical potential p  for our eleven candidate ground states with
p ranging from 0 to 020 we report in table 1 the
results relative to ld  3 for two values of p  005
and 020 an emergent aspect of this table is the existence of a rich degeneracy that is only partly a result of
the effective identity of crystal structures up to a dilation take eg the five structures with the minimum 
and with the same density while the bcc001 lattice
with  
 3 is obtained from the 
fcc001 lattice with
  3 2  212    by a simple 2 dilation there is
no homothety transforming bcc0013 into bcc1103
or into bcc1113 in turn equivalent to sc11115
points in these three lattices have different local environments as can be checked by counting the nthorder
neighbors for n up to 4 yet the three stretched bcc crystals of minimum  share the same un  also the pairs
fcc1103 fcc1113 and sc0013 sc1103 consist
of topologicallydifferent degenerate structures this fact
is an emergent phenomenon whose deep reason remains

5
unclear to us it should deal with the dependence of u on
the ratio r since the same symmetry holds with a
polynomial rather than gaussian dependence
for the case of ld  3 we show in fig 1 the overall p dependence at t  0 of the chemical potential 
for the various solids the solid with the minimum  is
either of the type fcc001 with   3 or say of the
type bcc001 with   3 a fact that holds true but
with   ld for all 1  ld  3 other solids are
definitely ruled out and the same will probably hold for
t  0 on increasing ld the transition from a fcctype to a bcctype phase occurs at a lower and lower
pressure whose reduced value is slightly less than 002
for ld  3

monte carlo simulation

in order to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of
the gcn model at nonzero temperatures we have carried out a number of mc simulation runs for a gcn
system with ld  3 which is the system with the
strongest liquidcrystalline features that we can still manage numerically
we have effected scans of the phase diagram for six
different pressure values p   001 002 003 005 012
and 020 with all probability fcc0013 is the stable system phase only in a very small pocket of t p
plane nearby the origin however we decided not to
embark on a freeenergy study of the relative stability of
fluid fcc0013 and bcctype phases at such low pressures since this would require a numerical accuracy that
is beyond our capabilities to a first approximation the
boundary line between fcc0013 and say bcc1113
can be assumed to run at constant pressure for relating
data obtained at different pressures we have carried out
two further sequences of mc runs along the isothermal
paths for t   0002 solids and t   0015 fluid
the frenkelladd computation of the excess
helmholtz free energy per particle fex confirms that
the bcc0013 bcc1103 and bcc1113 solids
are nearly degenerate at low temperature we take
t   0002 p   005 as a reference state for the
calculation of solid free energies with the density
fixed at   008562d3 in every case corresponding
to p   005 we find fex  1444612 1444702
and 1444533 for the three above solids respectively
implying a weak preference for the bcc1113 phase
then using thermodynamic integration along the
t   0002 isotherm see eq 32 we have studied
the relative stability of the three solids as a function
of pressure up to p   020 the results depicted
in fig 2 suggest that bcc1113 is the stable phase
throughout the lowtemperature region the other solids
being very good solutions anyway with nearoptimal
chemical potentials

we then follow the thermal disordering of the bcctype solids for fixed pressure with three cases considered p   005 012 and 020 through sequences of
isothermalisobaric runs all starting from t   0002
with steps of 0001 any such sequence is stopped when
the values of potential energy and specific volume have
collapsed onto those of the fluid thus informing that the
ultimate bounds of solid stability are reached usually a
solid can hardly be overheated the stability thresholds
detected this way are fairly consistent with the indication coming from the df profiles which upon increasing temperature will eventually show a fluidlike appearance thermodynamic integration see eq 33 is used
to propagate the calculated  for t   0002 to higher
temperatures
as far as the nematic fluid is concerned we have
first generated a sequence of n p t simulation runs for
p   005 starting from t   0015 at this initial
point the excess chemical potential ex was estimated
by widoms insertion method obtaining ex  09865
it is worth noting that in a long simulation run of as
many as 5  104 mc sweeps at equilibrium the chemicalpotential value relaxed very soon with small fluctuations
around the average and no significant drift observed our
analysis of the fluid phase is completed by further simulation runs along the isobaric paths for p   012 and
020 for which we did not have the need to compute the
chemical potential again since this could be deduced from
the volume data along the t   0015 isotherm
chemicalpotential results along the three isobars on
which we focussed are reported in figs 3 to 5 as is clear
with increasing temperature the fluid eventually takes
over the solids among the solids the bcc1113 phase
is the preferred one for any temperature and pressure although the chemical potential of the other solid phases is
only slightly larger on increasing pressure the melting
temperature goes down like in the gaussiancore model
the necessity of a matching with the zerotemperature
melting point for p  0 will then imply reentrant melting in the gcn model too the maximum error on the
melting temperature tm  which we estimate to be about
0003 hence not that small entirely depends on the limited precision of the fluid ex  which then constitutes a
major source of error on tm 
the only conclusion we can draw from the above
chemicalpotential study is that bcc1113 is the most
stable solid phase of the system provided the pressure is
not too low however a closer look at the df profiles
obtained from the simulation of bcc1113 raises some
doubts about the absolute stability of this phase at intermediate temperatures whatever the pressure calling
for a different interpretation of the hitherto considered
as bcc1113 mc data take for instance the case of
p  005 upon increasing temperature while g keeps
strongly peaked all the way to melting the solidlike oscillations of gk undergo progressive damping until they

6
are washed out completely suggesting a secondorder
or very weak firstorder at the most transformation of
bcc1113 into a columnar phase before melting this
is illustrated in figs 6 and 7 where the dfs are plotted
for a number of temperatures a similar indication is got
from the behavior of the smectic op see fig 8 whose
highest maximum eventually deflates at practically the
same temperature t   0005 at which the oscillations
of gk disappear note that no appearance of a columnar
phase is seen during the simulation of either bcc1103
or bcc0013 nor in the simulation of fcc0013 for
p   001 a slice of the columnar phase is depicted in
fig 9 right panels in this phase columns of stacked
particles are arranged side by side tightly packed together so as to project a triangular solid on the xy plane
neighboring columns are not commensurate with each
other as implied by a completely featureless gk 
the probable reason for the instability of the smectic
phase in the gcn model is the absence of an ad hoc mechanism for lateral attraction between the molecules which
is present instead in the model of ref 14 by the way
hard ellipsoids do not show a smectic phase either 7 at
variance with long hard spherocylinders where particle
geometry alone proves sufficient to stabilize a periodic
modulation of the number density along  10
given the compelling evidence of a columnar phase
in the gcn model one may now ask whether the conclusions drawn from the chemicalpotential data are all
flawed in particular the  curves that are tagged as
bcc1113 in figs 3 to 5 would be meaningless beyond
a certain temperature tc  tm  in fact they are not ie
they retain full validity up to melting since the nearly
continuous character of the transition from bcc1113
to columnar allows one to safely continuate thermodynamic integration across the boundary with the proviso
that what previously treated as the bcc1113 chemical potential beyond tc is to be assigned instead to the
columnar phase
as pressure goes up the transition from bcc1113 to
columnar takes place at lower and lower temperatures
in order to exclude that the columnar phase too likewise the fluid will show reentrant behavior at low pressure we have simulated the disordering of a bcc1113
solid also for p   002 and 003 in fact no reentrance
of the columnar phase is observed further points on
the melting line for p  001 002 and 003 are fixed
through the behavior of g as a function of temperature
all in all the overall gcn phase diagram appears as
sketched in fig 10 this is similar to the phase portrait
of the gaussiancore model see fig 1 of ref 4 with
the obvious exception of the columnar phase there is a
small discrepancy between the melting points as located
through freeenergy calculations full dots in fig 10 and
those assessed from the evolution of g open dots in
our opinion this would mostly be attributed to the statistical error associated with the ex of the fluid in its

reference state notwithstanding their limited precision
however freeenergy calculations are all but useless in
identifying the structure of the solid phase in conclusion although some aspects of the equilibrium behavior
of the gcn model remain still uncertain especially with
regard to the exact location of the solidsolid transition
at low pressure we are confident that the main features
of the gcn phase diagram are correctly accounted for
by fig 10
summing up there are at least two conceivable and
mutually exclusive paths for the thermal disordering of
a liquidcrystal solid aside from a direct transformation
of it into a nematic phase one is through the formation of a smectic phase which eventually transforms into
a nematic fluid a second possibility is a more gradual
release of crystalline order by the appearance of a columnar phase as intermediate stage between the solid and the
nematic phase our study showed that it is this second
scenario that occurs in the gcn model with no evidence
whatsoever of a smectic phase

conclusions

we have introduced a liquidcrystal model of softlyrepulsive parallel ellipsoids named the gaussiancore nematic gcn model aiming at a complete characterization of its phase behavior including the solid sector this
requires a preliminary identification of all relevant solid
structures which is generally a farfromtrivial task to be
accomplished for model liquid crystals 16 through a
careful scrutiny of as many as eleven uniaxiallydeformed
cubic and hexagonal phases we obtained a thorough description of the t  0 equilibrium phase portrait of the
gcn model identifying its ground state at any given
pressure in doing so we discovered a rich and absolutely
unexpected structural degeneracy which is only lifted by
going to t  0 at low temperature and for not too
low pressures our freeenergy calculations indicate that a
gcn system with an aspect ratio of 3 is found in just one
solid phase ie a stretched bcc solid with the molecules
oriented along 111 only near zero pressure the stable
phase becomes a stretched fcc solid with increasing
temperature the bcctype solid first undergoes a weak
transition into a columnar phase which still retains partial crystalline order before melting completely into the
nematic fluid
it is worth emphasizing that our interest in the gcn
model is purely theoretical hardcore ellipsoids providing a more physically realistic model liquid crystal one
could even argue that a gaussian repulsion is highly irrealistic for a liquid crystal in real atomic systems superposition of particle cores is strongly obstructed whence
the consideration of hardcore or steep inversepower repulsion in the more popular models however unless the
system density is very high higher than considered in

7
our study repulsive gaussian particles would effectively
be blind to an inner hard core which thus may or may
not exist as evidenced eg in the snapshots of fig 9
where particles appear well spaced out
the gcn model is a deformation of stillingers
gaussiancore model well known for exhibiting a
reentrantmelting transition various instances of reentrant behavior are also known for nematics 17 and indeed one of the original motivations for the present work
was searching for a new kind of reentrance ie reappearance of a more disordered phase with increasing
pressure with this study we provide yet another example of reentrant behavior in a model nematic while this
is nothing but the analog of fluidphase reentrance in the
gaussiancore model the absolute novelty of our findings
is in the nature of the intermediate phase this being surprisingly columnar in a range of pressures rather than
genuinely solid

after completion of this paper we became aware of
the discovery reported in p pfleiderer and t schilling
condmat0612151 of a new stable crystal phase in
freelystanding hard ellipsoids this further demonstrates
that the solid structure of liquid crystals is generally difficult to anticipate even when the model system is the
simplest as possible
the first example of such behavior was discovered by
p e cladis phys rev lett 35 48 1975 see also

fig 1 t  0 equilibrium behavior of the gcn model with
ld  3 left t  0 chemical potential p   of various crystals relative to bcc1103 which thus serves as
the zero or reference level the reduced pressure p  is incremented by steps of 001 note that for all p  the five
crystals fcc001212 bcc0013 bcc1103 bcc1113
and sc11115 are degenerate   0 other data points
are for fcc001 continuous line   3 for p   001 being   212 otherwise fcc1103 and fcc1113 dotted
line hcp111 open dots sh111 open squares sc0013
and sc1103 dashed line right resulting equation of
state in the pressure range from 0 to 030 fcc0013 open
triangle is stable at very low pressure up to slightly less
than 002 while fcc001212 bcc0013 etc open dots
prevail for higher pressures

fig 2 gcn model with ld  3 chemicalpotential results
for t   0002 in the picture we plot the reduced chemical
potential of the three t  0 degenerate structures that exist
for not too low pressure taking bcc1113 for reference the
latter phase gives the most stable solid for any p in the range
from 005 to 020 and most likely even further the 
curves are obtained by thermodynamic integration of volume
mc data using as initial conditions those specified by the
frenkelladd calculations that were carried out at p   005
though the reported  values for the bcctype solids are very
close to each other and also affected by some numerical noise
the higher stability of bcc1113 cannot be truly called into
question  a regular pattern is clearly seen behind each curve

results for p   005 chemical potential of the fluid
phase dotted line as compared with those of the competing
solid phases for that pressure bcc0013 longdashed line
bcc1103 dashed line bcc1113 continuous line while
the bcc1113 solid is stable at low temperature the fluid
phase overcomes it in stability for higher temperatures this
is more clearly seen in the inset where chemicalpotential
differences are reported taking the fluid  for reference the
melting temperature for p   005 which is where the continuous line crosses zero is estimated to be t   00073

fig 4 gcn model with ld  3 chemicalpotential results
for p   012 same notation as in fig 3 except for the
absence of data for bcc0013 which were not computed
despite this a look at the results in figs 2 and 3 give us
confidence that the chemical potential of bcc0013 will be
closer to that of bcc1103 than is for p   005

fig 5 gcn model with ld  3 chemicalpotential results
for p   020 same notation as in figs 3 and 4

fig 6 gcn model with ld  3 distribution functions of
bcc1113 for p   005 left t   0002 right t  
0003 the strenght of crystalline order along  as measured
by the amplitude of gk oscillations reduces with increasing
temperature until complete disorder is left above t   0005
see next fig 7 considering that the crystallinity within
the xy plane persists well beyond t   0005 the spatial
modulation of g remains solidlike beyond this temperature
and up to melting we conclude that the gcn system is found
in a columnar phase for 0005  t  tm

of bcc1113 for p   005 left t   0004 right
t   0005

fig 8 gcn model with ld  3 smectic order parameter   of bcc1113 for p   005 the behavior of  
faithfully reproduces that seen for gk z cf figs 6 and 7
the deflating of the highest   maximum with increasing
temperature closely follows the thermal damping of gk z oscillations

fig 9 gcn model with ld  3 some snapshots of the
particle configuration taken at low temperature t   0002
bcc1113 solid phase and at intermediate temperature
t   0006 columnar phase the reduced pressure is
p   005 in both cases above side view ie projection
of particle coordinates onto the xz plane below top view
ie projection of particle coordinates onto the xy plane for
clarity in spite of their mutual interaction being soft the particles are given sharp ellipsoidal boundaries corresponding to
a unitary short axis d and a long axis of l  3d while the
crystalline order along z is lost already at t   0005 hence
it is there in the topleft panel while it is absent in the topright panel the triangular order within the xy plane is maintained up to the melting temperature here tm  00073

fig 10 gcn model with ld  3 sketch of the phase
diagram on the t p plane the full dots mark the location
of the melting transition as extracted from our freeenergy
calculations open symbols refer instead to the transition
thresholds as given by a visual inspection of the df profiles
though the latter meltingpoint estimates are more easily obtained than the former the freeenergy study was essential to
identify the correct solid structure of the gcn model at not
too low pressure to help the eye tentative phase boundaries are drawn as continuous ie firstorder and dashed
nearly secondorder lines through the transition points in
the lowpressure region the solidsolid boundary is highly hypothetical since we have no data there
