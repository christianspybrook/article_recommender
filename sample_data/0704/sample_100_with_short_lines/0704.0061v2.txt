intersection bodies and generalized
cosine transforms
boris rubin
abstract intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of
geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking radon transforms generalized cosine transforms and the
relevant fourier analysis the main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the
context of their application to investigation of a certain family of
intersection bodies which we call intersection bodies the latter
include kintersection bodies in the sense of a koldobsky and
unit balls of finitedimensional subspaces of lp spaces in particular we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of
the spherical radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integralgeometric structure we apply this
result to the study of sections of intersection bodies new characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are
given we also review some known facts and give them new proofs

1 introduction
this is an updated and extended version of our previous preprint
r5
intersection bodies interact with radon transforms and encompass
diverse classes of geometric objects associated to sections of star bodies
the concept of intersection body was introduced in the remarkable
paper by lutwak lu and led to a breakthrough in the solution of the
longstanding busemannpetty problem see g k4 lu z2 for
references and historical notes
we remind some known facts that will be needed in the following
an originsymmetric os star body in rn  n  2 is a compact set
k with nonempty interior such that tk  k t  0 1 k  k
and the radial function k   sup  0    k is continuous
on the unit sphere s n1  in the following kn denotes the set of all
os star bodies in rn  gni is the grassmann manifold of idimensional
linear subspaces of rn  and voli  denotes the idimensional volume
function the minkowski functional of a body k  kn is defined by
n1

definition 11 lu a body k  kn is an intersection body of a body
l  kn if k   voln1 l    for every   s n1  where  is the
central hyperplane orthogonal to 
by taking into account that voln1 l    in definition 11 is a
constant multiple of the minkowskifunk transform

goodey lutwak and weil glw generalized definition 11 as follows
definition 12 a body k  kn is an intersection body if k  m
for some even nonnegative finite borel measure  on s n1 
a sequence of bodies kj  kn is said to be convergent to k  kn
in the radial metric if lim kj  k cs n1   0

proposition 13 the class of intersection bodies is the closure of the
class of intersection bodies of star bodies in the radial metric
proposition 14 if k is an intersection body in rn  n  2 then for
every i  2 3     n  1 and every   gni  k   is an intersection
body in 
regarding these two important propositions see fgw gw and
a nice historical survey in g

different generalizations of the concept of intersection body associated to lower dimensional sections were suggested in the literature see
eg k4 rz z1 the following one which plays an important role
in the study of the lower dimensional busemannpetty problem is due
to zhang z1
definition 15 we say that a body k  kn belongs to zhangs class
zin if there is a nonnegative finite borel measure m on the grassmann
ni
manifold gni such that k
 ri m where ri is the dual spherical
radon transform see 22 25
another generalization was suggested by koldobsky k2 and described in detail in k4 this class of bodies will be our main concern
definition 16 k4 p 71 a body k  kn is a kintersection body
of a body l  kn we write k  ibk l if
volk k    volnk l    

11

  gnk 

we denote by ibkn the set of all bodies k  kn satisfying 11 for
some l  kn 
when k  1 this definition coincides with definition 11 up to a
constant multiple an analog of definition 12 was given in the fourier
analytic terms as follows
definition 17 k4 definition 47 a body k  kn is a kintersection
body if there is a nonnegative finite borel measure  on s n1  so that
for every schwartz function

where  denotes the fourier transform of 
the set of all kintersection bodies in rn will be denoted by ikn 
keeping in mind proposition 13 for k  1 one can alternatively
define the class ikn as a closure of ibkn in the radial metric cf mi1
p 532 however to apply results from k4 to such class equivalence
of this definition to definition 17 must be proved we will do this in
the more general situation in section 52
from definitions 16 and 17 it is not clear for which bodies l  kn
the relevant kintersection body k  ibk l does exist it is also not
obvious which bodies actually constitute the class ikn  the following
important characterization is due to koldobsky

boris rubin

theorem 18 k4 theorem 48 a body k  kn is a kintersection
body if and only if   k
k represents a positive definite tempered dis
tribution on rn  that is the fourier transform   k
k  is a positive
tempered distribution on rn 
the concept of kintersection body is related to another important
development for k  kn  the quasinormed space rn    k  is said
to be isometrically embedded in lp  p  0 if there is a linear operator
t  rn  lp 0 1 so that xk  t xlp 01 
theorem 19 k4 theorem 610 the space rn    k  embeds isometrically in lp  p  0 p 6 2 4     if and only if p2  pk 
is a positive distribution on rn  0
following theorems 19 and 18 one can formally say that k  ikn if
and only if rn    k  embeds isometrically in lk  this observation
combined with definition 17 was used by a koldobsky to define the
concept of isometric embedding in lp  for negative p
definition 110 k4 definition 614 let 0  p  n k  kn  the
space rn    k  is said to be isometrically embedded in lp if there
is a nonnegative finite borel measure  on s n1  so that for every

where  denotes the fourier transform of 
originsymmetric bodies k in this definition can be regarded as unit
balls of ndimensional subspaces of lp  comparing definitions 110
and 17 one might call these bodies pintersection bodies since the
meaning of the space lp itself is not specified in definition 110 and
since our paper is mostly focused on geometric properties of bodies
rather than embeddings in lp  in the following we prefer to adopt
another name intersection body where  is a real number that
will be specified in due course we denote the set of all intersection
bodies in rn by in 
contents of the paper we will focus on intimate connection
between intersection bodies spherical radon transforms and generalized cosine transforms see definitions in section 22 this approach
is motivated by the fact that the volume of a central cross section of
a star body is expressed through the spherical radon transform and
the latter is a member of the analytic family of the generalized cosine
transforms these transforms were introduced by semyanistyi se and

intersection bodies

arise up to naming and normalization in different contexts of analysis
and geometry see eg k4 r1rz sa2 sa3 str1 str2
sections 24 provide analytic background for geometric considerations in sections 57 in section 2 we establish our notation and define
the generalized cosine transforms on the sphere and the relevant dual
transforms on grassmann manifolds in section 3 we present basic
properties of these transforms establish new relations between spherical radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms and prove
restriction theorems which are akin to trace theorems in sobolev
spaces section 4 deals with positive definite homogeneous distributions that can be characterized in terms of the generalized cosine
transforms this section serves as a preparation for the forthcoming
definition of the concept of intersection body we investigate which
s are appropriate and why in section 5 we switch to geometry and
define the class in of intersection bodies the case 0    n corresponds to the unit balls of lp spaces in the spirit of definition
110 the reader will find in this section new proofs of some known
facts we introduce the notion of intersection body of a star body
in rn  which extends definition 16 to all   n  6 0 the class
of all such bodies will be denoted by ibn  we will prove that for
all   n  6 0 2 4     the class in is the closure of ibn in
the radial metric the case   1 gives proposition 13 it will be
proved that all mdimensional central sections of intersection bodies are intersection bodies in the corresponding mplanes provided
  m  6 0
the natural question arises how to construct intersection bodies
in section 6 we give a series of examples some of them are known and
some are new they can be obtained by utilizing auxiliary statements
from section 3 in particular the famous embedding of zhangs class
n
znk
into ikn  which was first established in k3 and studied in mi1
mi2 will be generalized to the case when k is replaced by any  
0 n section 7 is devoted to the so called q lballs defined by
n
bql

q  0

we show that if 0  q  2 then bql
 in for all   0 n if
n
 in  if q  2 and
q  2 and n  3    n we still have bql
n
0    0  maxn  l l  2 then bql 6 in  the case when
q  2 l  1 and 0    n  3 represents an open problem
in section 8 we remind the generalized busemannpetty problem
gbp for idimensional central sections of os convex bodies in rn 
this challenging problem is still open for i  2 and i  3 n  5
it actually inspires the whole investigation using properties of the

6

boris rubin

generalized cosine transforms we give a short direct proof of the fact
that an affirmative answer to gbp implies that every smooth os convex body in rn with positive curvature is an n  iintersection body
this fact was discovered by a koldobsky the original proof in k3
n
is based on the embedding ini
 zin and zhangs result z1 theorem
6 the latter heavily relies on the hahnbanach separation theorem
our proof is more constructive and almost selfcontained we conclude
the paper by appendix which is added for convenience of the reader
the list of references at the end of the paper is far from being complete further references can be found in cited books and papers

of functions on lower dimensional subspaces and are well known for instance in the theory of function spaces to the best of our knowledge

proof for re   1 the statement is a particular case of theorem
39 set k  1 for other values of  the result follows by analytic
continuation


remark 311 the restriction  6 0 2 4    in theorems 39 and
310 is caused by the gamma function 2 in the numerator of the
corresponding normalizing factor it is evident from the proof that
both theorems remain true also for   2l l  n if we remove the
normalizing factor then m 1 in theorem 310 will be substituted
for m 12l  see 211
we will need the following generalization of theorem 310
theorem 312 let f  ce s n1    me s n1  and let   gnm 
1  m  n suppose that f  m 1  if   m  6 2l l  n and
f  m 12l  if   2l
i there is a measure   me s n1   such that the restriction of
f onto s n1   is represented as f  ms1
n1  
n1
ii if d  gd g  ce s  then i holds with d 
t gd where t g has the form 320
iii if   2l l  n then i and ii hold with ms1
n1  substituted
12l
for ms n1  
proof step 1 let first   m  6 0 2 4     we invoke the
poisson integral 21 so that
t f  t m 1   m 1 gt 

gt  t   de s n1 

t  0 1

since f is continuous then t f converges to f as t  0 uniformly
on s n1  and therefore uniformly on s n1   hence for any test
function   ds n1   owing to theorem 310 we have
f   limt f   limm 1 gt

ms1m
n1   and conclude that the limit limt   is welldefined for every
t0

  de s n1  since t  t t  is an even function and the generic
test function   ds n1   can be represented as     where
 are even and odd respectively it follows that the limit limt   
t0

limt    is welldefined for every   ds n1   not only for even
t0

 as stated above since d  s n1   is weakly complete there is an
even distribution  in d  s n1   so that
  ds n1  

   limt  
t0

furthermore since t    t t   is nonnegative for every nonnegative   ds n1   and every t  0 1 then  is a positive
distribution and by theorem 91  is a measure in me s n1  
1
thus by 323 f   limt  ms1
n1     ms n1   which
t0

means that f  ms1
n1   as desired
if d  gd g  ce s n1  then t  t t g tends to t g uniformly on s n1  as t  0 hence by 323 f   t g ms1
n1

which means f  ms n1  t g

4 positive definite homogeneous distributions
we remind some known facts see eg gs le let srn  be the
schwartz space of rapidly decreasing c  functions on rn and s  rn 
its dual the fourier transform of f  s  rn  is defined by
z
n
hf  i  2 hf i y 
x eixy dx   srn 
rn

a distribution f  s  rn  is homogeneous of degree   c if for any
  srn  and any a  0 hf xai  an hf i homogeneous distributions on rn are intimately connected with distributions on s n1 
let first f  l1 s n1  e f x  x f xx x  rn  0 the
operator e generates a meromorphic s  distribution
z 
z
n1
he f i  ac
r
urdr ur 
f rd
s n1

0

where ac denotes analytic continuation in the variable the distribution e f is regular if re   n and admits simple poles at
  n n  1    the above definition extends to all distributions
f  d  s n1  by the formula
z 
he f i  ac
r n1urdr ur  f r 1
0



and the map e  d s n1  s  rn  is weakly continuous if f
is orthogonal to all spherical harmonics of degree j then the derivative uj r equals zero at r  0 and the pole at   n  j is
removable in particular if f is an even distribution ie f  
f         ds n1 then the only possible poles
of e f are n n  2 n  4    
the fourier transform of homogeneous distributions was extensively
studied by many authors see sa3 and references therein we restrict
our consideration to even distributions when the operator family m  
defined by 29 naturally arises thanks to the formula
e1n f   21  n2 e1 m  f

41

this formula amounts to semyanistyi se if f  de s n1  then 41
holds pointwise for 0  re   1 see eg lemma 33 in r1  and
extends in the s  sense to all   c satisfying

and s

and on different notations h i and   are used for distributions on rn
 respectively

n1

intersection bodies

19

since de s n1 is dense in de s n1 and the maps e1n and e1
are weakly continuous from de s n1  to s  rn  then 41 extends to
all f  de s n1 
regarding the cases excluded in 42 we note that if   1  2l for
some l  0 1    then 41 is meaningful if and only if f is orthogonal
to all spherical harmonics of degree 2l if   1  n  2l for some
l  0
p1    then according to the spherical harmonic decomposition

where  is the laplace operator   1      n  and 
is the delta function it is worth noting that for   1 3 5    the
distribution e1n f  can also be understood in the regularized sense
without any orthogonality assumptions however such regularization
does not preserve homogeneity see sa1 sa3
our main concern is positivity and positive definiteness of even homogeneous distributions the reader is referred to gv for the general
theory a distribution f  s  rn  is positive if hf i  0 for all nonnegative   srn  a similar definition holds for distributions on the
sphere and on rn  0 a distribution f  s  rn  is positive definite
if f is positive for our purposes it is important to know which even
homogeneous distributions are positive definite let us rewrite 41
and 42 with 1  n   replaced by  we have

although in was called the set of bodies the definition of this set
is purely analytic and extra work is needed to understand what bodies
if any actually constitute the class in 
the following comments will be helpful
1 the case   n is not so interesting because by theorem 51c
in is either empty if n  2  0 or coincides with the whole
class kn if n  2  0
2 the case   0 n agrees with the concept of isometric embedding of the space rn    k  into lp  p   see introduction in the
framework of this concept all bodies k  in can be regarded as unit
balls of ndimensional subspaces of l

for some   me s n1  this is the well known lvy representation
characterizing isometric embedding of the space rn    k  into lp

theorem 19 keeping this terminology we can state the following
proposition 53 let p  n p 6 0 then rn    k  embeds

isometrically in lp if and only if k  ip

4 if   k  1 2     n  1 then in  ikn coincides with the class
of kintersection bodies see definition 17 and theorem 18 theorems
51 and 52 provide new characterizations of this class
these comments inspire the following
definition 54 let   n  6 0 a body k  kn is said to be a
intersection body if k  in  or in other words if there is a measure
  me s n1  such that s k  m 1  if  6 2l l  n and

remark 59 if   2 4     we cannot prove the coincidence of

6 examples of intersection bodies
the definition of the classes in and ibn and all known characterizations are purely analytic unlike the case   1 when an intersection
body of a star body is explicitly defined by a simple geometric procedure it is not clear how can we construct intersection bodies in the
general case below we give some examples when the radial function
of a intersection body can be explicitly determined these examples
utilize the generalized cosine transforms
example 61 let   1  6 0 this case is the simplest indeed
given a nonnegative measure  on s n1  the relevant intersection

this fact with  replaced by p is a reformulation of theorem 617
from k4 which was stated in the language of isometric embeddings
and relies on the p lvy characterization see also lemma 64 and
theorem 411 in k4
example 62 if n  3    n   0 then in includes all originsymmetric convex bodies in rn 
this fact is due to koldobsky k4 corollary 49 it can be proved
using a slight modification of the argument from r3 sec 7 as follows
by theorem 51 c it suffices to check that for any os convex body
k m 1n k  me s n1  for   n  1 this is obvious to handle
the case n  3    n  1 suppose first that k is infinitely smooth
using polar coordinates for re   0 we can write

then
can be realized as analytic continuation ac at

aku t  voln1 k tuu  taking analytic continuation see gs
chapter 1 for 2    0 which is equivalent to n  3    n  1
we get

t1 aku t  aku 0 dt

similarly aci at   2 which corresponds to   n  3 is
c2 aku 0 following gs one can easily check that constants c1 and
c2 are negative since k is convex both analytic continuations are
positive and therefore m 1n k  0 if k is an arbitrary os convex
body we approximate it in the radial metric by smooth os convex
bodies kj  then for any test function   d s n1  by the previous
step we have

hence by theorem 91 m 1n k is a nonnegative measure and the
proof is complete

by definition 54 this gives the result the particular case   i
n
implies the embedding into iin of the zhangs class zni
 see definition

n
see also mi2 where it is proved that zni
is a proper subset of iin if
2  i  n  2

example 64 if 0  i  12    i  n and k  m i  for some
  m s n1  then k  in 
indeed by lemma 34 with   i     1   k  m i  
m 1 ai1  where ai1 is an integral operator which preserves
positivity provided i    1    1  n i    1    2 this
is just our case
example 65 one can construct bodies k  in from bodies l  in

by the formula k  l provided 0      n
indeed by definition 54 there is a measure   m s n1  so that
l  m 1  then by lemma 34 with   1     1  
k  l  m 1   m 1 a11  and we are done this example
generalizes the corresponding result from mi1 p 533 statement c

both statements are due to koldobsky the first one follows from
the fact that for 0  q  2 the fourier transform of x
q is a positive

s distribution see lemmas 36 and 227 in k4 the second statement is a reformulation of theorem 413 from k4 the if part is a
consequence of example 62

consideration let

the function ql  is uniformly continuous on rl and vanishes at

it is known see eg sw that

our next concern is the behavior of ql  when    if q
q

following
lemma 72 for any q  0
75

lim lq ql   2lq  l21 1  q2l  q2 sinq2



proof for l  1 this statement can be found in ps chapter 3 problem 154 and in k4 p 45 in the general case the proof is more
sophisticated and relies on the properties of bessel functions by the
wellknown formula for the fourier transform of a radial function see
eg sw we write ql   i where

now we can proceed to studying q lballs bql

n
an intimate connection between geometric properties of the balls bql
and the fourier transform of the power function   pql the case q  2
is wellknown and associated with riesz potentials see eg st the
relevant case of lnq balls which agrees with l  1 was considered in

theorem 74 if 0  q  2 0  l  n then bql
is a intersection
body for any 0    n

proof owing to lemma 71 the function 78 with p replaced by 
is positive and therefore by lemma 73   
ql represents a positive
definite distribution now the result follows by theorem 51

n
consider the case q  2 in this case bql
is convex and owing to
n
n
example 62 bql  i for all n  3    n what about   n  3
this case is especially intriguing

proposition 75 if q  2 and 0    maxn  l l  2 then   ql
n
is not a positive definite distribution and therefore bql

proof let 0    n  l  2 and suppose the contrary that bql

consider the section of bql

ren  r  by theorem 512 bql
   inl1 in  and therefore

xn en  x ql  xn q  x q q

is a positive definite distribution in  by the second derivative text see
k4 theorem 419 this is impossible if 0    n  l  2 a similar
contradiction can be obtained if we assume 0    l  2 and consider
n
the section of bql
by the l  1dimensional plane re1  rl 

proposition 75 can be proved without using the second derivative
text and theorem 512 on sections of intersection bodies see r4
the bounds for  appear to be the same

volumes
for 1  i  n let voli  denote the idimensional volume function
suppose that i is fixed and let a and b be os convex bodies in rn
satisfying
81

voli a    voli b     gni 

does it follow that
82

voln a  voln b 

this question is known as the generalized busemannpetty problem
gbp see g rz z1
theorem 81 if gbp 8182 has an affirmative answer then
every smooth originsymmetric convex body with positive curvature in
rn is an n  iintersection body
proof suppose that b is an os convex body in rn so that the radial
function b is infinitely smooth the boundary of b has a positive curvan
ture and b 
 ini
 by definition 54 there is a function   de s n1 
which is negative on some open originsymmetric set   s n1 and
ni
such that b
 m 1in  we choose a function h  de s n1  so
that h 6 0 h  0 if    and h  0 otherwise define an os
smooth body a by ia  ib  m 1i h   0 if  is small enough
0
then a is convex since by 312 ri m 1i h  c rni
h  0 then
i
i
ri a  ri b  which gives 81 on the other hand by 35

or b
 b   b
 a  by hlders inequality this implies voln b 
voln a which contradicts 82


remark 82 as we noted in introduction theorem 81 is not new and
its proof given in k3 relies on a sequence of deep facts from functional
analysis the proof presented above is much more elementary and
constructive for instance it allows us to keep invariance properties of
the bodies under control this advantage was essentially used in our
paper r4
theorem 81 and proposition 75 imply the following
n
corollary 83 let 1  l  n2 i  l  2 b  b4l
see 71 then
n
there is a smooth os convex body a in r so that 81 holds but 82
fails

boris rubin

setting l  1 in this statement we obtain the wellknown bourgainzhang theorem which states that gbp has a negative answer when
3  i  n see bz k4 rz on this subject for i  2 and i  3
n  5 the gbp is still open an affirmative answer in these cases
was obtained in r4 for bodies having a certain additional symmetry
9 appendix
every positive distribution f  rs  rn  is given by a tempered nonnegative measure  ie hf i  xdx see eg gv p147
for convenience of the reader we present a similar fact for the sphere
theorem 91 a distribution f  d  s n1  is positive if and only if
there is a measure   m s n1  such that
z
f  
d
  ds n1
s n1

proof this statement is known however we could not find precise reference and decided to give a proof for convenience of the reader the
if part is obvious to prove the  only if part we write a test function   ds n1 as a sum   1 i2  where 1  re  2  im 
since cs n1   j  cs n1  j  1 2 and f is positive then
f 1 cs n1  f j   f 1 cs n1 

and therefore f   f 1   f 2   2f 1 cs n1  since
ds n1 is dense in cs n1  then f extends as a linear continuous
functional f  on cs n1  and by the rriesz theorem there is a measure  on s n1 such that f    s n1 d for every  
r
    n1 d for every
cs n1 in particular f   f
s
  ds n1  by taking into account that every nonnegative function
  cs n1  can be uniformly approximated by nonnegative functions
k  ds n1 for instance by poisson integrals of  we get
z
z
k d  lim f k   0
d  lim

the latter means that  is nonnegative
