there has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons in the past several
years we study the strong decays of the swave pwave dwave and radially excited charmed
baryons using the 3 p0 model after comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with
the available data we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed
baryons observed recently

introduction

babar and belle collaborations observed several excited charmed baryons
c 2880 2940
c 2980 30770 and c 27680 last year 1 2 3 4 5
which inspired several investigations of these states
in literature 6 7 8 9 we collect the experimental
information of these recently observed hadrons in table
i their quantum numbers have not been determined
except c 2880  in order to understand their structures using the present experimental information we
study the strong decay pattern of the excited charmed
baryons systematically in this work in the past decades
there has been some research work on heavy baryons

8 11 12
the quantum numbers and decay widths of swave and
some pwave charmed baryons are known 13 we first
systematically analyze their strong decays in the framework of the 3 p0 strong decay model accordingly one
can extract the parameters and estimate the accuracy of
the 3 p0 model when its applied in the charmed baryon
system then we go one step further and extend the
same formalism to study the decay patterns of these new
charmed baryons c 2880 2940 2980 30770 under different assignments of their quantum numbers after comparing the theoretical results with the available
experimental data we can learn their favorable quantum
numbers and assignments in the quark model

in fig 2 we introduce our notations and conventions
for the pwave charmed baryons l is the orbital angular
momentum between the two light quarks while l denotes
the orbital angular momentum between the charm quark
and the two light quark system we use the prime to
label the cjl baryons in the 6f representation and the
tilde to discriminate the baryons with l  1 from that
with l  1
the notation for dwave charmed baryons is more
complicated see fig 3 besides the prime l and l

the notations and conventions of
charmed baryon

we first introduce our notations for the excited
charmed baryons inside a charmed baryon there are one
charm quark and two light quarks u d or s it belongs
to either the symmetric 6f or antisymmetric 3f flavor
representation see fig 1 for the swave charmed
baryons the total colorflavorspin wave function and
color wave function must be symmetric and antisymmetric respectively hence the spin of the two light quarks
is s1 for 6f or s0 for 3f  the angular momentum

and parity of the swave charmed baryons are j p  21


or 32 for 6f and j p  21 for 3f  the names of swave
charmed baryons are listed in fig 1 where we use the

star to denote 32 baryons and the prime to denote the

j p  21 baryons in the 6f representation

the 3 p0 model

the 3 p0 model was first proposed by micu 20 and
further developed by yaouanc et al later 21 22 23
now this model is widely used to study the strong decays
of hadrons 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
according to this model a pair of quarks with j p c 

0
is created from the vacuum when a hadron decays
which is shown in fig 4 for the baryon decay process
a  b  c the new q q pair created from the vacuum
together with the qqq within the the initial baryon regroup into the outgoing meson and baryon via the quark
rearrangement process in the nonrelativistic limit the
transition operator is written as

the decay widths of charmed baryons from the 3 p0
model involve several parameters the strength of quark
pair creation from vacuum  the r value in the harmonic
oscillator wave function of meson and the  in the
baryon wave functions we follow the convention of ref
34 and take   134 which is considered as a universal
parameter in the 3 p0 model the r value of  and k

the d meson 35     05 gev for the proton and
 31 for swave charmed baryons the parameters

fixed to reproduce the mass splitting through the contact
term in the potential model 33 their values are

discussion and conclusion

at present it is still too difficult to calculate the strong
decay widths of hadrons from the first principles of qcd
for this purpose some phenomenological strong decay
models were proposed such as the 3 p0 model flux tube
model qcd sum rule lattice qcd etc among which
only the first two approaches can be applied to the strong
decays of excited hadrons to a large extent the predictions from the 3 p0 and flux tube models roughly agree
with each other

the 3 p0 model possesses inherent uncertainties 21 29
34 in certain cases the result from the 3 p0 model may
be a factor of 2  3 off the experimental width the uncertainty source of the 3 p0 model arises from the strength
of the quark pair creation from the vacuum  the approximation of nonrelativity and assuming the simple harmonic oscillator radial wave functions for the hadrons
even with the above uncertainty the 3 p0 model is still
the most systematic effective and widely used framework
to study the hadron strong decays
in this work we have calculated the strong decay
widths of charmed baryons using the 3 p0 model our
numerical results do not strongly depend on the parameters  and  as shown in figs 5 6 and 7 thus the
following qualitative features and conclusions remain essentially unchanged with reasonable variations of  and

observed by cdf collaboration recently the numerical
results are consistent with the experimental values too
the decay width of pwave baryon 
c 2593 is three
times larger than the experimental value with the
large experimental uncertainty and the inherent theoretical uncertainty of the the 3 p0 model such a
deviation is still acceptable the decay widths of
0

c 2625 and c 2790 2815 are compatible with the
experimental upper bound by comparing our results
with the experimental total width we tend to exclude

the c0  12  assignment for 
since the
c 2800


c 2800 is observed in 

channel
37
there are
c


only two assignments left for c 2800 ie c2  32 

or c2  25  more experimental information such as the
ratio

will be helpful in the deter

mination of the quantum number of 
c 2800
we have also calculated the strong decay widths of
newly observed c 2880 2940 2980 30770 assuming they are candidates of dwave charmed baryons
we find that the only possible assignment of c 2880 is

2c3  52  after considering both its total decay width and
the ratio c   c    which agrees very well with
the indication from belle experiment that c 2880 fa
vors j p  25 by the analysis of the angular distribution
2
unfortunately the experiment information about the
c 2940  2980 30770 is scarce at present from
their calculated decay widths we can only exclude some
assignments which are marked with crosses in tables
vii viii and ix the decay width ratios of c 2940
2980 30770 from the 3 p0 model will be useful in
the identification of their quantum numbers in the future since the inherent uncertainty cancels largely
we have also discussed the strong decays of
2980 30770 assuming they are radial excitations
unfortunately the numerical results in fig 8 depend
quite strongly on the node of the spatial wave function
which is related to the parameters of the harmonic oscillator wave functions as shown in fig 8 we are unable
to make strong conclusions here
