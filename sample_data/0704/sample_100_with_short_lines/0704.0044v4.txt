abstract
this paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas it
is motivated by observations of electromagnetic and density fluctuations in the solar wind interstellar medium
and galaxy clusters as well as by models of particle heating in accretion disks all of these plasmas and many
others have turbulent motions at weakly collisional and collisionless scales the paper focuses on turbulence in
a strong mean magnetic field the key assumptions are that the turbulent fluctuations are small compared to the
mean field spatially anisotropic with respect to it and that their frequency is low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency the turbulence is assumed to be forced at some systemspecific outer scale the energy injected at
this scale has to be dissipated into heat which ultimately cannot be accomplished without collisions a kinetic
cascade develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity the nature of the
kinetic cascade in various scale ranges depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations that exist there there are
four special scales that separate physically distinct regimes the electron and ion gyroscales the mean free path
and the electron diffusion scale in each of the scale ranges separated by these scales the fully kinetic problem
is systematically reduced to a more physically transparent and computationally tractable system of equations
which are derived in a rigorous way in the inertial range above the ion gyroscale the kinetic cascade
separates into two parts a cascade of alfvnic fluctuations and a passive cascade of density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations the former are governed by the reduced magnetohydrodynamic rmhd equations at
both the collisional and collisionless scales the latter obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field
lines associated with the alfvnic component in the collisional limit these compressive fluctuations become
the slow and entropy modes of the conventional mhd in the dissipation range below ion gyroscale there
are again two cascades the kineticalfvnwave kaw cascade governed by two fluidlike electron reduced
magnetohydrodynamic ermhd equations and a passive cascade of ion entropy fluctuations both in space
and velocity the latter cascade brings the energy of the inertialrange fluctuations that was landaudamped at
the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating the kaw energy is similarly
damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat kolmogorovstyle scaling relations are
derived for all of these cascades the relationship between the theoretical models proposed in this paper and
astrophysical applications and observations is discussed in detail

1 introduction

as observations of velocity density and magnetic fields in
astrophysical plasmas probe ever smaller scales turbulence
ie broadband disordered fluctuations usually characterized
by powerlaw energy spectraemerges as a fundamental and
ubiquitous feature
one of the earliest examples of observed turbulence in
space was the detection of a kolmogorov k53 spectrum
of magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind over a frequency range of about three decades first reported by
matthaeus  goldstein 1982 bavassano et al 1982 and confirmed to a high degree of accuracy by a multitude of subseelectronic address aschekochihin1physicsoxacuk

quent observations eg marsch  tu 1990a horbury et al
1996 leamon et al 1998 bale et al 2005 see fig 1 another famous example in which the kolmogorov power law
appears to hold is the electron density spectrum in the interstellar medium ismin this case it emerges from observations by various methods in several scale intervals and when
these are pieced together the power law famously extends
over as many as 12 decades of scales armstrong et al 1981
1995 lazio et al 2004 a record that has earned it the name
of the great power law in the sky numerous other measurements in space and astrophysical plasmas from the magnetosphere to galaxy clusters result in kolmogorov or consistent with kolmogorov spectra but also show steeper power
laws at very small microphysical scales these observations
are discussed in more detail in  8
powerlaw spectra spanning broad bands of scales are
symptomatic of the fundamental role of turbulence as a mechanism of transferring energy from the outer scales henceforth denoted l where the energy is injected to the inner
scales where it is dissipated as these scales tend to be
widely separated in astrophysical systems one way for the
system to bridge this scale gap is to fill it with fluctuations the
powerlaw spectra then arise due to scale invariance at the intermediate scales besides being one of the more easily measurable characteristics of the multiscale nature of turbulence

schekochihin et al

powerlaw and particularly kolmogorov spectra evoke a
number of fundamental physical ideas that lie at the heart of
the turbulence theory universality of smallscale physics energy cascade locality of interactions etc in this paper we
shall revisit and generalize these ideas for the problem of kinetic plasma turbulence8 so it is perhaps useful to remind the
reader how they emerge in a standard argument that leads to
the k53 spectrum kolmogorov 1941 obukhov 1941
11 kolmogorov turbulence

suppose the average energy per unit time per unit volume
that the system dissipates is  this energy has to be transferred from some large outer scale l at which it is injected
to some small inner scales at which the dissipation occurs
see  15 it is assumed that in the range of scales intermediate between the outer and the inner the inertial range the
statistical properties of the turbulence are universal independent of the macrophysics of injection or of the microphysics
of dissipation spatially homogeneous and isotropic and the
energy transfer is local in scale space the flux of kinetic energy through any inertialrange scale  is independent of 
u2
   const

where the constant density of the medium is absorbed into
 u is the typical velocity fluctuation associated with the
scale  and  is the cascade time9 since interactions are
assumed local  must be expressed in terms of quantities
associated with scale  it is then dimensionally inevitable
that   u the nonlinear interaction time or turnover
time so we get
u  13 

2

this corresponds to a k53 spectrum of kinetic energy
12 mhd turbulence and critical balance
that astronomical data appear to point to a ubiquitous nature of what in its origin is a dimensional result for the turbulence in a neutral fluid might appear surprising indeed the
astrophysical plasmas in question are highly conducting and
support magnetic fields whose energy is at least comparable
to the kinetic energy of the motions let us consider a situation where the plasma is threaded by a uniform dynamically
strong magnetic field b0 the mean or guide field see  13
for a brief discussion of the validity of this assumption in
the presence of such a field there is no dimensionally unique
way of determining the cascade time  because besides the
nonlinear interaction time u  there is a second characteristic time associated with the fluctuation of size  namely the
alfvn time lk va  where va is the alfvn speed and lk is
the typical scale of the fluctuation along the magnetic field
the first theories of magnetohydrodynamic mhd turbulence iroshnikov 1963 kraichnan 1965 dobrowolny et al
1980 calculated  by assuming an isotropic cascade lk 
 of weakly interacting alfvnwave packets   lk va 
and obtained a k32 spectrum the failure of the observed spectra to conform to this law see references above
8 an outline of a kolmogorovstyle approach to kinetic turbulence was
given in a recent paper by schekochihin et al 2008b it can be read as a
conceptual introduction to the present paper which is much more detailed
and covers a much broader set of topics
9 this is the version of kolmogorovs theory due to obukhov 1941

montgomery  turner 1981
the modern form of mhd turbulence theory is commonly
associated with the names of goldreich  sridhar 1995
1997 henceforth gs it can be summarized as follows assume that a all electromagnetic perturbations are strongly
anisotropic so that their characteristic scales along the mean
field are much larger than those across it lk   or in terms
of wavenumbers kk  k  b the interactions between the
alfvnwave packets are strong and the turbulence at sufficiently small scales always arranges itself in such a way that
the alfvn timescale and the perpendicular nonlinear interaction timescale are comparable to each other ie

mhd modesslow waves and the entropy modeturn
out to be passively advected by the alfvnic component
of the turbulence this follows from the anisotropy see
lithwick  goldreich 2001 and  2426  55 and  63
for further discussion of the compressive fluctuations
as we have mentioned above the anisotropy was in
fact incorporated into mhd turbulence theory already by
montgomery  turner 1981 however these authors view
differed from the gs theory in that they thought of mhd
turbulence as essentially two dimensional described by a
kolmogorovlike cascade fyfe et al 1977 with an admixture of alfvn waves having some spectrum in kk unrelated
to the perpendicular structure of the turbulence note that
higdon 1984 while adopting a similar view anticipated the
scaling relation 5 but did not seem to consider it to be anything more than the confirmation of an essentially 2d nature
of the turbulence in what we are referring to here as gs
turbulence the 2d and alfvnic fluctuations are not separate
components of the turbulence the turbulence is three dimensional with correlations parallel and perpendicular to the local mean field related at each scale by the critical balance
assumption
indeed intuitively we cannot have kk va  k u  the turbulence cannot be any more 2d than allowed by the critical
balance because fluctuations in any two planes perpendicular to the mean field can only remain correlated if an alfvn
wave can propagate between them in less than their perpendicular decorrelation time in the opposite limit weakly interacting alfn waves with fixed kk and   kk va  k u can be
shown to give rise to an energy cascade towards smaller perpendicular scales where the turbulence becomes strong and
eq 3 is satisfied goldreich  sridhar 1997 galtier et al
2000 yousef et al 2009 thus there is a natural tendency
towards critical balance in a system containing nonlinearly interacting alfvn waves we will see in what follows that critical balance may in fact be taken as a general physical principle relating parallel scales associated with linear propagation and perpendicular scales associated with nonlinear interaction in anisotropic plasma turbulence see  75  794

we emphasize that the anisotropy of astrophysical plasma
turbulence is an observed phenomenon it is seen most clearly

the numerical evidence is much less clear on the scaling of the

13 mhd turbulence with and without a mean field
in the discussion above treating mhd turbulence as turbulence of alfvnic fluctuations depended on assuming the
presence of a mean guide field b0 that is strong compared to
the magnetic fluctuations bb0  uva  1 we will also
need this assumption in the formal developments to follow
see  21  31 is it legitimate to expect that such a spatially
regular field will be generically present kraichnan 1965 argued that in a generic situation in which all magnetic fields are
produced by the turbulence itself via the dynamo effect one
could assume that the strongest field will be at the outer scale
and that this field will play the role of an approximately uniform guide field for the alfvn waves in the inertial range
formally this amounts to assuming that in the inertial range

it is however by no means obvious that this should be true
when a strong mean field is imposed by some external mechanism the turbulent motions cannot bend it significantly so
only small perturbations are possible and b  b0  in contrast without a strong imposed field the energy density of the
magnetic fluctuations is at most comparable to the kineticenergy density of the plasma motions which are then sufficiently energetic to randomly tangle the field so b  b0 
in the weakmeanfield case the dynamically strong
stochastic magnetic field is a result of saturation of the
smallscale or fluctuation dynamoamplification of magnetic field due to random stretching by the turbulent motions see review by schekochihin  cowley 2007 the
definitive theory of this saturated state remains to be discovered both physical arguments and numerical evidence
schekochihin et al 2004 yousef et al 2007 suggest that
the magnetic field in this case is organized in folded flux
sheets or ribbons the length of these folds is comparable to the outer scale while the scale of the fielddirection
reversals transverse to the fold is determined by the dissipation physics in mhd with isotropic viscosity and resistivity it is the resistive scale11 although alfvn waves propagating along the folds may exist schekochihin et al 2004

spectrum the fact that the spectrum is closer to k than to k
in numerical simulations maron  goldreich 2001 mller et al 2003
mason et al 2007 perez  boldyrev 2008 2009 beresnyak  lazarian
2008b prompted boldyrev 2006 to propose a scaling argument that allows
32
an anisotropic alfvnic turbulence with a k spectrum his argument is
based on the conjecture that the fluctuating velocity and magnetic fields tend
to partially align at small scales an idea that has had considerable numerical support maron  goldreich 2001 beresnyak  lazarian 2006 2008b
mason et al 2006 matthaeus et al 2008a the alignment weakens nonlinear interactions and alters the scalings another modification of the gs the32
ory leading to an anisotropic k spectrum was proposed by gogoberidze
2007 who assumed that mhd turbulence with a strong mean field is dominated by nonlocal interactions with the outer scale however in both arguments the basic assumption that the turbulence is strong is retained this is
the main assumption that we make in this paper the critical balance conjecture 3 is used below not as a scaling prescription but in a weaker sense of
an ordering assumption ie we simply take the wave propagation terms in
the equations to be comparable to the nonlinear terms it is not hard to show
that the results derived in what follows remain valid whether or not the alignment is present we note that observationally only in the solar wind does one
measure the spectra with sufficient accuracy to state that they are consistent

with k but not with k see  811
11 in weakly collisional astrophysical plasmas such a description is not
applicable the field reversal scale is most probably determined by more
complicated and as yet poorly understood kinetic plasma effects below this
scale an alfvnic turbulence of the kind discussed in this paper may exist
schekochihin  cowley 2006

schekochihin et al

schekochihin  cowley 2007 the presence of the smallscale direction reversals means that there is no scalebyscale
equipartition between the velocity and magnetic fields while
the magnetic energy is smallscale dominated due to the direction reversals12 the kinetic energy should be contained primarily at the outer scale with some scaling law in the inertial
range
thus at the current level of understanding we have to assume that there are two asymptotic regimes of mhd turbulence anisotropic alfvnic turbulence with b  b0 and
isotropic mhd turbulence with smallscale field reversals and
b  b0  in this paper we shall only discuss the first regime
the origin of the mean field may be external as eg in the
solar wind where it is the field of the sun or due to some
form of meanfield dynamo rather than smallscale dynamo
as usually expected for galaxies see eg shukurov 2007
note finally that the condition b  b0 need not be satisfied at the outer scale and in fact is not satisfied in most space
or astrophysical plasmas where more commonly b  b0 at
the outer scale this however is sufficient for the kraichnan hypothesis to hold and for an alfnic cascade to be set
up so at small scales in the inertial range and beyond the
assumptions 6 are satisfied
14 kinetic turbulence

the gs theory of mhd turbulence  12 allows us to
make sense of the magnetized turbulence observed in cosmic
plasmas exhibiting the same statistical scaling as turbulence
in a neutral fluid although the underlying dynamics are very
different in these two cases however there is an aspect of
the observed astrophysical turbulence that undermines the applicability of any type of fluid description in most cases the
inertial range where the kolmogorov scaling holds extends to
scales far below the mean free path deep into the collisionless
regime for example in the case of the solar wind the mean
free path is close to 1 au so all scales are collisionless
an extreme case which also happens to be the best studied
thanks to the possibility of in situ measurements see  8
the proper way of treating such plasmas is using kinetic
theory not fluid equations the basis for the application of the
mhd fluid description to them has been the following well
known result from the linear theory of plasma waves while
the fast slow and entropy modes are damped at the meanfreepath scale both by collisional viscosity braginskii 1965
see  612 and by collisionless waveparticle interactions
barnes 1966 see  622 the alfvn waves are only damped
at the ion gyroscale it has therefore been assumed that the
mhd description inasmuch as it concerns the alfvnwave
cascade can be extended to the ion gyroscale with the understanding that this cascade is decoupled from the damped
cascades of the rest of the mhd modes this approach and
its application to the turbulence in the ism are best explained
by lithwick  goldreich 2001
while the fluid description may be sufficient to understand the alfvnic fluctuations in the inertial range it is certainly inadequate for everything else the compressive fluctuations in the inertial range and turbulence in the dissipation
range below the ion gyroscale where powerlaw spectra are
also detected eg denskat et al 1983 leamon et al 1998
12 see haugen et al 2004 for an alternative view note also that the
numerical evidence cited above pertains to forced simulations in decaying
mhd turbulence simulations the magnetic energy does indeed appear to be
at the outer scale biskamp  mller 2000 so one might expect an alfvnic
cascade deep in the inertial range

czaykowska et al 2001 smith et al 2006 sahraoui et al
2006 alexandrova et al 2008ab see also fig 1 the fundamental challenge that a comprehensive theory of astrophysical plasma turbulence must meet is to give the full account of
how the turbulent fluctuation energy injected at the outer scale
is cascaded to small scales and deposited into particle heat
we shall see  34 and  35 that the familiar concept of an
energy cascade can be generalized in the kinetic framework
as the kinetic cascade of a single quantity that we call the
generalized energy see also schekochihin et al 2008b and
references therein the small scales developed in the process are small scales both in the position and velocity space
the fundamental reason for this is the low collisionality of
the plasma since heating cannot ultimately be accomplished
without collisions large gradients in phase space are necessary for the collisions to be effective
the idea of a generalized energy cascade in phase space
as the engine of kinetic plasma turbulence is the central concept of this paper in order to understand the physics of the
kinetic cascade in various scale ranges we derive in what follows a hierarchy of simplified yet rigorous reduced kinetic
fluid and hybrid descriptions while the full kinetic theory
of turbulence is very difficult to handle either analytically or
numerically the models we derive are much more tractable
for all the regimes of applicability scaleparameter ranges
underlying assumptions are clearly stated in each of these
regimes the kinetic cascade splits into several channels of energy transfer some of them familiar eg the alfvnic cascade  53 and  54 others conceptually new eg the kinetic cascade of collisionless compressive fluctuations  62
or the entropy cascade  79712
so as to introduce this theoretical framework in a way that
is both analytically systematic and physically intelligible let
us first consider the characteristic scales that are relevant to
the problem of astrophysical turbulence  15 the models
we derive are previewed in  16 at the end of which the plan
of further developments is given
15 scales in the problem
151 outer scale

it is a generic feature of turbulent systems that energy is
injected via some largescale mechanism large scale here
means some scale or a range of scales comparable to the
size of the system depending on its global properties and
much larger than the microphysical scales at which energy
is dissipated and converted into heat  152 examples of
largescale stirring of turbulent fluctuations include the solar
activity in the corona launching alfvn waves to produce
turbulence in the solar wind supernova explosions in the
ism eg norman  ferrara 1996 ferrire 2001 the magnetorotational instability in accretion disks balbus  hawley
1998 merger events galaxy wakes and active galactic
nuclei in galaxy clusters eg subramanian et al 2006
ensslin  vogt 2006 chandran 2005a since in this paper
we are concerned with the local properties of astrophysical
plasmas let us simply assume that energy injection occurs at
some characteristic outer scale l all further considerations
will apply to scales that are much smaller than l and we will
assume that the particular character of the energy injection
does not matter at these small scales
in most astrophysical situations one cannot assume that
equilibrium quantities such as density temperature mean velocity and mean magnetic field are uniform at the outer scale

 12 dotted line shows the path an alfvnwave cascade starting at the outer scale l  l0 takes through the wavenumber space we also show the regions of
validity of the three tertiary approximations they all require kk  k anisotropic fluctuations and kk i  1 ie kk vthi  i  lowfrequency limit reduced
mhd rmhd  2 is valid when k i  kk mfpi  me mi 12 strongly magnetized collisional limit adiabatic electrons the regions of validity of kinetic
reduced mhd krmhd  5 and electron reduced mhd ermhd  7 lie within that of the isothermal electrongyrokinetic ion approximation fig 4 with
the additional requirement that k i  min1 kk mfpi  strongly magnetized ions for krmhd or k i  1 unmagnetized ions for ermhd the collisional
limit of krmhd  61 and appendix d me mi 12  kk mfpi  1 is similar to rmhd except electrons are isothermal the dotted line is the scaling of kk
vs k from critical balance in both the alfvnwave  12 eq 5 and kineticalfvnwave  75 eq 241 regimes

however at scales much smaller than l the gradients of the
smallscale fluctuating fields are much larger than the outerscale gradients although the fluctuation amplitudes are much
smaller for the mean magnetic field this assumption is discussed in some detail in  13 so we may neglect the equilibrium gradients and consider the turbulence to be homogeneous specifically this is a good assumption if kk l  1
eq 6 ie not only the perpendicular scales but also the
much larger parallel ones are still shorter than the outer scale
note that we cannot generally assume that the outerscale energy injection is anisotropic so the anisotropy is also the property of small scales only
152 microscales

there are four microphysical scales that mark the transitions between distinct physical regimes
electron diffusion scale  at kk mfpi mi me 12  1 the

electron response is isothermal  44 appendix a4 at
kk mfpi mi me 12  1 it is adiabatic  484 appendix a3

mean free path  at kk mfpi  1 the plasma is collisionless
in this regime waveparticle interactions can damp compressive fluctuations via barnes damping  622 so kinetic description becomes essential at kk mfpi  1 the plasma is
collisional and fluidlike  61 appendices a and d
ion gyroscale  at k i  1 ions as well as the electrons
are magnetized and the magnetic field is frozen into the ion

flow the e  b velocity field at k i  1 ions can exchange energy with electromagnetic fluctuations via wave
particle interactions and ion heating eventually occurs via a
kinetic ionentropy cascade see  79710 at k i  1
the ions are unmagnetized and have a boltzmann
response

 72 note that the ion inertial scale di  i  i is comparable to the ion gyroscale unless the plasma beta i  8ni ti b2
is very different from unity in the theories developed below
di does not play a special role except in the limit of ti  te 
which is not common in astrophysical plasmas see further
discussion in  71 and appendix e
electron gyroscale  at k e  1 electrons are magnetized
and the magnetic field is frozen into the electron flow  4
 7 appendix c at k e  1 the electrons absorb the
energy of the electromagnetic fluctuations via waveparticle
interactions leading to electron heating via a kinetic electronentropy cascade see  712

typical values of these scales and of several other key parameters are given in table 1 in fig 2 we show how the
wavenumber space k  kk  is divided by these scales into
several domains where the physics is different further partitioning of the wavenumber space results from comparing k i
and kk mfpi k i  kk mfpi is the limit of strong magnetization see appendix a2 and most importantly from comparing parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers as we explained above observational and numerical evidence tells us
that alfvnic turbulence is anisotropic kk  k  in fig 2
we sketch the path the turbulent cascade is expected to take

 12 and  75 respectively
16 kinetic and fluid models
what is the correct analytical description of the turbulent
plasma fluctuations along the presumed path of the cascade
as we promised above it is going to be possible to simplify
the full kinetic theory substantially these simplifications can
be obtained in the form of a hierarchy of approximations and
as these emerge specific physical mechanisms that control the
turbulent cascade in various physical regimes become more
transparent
gyrokinetics  3  the starting point for these develop

ments and the primary approximation in the hierarchy is gyrokinetics a lowfrequency kinetic theory resulting from averaging over the cyclotron motion of the particles gyrokinetics is appropriate for the study of subsonic plasma turbulence in virtually all astrophysically relevant parameter ranges
howes et al 2006 for fluctuations at frequencies lower

than the ion cyclotron frequency   i  gyrokinetics can
be systematically derived by making use of the following two
assumptions which also underpin the gs theory  12 a
anisotropy of the turbulence so   kk k is used as the small
parameter and b strong interactions ie the fluctuation amplitudes are assumed to be such that wave propagation and
nonlinear interaction occur on comparable timescales from
eq 3 u va   the first of these assumptions implies that
fluctuations at alfvnic frequencies satisfy   kk va  i
even when their perpendicular scale is such k i  1 this
makes gyrokinetics an ideal tool both for analytical theory and
for numerical studies of astrophysical plasma turbulence the
numerical approaches are also made attractive by the long experience of gyrokinetic simulations accumulated in the fusion
research and by the existence of publicly available gyrokinetic codes kotschenreuther et al 1995 jenko et al 2000
candy  waltz 2003 chen  parker 2003 a concise review of gyrokinetics is provided in  3 see howes et al 2006
for a detailed derivation the reader is urged to pay particular attention to  34 and  35 where the concept of the kinetic cascade of generalized energy is introduced and the particle heating in gyrokinetics is discussed appendix f introduces additional conservation laws that arise in 2d and sometimes also in 3d this establishes the conceptual framework
in which most of the subsequent physical arguments are presented the region of validity of gyrokinetics is illustrated
in fig 3 it covers virtually the entire path of the turbulent
cascade except the largest outer scales where one cannot
assume anisotropy note that the twofluid theory which is
the starting point for the mhd theory see appendix a is
not a good description at collisionless scales it is important
to mention however that the formulation of gyrokinetics that
we adopt while appropriate for treating fluctuations at collisionless scales does nevertheless require a certain weak
degree of collisionality see discussion in  313 and an extended treatment of collisions in gyrokinetics in appendix b
isothermal electron fluid  4  while gyrokinetics constitutes a significant simplification it is still a fully kinetic
description further progress towards simpler models is
achieved by showing that for parallel scales smaller than the
electron diffusion scale kk mfpi  me mi 12  and perpendicular scales larger than the electron gyroscale k e  1
the electrons are a magnetized isothermal fluid while ions
must be treated gyrokinetically this is the secondary
approximation in our hierarchy derived in  4 via an asymptotic expansion in me mi 12 see also appendix c1 the
plasma is described by the ion gyrokinetic equation and two
fluidlike equations that contain electron dynamicsthese
are summarized in  49 the region of validity of this
approximation is illustrated in fig 4 it does not capture the
dissipative effects around the electron diffusion scale or the
electron heating but it remains uniformly valid as the cascade
passes from collisional to collisionless scales and also as it
crosses the ion gyroscale

in order to elucidate the nature of the turbulence above and
below the ion gyroscale we derive two tertiary approximations one of which is valid for k i  1  5 and  6 and the
other for k i  1  7 see also appendix c which gives
a nonrigorous nongyrokinetic but perhaps more intuitive
derivation of the results of  4 and  72

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
kinetic reduced mhd  5 and  6  on scales above the ion
gyroscale known as the inertial range we demonstrate that
the decoupling of the alfvnwave cascade and its indifference to both collisional and collisionless damping are explicit
and analytically provable properties we show rigorously that
the alfvnwave cascade is governed by a closed set of two
fluidlike equations for the stream and flux functionsthe reduced magnetohydrodynamics rmhdindependently of
the collisionality  53 and  54 the derivation of rmhd
from mhd and its properties are presented in  2 the cascade proceeds via interaction of oppositely propagating wave
packets and is decoupled from the density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations the compressive modes in the collisional limit these are the entropy and slow modes see  61
and appendix d the latter are passively mixed by the
alfvn waves but unlike in the fluid collisional limit this
passive cascade is governed by a simplified kinetic equation for the ions  55 together with rmhd it forms
a hybrid fluidkinetic description of magnetized turbulence
in a weakly collisional plasma which we call kinetic reduced mhd krmhd the krmhd equations are summarized in  57 their collisional and collisionless limits
are explored in  61 and  62 respectively whereas the
alfvn waves are undamped in this approximation the compressive fluctuations are subject to damping both in the collisional braginskii 1965 viscous damping  612 and collisionless barnes 1966 damping  622 limits in the collisionless limit the compressive component of the turbulence is
a simple example of an essentially kinetic turbulence including such features as conservation of generalized energy despite collisionless damping and parallel phase mixing possibly leading to ion heating  623625 how strongly
the compressive fluctuations are damped depends on the parallel scale of these fluctuations since the ion kinetic equation
turns out to be linear along the moving field lines associated
with the alfvn waves the compressive fluctuations do not in
the absence of finitegyroradius effects develop small parallel
scales and their cascade may be only weakly damped above
the ion gyroscalethis is discussed in  63
electron reduced mhd  7  at the ion gyroscale the
alfvnic and the compressive cascades are no longer decoupled and their energy is partially damped via collisionless
waveparticle interactions  71 this part of the energy
is channeled into ion heat the rest of it is converted into
a cascade of kinetic alfvn waves kaw this cascade extends through what is known as the dissipation range to
the electron gyroscale where its turn comes to be damped via
waveparticle interaction and transferred into electron heat
the kaw turbulence is again anisotropic with kk  k  it
is governed by a pair of fluidlike equations also derived
from gyrokinetics we call them electron reduced mhd
ermhd in the highbeta limit they coincide with the reduced anisotropic form of the previously known electron
mhd kingsep et al 1990 the ermhd equations are derived in  72 see also appendix c2 and the kaw cascade is considered in  7375 the fate of the inertialrange energy collisionlessly damped at the ion gyroscale is
investigated in  79711 an analogous consideration for
the kaw energy damped at the electron gyroscale is presented in  712 in these sections we introduce the notion of the entropy cascadea nonlinear phasemixing process whereby the collisionless damping occurring at the ion
and electron gyroscales is made irreversible and particles are

7

heated this part of the cascade is purely kinetic and its salient
feature is the particle distribution functions developing small
scales in the gyrokinetic phase space note that besides deriving rigorous sets of equations for the dissipationrange turbulence  7 also presents a number of kolmogorovstyle scaling
predictionsboth for the kaw cascade  75 and for the entropy cascade  792  7102  7104  712
hall reduced mhd appendix e  the reduced anisotropic
form of the popular hall mhd system can be derived as a
special limit of gyrokinetics k i  1 ti  te  i  1
the resulting hall reduced mhd hrmhd equations
are a convenient model for some purposes because they
simultaneously capture the coldion lowbeta limits of both
the krmhd and ermhd systems however they are
usually not strictly applicable in space and astrophysical
plasmas of interest where ions are rarely cold and i is not
particularly low the hrmhd equations are derived in  e1
the kinetic cascade of generalized energy in the hall limit is
discussed in  e2 and the circumstances under which the ion
inertial and ion sound scales become important in theories of
plasma turbulence are summarized in  e4 theories of the
dissipationrange turbulence based on hall mhd are briefly
discussed in  826

the regions of validity of the tertiary approximations
krmhd and ermhdare illustrated in fig 2 in this figure we also show the region of validity of the rmhd system derived from the standard compressible mhd equations
by assuming anisotropy of the turbulence and strong interactions this derivation is the fluid analog of the derivation
of gyrokinetics we present it in  2 before embarking on
the gyrokineticsbased path outlined above in order to make
a connection with the conventional mhd treatment and to
demonstrate with particular simplicity how the assumption of
anisotropy leads to a reduced fluid system in which the decoupling of the cascades of the alfvn waves and of the compressive modes is manifest appendix a extends this derivation
to braginskii 1965 twofluid equations in the limit of strong
magnetization it also works out rigorously the transition from
the fluid limit to the krmhd equations
the main formal developments of this paper are contained
in  37 the outline given above is meant to help the reader
navigate these sections in  8 we discuss at some length
how our results apply to various astrophysical plasmas with
weak collisionality the solar wind and the magnetosheath
the ism accretion disks and galaxy clusters  81 and  82
can also be read as an overall summary of the paper in light
of the evidence available from spaceplasma measurements
finally in  9 we provide a brief epilogue and make a few
remarks about future directions of inquiry

21 rmhd ordering

as we explained in the introduction observational and numerical evidence makes it safe to assume that the turbulence
in such a system will be anisotropic with kk  k at scales
smaller than the outer scale kk l  1 see  13 and  151
let us therefore introduce a small parameter   kk k and
carry out a systematic expansion of eqs 710 in  in this
expansion the fluctuations are treated as small but not arbitrarily so in order to estimate their size we shall adopt the
criticalbalance conjecture 3 which is now treated not as a
detailed scaling prescription but as an ordering assumption
this allows us to introduce the following ordering

is the plasma beta which is ordered to be order unity in the 
expansion subsidiary limits of high and low  can be taken
after the  expansion is done see  24
in eq 12 we made two auxiliary ordering assumptions that the velocity and magneticfield fluctuations
have the character of alfvn and slow waves b b0

of the alfvnwavepolarized fluctuations b b0  u va 
slowwavepolarized fluctuations bk b0  uk va  and densitypressureentropy fluctuations 0   pp0  are all the
same order strictly speaking whether this is the case depends
on the energy sources that drive the turbulence as we shall
see if no slow waves or entropy fluctuations are launched
none will be present however in astrophysical contexts the
outerscale energy input may be assumed random and therefore comparable power is injected into all types of fluctuations
we further assume that the characteristic frequency of the
fluctuations is   kk va eq 3 meaning that the fast waves
for which   k v2a  c2s 12  are ordered out this restriction must be justified empirically observations of the solarwind turbulence confirm that it is primarily alfvnic see
eg bale et al 2005 and that its compressive component is
substantially pressurebalanced roberts 1990 burlaga et al
1990 marsch  tu 1993 bavassano et al 2004 see eq 22
below a weakturbulence calculation of compressible mhd

turbulence in lowbeta plasmas chandran 2005b suggests
that only a small amount of energy is transferred from the fast
waves to alfvn waves with large kk  a similar conclusion
emerges from numerical simulations cho  lazarian 2002
2003 as the fast waves are also expected to be subject to
strong collisionless damping andor to strong dissipation after
they steepen into shocks we eliminate them from our consideration of the problem and concentrate on lowfrequency
turbulence
22 alfvn waves
we start by observing that the alfvnwavepolarized
fluctuations are twodimensionally solenoidal since from
eq 7

and   b  0 exactly separating the o part of these divergences gives   u  0 and   b  0 to lowest order

equations 1718 are known as the reduced magnetohydrodynamics rmhd the first derivations of these
equations in the context of fusion plasmas are due to
kadomtsev  pogutse 1974 and to strauss 1976 these
were followed by many systematic derivations and generalizations employing various versions and refinements of
the basic expansion taking into account the nonalfvnic
modes which we will do in  24 and including the effects of spatial gradients of equilibrium fields eg strauss
1977 montgomery 1982 hazeltine 1983 zank  matthaeus
1992 kinney  mcwilliams 1997 bhattacharjee et al 1998
kruger et al 1998 a comparative review of these expansion
schemes and their often close relationship to ours is outside
the scope of this paper one important point we wish to emphasize is that we do not assume the plasma beta defined in
eq 14 to be either large or small
equations 17 and 18 form a closed set meaning that the
alfvnwave cascade decouples from the slow waves and density fluctuations it is to the turbulence described by eqs 17

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
18 that the gs theory outlined in  12 applies13 in  53 we
will show that eqs 17 and 18 correctly describe inertialrange alfvnic fluctuations even in a collisionless plasma
where the full mhd description eqs 710 is not valid
23 elsasser fields

the mhd equations 710 in the incompressible limit
  const acquire a symmetric 
form if written in terms of
the elsasser fields z  u  b 4 elsasser 1950 let
us demonstrate how this symmetry manifests itself in the reduced equations derived above
we introduce elsasser potentials       so that z

      for these potentials eqs 1718 become

these equations show that the rmhd has a simple set of exact solutions if    0 or    0 the nonlinear term vanishes
and the other nonzero elsasser potential is simply a fluctuation of arbitrary shape and magnitude propagating along
the mean field at the alfvn speed va     f  x y z  vat
these solutions are finiteamplitude alfvnwave packets of
arbitrary shape only counterpropagating such solutions can
interact and thereby give rise to the alfvnwave cascade
kraichnan 1965 note that these interactions are conservative in the sense that the  and  waves scatter off each
other without exchanging energy
note that the individual conservation of the  and 
waves energies means that the energy fluxes associated
with these waves need not be equal so instead of a single kolmogorov flux  assumed in the scaling arguments
reviewed in  12 we could have  6   the gs theory can be generalized to this case of imbalanced alfvnic
cascades lithwick et al 2007 beresnyak  lazarian 2008a
chandran 2008 but here we will focus on the balanced turbulence     if one considers the turbulence forced
in a physical way ie without forcing the magnetic field
which would break the flux conservation the resulting cascade would always be balanced in the real world imbalanced alfvnic fluxes are measured in the fast solar wind
where the influence of initial conditions in the solar atmosphere is more pronounced while the slowwind turbulence
is approximately balanced marsch  tu 1990a see also reviews by tu  marsch 1995 bruno  carbone 2005 and references therein
13 the alfvnwave turbulence in the rmhd system has been studied by many authors some of the relevant numerical investigations are
due to kinney  mcwilliams 1998 dmitruk et al 2003 oughton et al
2004 rappazzo et al 2007 2008 perez  boldyrev 2008 2009 analytical theory has mostly been confined to the weakturbulence paradigm
ng  bhattacharjee 1996 1997 bhattacharjee  ng 2001 galtier et al
2002 lithwick  goldreich 2003 galtier  chandran 2006 nazarenko
2008 we note that adopting the critical balance eq 3 as an ordering
assumption for the expansion in kk k does not preclude one from subsequently attempting a weakturbulence approach the latter should simply be
treated as a subsidiary expansion indeed implementing the anisotropy assumption on the level of mhd equations rather than simultaneously with
the weakturbulence closure galtier et al 2000 significantly reduces the
amount of algebra one should however bear in mind that the weakturbulence approximation always breaks down at some sufficiently small
scalenamely when k  va u2 kk2 l where l is the outer scale of the
turbulence u velocity at the outer scale and kk the parallel wavenumber of the alfvn waves see goldreich  sridhar 1997 or the review by
schekochihin  cowley 2007 below this scale interactions cannot be assumed weak

24 slow waves and the entropy mode

equations 2627 describe the slowwavepolarized fluctuations while eq 23 describes the zerofrequency entropy
mode which is decoupled from the slow waves14 the nonlinearity in eqs 2627 enters via the derivatives defined in
eqs 1920 and is due solely to interactions with alfvn
waves thus both the slowwave and the entropymode cascades occur via passive scatteringmixing by alfvn waves in
the course of which there is no energy exchange between the
cascades
note that in the highbeta limit cs  va see eq 14 the
entropy mode is dominated by density fluctuations eq 23
cs  va  which also decouple from the slowwave cascade

the highbeta limit is equivalent to the incompressible approximation for the slow waves
14 for other expansion schemes leading to reduced sets of equations for
these compressive fluctuations see references in  22 note that the nature of the density fluctuations described above is distinct from the so called
pseudosound density fluctuations that arise in the nearly incompressible mhd theories montgomery et al 1987 matthaeus  brown 1988
matthaeus et al 1991 zank  matthaeus 1993 the pseudosound is essentially the density response caused by the nonlinear pressure fluctuations
calculated from the incompressibility constraint the resulting density fluctuations are second order in mach number and therefore order 2 in our
expansion see eq 13 the passive density fluctuations derived in this section are order  and therefore supersede the pseudosound see review by
tu  marsch 1995 for a discussion of the relevant solarwind evidence

10

schekochihin et al

in  55 we will derive a kinetic description for the inertialrange compressive fluctuations density and magneticfield
strength which is more generally valid in weakly collisional
plasmas and which reduces to eqs 2627 in the collisional
limit see appendix d while these fluctuations will in general satisfy a kinetic equation they will remain passive with
respect to the alfvn waves
25 elsasser fields for the slow waves

in the highbeta limit va  cs  the generalized elsasser
fields 29 become the parallel components of the conventional incompressible elsasser fields we see that only in this
limit do the slow waves interact exclusively with the counterpropagating alfvn waves and so only in this limit does setting    0 or    0 gives rise to finiteamplitude slowwave
packet solutions z
k  f x y z  vat analogous to the finiteamplitude alfvnwave packets discussed in  2315 for general  the phase speed of the slow waves is smaller than that
of the alfvn waves and therefore alfvn waves can catch
up and interact with the slow waves that travel in the same
direction all of these interactions are of scattering type and
involve no exchange of energy
26 scalings for passive fluctuations

the scaling of the passively mixed scalar fields introduced
above is slaved to the scaling of the alfvnic fluctuations
consider for example the entropy mode eq 23 as
in kolmogorovobukhov theory see  11 one assumes a
localinscalespace cascade of scalar variance and a constant
flux s of this variance then analogously to eq 1

so the scalar fluctuations have the same scaling as the turbulence that mixes them obukhov 1949 corrsin 1951 in gs

15 obviously setting both    0 does always enable these finiteamplitude slowwave solutions more nontrivially such finiteamplitude solutions exist in the lagrangian frame associated with the alfvn wavesthis
is discussed in detail in  63

turbulence the scalarvariance spectrum should therefore be
53
k lithwick  goldreich 2001 the same argument applies to all passive fields
it is the presumably passive electrondensity spectrum
that provides the main evidence of the k53 scaling in the interstellar turbulence armstrong et al 1981 1995 lazio et al
2004 see further discussion in  841 the explanation of
this spectrum in terms of passive mixing of the entropy mode
originally proposed by higdon 1984 was developed on the
basis of the gs theory by lithwick  goldreich 2001 the
turbulent cascade of the compressive fluctuations and the relevant solarwind data is discussed further in  63 in particular it will emerge that the anisotropy of these fluctuations
remains a nontrivial issue is there an analog of the scaling
relation 5 the scaling argument outlined above does not
invoke any assumptions about the relationship between the
parallel and perpendicular scales of the compressive fluctuations other than the assumption that they are anisotropic
lithwick  goldreich 2001 argue that the parallel scales of
the alfvnic fluctuations will imprint themselves on the passively advected compressive ones so eq 5 holds for the
latter as well in  63 we examine this conclusion in view
of the solarwind evidence and of the fact that the equations
for the compressive modes become linear in the lagrangian
frame associated with the alfvnic turbulence
27 five rmhd cascades

thus the anisotropy and critical balance 3 taken as
ordering assumptions lead to a neat decomposition of the
mhd turbulent cascade into a decoupled alfvnwave cascade and cascades of slow waves and entropy fluctuations passively scatteredmixed by the alfvn waves more precisely
eqs 23 21 and 30 imply that for arbitrary  there are
five conserved quantities16

this is an example of splitting of the overall energy cascade
into several channels recovered as a particular case of the
more general kinetic cascade in appendix d2a concept
that will repeatedly arise in the kinetic treatment to follow
the decoupling of the slow and alfvnwave cascades in
mhd turbulence was studied in some detail and confirmed
in direct numerical simulations by maron  goldreich 2001
for   1 and by cho  lazarian 2002 2003 for a range
of values of  the derivation given in  22 and  24 cf
lithwick  goldreich 2001 provides a straightforward theoretical basis for these results assuming anisotropy of the turbulence which was also confirmed in these numerical studies
it turns out that the decoupling of the alfvnwave cascade
that we demonstrated above for the anisotropic mhd turbu16 note that magnetic helicity of the perturbed field is not an invariant of
rmhd except in two dimensions see
r appendix f4 in 2d there is also
conservation of the mean square flux d 3 r 2 see appendix f2

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
lence is a uniformly valid property of plasma turbulence at
both collisional and collisionless scales and that this cascade
is correctly described by the rmhd equations 1718 all the
way down to the ion gyroscale while the fluctuations of density and magneticfield strength do not satisfy simple fluid
evolution equations anymore and require solving the kinetic
equation in order to prove this we adopt a kinetic description and apply to it the same ordering  21 as we used to
reduce the mhd equations the kinetic theory that emerges

rigorous derivations of the gyrokinetic equation based on
the hamiltonian formalism were developed by dubin et al
1983 electrostatic and hahm et al 1988 electromagnetic
this approach is reviewed in brizard  hahm 2007 a
more pedestrian but perhaps also more transparent exposition
of the gyrokinetics in a straight mean field can be found in
howes et al 2006 who also provide a detailed explanation
of the gyrokinetic ordering in the context of astrophysical
plasma turbulence and a treatment of the linear waves and
damping rates here we review only the main points so as
to allow the reader to understand the present paper without
referring elsewhere

thus gyrokinetics is a lowfrequency limit that averages over
the timescales associated with the particle gyration because
we have assumed that the fluctuations are anisotropic and have
by order of magnitude alfvnic frequencies we see from
eq 46 that their frequency remains far below i at all scales
including the ion and even electron gyroscalethe gyrokinetics remains valid at all of these scales and the cyclotronfrequency effects are negligible cf quataert  gruzinov

this means that the gyrokinetic description in the form used
below does not extend to large sonic flows that can be
present in many astrophysical systems it is in principle
possible to extend the gyrokinetics to systems with sonic
flows eg in the toroidal geometry see artun  tang 1994
sugama  horton 1997 however we do not follow this
route because such flows belong to the same class of nonuniversal outerscale features as background density and temperature gradients systemspecific geometry etcthese can
all be ignored at small scales where the turbulence should be
approximately homogeneous and subsonic as long as kk l

where mfpi  vthi ii is the ion mean free path this ordering can actually be inferred from equating the gyrokinetic entropy production terms to the collisional entropy production
see extended discussion in howes et al 2006 note that the
ordering 49 holds on the understanding that we have ordered
k i  1 eq 44 because the fluctuation frequency can depend on k i in the dissipation range see  73

the ordering of the collision frequency expressed by
eq 49 means that collisions while not dominant as in
the fluid description appendix a are still retained in

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
the version of the gyrokinetic theory adopted by us their
presence is required in order for us to be able to assume
that the equilibrium distribution is maxwellian eq 54
below and for the heating and entropy production to be
treated correctly  34 and  35 however our ordering of
collisions and of the fluctuation amplitudes  312 imposes
certain limitations thus we cannot treat the class of nonlinear
phenomena involving particle trapping by parallelvarying
fluctuations nonmaxwellian tails of particle distributions
plasma instabilities arising from the equilibrium pressure
anisotropies mirror firehose and their possible nonlinear
evolution to large amplitudes see discussion in  83
the region of validity of the gyrokinetic approximation in
the wavenumber space is illustrated in fig 3it embraces
all of the scales that are expected to be traversed by the
anisotropic energy cascade except the scales close to the
outer scale
as we explained above me mi  i  k i and kk mfpi or
ii  are assigned order unity in the gyrokinetic expansion
subsidiary expansions in small me mi  4 and in small or
large values of the other three parameters  57 can be carried out at a later stage as long as their values are not so large
or small as to interfere with the primary expansion in  these
expansions will yield simpler models of turbulence with more
restricted domains of validity than gyrokinetics

where collisions are concerned it must be constantly kept in

flow as will be explained in more detail in  35 f0s has a
slow time dependence via the equilibrium temperature t0s 
t0s 2t this reflects the slow heating of the plasma as the turbulent energy is dissipated however t0s can be treated as a
constant with respect to the time dependence of the firstorder
distribution function the timescale of the turbulent fluctuations the firstorder part of the distribution function is composed of the boltzmann response second term in eq 54 ordered in eq 47 and the gyrocenter distribution function hs

particle position r but by the position rs of the particle gyrocenter or guiding centerthe center of the ring orbit that

we will refer to w as the generalized energy we use this
term to emphasize the role of w as the cascaded quantity in
gyrokinetic turbulence see below this quantity is in fact
the gyrokinetic version of a collisionless kinetic invariant variously referred to as the generalized grand canonical potential see hallatschek 2004 who points out the fundamental
role of this quantity in plasma turbulence simulations or free
energy eg fowler 1968 scott 2007 the nonmagnetic
part of w is related to the perturbed entropy of the system krommes  hu 1994 sugama et al 1996 howes et al
2006 schekochihin et al 2008b see discussion in  3519
19 note also that a quadratic form involving both the perturbed distribution
function and the electromagnetic field appears in a more general form than
eq 74 in the formulation of the energy principle for the kinetic mhd
approximation kruskal  oberman 1958 kulsrud 1962 1964 regarding
the relationship between kinetic mhd and gyrokinetics see footnote 23

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
equation 73 is a conservation law of the generalized energy pext is the source and the second term on the righthand
side which is negative definite represents collisional dissipation this suggests that we might think of kinetic plasma
turbulence in terms of the generalized energy w injected by
the outerscale stirring and dissipated by collisions in order for the dissipation to be important the collisional term in
eq 73 has to become comparable to pext  this can happen
in two ways
1 at collisional scales kk mfpi  1 due to deviations of
the perturbed distribution function from a local perturbed maxwellian see  61 and appendix d
2 at collisionless scales kk mfpi  1 due the development of small scales in the velocity spacelarge gradients in vk see  624 or v which is accompanied
by the development of small perpendicular scales in the
position space see  791
thus the dissipation is only important at particular small
scales which are generally well separated from the outer
scale the generalized energy is transferred from the outer
scale to the dissipation scales via a nonlinear cascade we
shall call it the kinetic cascade it is analogous to the energy
cascade in fluid or mhd turbulence but a conceptually new
feature is present the small scales at which dissipation happens are small scales both in the velocity and position space
whereas the large gradients in vk are produced by the linear parallel phase mixing whose role in the kinetic dissipation processes has been appreciated for some time landau
1946 hammett et al 1991 krommes  hu 1994 krommes
1999 watanabe  sugama 2004 see  624 the emergence
of large gradients in v is due to an essentially nonlinear
phase mixing mechanism  791 at spatial scales smaller
than the ion gyroradius this nonlinear perpendicular phase
mixing turns out to be a faster and therefore presumably the
dominant way of generating smallscale structure in the velocity space it was anticipated in the development of gyrofluid
moment hierarchies by dorland  hammett 1993 here we
treat it for the first time as a phasespace turbulent cascade
this is done in  79 and  710 see also schekochihin et al
2008b
in the sections that follow we shall derive particular forms
of w for various limiting cases of the gyrokinetic theory
 47  56  625  78 appendices d2 and e2 we
shall see that the kinetic cascade of w is indeed a direct
generalization of the more familiar fluid cascades such as
the rmhd cascades discussed in  2 and that w contains
the energy invariants of the fluid models in the appropriate
limits in these limits the cascade of the generalized energy will split into several decoupled cascades as it did in
the case of rmhd  27 whenever one of the physically
important scales  152 is crossed and a change of physical
regime occurs these cascades are mixed back together into
the overall kinetic cascade of w  which can then be split in
a different way as it emerges on the opposite side of the
transition region in the scale space the conversion of the
alfvnic cascade into the kaw cascade and the entropy cascade at k i  1 is the most interesting example of such a
transition discussed in  7
the generalized energy appears to be the only quadratic
invariant of gyrokinetics in three dimensions in two dimensions many other invariants appear see appendix f

35 heating and entropy
in a stationary state all of the the turbulent power injected
by the external stirring is dissipated and thus transferred into
heat mathematically this is expressed as a slow increase in
the temperature of the maxwellian equilibrium in gyrokinetics the heating timescale is ordered as  2 1 
even though the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations may
be occurring collisionlessly at scales such that kk mfpi  1
eg via waveparticle interaction at the ion gyroscale  71
the resulting heating must ultimately be effected with the help
of collisions this is because heating is an irreversible process
and it is a small amount of collisions that make collisionless
damping irreversible in other words slow heating of the
maxwellian equilibrium is equivalent to entropy production
and boltzmanns htheorem rigorously requires collisions to
make this possible

where the overlines mean averaging over times longer than
the characteristic time of the turbulent fluctuations   1
but shorter than the typical heating time  2 1 see
howes et al 2006 schekochihin et al 2008b for a detailed
derivation of this and related results on heating in gyrokinetics see also earlier discussions of the entropy production
in gyrokinetics by krommes  hu 1994 krommes 1999
sugama et al 1996 we have omitted the term describing the
interspecies collisional temperature equalization note that
both sides of eq 76 are order 2 
if we now time average eq 73 in a similar fashion the
lefthand side vanishes because it is a time derivative of a
quantity fluctuating on the timescale   1 and we confirm
that the righthand side of eq 76 is simply equal to the average power pext injected by external stirring the import of
eq 76 is that it tells us that heating can only be effected
by collisions while eq 73 implies that the injected power
gets to the collisional scales in velocity and position space by
means of a kinetic cascade of generalized energy
the first
pterm in the expression for the generalized energy
74 is  s t0s ss  where ss is the perturbed entropy see
eq 75 the second term in eq 74 is magnetic energy
collisionless damping of electromagnetic fluctuations can be
thought of as a redistribution of the generalized energy transferring the electromagnetic energy into entropy fluctuations
while the total w is conserved a simple example of how that
happens for collisionless compressive fluctuations in the inertial range is worked out in  623
the contribution to the perturbed entropy from the gyrocenter distribution is the integral of h2s 2f0s whose
evolution equation 70 can be viewed as the gyrokinetic
version of the htheorem the first term on the righthand
side of this equation represents the waveparticle interaction
collisionless damping under time average it is related to
the work done on plasma eq 71 and hence to the average
externally injected power pext via timeaveraged eq 7220
20

note that eq 72 is valid not only in the integral form but also indi

16

schekochihin et al

in a stationary state this is balanced by the second term in the
righthand side of eq 70 which is the collisionalheating
or entropyproduction term that also appears in eq 76
thus the generalized energy channeled by collisionless
damping into entropy fluctuations is eventually converted
into heat by collisions the subgyroscale entropy cascade
which brings the perturbed distribution function hs to collisional scales will be discussed further in  79 and  710
see also schekochihin et al 2008b
this concludes a short primer on gyrokinetics necessary
and sufficient for adequate understanding of what is to follow formally all further analytical derivations in this paper
are simply subsidiary expansions of the gyrokinetics in the parameters we listed in  31 in  4 we expand in me mi 12 
in  5 in k i followed by further subsidiary expansions in
large and small kk mfpi in  6 and in  7 in 1k i 
4 isothermal electron fluid

in this section we carry out an expansion of the electron gyrokinetic equation in powers of me mi 12  002 for hydrogen plasma in virtually all cases of
 interest this expansion
can be done while still considering i  k i  and kk mfpi to
be order unity21 note that the assumption k i  1 together
with eq 45 mean that
k e  k i me mi 12  1

77

ie the expansion in me mi 12 means also that we are
considering scales larger than the electron gyroradius the
idea of such an expansion of the electron kinetic equation
has been utilized many times in plasma physics literature
the massratio expansion of the gyrokinetic equation in a
form very similar to what is presented below is found in
snyder  hammett 2001
the primary import of this section will be technical we
shall dispense with the electron gyrokinetic equation and thus
prepare the necessary ground for further approximations the
main results are summarized in  49 a reader who is only
interested in following qualitatively the major steps in the
derivation may skip to this summary

e in the electron gyrokinetic equation we get the following

14bk 2 t in a stationary state time averaging eliminates the time
derivative of the magneticfluctuation energy so ek  jk  ek  jk  0 at all k
except those corresponding to the outer scale where the external energy injection occurs this means that below the outer scale the work done on one
species balances the work done on the other the waveparticle interaction
term in the gyrokinetic equation is responsible for this energy exchange

43 flux conservation
equation 95 implies that the magnetic flux is conserved
and magneticfield lines cannot be broken to lowest order in
the massratio expansion indeed we may follow cowley
1985 and argue that the lefthand side of eq 95 is minus
the projection of the electric field on the total magnetic field
see eq 37 so we have

ie the magnetic field lines are frozen into the velocity field

total magnetic field b see eq c6
the flux conservation is broken in the higher orders of the
massratio expansion in the first order ohmic resistivity formally enters in eq 95 unless collisions are even weaker
than assumed so far if they are downgraded one order as is
done in  483 resistivity enters in the second order in the
second order the electron inertia and the finiteness of the electron gyroradius also lead to unfreezing of the flux this can be
seen formally by keeping secondorder terms in eq 79 multiplying it by vk and integrating over velocities the relative
importance of these flux unfreezing mechanisms is evaluated
in  77
44 isothermal electrons

equation 96 mandates that the perturbed electron temperature must remain constant along the perturbed field lines
strictly speaking this does not preclude te varying across
the field lines however we shall now assume te  const has
no spatial variation which is justified eg if the field lines
are stochastic assuming that no spatially uniform perturbations exist we may set te  0 equation 94 then reduces

48 validity of the massratio expansion

let us examine the range of spatial scales in which the
equations derived above are valid in carrying out the expansion in me mi 12  we ordered k i  1 eq 77 and
kk mfpi  1 eq 83 formally this means that the perpendicular and parallel wavelengths of the perturbations must not
be so small or so large as to interfere with the mass ratio expansion we now discuss the four conditions that this requirement leads to and whether any of them can be violated without
destroying the validity of the equations derived above

this is equivalent to demanding that k e  1 a condition
that was indeed essential for the expansion to hold eq 78
this is not a serious limitation because electrons can be considered well magnetized at virtually all scales of interest for
astrophysical applications however we do forfeit the detailed information about some important electron physics at
k e  1 for example such effects as wave damping at the
electron gyroscale and the electron heating although the total
amount of the electron heating can be deduced by subtracting
the ion heating from the total energy input the breaking of
the flux conservation resistivity is also an effect that requires
incorporation of the finite electron gyroscale physics
482 k i  me mi 12 

if this condition is broken the smallk i expansion carried out in  5 must formally speaking precede the massratio expansion however it turns out that the smallk i expansion commutes with the massratio expansion
schekochihin et al 2007 see also footnote 23 so we
may use the equations derived in  4246 when k i 
me mi 12 
483 kk mfpi  mi me 12 

let us consider what happens if this condition is broken
and kk mfpi  mi me 12  in this case the collisions become even weaker and the expansion procedure must be modified namely the collision term picks up one extra order of
me mi 12  so it is first order in eq 79 to zeroth order
the electron kinetic equation no longer contains collisions instead of eq 84 we have

we may seek the solution of this equation in the form h0

ht re f0e  hehom  where ht re  is an unknown function to
be determined and h0
ehom is the homogeneous solution satisfying
b  h0
ehom  0

111

ie h0
ehom must be constant along the perturbed magnetic
field this is a generalization of eq 96 again assuming
stochastic field lines we conclude that h0
ehom is independent
of space if we rule out spatially uniform perturbations we
may set h0
ehom  0 the unknown function ht re  is readily
expressed in terms of ne and

if the parallel wavelength of the fluctuations is so long that
this is violated kk mfpi  me mi 12  the collision term in
eq 79 is minus first order this is the lowestorder term in

49 summary
the original gyrokinetic description introduced in  3 was
a system of two kinetic equations eq 57 that evolved the
electron and ion distribution functions he  hi and three field
equations eqs 6163 that related  ak and bk to he and
hi  in this section we have taken advantage of the smallness
of the electron mass to treat the electrons as an isothermal
magnetized fluid while ions remained fully gyrokinetic
in mathematical terms we solved the electron kinetic equation and replaced the gyrokinetics with a simpler closed system of equations that evolve 6 unknown functions  ak  bk 
ne  uke and hi  these satisfy two fluidlike evolution equations 95 and 104 three integral relations 107 108 and
87 which involve hi  and the kinetic equation 57 for hi 
the system is simpler because the full electron distribution
function has been replaced by two scalar fields ne and uke 
we now summarize this new system of equations denoting

the generalized energy conserved by eqs 116121 is
given by eq 109
it is worth observing that the lefthand side of eq 116 is
simply minus the component of the electric field along the total magnetic field see eq 37 this was used in  43 to
prove that the magnetic flux described by eq 116 is exactly
conserved see  77 for a discussion of scales at which this
conservation is broken equation 116 is the projection of
the generalized ohms law onto the total magnetic fieldthe
righthand side of this equation is the socalled thermoelectric term this is discussed in more detail in appendix c1
where we also show that eq 117 is the parallel part of faradays law and give a qualitative nongyrokinetic derivation of
eqs 116117
we will refer to eqs 116121 as the equations of isothermal electron fluid they are valid in a broad range of scales
the only constraints are that kk  k gyrokinetic ordering  31 k e  1 electrons are magnetized  481 and
kk mfpi  me mi 12 electrons are isothermal  484 the
region of validity of eqs 116121 in the wavenumber space
is illustrated in fig 4 a particular advantage of this hybrid
fluidkinetic system is that it is uniformly valid across the
transition from magnetized to unmagnetized ions ie from
k i  1 to k i  1
5 turbulence in the inertial range kinetic rmhd

our goal in this section is to derive a reduced set of equations that describe the magnetized plasma in the limit of small
k i  before we proceed with an expansion in k i  we need
to make a formal technical step the usefulness of which will
become clear shortly a reader with no patience for this or
any of the subsequent technical developments may skip to the

underneath each term in eqs 125128 we have indicated

52 subsidiary ordering in k i

in order to carry out a subsidiary expansion in small k i 
we must order all terms in eqs 95104 and 125128 with
respect to k i  let us again assume like we did when expanding the electron equation  4 that the ordering introduced for the gyrokinetics in  31 holds also for the subsidiary expansion in k i  first note that in view of eq 47
we must regard zet0i to be minus first order

532 derivation of eq 18

as we are about to see in order to derive eq 18 we have
to separate the firstorder part of the k i expansion the
easiest way to achieve this is to integrate eq 125 over the
velocity space keeping r constant and expand the resulting
equation in small k i  using eqs 126 and 127 to express
the velocityspace integrals of g we get

also as b b0   eq 12

so  and vk cak are same order
since uk  uki electrons do not contribute to the mass flow
assuming that slow waves and alfvn waves have comparable
energies implies uki  u  as uki is determined by the second
equality in eq 127 we can order g using eq 12

so g is zeroth order in k i  similarly ne n0e  bk b0  
are zeroth order in k i this follows directly from eq 12
together with eq 3 the above considerations allow us to
order all terms in our equations the ordering of the collision
term involving  is explained in appendix b2

underneath each term the lowest order in k i to which it
enters is shown we see that terms containing  are all first
order so it is up to this order that we shall retain terms the
collision term integrated over the velocity space picks up two
extra orders of k i see appendix b1 so it is second order
and can therefore be dropped as a consequence of quasineutrality the zerothorder part of the above equation exactly
coincides with eq 104 ie ni n0i  ne n0e satisfy the
same equation indeed neglecting secondorder terms but
not firstorder ones the nonlinear term in eq 137 the last
term on the lefthand side is

we have established that the alfvnwave component of the
turbulence is decoupled and fully described by the rmhd
equations 17 and 18 this result is the same as that in
 22 but now we have proven that collisions do not affect the
alfvn waves and that a fluidlike description only requires
k i  1 to be valid
54 why alfvn waves ignore collisions

where up to corrections of order k

scalar potential is hiri  ri  the scalar potential taken at
the position of the ion gyrocenter note that in eq 141 the
first term is minus first order in k i see eq 132 the second and third terms are zeroth order eq 134 and all terms
of first and higher orders are omitted in order to compute the
full ion distribution function given by eq 54 we have to
convert hi to the r space keeping terms up to zeroth order

the first two terms can be combined into a maxwellian
with mean perpendicular flow velocity u  ue  these are
the terms responsible for the alfvn waves the remaining
terms which we shall denote  f i  are the perturbation of the
maxwellian in the moving frame of the alfvn wavesthey

this sheds some light on the indifference of alfvn waves
to collisions alfvnic perturbations do not change the
maxwellian character of the ion distribution unlike in a neutral fluid or gas where viscosity arises when particles transport the local mean momentum a distance  mfpi  the particles in a magnetized plasma instantaneously take on the local e  b velocity they take a cyclotron period to adjust so
roughly speaking i plays the role of the mean free path
thus there is no memory of the mean perpendicular motion
and therefore no perpendicular momentum transport
some readers may find it illuminating to notice that
eq 140 can be interpreted as stating simply j  0 the first
two terms represent the divergence of the polarization current
which is perpendicular to the magnetic field22 the last two
terms are b   jk  no contribution to the current arises from
the collisional term in eq 137 as ionion collisions cause
no particle transport to lowest order in k i 
22

the polarizationdrift velocity is formally higher order than ue in the

55 compressive fluctuations

eqs 125128 if only zerothorder terms are kept in these

eqs 2527and the nonlinear scatteringmixing of the slow
waves and the entropy mode by the alfvn waves takes the
form of passive advection of the distribution function g the
density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations are velocityspace moments of g
another way to understand the passive nature of the compressive component of the turbulence discussed above is to
gyrokinetic expansion however since ue does not produce any current
the lowestorder contribution to the perpendicular current comes from the
polarization drift the higherorder contributions to the gyrocenter distribution function did not need to be calculated explicitly because the information about the polarization charge is effectively carried by the quasineutrality
condition 61 we do not belabor this point because in our approach the notion of polarization charge is only ever brought in for interpretative purposes
but is not needed to carry out calculations for further qualitative discussion
of the role of the polarization charge and polarization drift in gyrokinetics

where waw

are the energies of the  and  waves

thus the kinetic cascade in the limit k i  1 is split in
dependently of the collisionality into three cascades of waw


waw
and wcompr  the compressive cascade is in fact split
into three independent cascadesthe splitting is different in
the collisional limit appendix d2 and in the collisionless
one  625 figure 5 schematically summarizes both the
splitting of the kinetic cascade that we have worked out so far
and the upcoming developments

153

we see that the kinetic energy of the alfvnic fluctuations
has emerged from the ionentropy part of the generalized energy the first two terms in eq 153 are the total kinetic
plus magnetic energy of the alfvn waves denoted waw  as
we learned from  53 it cascades independently of the rest of

in  4 gyrokinetics was reduced to a hybrid fluidkinetic
system by means of an expansion in the electron mass which
was valid for k e  1 in this section we have further restricted the scale range by taking k i  1 and as a result have
been able to achieve a further reduction in the complexity of
the kinetic theory describing the turbulent cascades the reduced theory derived here evolves 5 unknown functions 
 bk  ne and g the stream and flux functions  and 
are related to the fluid quantities perpendicular velocity and
magnetic field perturbations via eq 16 and to the electromagnetic potentials  ak via eq 135 they satisfy a closed
system of equations eqs 1718 which describe the decoupled cascade of alfvn waves these are the same equations
that arise from the mhd approximations but we have now
proven that their validity does not depend on the assumption
of high collisionality the fluid limit and extends to scales
well below the mean free path but above the ion gyroscale
the physical reasons for this are explained in  54 the density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations the compressive fluctuations or the slow waves and the entropy mode in
the mhd limit now require a kinetic description in terms of
the ion distribution function g or  f i  eq 149 evolved by
the kinetic equation 145 or eq 150 the kinetic equation
contains ne and bk  which are in turn calculated in terms
of the velocityspace integrals of g via eqs 146 and 148
or eqs 151 and 152 the nonlinear evolution turbulent
cascade of g bk and ne is due solely to passive advection
of g by the alfvnwave turbulence

known as kinetic mhd or kmhd see kulsrud 1964 1983 kmhd is derived for magnetized plasmas i  mfpi  under the assumption that ks  1
and   s but without assuming either strong anisotropy kk  k  or
small fluctuations b  b0  the krmhd equations 155159 can be
recovered from kmhd by applying to it the gkrmhd ordering eq 12
and  31 and an expansion in me mi 12 schekochihin et al 2007 this
means that the k i expansion  5 which for kmhd is the primary expansion commutes with the gyrokinetic expansion  3 and the me mi 12
expansion  4 both of which preceded it in this paper

612 dissipation

the diffusion terms add dissipation to the equations because diffusion occurs along the field lines of the total magnetic field mean field plus perturbation the diffusive terms

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
are nonlinear and the dissipation process also involves interaction with the alfvn waves we can estimate the characteristic
parallel scale at which the diffusion terms become important
by balancing the nonlinear cascade time and the typical diffusion time

where we have used eq 165
technically speaking the cutoff given by eq 168 always
lies in the range of kk that is outside the region of validity
of the smallkk mfpi expansion adopted in the derivation of
eqs 161163 in fact in the lowbeta limit the collisional
cutoff falls manifestly in the collisionless scale range ie
the collisional fluid approximation breaks down before the
slowwave and entropy cascades are damped and one must use
the collisionless kinetic limit to calculate the damping see
 622 the situation is different in the highbeta limit in
this case the expansion in small kk mfpi can be reformulated

as an expansion in small 1 i and the cutoff falls within the

ion heating via the standard fluid collisional route involving
the development of small parallel scales in the position space

the fluctuations that are damped at the rate 190 are predominantly of the magneticfield strength the damping
 rate is a
constant independent of kk  small fraction  1 i of the

effect known in astrophysics as the barnes 1966 damping and in plasma

to carry out the gyrokinetic expansion in small kk k  first and then take
the highbeta limit as a subsidiary expansion a more standard approach in
the linear theory of plasma waves is to take the limit of high i while treating
kk k as an arbitrary quantity a detailed calculation of the damping rates

624 linear parallel phase mixing

in dynamical terms how does the kinetic system eq 181
arrange for the integral of the distribution function g vk  to
decay while allowing its norm to grow this is a very well
known phenomenon of linear phase mixing landau 1946
hammett et al 1991 krommes  hu 1994 krommes 1999
watanabe  sugama 2004 to put it in simple terms the
solution of the linearized eq 181 consists of the inhomogeneous part which contains the collisionless damping and the
homogeneous part solution of the lefthand side  0 given by
g  eikk vkt  the socalled ballistic response this is also the
nonlinear solution if t and kk are interpreted as lagrangian
variables in the frame of the alfvn waves see  63 as
time goes on this part of the solution becomes increasingly
oscillatory in vk  so its velocity integral tends to zero while
its amplitude does not decay it is such ballistic contributions
that make up the g term in eq 200
as the velocity gradient of g increases with time
 g vk  kktg  at some point it can become sufficiently
large to activate the collision integral the righthand side of
eq 157 which has so far been neglected this way the collisionless damping of compressive fluctuations can be turned
into ion heatinga simple example of a more general principle of how electromagnetic fluctuation energy is transferred
into heat via the entropy part of the generalized energy  35

indeed we will prove in  625 that the invariants wcompr
are
constituent parts of the overall generalized energy functional
for the compressive fluctuations so their cascade to small
scales in phase space is part of the overall kinetic cascade introduced in  34
it is not entirely clear how efficient is the parallelphasemixing route to ion heating and therefore whether the collisionlessly damped energy of compressive fluctuations ends up
in the ion heat or rather reaches the ion gyroscale and couples
back to the alfvnic component of the turbulence  71 the
answer to this question will depend on whether compressive
fluctuations can develop large kk a nontrivial issue further
discussed in  63

we will now show how the generalized energy for compressive fluctuations in the collisionless regime incorporates
the two invariants derived in  623

where  is defined by eq 204 and wcompr
are the two independent invariants that we derived in  623 thus the generalized energy for compressive fluctuations splits into three in
dependently cascading parts wcompr
associated with the density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations and a purely kinetic part given by the first term in eq 213 see fig 5
the dynamical evolution of this purely kinetic component is
described by eq 212it is a passively mixed undamped
ballistictype mode
all three cascade channels lead to small perpendicular spatial scales via passive mixing by the alfvnic turbulence and
also to small scales in vk via the parallel phase mixing process discussed in  624 note that g is subject to this process
as well
63 parallel and perpendicular cascades

let us return to the kinetic equation 157 and transform
it to the lagrangian frame associated with the velocity field
u      of the alfvn waves t r  t r0  where
z t

214
rt r0   r0

in this frame the convective derivative ddt defined in
eq 160 turns into t while the parallel spatial gradient
b   can be calculated by employing the cauchy solution for
the perturbed magnetic field b     
b t r

where r is given by eq 214 and 0  r0  then


 216
b    b0 r0   0 r    b0 r0   0 
s0
where s0 is the arc length along the perturbed magnetic field
taken at t  0 if b 0 r0   0 s0  z0  thus in the lagrangian frame associated with the alfvnic component of
the turbulence eq 157 is linear this means that if the
effect of finite ion gyroradius is neglected the krmhd system does not give rise to a cascade of density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations to smaller scales along the moving
perturbed field lines ie b  ne and b  bk do not increase in contrast there is a perpendicular cascade cascade
in k  the perpendicular wandering of field lines due to the
alfvnic turbulence causes passive mixing of ne and bk in
the direction transverse to the magnetic field see  26 for a
quick recapitulation of the standard scaling argument on the
53
passive cascade that leads to a k in the perpendicular direction figure 7 illustrates this situation26
26

note that effectively there is also a cascade in kk if the latter is measured along the unperturbed fieldmore precisely a cascade in kz  this is
due to the perpendicular deformation of the perturbed magnetic field by the
alfvnwave turbulence since  grows while b   remains the same we
have from eq 123 z  b b0    

f ig  7 lagrangian mixing of passive fields fluctuations develop small
scales across but not along the exact field lines

we emphasize that this lack of nonlinear refinement of the
scale of ne and bk along the moving field lines is a particular property of the compressive component of the turbulence
not shared by the alfvn waves indeed unlike eq 157 the
rmhd equations 155156 do not reduce to a linear form
under the lagrangian transformation 214 so the alfvn
waves should develop small scales both across and along the
perturbed magnetic field
whether the density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations develop small scales along the magnetic field has direct
physical and observational consequences damping of these
fluctuations both in the collisional and collisionless regimes
discussed in  612 and  622 respectively depends precisely on their scale along the perturbed field indeed the
linear results derived there are exact in the lagrangian frame
214 to summarize these results the damping rate of ne
and bk at i  1 is

  vthi mfpi kk0


  vthi kk0 

kk0 mfpi  1

kk0 mfpi  1

217
218

where kk0  b   is the wavenumber along the perturbed field
ie if there is no parallel cascade the wavenumber of the
largescale stirring
whether this damping cuts off the cascades of ne and bk
depends on the relative magnitudes of the damping rate  for
a given k and the characteristic rate at which the alfvn
waves cause ne and bk to cascade to higher k  this rate
is a  kka va  where kka is the parallel wave number of the
alfvn waves that have the same k  since the alfvn waves
do have a parallel cascade assuming scalebyscale critical
balance 3 leads to eq 5
23 13

kka  k l0



219

if in contrast to the alfvn waves ne and bk have no parallel cascade kk0 does not grow with k  so for large enough
k  kk0  kka and   a  this means that despite the damping the density and fieldstrength fluctuations should have
perpendicular cascades extending to the ion gyroscale
the validity of the argument at the beginning of this section that ruled out the parallel cascade of ne and bk is not
quite as obvious as it might appear lithwick  goldreich
2001 argued that the dissipation of ne and bk at the ion
gyroscale would cause these fluctuations to become uncorrelated at the same parallel scales as the alfvnic fluctuations by
which they are mixed ie kk0  kka  the damping rate then
becomes comparable to the cascade rate cutting off the cascades of density and fieldstrength fluctuations at kk mfpi  1
the corresponding perpendicular cutoff wavenumber is see
eq 219
12 32

k  l0 mfpi 

220

asymptotically speaking in a weakly collisional plasma
this cutoff is far above the ion gyroscale k i  1 however the relatively small value of mfpi in the warm ism
which was the main focus of lithwick  goldreich 2001

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
meant that the numerical value of the perpendicular cutoff
scale given by eq 220 was in fact quite close both to
the ion gyroscale see table 1 and to the observational estimates for the inner scale of the electrondensity fluctuations
in the ism spangler  gwinn 1990 armstrong et al 1995
thus it was not possible to tell whether eq 220 rather than
k  1
i  represented the correct prediction
the situation is rather different in the nearly collisionless case of the solar wind where the cutoff given by
eq 220 would mean that very little density or fieldstrength fluctuations should be detected above the ion gyroscale
observations do not support such a conclusion the density fluctuations appear to follow a k53 law
at all scales larger than a few times i lovelace et al
1970 woo  armstrong 1979 celnikier et al 1983 1987
coles  harmon 1989 marsch  tu 1990b coles et al
1991 consistently with the expected behavior of an undamped passive scalar field see  26 an extended range
of k53 scaling above the ion gyroscale is also observed for
the fluctuations of the magneticfield strength marsch  tu
1990b bershadskii  sreenivasan 2004 hnat et al 2005
alexandrova et al 2008a
these observational facts suggest that the cutoff formula
220 does not apply this does not however conclusively
vitiate the lithwick  goldreich 2001 theory heuristically
their argument is plausible although it is perhaps useful
to note that in order for the effect of the perpendicular dissipation terms not present in the krmhd equations 157159 to be felt the density and fieldstrength fluctuations
should reach the ion gyroscale in the first place quantitatively the failure of the compressive fluctuations in the
solar wind to be damped could still be consistent with the
lithwick  goldreich 2001 theory because of the relative
weakness of the collisionless damping especially at low beta
 622the explanation they themselves favor the way to
check observationally whether this explanation suffices would
be to make a comparative study of the compressive fluctuations for solarwind data with different values of i  if the
strength of the damping is the decisive factor one should always see cascades of both ne and bk at low i  no cascades
at i  1 and a cascade of bk but not ne at high i in
this limit the damping of the density fluctuations is strong
of the fieldstrength weak see  622 if on the other hand
the parallel cascade of the compressive fluctuations is intrinsically inefficient very little i dependence is expected and a
perpendicular cascade should be seen in all cases
obviously an even more direct observational or numerical test would be the detection or nondetection of nearperfect alignment of the density and fieldstrength structures
with the moving field lines not with the mean magnetic
fieldsee footnote 26 but it is not clear how to measure
this reliably it is interesting in this context that in nearthesun measurements the density fluctuations are reported
to have the form of highly anisotropic filaments aligned with
the magnetic field armstrong et al 1990 grall et al 1997
woo  habbal 1997 another intriguing piece of observational evidence is the discovery that the local structure of the
magneticfieldstrength and density fluctuations at 1 au is in
a certain sense correlated with the solar cycle kiyani et al
2007 hnat et al 2007 wicks et al 2009this suggests a
dependence on initial conditions that is absent in the alfvnic
fluctuations and that presumably should also disappear in the
compressive fluctuations if the latter are fully mixed both in

the perpendicular and parallel directions
7 turbulence in the dissipation range electron rmhd
and the entropy cascade

71 transition at the ion gyroscale

the validity of the theory discussed in  5 and  6 breaks
down when k i  1 as the ion gyroscale is approached
the alfvn waves are no longer decoupled from the rest of
the plasma dynamics all modes now contain perturbations
of density and magneticfield strength and can be collisionlessly damped because of the lowfrequency nature of the
alfvnwave cascade   i even at k i  1 eq 46
so the ion cyclotron resonance   kk vk  i  is not important while the landau one   kk vk  is the linear theory of this collisionless damping in the gyrokinetic approximation is worked out in detail in howes et al 2006 see
also gary  borovsky 2008 figure 8 shows the solutions of
their dispersion relation that illustrate how the alfvn wave
becomes a dispersive kinetic alfvn wave kaw see  73
and collisionless damping becomes important as the ion gyroscale is reached
we stress that this transition 
occurs at the ion gyroscale not
at the ion inertial scale di  i  i except in the limit of cold
ions   t0i t0e  1 see appendix e this statement is true
even when i is not order unity as illustrated in fig 8 for the
three cases plotted there k di  1 corresponds to k i  01
1 and 10 for i  001 1 and 100 respectively but there is
no trace of the ion inertial scale in the solutions of the linear
dispersion relation nonlinearly in the limit i  1 we may
consider thescales k di  1 and expand the gyrokinetics in
k i  k di i  1 in a way similar to how it was done in  5
and obtain precisely the same results alfvnic fluctuations
described by the rmhd equations and compressive fluctuations passively advected by them and satisfying the reduced
kinetic equation derived in  55 thus even though di  i
at low beta there is no change in the nature of the turbulent
cascade until k i  1 is reached
the nonlinear theory of what happens at k i  1 is very
poorly understood it is however possible to make progress
by examining what kind of fluctuations emerge on the other
side of the transition at k i  1 as we will demonstrate
below it turns out that another turbulent cascadethis time
of kawis possible in this socalled dissipation range it
can transfer the energy of kawlike fluctuations down to the
electron gyroscale where electron landau damping becomes
important see howes et al 2006 some observational evidence of kaw is indeed available in the solar wind and the
magnetosphere bale et al 2005 grison et al 2005 see further discussion in  824 below we derive the equations that
describe kawlike fluctuations in the scale range k i  1
k e  1  72 and work out a kolmogorovstyle scaling
theory for this cascade  75
because of the presence of the collisionless damping at the
ion gyroscale only a certain fraction of the turbulent power
arriving there from the inertial range is converted into the
kaw cascade while the rest is landaudamped the damping leads to the heating of the ions but the process of depositing the collisionlessly damped fluctuation energy into the ion
heat is nontrivial because as we explained in  35 collisions
do need to play a role in order for true heating to occur as
we explained in  35 and will see specifically for the dissipation range in  78 the electromagneticfluctuation energy
does not disappear as a result of the landau damping but is
converted into ion entropy fluctuations while the generalized

time is comparable or shorter than the wave period ie   12 thus in these plots the damping at k i  1 is relatively weak for i  1 relatively
strong for low beta and very strong for high beta

energy is conserved collisions are then accessed and ion
heating achieved via a purely kinetic phenomenon the ion
entropy cascade in phase space nonlinear phase mixing for
which a theory is developed in  79 and  710 a similar process of conversion of the kaw energy into electron entropy
fluctuations and then electron heat is treated in  712
figure 5 illustrates the routes energy takes from the ion gyroscale towards heating crucially it is at k i  1 that it
is decided how much energy would eventually go into the
ions and how much into electrons27 how this distribution
of energy depends on plasma parameters i and t0i t0e 
is an open theoretical question28 of considerable astrophysical interest eg the efficiency of ion heating is a key unknown in the theory of advectiondominated accretion flows
quataert  gruzinov 1999 see discussion in  85 and of
the solar corona eg cranmer  van ballegooijen 2003 we
will also see in  711 that it may determine the form of the
observed dissipationrange spectra in space plasmas
a short summary of this section is given in  714
72 equations of electron reduced mhd

the derivation is straightforward when ai  k i  1 all
bessel functions in eqs 118120 are small so the integrals
of the ion distribution function vanish and eqs 118120 become

where we used the definitions 135 of the stream and flux
functions  and 
27 some of the energy of compressive fluctuations may go into ion heat via
collisional  612 or collisionless  622 damping of these fluctuations
in the inertial range whether this is a significant ion heating mechanism
depends on the efficiency of the parallel cascade see  624 and  63
28 how much energy is converted into ion entropy fluctuations in the process of a nonlinear turbulent cascade is not necessarily directly related to the
strength of the linear collisionless damping

these equations are a reflection of the fact that for k i 
1 the ion response is effectively purely boltzmann with the
gyrokinetic part hi contributing nothing to the fields or flows
see eq 54 with hi omitted hi does however play an important role in the energy balance and ion heating as explained
in  78710 below the boltzmann response for ion density is expressed by eq 221 equation 222 states that the
parallel ion flow velocity can be neglected finally eq 223
expresses the pressure balance for boltzmann and therefore
isothermal electrons eq 103 and ions if we write

which combined with eq 221 gives eq 223 we remind
the reader that the perpendicular ampres law from which
eq 223 was derived eq 66 via eq 120 is in gyrokinetics indeed equivalent to the statement of perpendicular pressure balance see  33

coincides with our eqs 226227 in the effectively incompressible limits of i  1 or e  i z  1 when betas are
arbitrary density fluctuations cannot be neglected compared
to the magneticfieldstrength fluctuations eq 225 and
give rise to perpendicular ion flows with   ui 6 0 thus our
ermhd system constitutes the appropriate generalization of
emhd for lowfrequency anisotropic fluctuations without the
assumption of incompressibility
a more tenuous relationship also exists between our
ermhd system and the socalled hall mhd which like
emhd is based on the magnetic field being frozen into
the electron flow but includes the ion motion via the standard mhd momentum equation eq 8 strictly speaking hall mhd can only be used in the limit of cold ions
  t0i t0e  1 see eg ito et al 2004 hirose et al 2004
and appendix e in which case it can be shown to reduce
to eqs 226227 in the appropriate smallscale limit appendix e although   1 is not a natural assumption for
most space and astrophysical plasmas hall mhd has due to
its simplicity been a popular theoretical paradigm in the studies of space and astrophysical plasma turbulence see  826
we have therefore devoted appendix e to showing how this
approximation fits into the theoretical framework proposed
here namely we derive the anisotropic lowfrequency version of the hall mhd approximation from gyrokinetics under
the assumption   1 and discuss the role of the ion inertial
and ion sound scales which acquire physical significance in
this limit however outside this appendix we assume   1
everywhere and shall not use hall mhd
the validity of the ermhd equations as a model for
plasma dynamics in the dissipation range is further discussed

74 finiteamplitude kinetic alfvn waves
as we are about to argue for a critically balanced kaw
turbulence in a fashion analogous to the gs theory for the
alfvn waves  12 it is a natural question to ask how similar the nonlinear properties of a putative kaw cascade will be
to an alfvnwave cascade as in the case of alfvn waves
there are two counterpropagating linear modes eqs 230
and 231 and it turns out that certain superpositions of these
modes kaw packets are also exact nonlinear solutions of
eqs 226227 let us show that this is the case
we might look for the nonlinear solutions of eqs 226227
by requiring that the nonlinear terms vanish since b

where c1 and c2 are constants whether such solutions are

of the linearized equations is also an exact nonlinear solution
as we have shown above a superposition of monochromatic
kaw that have a fixed k  or somewhat more generally satisfy eq 235 with a fixed c2  is still an exact solution
note that a similar procedure applied to the rmhd equations 1718 returns the elsasser solutions perturbations of

between these finiteamplitude alfvenwave packets and the
finiteamplitude kaw packets discussed above is that nonlinear interactions can occur not just between counterpropagating kaw but also between copropagating onesa natural
conclusion because kaw are dispersive their group velocity
along the guide field is  va k i  so copropagating waves
with different k can catch up with each other and interact30

for the purposes of scaling arguments and orderofmagnitude estimates we set z  1 but keep the i dependence so low and highbeta limits could be recovered if
necessary the fact that fixedk kaw packets which satisfy eq 237 with   1k  are exact nonlinear solutions
of the ermhd equations  74 lends some credence to this
assumption
assuming scalespace locality of interactions implies a
constantflux kaw cascade analogously to eq 1

where kaw is the cascade time and kaw is the kaw energy
flux proportional to the fraction of the total flux  or the total
turbulent power pext  see  34 that was converted into the
kaw cascade at the ion gyroscale
using eqs 226227 and eq 237 it is not hard to see
that the characteristic nonlinear decorrelation time is 2  
if the turbulence is strong then this time is comparable to
the inverse kaw frequency eq 230 scale by scale and we
may assume the cascade time is comparable to either

75 scalings for kaw turbulence

a scaling theory for the turbulence described by eqs 221227 can be constructed along the same lines as the gs theory
for the alfvnwave turbulence  12 namely we shall assume that the turbulence below the ion gyroscale consists of
kawlike fluctuations with kk  k quataert  gruzinov
1999 and that the interactions between them are critically
balanced cho  lazarian 2004 ie that the propagation
time and nonlinear interaction time are comparable at every
scale we stress that none of these assumptions are strictly
speaking inevitable31 and in fact neither were they inevitable in the case of alfvn waves since we have derived eqs 226227 from gyrokinetics the anisotropy of
the fluctuations described by these equations is hardwired
but it is not guaranteed that the actual physical cascade below the ion gyroscale is indeed anisotropic although analysis of solarwind measurements does seem to indicate that
at least a significant fraction of it is see leamon et al
1998 hamilton et al 2008 numerical simulations based
on eq 228 biskamp et al 1996 1999 ghosh et al 1996
ng et al 2003 cho  lazarian 2004 shaikh  zank 2005
have revealed that the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations
73
scales as k  the outcome consistent with the assumptions
stated above let us outline the argument that leads to this
scaling
first assume that the fluctuations are kawlike and that 
and  eq 231 have similar scaling this implies

30 the calculation above is analogous to the calculation by
mahajan  krishan 2005 for incompressible hall mhd ie essentially the highe limit of the equations discussed in appendix e but
the result is more general in the sense that it holds at arbitrary ion and
electron betas the mahajankrishan solution in the emhd limit amounts
to noticing that eq 228 becomes linear for forcefree beltrami magnetic
perturbations   b  b substituting eq 229 into this equation
and using eq 223 we see that the forcefree equation is equivalent
to eqs 234236 if c2  2 and the incompressible limit i  1 or
e  i z  1 is taken

in other words this says that z  b b0    and so

our scaling arguments do not violate the gyrokinetic ordering
see  21 and  31 equation 239 is the criticalbalance assumption for kaw as in the case of the alfvn waves  12
we might argue physically that the critical balance is set up because the parallel correlation length lk is determined by the
condition that a wave can propagate the distance lk in one
nonlinear decorrelation time corresponding to the perpendicular correlation length

that kaw turbulence is not weak and that the critical balance
hypothesis applies
for kawlike fluctuations the density eq 221 and
magnetic field eqs 223 and 231 have the same spec73
trum as the scalar potential ie k  while the electric field
13
e  k  has a k spectrum the solarwind fluctuation
spectra reported by bale et al 2005 indeed are consistent
with a transition to kaw turbulence around the ion gyroscale
k53 magnetic and electricfield power spectra at ki  1 are
replaced for ki  1 with what appears to be consistent with
a k73 scaling for the magneticfield spectrum and a k13 for
the electric one see fig 1 a similar result is recovered in
fully gyrokinetic simulations with i  1   1 howes et al
2008b however not all solarwind observations are quite as

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
straightforwardly supportive of the notion of the kaw cascade and much steeper magneticfluctuation spectra have also
been reported eg denskat et al 1983 leamon et al 1998
smith et al 2006 possible reasons for this will emerge in
 76 and  711 and the solarwind data are further discussed
in  824 and  825
76 validity of the electron rmhd and the effect of electron

landau damping
the ermhd equations derived in  7 are valid provided
k i  1 and also provided it is sufficient to use the leading
order in the massratio expansion isothermal electrons see
 4 in particular this means that the electron landau damping is neglected asymptotically speaking this is a rigorous
limit but one must be cautious in applying it to real plasmas since the width of the scale range where k i  1 and
k e  1 is only  mi me 12  43 for some values of the
plasma parameters t0i t0e and i  there may not be a very
broad interval of scales where the electron landau damping
is truly negligible consider for example the lowbeta limit
i  1 in this limit the kaw frequency is   k i kk va
eq 230 the electron landaudamping becomes important when   kk vthe  or k e  i  1 so the ermhd
approximation breaks down and consequently the kaw cascade if any should be interrupted well before the electron
gyroscale is reached figure 8 shows the solution of the
full gyrokinetic dispersion relation howes et al 2006 for
small unity and large i  one can judge for which scales and
how well or how badly the ermhd approximation holds
from the precision with which the exact frequency follows the
asymptotic solution eq 230 and from the relative strength
of the damping compared to the real frequency of the waves
nonnegligible electron landau damping may affect turbulence spectra because one can no longer assume a constant
flux of kaw energy as we did in  75 to evaluate the consequences of this effect howes et al 2008a constructed a simple model of spectral energy transfer and concluded that landau damping leads to steepening of the kaw spectraone
of several possible reasons for steep dissipationrange spectra
observed in space plasmas see also  711
77 unfreezing of flux
as ermhd is a limit of the isothermalelectronfluid system  4 the magneticfield lines remain unbroken see
 43 within the orderings employed above small mass ratio ii   i  1   1 the flux unfreezes only in the
vicinity of the electron gyroscale it is interesting to evaluate
somewhat more precisely the scale at which this happens as a
function of plasma parameters
physically there are three kinds of mechanisms by which
the flux conservation is broken electron inertia the effects of
finite electron gyroradius and ohmic resistivity let us take
the vk moment of the electron gyrokinetic equation eq 57
s  e integration at constant r and use eq 222 to evaluate
the inertial term in the resulting parallel electron momentum
equation

where de  e  e is the electron inertial scale and e

 that the
electron inertia becomes important when k e  e  the

33

finitegyroradius effects enter when k e  1 thus at low
e  the electron inertia becomes important above the electron
gyroscale whereas at high e  the finitegyroradius effects enter first finally the ohmic resistivity comes from the collision term see appendix b4

although we can write wkaw as the sum of the energies of
the  and  linear kaw eigenmodes eq 231 which
are also exact nonlinear solutions  74 the two do not cascade independently and can exchange
energy note that the
r
ermhd equations also conserve d 3 r  which is readily
interpreted as the helicity of the perturbed magnetic field see
appendix f3 however it does not affect the kaw cascade
discussed in  75 because it can be argued to have a tendency
to cascade inversely appendix f6
comparing the way the generalized energy is split above
and below the ion gyroscale see  56 for the k i  1 limit
we interpret what happens at the k i  1 transition as a redistribution of the power that arrived from large scales between
a cascade of kaw and a cascade of the minus gyrocenter
entropy in the phase space see fig 5 the latter cascade
is the way in which the energy diverted from the electromagnetic fluctuations by the collisionless damping waveparticle

34

schekochihin et al

interaction can be transferred to the collisional scales and deposited into heat  71 the concept of entropy cascade as
the key agent in the heating of the plasma was introduced in
 35 where we promised a more detailed discussion later on
we now proceed to this discussion
79 entropy cascade

the iongyrocenter distribution function hi satisfies the ion
gyrokinetic equation 121 where ionelectron collisions are
neglected under the massratio expansion at k i  1 the
dominant contribution to hiri comes from the electromagnetic fluctuations associated with kaw turbulence since
the kaw cascade is decoupled from the entropy cascade hi
is a passive tracer of the ringaveraged kaw turbulence in
phase space expanding the bessel functions in the expression for hiri k ai  1 in eq 69 with s  i and making
use of eqs 222223 and of the kaw scaling   k i
eq 231 it is not hard to show that

791 nonlinear perpendicular phase mixing

the waveparticle interaction term the first term on the
right hand sides of these two equations will shortly be seen
to be subdominant at k i  1 it represents the source of
the invariant whi due to the collisionless damping at the ion
gyroscale of some fraction of the energy arriving from the inertial range in a stationary turbulent state we should have
dwhi dt  0 and this source should be balanced on average by
the negative definite collisional dissipation term   heating
see  35 this balance can only be achieved if hi develops
small scales in the velocity space and carries the generalized
energy or in this case entropy to scales in the phase space at
which collisions are important a quick way to see this is by
recalling that the collision operator has two velocity derivatives and can only balance the terms on the lefthand side of
eq 249 if

the condition 251 means that the collision rate can be arbitrarily smallthis will always be compensated by the sufficiently fine velocityspace structure of the distribution function to produce a finite amount of entropy production heating independent of ii in the limit ii  0 the situation bears some resemblance to the emergence of small spatial scales in neutralfluid turbulence with arbitrarily small
but nonzero viscosity kolmogorov 1941 the analogy
is not perfect however because the ion gyrokinetic equation 249 does not contain a nonlinear interaction term that
would explicitly cause a cascade in the velocity space instead the ringaveraged kaw turbulence mixes hi in the
gyrocenter space via the nonlinear term in eq 249 so hi
will have smallscale structure in ri on characteristic scales
much smaller than i  let us assume that the dominant nonlinear effect is a local interaction of the smallscale fluctuations of hi with the similarly smallscale component of hiri 
since ring averaging is involved and k i is large the values of hiri corresponding to two velocities v and v will
come from spatially decorrelated electromagnetic fluctuations
if k v i and k v i the argument of the bessel function
in eq 247 differ by order unity ie for

see fig 10 this relation gives a correspondence between
the decorrelation scales of hi in the position and velocity
space combining eqs 252 and 251 we see that there is
a collisional cutoff scale determined by k i  ii 12 
132 the cutoff scale is much smaller than the ion gyroscale
in the range between these scales collisional dissipation is
small the ion entropy fluctuations are transferred across this
scale range by means of a cascade for which we will construct a scaling theory in  792 and for the case without the
background kaw turbulence in  710
it is important to emphasize that no matter how small the
collisional cutoff scale is all of the generalized energy channeled into the entropy cascade at the ion gyroscale eventually
32 another source of smallscale spatial smoothing comes from the per2 2 h that arise in
pendicular gyrocenterdiffusion terms  ii vvthi 2 k

the ringaveraged collision operators eg the second term in the model
operator b13 these terms again enforce a cutoff wavenumber such that

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
reaches it and is converted into heat note that the rate at
which this happens is in general amplitudedependent because
the process is nonlinear although we will argue in  794 see
also  7103 that the nonlinear cascade time and the parallel
linear propagation particle streaming time are related by a
criticalbalancelike condition we will also argue there that
the linear parallel phase mixing which can generate small
scales in vk  is a less efficient process than the nonlinear perpendicular one discussed above
it is interesting to note the connection between the entropy
cascade and certain aspects of the gyrofluid closure formalism developed by dorland  hammett 1993 in their theory the emergence of small scales in v manifested itself as
the growth of highorder v moments of the gyrocenter distribution function they correctly identified this effect as a consequence of the nonlinear perpendicular phase mixing of the
gyrocenter distribution function caused by a perpendicularvelocityspace spread in the ringaveraged e  b velocities
given by hue iri    hiri in our notation arising at and
below the ion gyroscale

since entropy is a conserved quantity we will follow the

analogously to eq 1

253

where h is the entropy flux proportional to the fraction of the
total turbulent power  or pext  see  34 that was diverted
into the entropy cascade at the ion gyroscale and is the cascade time that we now need to find
by the criticalbalance assumption the decorrelation time
of the electromagnetic fluctuations in kaw turbulence is
comparable at each scale to the kaw period at that scale and
to the nonlinear interaction time eq 239

the characteristic time associated with the nonlinear term in
eq 249 is longer than kaw by a factor of i 12 due to
the ring averaging which reduces the strength of the nonlinear
interaction this weakness of the nonlinearity makes it possible to develop a systematic analytical theory of the entropy
cascade schekochihin  cowley 2009 it is also possible
to estimate the cascade time via a more qualitative argument
analogous to that first devised by kraichnan 1965 for the
weak turbulence of alfvn waves during each kaw correlation time kaw  the nonlinearity changes the amplitude of hi
by only a small amount

255

these changes accumulate with time as a random walk
so after time t the cumulative change in amplitude is

after which the cumulative change in amplitude is comparable to the amplitude itself which gives using eq 254

tatsuno et al 2009ab
794 parallel phase mixing

another assumption which was made implicitly was that
the parallel phase mixing due to the second term on the lefthand side of eq 249 could be ignored this requires justification especially because it is with this ballistic term
that one traditionally associates the emergence of smallscale
structure in the velocity space eg krommes  hu 1994
krommes 1999 watanabe  sugama 2004 the effect of
the parallel phase mixing is to produce small scales in velocity space vk  1kkt let us assume that the kaw turbulence imparts its parallel decorrelation scale to hi and use the

propagation time is comparable to the cascade time or kk vk

710 entropy cascade in the absence of kaw turbulence

it is not currently known how one might determine analytically what fraction of the turbulent power arriving from
the inertial range to the ion gyroscale is channeled into the
kaw cascade and what fraction is dissipated via the kinetic
ionentropy cascade introduced in  79 perhaps it can only
be determined by direct numerical simulations it is certainly a fact that in many solarwind measurements the relatively shallow magneticenergy spectra associated with the
kaw cascade  75 fail to appear and much steeper spectra
are detected close to k4  see leamon et al 1998 smith et al
2006 in view of this evidence it is interesting to ask what
would be the nature of electromagnetic fluctuations below the
ion gyroscale if the kaw cascade failed to be launched ie
if all or most of the turbulent power were directed into the
entropy cascade ie if w  whi in  78
7101 equations

it is again possible to derive a closed set of equations for all
fluctuating quantities
let us assume and verify a posteriori  7104 that the
characteristic frequency of such fluctuations is much lower
than the kaw frequency eq 230 so that the first term in
eq 116 is small and the equation reduces to the balance of
the other two terms this gives

where we have approximated b    z which will indeed be shown to be correct in  7104
together with the ion gyrokinetic equation which determines hi  eqs 261264 form a closed set they describe
lowfrequency fluctuations of the density and electromagnetic
field due solely to the presence of fluctuations of hi below the
ion gyroscale
it follows from eq 263 that bk b0 contributes subdominantly to hiri eq 69 with s  i and ai  1 it will be

verified a posteriori  7104 that the same is true for ak 
therefore eqs 247 and 249 continue to hold as in the
case with kaw this means that eqs 249 and 262 form
a closed subset thus the kinetic ionentropy cascade is selfregulating in the sense that hi is no longer passive as it was
in the presence of kaw turbulence  79 but is mixed by
the ringaveraged electrostatic fluctuations of the scalar potential which themselves are produced by hi according to
eq 262
the magnetic fluctuations are passive and determined by
the electrostatic and entropy fluctuations via eqs 263
and 264
7102 scalings

from eq 262 we can establish a correspondence between
 and hi the electrostatic fluctuations and the fluctuations

where the factor of i 12 comes from the bessel function

v integration of the oscillatory factor in the bessel function
times hi  which decorrelates on small scales in the velocity
space and therefore its integral accumulates in a randomwalklike fashion the velocityspace scales are related to the
spatial scales via eq 252 which was arrived at by an argument not specific to kawlike fluctuations and therefore
continues to hold
using eq 267 we find that the waveparticle interaction
term in the righthand side of eq 249 is subdominant comparing it with hi t shows that it is smaller by a factor of
i 32  1 therefore it is the nonlinear term in eq 249
that controls the scalings of hi and  
we now assume again the scalespace locality and constancy of the entropy flux so eq 253 holds the cascade
decorrelation time is equal to the characteristic time associated with the nonlinear term in eq 249  i 12 2  
substituting this into eq 253 and using eq 267 we arrive at the desired scaling relations for the entropy cascade

confirmed in the numerical simulations by tatsuno et al
2009ab who studied decaying electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulence in two spatial dimensions they also found velocityspace scalings in accord with eq 252 using a spectral
representation of the correlation functions in the v space
based on the hankel transform of the distribution function

7103 parallel cascade and parallel phase mixing

we have again ignored the ballistic term the second on
the lefthand side in eq 249 we will estimate the efficiency of the parallel spatial cascade of the ion entropy and of
the associated parallel phase mixing by making a conjecture
analogous to the critical balance assuming that any two perpendicular planes only remain correlated provided particles
can stream between them in one nonlinear decorrelation time
cf  12 and  794 we conclude that the parallel particlestreaming frequency kk vk should be comparable at each scale
to the inverse nonlinear time 1  so
kk vthi  1

271

as we explained in  794 the parallel scales in the velocity
space generated via the ballistic term are related to the parallel
wavenumbers by vk  1kkt from eq 271 we find that
after one cascade time  the typical parallel velocity scale is
vk vthi  1 so the parallel phase mixing is again much less
efficient than the perpendicular one
note that eq 271 combined with eq 270 means that the
anisotropy is again characterized by the scaling relation kk 
13

k  similarly to the case of kaw turbulence see eq 241
and  794
7104 scalings for the magnetic fluctuations

whence the spectrum of these fluctuations is k 
the scaling of ak the perpendicular magnetic fluctuations
depends on the relation between kk and k  indeed the ratio
between the first and the third terms on the lefthand side of
eq 264 or equivalently between the first and second terms
1
on the righthand side of eq 266 is  kk vthi  for a critically balanced cascade this makes the two terms comparable
eq 271 using the first term to work out the scaling for the
perpendicular magnetic fluctuations we get using eq 269

which is the same scaling as for bk b0 eq 272
using eq 273 together with eqs 269 and 270 it is
now straightforward to confirm the three assumptions made
in  7101 that we promised to verify a posteriori

37

1 in eq 116 ak t  cb so eq 261 holds the
electrons remain boltzmann this means that no kaw
can be excited by the cascade
2 b b0  kk k  so b    z in eq 264 this
means that field lines are not significantly perturbed
3 in the expression for hiri eq 69 vk ak c   so
eq 249 holds this means that the electrostatic fluctuations dominate the cascade
711 cascades superposed
the spectra of magnetic fluctuations obtained in  7104
are very steepsteeper in fact than those normally observed
in the dissipation range of the solar wind  825 one might
speculate that the observed spectra may be due to a superposition of the two cascades realizable below the ion gyroscale a
highfrequency cascade of kaw  75 and a lowfrequency
cascade of electrostatic fluctuations due to the ion entropy
fluctuations  710 such a superposition could happen if
the power going into the kaw cascade is relatively small
kaw   one then expects an electrostatic cascade to be
set up just below the ion gyroscale with the kaw cascade
superseding it deeper into the dissipation range comparing
eqs 240 and 269 we can estimate the position of the spectral break
23

274
k i  kaw

since i e   mi me 12 z is not a very large number the
dissipation range is not very wide it is then conceivable that
the observed spectra are not true power laws but simply nonasymptotic superpositions of the electrostatic and kaw spectra with the observed range of effective spectral exponents
due to varying values of the spectral break 274 between the
two cascades33
the value of kaw  specific to any particular set of parameters i    etc is set by what happens at k i  1  71
see  822  825 and  85 for further discussion

these scales we have to return to the full gyrokinetic system of equations the quasineutrality eq 61 parallel

713 validity of gyrokinetics in the dissipation range
as the kinetic cascade takes the generalized energy to ever
smaller scales the frequency  of the fluctuations increases
in applying the gyrokinetic theory one must be mindful of
the need for this frequency to stay smaller than i  using
the scaling formulae for the characteristic times of the fluctuations derived above eqs 254 270 and 283 we can
determine the conditions for   i  thus for the gyrokinetic theory to be valid everywhere in the inertial range we

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
2008a34 this releases a variety of highfrequency wave
modes which may be participating in the turbulent cascade
around and below the electron gyroscale see eg the recent
detailed observations of these scales in the magnetosheath by
mangeney et al 2006 lacombe et al 2006 or the early measurements of highfrequency fluctuations in the solar wind by
denskat et al 1983 coroniti et al 1982
714 summary
in this section we have analyzed the turbulence in the dissipation range which turned out to have many more essentially
kinetic features than the inertial range
at the ion gyroscale k i  1 the kinetic cascade rearranged itself into two distinct components part of the generalized energy arriving from the inertial range was collisionlessly damped giving rise to a purely kinetic cascade of ionentropy fluctuations the rest was converted into a cascade of
kinetic alfvn waves kaw fig 5 see  71 and  78
the kaw cascade is described by two fluidlike equations for 
two scalar functions the magnetic flux function
  ak  4mi n0i and the scalar potential expressed for
continuity with the results of  5 in terms of the function

the ion distribution function is mixed by the ringaveraged
scalar potential and undergoes a cascade both in the velocity
and gyrocenter spacethis phasespace cascade is essential
for the conversion of the turbulent energy into the ion heat
which can ultimately only be done by collisions see  79
if the kaw cascade is strong its power kaw is an orderunity fraction of the total injected turbulent power  it determines  in eq 297 so the ionentropy cascade is passive
with respect to the kaw turbulence equations 294295 and
297 form a closed system that determines the three functions   hi  of which the latter is slaved to the first two

we argued in  711 that the observed spectra in the dissipation range of the solar wind could be the result of a superposition of these two cascades although a number of alternative
theories exist  826
8 discussion of astrophysical applications

we have so far only occasionally referred to some relevant
observational evidence for space and astrophysical plasmas
we now discuss in more detail how the theoretical framework
laid out above applies to real plasma turbulence in space
although we will discuss the interstellar medium accretion disks and galaxy clusters towards the end of this section the most rewarding source of observational information
about plasma turbulence in astrophysical conditions is the solar wind and the magnetosheath because only there direct in
situ measurements of all the interesting quantities are possible measurements of the fluctuating magnetic and velocity
fields in the solar wind have been available since the 1960s
coleman 1968 and a vast literature now exists on their spectra anisotropy alfvnic character and many other aspects a
short recent review is horbury et al 2005 two long ones are
tu  marsch 1995 bruno  carbone 2005 it is not our
aim here to provide a comprehensive survey of what is known
about plasma turbulence in the solar wind instead we shall
limit our discussion to a few points that we consider important in light of the theoretical framework proposed in this paper35 as we do this we shall provide copious references to
35 an extended quantitative discussion of the applicability of the gyrokinetic theory to the turbulence in the slow solar wind was given by howes et al
2008a

schekochihin et al

the main body of the paper so this section can be read as a
dataoriented guide to it aimed both at a thorough reader who
has arrived here after going through the preceding sections
and an impatient one who has skipped to this one hoping to
find out whether there is anything of practical use in the
theoretical developments above
81 inertialrange turbulence in the solar wind
in the inertial range ie for k i  1 the solarwind turbulence should be described by the reduced hybrid fluidkinetic
theory derived in  5 krmhd its applicability hinges on
three key assumptions i the turbulence is alfvnic ie consists of small bb0  1 lowfrequency   kk va  i 
perturbations of an ambient mean magnetic field and corresponding velocity fluctuations ii it is strongly anisotropic
k  kk  iii the equilibrium distribution can be approximated or at least reasonably modeled by a maxwellian without loss of essential physics this will be discussed in  83
if these assumptions are satisfied krmhd summarized in
 57 is a rigorous set of dynamical equations for the inertial
range a set of kolmogorovstyle scaling predictions for the
alfvnic component of the turbulence can be produced the
gs theory reviewed in  12 while to the compressive fluctuations the considerations of  6 apply so let us examine
the observational evidence
811 alfvnic nature of the turbulence

the presence of alfvn waves in the solar wind was reported already the early works of unti  neugebauer 1968
and belcher  davis 1971 alfvn waves are detected already at very low frequencies large scalesand at these
low frequencies have a k1 spectrum36 this spectrum corresponds to a uniform distribution of scalesfrequencies of
waves launched by the coronal activity of the sun nonlinear interaction of these waves gives rise to an alfvnic turbulent cascade of the type that was discussed above the effective outer scale of this cascade can be detected as a spectral break where the k1 scaling steepens to the kolmogorov
slope k53 see bavassano et al 1982 marsch  tu 1990a
horbury et al 1996 for fastwind results on the spectral break
for a discussion of the effective outer scale in the slow wind
at 1 au see howes et al 2008a the particular scale at
which this happens increases with the distance from the sun
bavassano et al 1982 reflecting the more developed state
of the turbulence at later stages of evolution at 1 au the
outer scale is roughly in the range of 105  106 km the k53
range extends down to scalesfrequencies that correspond to a
few times the ion gyroradius 102  103 km see table 1
the range between the outer scale the spectral break and
the ion gyroscale is the inertial range in this range bb0 decreases with scale because of the steep negative spectral slope
therefore the assumption of small fluctuations bb0  1
while not necessarily true at the outer scale is increasingly
better satisfied further into the inertial range cf  13
are these fluctuations alfvnic in a plasma such as the
solar wind they ought to be because as showed in  53 for
k i  1 these fluctuations are rigorously described by the
36 inferred from the frequency spectrum f 1 via the taylor 1938 hypothesis f  k  vsw  where vsw is the mean velocity at which the wind blows
past the spacecraft the taylor hypothesis is a good assumption for the solar wind because vsw  800 kms in the fast wind  300 kms in the slow
wind is highly supersonic superalfvnic and far exceeds the fluctuating
velocities

rmhd equations the magnetic flux is frozen into the ion
motions so displacing a parcel of plasma should produce a
matching alfvnic perturbation of the magneticfield line
and vice versa in an alfvn wave u  b  4mi n0i 
the strongest confirmation that this is indeed true for the
inertialrange fluctuations in the solar wind was achieved by
bale et al 2005 who compared the spectra of electric and
magnetic fluctuations and found that they both scale as k53
and follow each other with remarkable precision see fig 1
the electric field is a very good measure of the perpendicular
velocity field because for k i  1 the plasma velocity is
the e  b drift velocity u  ce  b0 see  54
this picture of agreement between basic theory and observations is upset in a disturbing fashion by an extraordinary recent result by chapman  hnat 2007 podesta et al
2006 and j e borovsky 2008 private communication
who claim different spectral indices for velocity and magnetic fluctuationsk32 and k53  respectively this result
is puzzling because if it is asymptotically correct in the inertial range it implies either u  b or u  b and it is
not clear how perpendicular velocity fluctuations in a nearideal plasma could fail to produce alfvnic displacements
and therefore perpendicular magnetic field fluctuations with
matching energies plausible explanations may be either that
the velocity field in these measurements is polluted by a nonalfvnic component parallel to the magnetic field although
data analysis by chapman  hnat 2007 does not support this
or that the flattening of the velocity spectrum is due to some
form of a finitegyroradius effect or even an energy injection
into the velocity fluctuations at scales approaching the ion
gyroscale eg from the pressureanisotropydriven instabilities  83
812 energy spectrum

how solid is the statement that the observed spectrum
has a k53 scaling in individual measurements of the
magneticenergy spectra very high accuracy is claimed
for this scaling the measured spectral exponent is between 16 and 17 agreement with kolmogorov value 167
is often reported to be within a few percent see eg
horbury et al 1996 leamon et al 1998 bale et al 2005
narita et al 2006 alexandrova et al 2008a horbury et al
2008 there is a somewhat wider scatter of spectral indices if one considers large sets of measurement intervals
smith et al 2006 but overall the observational evidence
32
does not appear to be consistent with a k spectrum consistently found in the mhd simulations with a strong mean field
maron  goldreich 2001 mller et al 2003 mason et al
2007 perez  boldyrev 2008 2009 beresnyak  lazarian
2008b and defended on theoretical grounds in the recent
modifications of the gs theory by boldyrev 2006 and by
gogoberidze 2007 see footnote 10 this discrepancy between observations and simulations remains an unresolved
theoretical issue it is probably best addressed by numerical modeling of the rmhd equations  22 and by a detailed comparison of the structure of the alfvnic fluctuations
in such simulations and in the solar wind
813 anisotropy

building up evidence for anisotropy of turbulent fluctuations has progressed from merely detecting their elongation
along the magnetic field belcher  davis 1971to fitting
data to an ad hoc model mixing a 2d perpendicular and a

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
1d parallel slab turbulent components in some proportion37 matthaeus et al 1990 bieber et al 1996 dasso et al
2005 hamilton et al 2008to formal systematic unbiased
analyses showing the persistent presence of anisotropy at all
scales bigazzi et al 2006 sorrisovalvo et al 2006 to direct measurements of threedimensional correlation functions
osman  horbury 2007and finally to computing spectral
exponents at fixed angles between k and b0 horbury et al
2008 the latter authors appear to have achieved the first
direct quantitative confirmation of the gs theory by demon53
strating that the magneticenergy spectrum scales as k in
wavenumbers perpendicular to the mean field and as kk2 in
wavenumbers parallel to it consistent with the first scaling
relation in eq 4 this is the closest that observations have
23
got to confirming the gs relation kk  k see eq 5 in a
real astrophysical turbulent plasma
814 compressive fluctuations

according to the theory developed in  5 the density and
magneticfieldstrength fluctuations are passive energetically
decoupled from and mixed by the alfvnic cascade  55
these are slow and entropy modes in the collisional mhd
limitsee  24 and  61 these fluctuations are expected to
be pressurebalanced as expressed by eq 22 or more generally in gyrokinetics by eq 67 there is indeed strong
evidence that magnetic and thermal pressures in the solar
wind are anticorrelated although there are some indications
of the presence of compressive fastwavelike fluctuations as
well roberts 1990 burlaga et al 1990 marsch  tu 1993
bavassano et al 2004

kellogg  horbury 2005 alexandrova et al 2008a and
near the sun lovelace et al 1970 woo  armstrong 1979
coles  harmon 1989 coles et al 1991 show fluctuation
levels of order 10 and spectra that appear to have a k53
scaling above scales of order 102  103 km which approximately corresponds to the ion gyroscale the kolmogorov
value of the spectral exponent is as in the case of alfvnic
fluctuations measured quite accurately in individual cases
167  003 in celnikier et al 1987 interestingly the
higherorder structure function exponents measured for the
magneticfield strength show that it is a more intermittent
quantity than the velocity or the vector magnetic field ie
than the alfvnic fluctuations and that the scaling exponents are quantitatively very close to the values found for
passive scalars in neutral fluids bershadskii  sreenivasan
2004 bruno et al 2007 one might argue that this lends
some support to the theoretical expectation of passive
magneticfieldstrength fluctuations
considering that in the collisionless regime these fluctuations are supposed to be subject to strong kinetic damping
 622 the presence of welldeveloped kolmogorovlike
and apparently undamped turbulent spectra is more surprising
than has perhaps been publicly acknowledged an extended
discussion of this issue was given in  63 without the in37 these techniques originate from the view of mhd turbulence as a superposition of a 2d turbulence and an admixture of alfvn waves fyfe et al
1977 montgomery  turner 1981 as we discussed in  12 we consider
the goldreich  sridhar 1995 1997 view of a critically balanced alfvnic
cascade to be better physically justified

41

clusion of the dissipation effects associated with the finite ion
gyroscale the passive cascade of the density and field strength
is purely perpendicular to the exact local magnetic field and
does not lead to any scale refinement along the field this implies highly anisotropic fieldaligned structures whose length
is determined by the initial conditions ie conditions in the
corona the kinetic damping is inefficient for such fluctuations while this would seem to explain the presence of fully
fledged powerlaw spectra it is not entirely obvious that the
parallel cascade is really absent once dissipation is taken into
account lithwick  goldreich 2001 so the issue is not yet
settled this said we note that there is plenty of evidence of
a high degree of anisotropy and field alignment of the density microstructure in the inner solar wind and outer corona
eg armstrong et al 1990 grall et al 1997 woo  habbal
1997 there is also evidence that the local structure of the
compressive fluctuations at 1 au is correlated with the coronal activity implying some form of memory of initial conditions kiyani et al 2007 hnat et al 2007 wicks et al 2009
we note finally that whether compressive fluctuations in
the inertial range can develop short parallel scales should also
tell us how much ion heating can result from their damping
see  624
82 dissipationrange turbulence in the solar wind and the

magnetosheath
at scales approaching the ion gyroscale k i  1 effects
associated with the finite extent of ion gyroorbits start to
matter observationally this transition manifests itself as a
clear break in the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with the
inertialrange k53 scaling replaced by a steeper slope see
fig 1 while the electrons at these scales can be treated as
an isothermal fluid as long as we are considering fluctuations
above the electron gyroscale k e  1 see  4 the fully
gyrokinetic description  3 has to be adopted for the ions
it is indeed to understand plasma dynamics at and around
k i  1 that gyrokinetics was first designed in fusion plasma
theory frieman  chen 1982 brizard  hahm 2007 in order for gyrokinetics and further dissipationrange approximations that follow from it  7 to be a credible approach in
the solar wind and other space plasmas it has to be established that fluctuations at and below the ion gyroscale are still
strongly anisotropic kk  k  if that is the case then their
frequencies   kk va k i  see  73 will still be smaller than
the cyclotron frequency in at least a part of the dissipation
range38the range of scales k i  1 see  713
note that additional information about the dissipationrange turbulence can be extracted from the measurements in
the magnetosheathwhile scales above the ion gyroscale are
probably nonuniversal there the dissipation range appears to
display universal behavior mostly similar to the solar wind
see eg alexandrova 2008 this complements the observational picture emerging from the solarwind data and allows us to learn more as fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetosheath are larger and much smaller scales can be probed
than in the solar wind mangeney et al 2006 lacombe et al
2006 alexandrova et al 2008b
821 anisotropy
38 this term customary in the spacephysics literature is somewhat of
a misnomer because as we have seen in  7 rich dissipationless turbulent
dynamics are present in this range alongside what is normally thought of as
dissipation

42

schekochihin et al

we know with a fair degree of certainty that the fluctuations that cascade down to the ion gyroscale from the inertial range are strongly anisotropic  813 while it appears likely that the anisotropy persists at k i  1 it is extremely important to have a clear verdict on this assumption
from solar wind measurements while leamon et al 1998
and more recently hamilton et al 2008 did present some
evidence that magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind have a
degree of anisotropy below the ion gyroscale no definitive
study similar to horbury et al 2008 or bigazzi et al 2006
sorrisovalvo et al 2006 exists as yet in the magnetosheath where the dissipationrange scales are easier to measure than in the solar wind recent analysis by sahraoui et al
2006 alexandrova et al 2008b does show evidence of
strong anisotropy
besides confirming the presence of the anisotropy it would
be interesting to study its scaling characteristics eg check
13
the scaling prediction kk  k eq 241 see also  794
23
and  7103 in a similar fashion as the gs relation kk  k
eq 5 was corroborated by horbury et al 2008
in this paper we have proceeded on the assumption that
the anisotropy and therefore low frequencies   i  do
characterize fluctuations in the dissipation rangeor at least
that the lowfrequency anisotropic fluctuations are a significant energy cascade channel and can be considered decoupled
from any possible highfrequency dynamics
822 transition at the ion gyroscale collisionless damping and
heating

if the fluctuations at the ion gyroscale have kk  k and
  i  821 they are not subject to the cyclotron resonance   kk vk  i  but are subject to the landau one
  kk vk  alfvnic fluctuations at the ion gyroscale are
no longer decoupled from the compressive fluctuations and
can be landaudamped  71 it seems plausible that it
is the inflow of energy from the alfvnic cascade that accounts for a pronounced local flattening of the spectrum of
density fluctuations in the solar wind observed just above
the ion gyroscale woo  armstrong 1979 celnikier et al
1983 1987 coles  harmon 1989 marsch  tu 1990b
coles et al 1991 kellogg  horbury 200539
in energetic terms landau damping amounts to a redistribution of generalized energy from electromagnetic fluctuations to entropy fluctuations  34  78 this gives rise
to the entropy cascade ultimately transferring the landaudamped energy into ion heat  35  79 and  710 however only part of the inertialrange cascade is so damped because an alternative electron cascade channel exists the kinetic alfvn waves  7278 the energy transferred into
the kawlike fluctuations can cascade to the electron gyroscale where it is landau damped on electrons converting
first into the electron entropy cascade and then electron heat
 712
thus the transition at the ion gyroscale ultimately decides in what proportion the turbulent energy arriving from
the inertial range is distributed between the ion and electron
heat how the fraction of power going into either depends on
parametersi ti te  amplitudes    is a key unanswered
question both in space and astrophysical see eg  85 plas39 celnikier et al 1987 proposed that the flattening might be a k1 spectrum analogous to batchelors spectrum of passive scalar variance in the
viscousconvective range we think this analogy cannot apply because density is not passive at or below the ion gyroscale

mas gyrokinetics appears to be an ideal tool for addressing
this question both analytically and numerically howes et al
2008b within the framework outlined in this paper the minimal model appropriate for studying the transition at the ion
gyroscale is the system of equations for isothermal electrons
and gyrokinetic ions derived in  4 it is summarized in  49
823 ion gyroscale vs ion inertial scale

it is often assumed in the space
 physics literature that it is
at the ion inertial scale di  i  i  rather than at the ion gyroscale i that the spectral break between the inertial and dissipation range occurs the distinction between di and i becomes noticeable when i is significantly different from unity
a relatively rare occurrence in the solar wind while some attempts to determine at which of these two scales a spectral
break between the inertial and dissipation ranges occurs have
produced claims that di is a more likely candidate smith et al
2001 more comprehensive studies of the available data sets
conclude basically that it is hard to tell leamon et al 2000
markovskii et al 2008
in the gyrokinetic approach advocated in this paper the ion
inertial scale does not play a special role see  71 the only
parameter regime in which di does appear as a special scale
is ti  te cold ions when the hall mhd approximation
can be derived in a systematic way see appendix e this
however is not the right limit for the solar wind or most other
astrophysical plasmas of interest because ions are rarely cold
hall mhd is discussed further in  826 and appendix e
824 kaw turbulence

if gyrokinetics is valid at scales k i  1 ie if kk  k 
  i and it is acceptable to at least model the equilibrium
distribution as a maxwellian see  83 the electromagnetic
fluctuations below the ion gyroscale will be described by the
fluid approximation that we derived in  72 and referred to
ermhd the wave solutions of this system of equations are
the kinetic alfvn waves  7374 and it is possible to argue for a gsstyle critically balanced cascade of kawlike
electromagnetic fluctuations  75 between the ion and electron gyroscales landau damped on electrons at k e  1 the
expression for the kaw damping rate in the gyrokinetic limit
is given in howes et al 2006 see also fig 8
individual kaw have indeed been detected in space plasmas eg grison et al 2005 what about kaw turbulence
how does one tell whether any particular spectral slope one is
measuring corresponds to the kaw cascade or fits some alternative scheme for the dissipationrange turbulence  826
it appears to be a sensible program to look for specific relationships between different fields predicted by theory  72
and for the corresponding spectral slopes and scaling relations
for the anisotropy  75 this means that simultaneous measurements of magnetic electric density and magneticfieldstrength fluctuations are needed
for the solar wind the spectra of electric and magnetic
fluctuations below the ion gyroscale reported by bale et al
2005 are consistent with the k13 and k73 scalings predicted for an anisotropic critically balanced kaw cascade
 75 see fig 1 for theoretical scaling fits superimposed
on a plot taken from bale et al 2005 note however that
bale et al 2005 themselves interpreted their data in a somewhat different way and that their resolution was in any case
not sufficient to be sure of the scalings they were also able
to check that their fluctuations satisfied the kaw dispersion

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
relationfor critically balanced fluctuations this is indeed
plausible magneticfluctuation spectra recently reported by
alexandrova et al 2008a are only slightly steeper than the
theoretical k73 kaw spectrum these authors also find a
significant amount of magneticfieldstrength fluctuations in
the dissipation range with a spectrum that follows the same
scalingthis is again consistent with the theoretical picture
of kaw turbulence see eq 223 measurements reported
by czaykowska et al 2001 alexandrova et al 2008b for
the magnetosheath appear to present a similar picture
the density spectra measured by celnikier et al 1983
1987 steepen below the ion gyroscale following the flattened
segment around k i  1 discussed in  822 for a kaw
cascade the density spectrum should be k73  75 without kaw k103  7102 the slope observed in the papers
cited above appears to be somewhat shallower even than k2
cf a similar result by spangler  gwinn 1990 for the ism
see  841 but given imperfect resolution neither seriously
in contradiction with the prediction based on the kaw cascade nor sufficient to corroborate it unfortunately we have
not found published simultaneous measurements of densityand magnetic or electricfluctuation spectra
825 variability of the spectral slope

while many measurements consistent with the kaw picture can be found there are also many in which the spectra
are much steeper denskat et al 1983 leamon et al 1998
analysis of a large set of measurements of the magneticfluctuation spectra in the dissipation range of the solar wind
reveals a wide spread in the spectral indices roughly between
1 and 4 smith et al 2006 there is evidence of a weak
positive correlation between steeper dissipationrange spectra
and higher ion temperatures leamon et al 1998 or higher
cascade rates calculated from the inertial range smith et al
2006 this suggests that a larger amount of ion heating may
correspond to a fully or partially suppressed kaw cascade
which is in line with our view of the ion heating and the kaw
cascade as the two competing channels of the overall kinetic
cascade  78 with a weakened kaw cascade all or part of
the dissipation range would be dominated by the ion entropy
cascadea purely kinetic phenomenon manifested by predominantly electrostatic fluctuations and very steep magneticenergy spectra  710 this might account both for the steepness of the observed spectra and for the spread in their indices
 711 although many other theories exist see  826
while we may thus have a plausible argument this is not
yet a satisfactory quantitative theory that would allow us to
predict when the kaw cascade is present and when it is not or
what dissipationrange spectrum should be expected for given
values of the solarwind parameters i  ti te  etc resolution of this issue again appears to hinge on the question of how
much turbulent power is diverted into the ion entropy cascade
equivalently into ion heat at the ion gyroscale see  822
826 alternative theories of the dissipation range

a number of alternative theories and models have been put
forward to explain the observed spectral slopes and their variability in the dissipation range it is not our aim to review or
critique them all in detail but perhaps it is useful to provide a
few brief comments about some of them in light of the theoretical framework constructed in this paper
this entire theoretical framework hinges on adopting gyrokinetics as a valid description or at least a sensible model

43

that does not miss any significant channels of energy cascade
and dissipation while we obviously believe this to be the
right approach it is worth spelling out what effects are left
out by construction
parallel alfvnwave cascade and ion cyclotron damping  the
use of gyrokinetics assumes that fluctuations stay anisotropic
at all scales kk  k  and therefore   i  so the
cyclotron resonances are ordered out however if one
insists on routing the alfvnwave energy into a parallel cascade eg by forcibly setting k  0 it is possible to construct a weak turbulence theory in which it
is dissipated by the ion cyclotron damping yoon  fang
2008 numerical simulations of 3d mhd turbulence do
not support the possibility of a parallel alfvnwave cascade
shebalin et al 1983 oughton et al 1994 cho  vishniac
2000 maron  goldreich 2001 cho et al 2002 mller et al
2003 solarwind evidence that the perpendicular cascade
dominates is quite strong for the inertial range  813 and
less so for the dissipation range  821 while as stated
in  821 one cannot yet definitely claim that observations
tell us that   i at k i  1 it has been argued that
observations do not appear to be consistent with cyclotron
damping being the main mechanism for the dissipation of
the inertialrange alfvnic turbulence at the ion gyroscale
leamon et al 1998 2000 smith et al 2001 ioncyclotron
resonance could conceivably be reached somewhere in the
dissipation range see  713 at this point gyrokinetics will
formally break down although as argued by howes et al
2008a see their  36 this does not necessarily mean that
ion cyclotron damping will become the dominant dissipation
channel for the turbulence
parallel whistler cascade  a parallel magnetosonicwhistler
cascade eventually damped by the electron cyclotron
resonance stawicki et al 2001 is also excluded in the
construction of gyrokinetics the whistler cascade has
been given some consideration in the hall mhd approximation further discussed at the end of this section both
weakturbulence theory galtier 2006 and 3d numerical
simulations cho  lazarian 2004 concluded that like
in mhd the turbulent cascade is highly anisotropic with
perpendicular energy transfer dominating over the parallel
one40 the same conclusion appears to have been reached
in recent 2d kinetic pic simulations by gary et al 2008
saito et al 2008 thus the turbulence again seems to be
driven into the gyrokinetically accessible regime

while theory and numerical simulations appear to make
arguing in favor of a parallel cascade and cyclotron heating difficult there exists some observational evidence in support of them especially for the nearsun solar wind eg
harmon  coles 2005 thus the presence or relative importance of the cyclotron heating in the solar wind and more
generally the mechanisms responsible for the observed perpendicular ion heating marsch et al 1983 remain a largely
open problem besides the theories mentioned above many
other ideas have been proposed some of which attempted
to reconcile the dominance of the lowfrequency perpendicular cascade with the possibility of cyclotron heating eg
chandran 2005b markovskii et al 2006 see hollweg 2008
for a concise recent review of the problem
40 it is possible to produce a parallel cascade artificially by running 1d
simulations matthaeus et al 2008b

44

schekochihin et al

mirror cascade  sahraoui et al 2006 analyzed a set of
cluster multispacecraft measurements in the magnetosheath
and reported a broad powerlaw  k83  spectrum of mirror
structures at and below the ion gyroscale they claim that
these are not kawlike fluctuations because their frequency
is zero in the plasma frame although these structures are
highly anisotropic with kk  k  they cannot be described by
the gyrokinetic theory in its present form because bk b0 is
very large  40 occasionally reaching unity and because
the particle trapping by fluctuations which is likely to be
important in the nonlinear physics of the mirror instability kivelson  southwood 1996 pokhotelov et al 2008
rincon et al 2009 is ordered out in gyrokinetics thus if a
mirror cascade exists it is not captured in our description
more generally the effect of the pressureanisotropydriven
instabilities on the turbulence in the dissipation range is a
wide open area requiring further analytical effort see  83

if kk  k    i  and bb0  1 are accepted for the
dissipation range and plasma instabilities at the ion gyroscale
 83 are ignored the formal gyrokinetic theory and its
asymptotic consequences derived above should hold there
are two essential features of the linear physics at and below
the ion gyroscale that must play some role the collisionless
landau damping and the dispersive nature of the wave solutions see fig 8 and  73 cf eg leamon et al 1999
stawicki et al 2001 both of these features have been employed to explain the spectral break at the ion gyroscale and
the spectral slopes below it
landau damping and instrumental effects  in most of our discussion  7  824825 we effectively assumed that the
landau damping is only important at k i  1 and k e  1
but not in between so we could talk about asymptotic scalings and dissipationless cascades however as was noted
in  76 a properly asymptotic scaling behavior in the dissipation range is probably impossible in nature because the
scale separation between the ion and electron gyroscales is
only about mi me 12  43 in particular there is not always
a wide scale interval where the kinetic damping is negligibly small especially at low i  see fig 8 cf leamon et al
1999 howes et al 2008a proposed a model of how the
presence of damping combined with instrumental effects a
resolution floor could lead to measured spectra that look like
power laws steeper than k73  with the effective spectral exponent depending on plasma parameters we refer the reader
to that paper for a discussion of how this compares with previous models of a similar kind eg li et al 2001 a key
physical assumption of theirs and similar models is that the
amount of power drained from the alfvnwave and kaw
cascades into the ion heat is set by the strength of the linear
damping whether this is justified is not yet clear
hall and electron mhd  if landau damping is deemed
unimportant in some part of the dissipation range which
can be true in some regimes see fig 8 and howes et al
2006 2008ab and the wave dispersion is considered to
be the salient feature it might appear that a fluid rather
than kinetic description should be sufficient hall mhd
mahajan  yoshida 1998 or its kdi  1 limit the electron
mhd kingsep et al 1990 have been embraced by many authors as such a description suitable both for analytical arguments goldreich  reisenegger 1992 krishan  mahajan
2004 gogoberidze 2005 galtier  bhattacharjee 2003

galtier 2006 alexandrova et al 2008a and numerical simulations biskamp et al 1996 1999 ghosh et al 1996
ng et al 2003 cho  lazarian 2004 shaikh  zank 2005
galtier  buchlin 2007 matthaeus et al 2008b
to what extent does this constitute an approach alternative to and better than gyrokinetics as suggested eg by
matthaeus et al 2008b for fluctuations with kk  k  hall
mhd is merely a particular limit of gyrokinetics i  1 and
ti te  1 coldion limit see appendix e if kk is not small
compared to k  then the gyrokinetics is not valid while hall
mhd continues to describe the coldion limit correctly eg
ito et al 2004 hirose et al 2004 capturing in particular the
whistler branch of the dispersion relation however as we
have already mentioned above the dominance of the perpendicular energy transfer kk  k  is supported both by weakturbulence theory for hall mhd galtier 2006 and by 3d
numerical simulations of the electron mhd cho  lazarian
2004
thus the gyrokinetic theory and its rigorous limits such
as ermhd  72 supersede hall mhd for anisotropic turbulence since ions are generally not cold in the solar wind
or any other plasma discussed here hall mhd is not formally a relevant approximation it also entirely misses the
kinetic damping and the associated entropy cascade channel
leading to particle heating  71  79 and  710 however
hall mhd does capture the alfvn waves becoming dispersive and numerical simulations of it do show a spectral break
although technically speaking at the wrong scale di instead
of i  see  71 although hall mhd cannot be rigorously
used as quantitative theory of the spectral break and the associated change in the nature of the turbulent cascade the hall
mhd equations in the limit kdi  1 are mathematically similar to our ermhd equations see  72 and appendix e to
within constant coefficients probably not essential for qualitative models of turbulence therefore results of numerical
simulations of hall and electron mhd cited above are directly useful for understanding the kaw cascadeand indeed in the limit kdi  1 kde  1 they are mostly consistent
with the scaling arguments of  75
alfvn vortices  finally we mention an argument pertaining
to the dissipationrange spectra that is not based on energy
cascades at all based on the evidence of alfvn vortices in
the magnetosheath alexandrova 2008 speculated that steep
powerlaw spectra observed in the dissipation range at least
in some cases could reflect the geometry of the iongyroscale
structures rather than a local energy cascade if alfvn vortices are a common feature this possibility cannot be excluded however the resulting geometrical spectra are quite
steep k4 and steeper so they can become important only
if the kaw cascade is weak or suppressedsomewhat similarly to the steep spectra associated with the entropy cascade
 711
83 is equilibrium distribution isotropic and maxwellian

in rigorous theoretical terms the weakest point of this paper is the use of a maxwellian equilibrium formally this is
only justified when the collisions are weak but not too weak
we ordered the collision frequency as similar to the fluctuation frequency eq 49 this degree of collisionality is
sufficient to prove that a maxwellian equilibrium distribution
f0s v does indeed emerge in the lowest order of the gyrokinetic expansion howes et al 2006 this argument works
well for plasmas such as the ism  84 where collisions are

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
weak mfpi  i  but nonnegligible mfpi  l in space
plasmas the mean free path is of the order of 1 authe distance between the sun and the earth see table 1 strictly
speaking in so highly collisionless a plasma the equilibrium distribution does not have to be either maxwellian or
isotropic
the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant   v2 2b
suggests that temperature anisotropy with respect to the
magneticfield direction t0 6 t0k  may exist when the
relative anisotropy is larger than roughly 1i  it triggers
several very fast growing plasma instabilities most prominently the firehose t0  t0k  and mirror t0  t0k  modes
eg gary et al 1976 their growth rates peak around the
ion gyroscale thus giving rise to additional energy injection
at k i  1
no definitive analytical theory of how these fluctuations saturate cascade and affect the equilibrium distribution has been
proposed it appears to be a reasonable expectation that the
fluctuations resulting from temperature anisotropy will saturate by limiting this anisotropy this idea has some support
in solarwind observations while the degree of anisotropy
of the core particle distribution functions varies considerably between data sets the observed anisotropies do seem
to populate the part of the parameter plane t0 t0k  i  circumscribed in a rather precise way by the marginal stability boundaries for the mirror and firehose gary et al 2001
kasper et al 2002 marsch et al 2004 hellinger et al 2006
matteini et al 200741
if we want to study turbulence in data sets that do not lie
too close to these stability boundaries assuming an isotropic
maxwellian equilibrium distribution eq 54 is probably
an acceptable simplification although not an entirely rigorous one further theoretical work is clearly possible on this
subject thus it is not a problem to formulate gyrokinetics
with an arbitrary equilibrium distribution frieman  chen
1982 and starting from that once can generalize the results
of this paper for the krmhd system  5 this has been done
by chen et al 2009 treating the instabilities themselves
might prove more difficult requiring the gyrokinetic ordering to be modified and the expansion carried to higher orders
to incorporate features that are not captured by gyrokinetics
eg short parallel scales rosin et al 2009 particle trapping pokhotelov et al 2008 rincon et al 2009 or nonlinear finitegyroradius effects califano et al 2008 note that
the theory of the dissipationrange turbulence will probably
need to be modified to account for the additional energy injection from the instabilities and for the yet unclear way in
which this energy makes its way to dissipation and into heat
besides the anisotropies the particle distribution functions
in the solar wind especially the electron one exhibit nonmaxwellian suprathermal tails see maksimovic et al 2005
marsch 2006 and references therein these contain small
 5 of the total density populations of energetic particles
both the origin of these particles and their effect on turbulence
have to be modeled kinetically again it is possible to formulate gyrokinetics for general equilibrium distributions of this
kind and examine the interaction between them and the turbulent fluctuations but we leave such a theory outside the scope
of this paper
thus much remains to be done to incorporate realistic equi41

note that kellogg et al 2006 measure the electricfield fluctuations
in the ioncyclotron frequency range estimate the resulting velocityspace
diffusion and argue that it is sufficient to isotropize the ion distribution

librium distribution functions into the gyrokinetic description
of the solar wind plasma in the meanwhile we believe that
the gyrokinetic theory based on a maxwellian equilibrium distribution as presented in this paper while idealized and imperfect is nevertheless a step forward in the analytical treatment
of the spaceplasma turbulence compared to the fluid descriptions that have prevailed thus far
84 interstellar medium
while the solar wind is unmatched by other astrophysical
plasmas in the level of detail with which turbulence in it can
be measured the interstellar medium ism also offers an observer a number of ways of diagnosing plasma turbulence
which in the case of the ism is thought to be primarily excited by supernova explosions norman  ferrara 1996 the
accuracy and resolution of this analysis are due to improve
rapidly thanks to many new observatories eg lofar42
planck ensslin et al 2006 and in more distant future the
ska lazio et al 2004
the ism is a spatially inhomogeneous environment consisting of several phases that have different temperatures densities and degrees of ionization ferrire 200143 we will use
the warm ism phase see table 1 as our fiducial interstellar plasma and discuss briefly what is known about the two
main observationally accessible quantitiesthe electron density and magnetic fieldsand how this information fits into
the theoretical framework proposed here
841 electron density fluctuations

the electrondensity fluctuations inferred from the interstellar scintillation measurements appear to have a spectrum
with an exponent  17 consistent with the kolmogorov
scaling armstrong et al 1981 1995 lazio et al 2004 see
however dissenting evidence by smirnova et al 2006 who
claim a spectral exponent closer to 15 this holds over
about 5 decades of scales   105  1010  km other observational evidence at larger and smaller scales supports the case
for this presumed inertial range to be extended over as many
as 12 decades   102 1015  km a fine example of scale
separation that prompted an impressed astrophysicist to dub
the density scaling the great power law in the sky the
upper cutoff here is consistent with the estimates of the supernova scale of order 100 pcpresumably the outer scale of
the turbulence norman  ferrara 1996 and also roughly the
scale height of the galactic disk obviously the upper bound
on the validity of any homogeneous model of the ism turbulence the lower cutoff is an estimate for the inner scale
below which the logarithmic slope of the density spectrum
steepens to about 2 spangler  gwinn 1990
higdon 1984 was the first to realize that the electrondensity fluctuations in the ism could be attributed to a cascade of a passive tracer mixed by the ambient turbulence the
mhd entropy mode see  26 this idea was brought to maturity by lithwick  goldreich 2001 who studied the passive cascades of the slow and entropy modes in the framework of the gs theory see also maron  goldreich 2001
if the turbulence is assumed anisotropic as in the gs theory
the passive nature of the density fluctuations with respect to
the decoupled alfvnwave cascade becomes a rigorous result both in mhd  24 and as we showed above in the
42

httpwwwlofarorg
and therefore different degrees of importance of the neutral particles
and the associated ambipolar damping effectsthese will not be discussed
here see lithwick  goldreich 2001

more general gyrokinetic description appropriate for weakly
collisional plasmas  55 anisotropy of the electrondensity
fluctuations in the ism is indeed observationally supported

dennettthorpe  de bruyn 2003 heyer et al 2008 see also
lazio et al 2004 for a concise discussion although detailed
scalebyscale measurements are not currently possible
if the underlying alfvnwave turbulence in the ism has
53
a k spectrum as predicted by gs so should the electron density see  26 as we discussed in  63 the physical nature of the inner scale for the density fluctuations depends on whether they have a cascade in kk and are efficiently damped when kk mfpi  1 or fail to develop small
parallel scales and can therefore reach k i  1 the observationally estimated inner scale is consistent with the ion
gyroscale i  103 km see table 1 note that the ion inertial scale di  i  i is similar to i at the moderate values
of i characteristic of the ismsee further discussion of the
irrelevance of di in  71  823 and appendix e however since the mean free path in the ism is not huge table 1 it is not possible to distinguish this from the perpen32
1
dicular cutoff k
 mfpi l12  500 km implied by the parallel cutoff at kk mfpi  1 see eq 220 as advocated by
lithwick  goldreich 2001 note that the relatively short
mean free path means that much of the scale range spanned by
the great power law in the sky is in fact well described by
the mhd approximation either with adiabatic  2 or isothermal  61 and appendix d electrons
below the ion gyroscale the 2 spectral exponent reported
by spangler  gwinn 1990 is measured sufficiently imprecisely to be consistent with the 73 expected for the density
fluctuations in the kaw cascade  75 however given the
high degree of uncertainty about what happens in this dissipation range even in the much better resolved case of the
solar wind  82 it would probably be wise to reserve judgment until better data are available
842 magnetic fluctuations

the second main observable type of turbulent fluctuations
in the ism are the magnetic fluctuations accessible indirectly
via the measurements of the faraday rotation of the polarization angle of the pulsar light travelling through the ism
the structure function of the rotation measure rm should
have the kolmogorov slope of 23 if the magnetic fluctuations are due to alfvnic turbulence described by the gs theory there is a considerable uncertainty in interpreting the
available data primarily due to insufficient spatial resolution
rarely better than a few parsec structure function slopes
consistent with 23 have been reported minter  spangler
1996 but depending on where one looks shallower structure functions that seem to steepen at scales of a few parsec
are also observed haverkorn et al 2004
a recent study by haverkorn et al 2005 detected an interesting trend the rm structure functions computed for regions that lie in the galactic spiral arms are nearly perfectly
flat down to the resolution limit while in the interarm regions
they have detectable slopes although these are mostly shallower that 23 observations of magnetic fields in external
galaxies also reveal a marked difference in the magneticfield
structure between arms and interarms the spatially regular
mean fields are stronger in the interarms while in the arms
the stochastic fields dominate beck 2007 this qualitative
difference between the magneticfield structure in the arms

and interarms has been attributed to smaller effective outer
scale in the arms  1 pc compared to  102 pc in the interarms see haverkorn et al 2008 or to the turbulence in the
arms and interarms belonging to the two distinct asymptotic
regimes described in  13 closer to the anisotropic alfvnic
turbulence with a strong mean field in the interarms and to the
isotropic saturated state of smallscale dynamo in the arms

accretion of plasma onto a central black hole or neutron
star is responsible for many of the most energetic phenomena

magnetic stresses due to this turbulence transport angular momentum allowing plasma to accrete the mri converts the
gravitational potential energy of the inflowing plasma into
turbulence at the outer scale that is comparable to the scale
height of the disk this energy is then cascaded to small
scales and dissipated into heatpowering the radiation that
we see from accretion flows fluid mhd simulations show
that the mrigenerated turbulence in disks is subsonic and
has   10  100 thus on scales much smaller than the scale
height of the disk homogeneous turbulence in the parameter
regimes considered in this paper is a valid idealization and
the kinetic models developed above should represent a step
forward compared to the purely fluid approach
turbulence is not yet directly observable in disks so models of turbulence are mostly used to produce testable predictions of observable properties of disks such as their xray and
radio emission one of the best observed cases is the presumed accretion flow onto the black hole coincident with the
radio source sgr a in the center of our galaxy see review
by quataert 2003
depending on the rate of heating and cooling in the inflowing plasma which in turn depend on accretion rate and other
properties of the system under consideration there are different models that describe the physical properties of accretion
flows onto a central object in one class of models a geometrically thin optically thick accretion disk shakura  sunyaev
1973 the inflowing plasma is cold and dense and well described as an mhd fluid when applied to sgr a  these
models produce a prediction for its total luminosity that is
several orders of magnitude larger than observed another
class of models which appears to be more consistent with the
observed properties of sgr a  is called radiatively inefficient
accretion flows riafs see rees et al 1982 narayan  yi
1995 and review by quataert 2003 of the applications and observational constraints in sgr a  in these models the inflowing plasma near the black hole is believed to adopt a twotemperature configuration with the ions ti  1011  1012 k
hotter than the electrons te  109  1011 k44 the electron
and ion thermodynamics decouple because the densities are
so low that the temperature equalization time  ie1 is longer
than the time for the plasma to flow into the black hole thus
like the solar wind riafs are macroscopically collisionless
plasmas see table 1 for plasma parameters in the galactic
center note that these parameters are so extreme that the gy44 it is partly with this application in mind that we carried the general
temperature ratio in our calculations see footnote 17

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas
rokinetic description while probably better than the fluid one
cannot be expected to be rigorously valid at the very least it
needs to be reformulated in a relativistic form at the high
temperatures appropriate to riafs electrons radiate energy
much more efficiently than the ions by virtue of their much
smaller mass and are therefore expected to contribute dominantly to the observed emission while the thermal energy of
the ions is swallowed by the black hole since the plasma
is collisionless the electron heating by turbulence largely determines the thermodynamics of the electrons and thus the
observable properties of riafs the question of which fraction of the turbulent energy goes into ion and which into electron heating is therefore crucial for understanding accretion
flowsand the answer to this question depends on the detailed properties of the smallscale kinetic turbulence eg
quataert  gruzinov 1999 sharma et al 2007 as well as on
the linear properties of the collisionless mri quataert et al
2002 sharma et al 2003
since all of the turbulent power coming down the cascade
must be dissipated into either ion or electron heat it is really the amount of generalized energy diverted at the ion gyroscale into the ion entropy cascade  7879 that decides
how much energy is left to heat the electrons via the kaw
cascade  7275  712 again as in the case of the solar
wind  822 and  825 the transition around the ion gyroscale from the alfvnic turbulence at k i  1 to the kaw
turbulence at k i  1 emerges as a key unsolved problem
86 galaxy clusters

galaxy clusters are the largest plasma objects in the universe like the other examples discussed above the intracluster plasma is in the weakly collisional regime see table 1
fluctuations of electron density temperature and of magnetic
fields are measured in clusters by xray and radio observatories but the resolution is only just enough to claim that a
fairly broad scale range of fluctuations exists schuecker et al
2004 vogt  ensslin 2005 no powerlaw scalings have yet
been established beyond reasonable doubt
what fundamentally hampers quantitative modeling of turbulence and related effects in clusters is that we do not have
a definite theory of the basic properties of the intracluster
medium its effective viscosity magnetic diffusivity or thermal conductivity in a weakly collisional and strongly magnetized plasma all of these depend on the structure of the
magnetic field braginskii 1965 which is shaped by the turbulence if or at scales where a reasonable a priori assumption can be made about the field structure further analytical
progress is possible thus the theoretical models presented in
this paper assume that the magnetic field is a sum of a slowly
varying in space mean field and small lowfrequency perturbations b  b0 
in fact since clusters do not have mean fields of any magnitude that could be considered dynamically significant but
do have stochastic fields the outerscale mhd turbulence in
clusters falls into the weakmeanfield category see  13
the magnetic field should be highly filamentary organized
in long folded directionreversing structures it is not currently known what determines the reversal scale45 observations while tentatively confirming the existence of very
45 see schekochihin  cowley 2006 for a detailed presentation of our
views on the interplay between turbulence magnetic field and plasma effects in cluster for further discussions and disagreements see ensslin  vogt
2006 subramanian et al 2006 brunetti  lazarian 2007

47

long filaments clarke  ensslin 2006 suggest that the reversal scale is much larger than the ion gyroscale thus the
magneticenergy spectrum for the hydra a cluster core reported by vogt  ensslin 2005 peaks at around 1 kpc compared to i  105 km below this scale an alfvnwave cascade should exist as is indeed suggested by vogt  ensslins
spectrum being roughly consistent with k53 at scales below
the peak as these scales are collisionless mfpi  100 pc in
the cores and  10 kpc in the bulk of the clusters it is to this
turbulence that the theory developed in this paper should be
applicable
another complication exists similar to that discussed in
 83 pressure anisotropies could give rise to fast plasma
instabilities whose growth rate peaks just above the ion gyroscale as was pointed out by schekochihin et al 2005
these are in fact an inevitable consequence of any largescale
fluid motions that change the strength of the magnetic field
although a number of interesting and plausible arguments
can be made about the way the instabilities might determine
the magneticfield structure schekochihin  cowley 2006
schekochihin et al 2008a rosin et al 2009 rincon et al
2009 it is not currently understood how the smallscale
fluctuations resulting from these instabilities coexist with the
alfvnic cascade
the uncertainties that result from this imperfect understanding of the nature of the intracluster medium are exemplified by the problem of its thermal conductivity the magneticfield reversal scale in clusters is certainly not larger than the
electron diffusion scale mi me 12 mfpi  which varies from a
few kpc in the cores to a few hundred kpc in the bulk therefore one would expect that the approximation of isothermal
electron fluid  4 should certainly apply at all scales below
the reversal scale where b  b0 presumably holds even
this however is not absolutely clear one could imagine
the electrons being effectively adiabatic if or in the regions
where the plasma instabilities give rise to large fluctuations
of the magnetic field bb0  1 at the ion gyroscale reducing the mean free path to mfpi  i schekochihin et al
2008a rosin et al 2009 rincon et al 2009 such fluctuations cannot be described by the gyrokinetics in its current form the current state of the observational evidence
does not allow one to exclude either of these possibilities
both isothermal fabian et al 2006 sanders  fabian 2006
and nonisothermal markevitch  vikhlinin 2007 coherent
structures that appear to be shocks are observed disordered
fluctuations of temperature can also be detected which allows
one to infer an upper limit for the scale at which the isothermal
approximation can start being valid thus markevitch et al
2003 find temperature variations at all scales down to 
100 kpc which is the statistical limit that defines the spatial resolution of their temperature map in none of these or
similar measurements is the magnetic field data available that
would make possible a pointwise comparison of the magnetic
and thermal structure
because of this lack of information about the state of the
magnetized plasma in clusters theories of the intracluster
medium are not sufficiently constrained by observations so
no one theory is in a position to prevail this uncertain state
of affairs might be improved by analyzing the observationally
much better resolved case of the solar wind which should be
quite similar to the intracluster medium at very small scales
except for somewhat lower values of i in the solar wind
9 conclusion

schekochihin et al

in this paper we have considered magnetized plasma turbulence in the astrophysically prevalent regime of weak collisionality we have shown how the energy injected at the
outer scale cascades in phase space eventually to increase the
entropy of the system and heat the particles in the process
we have explained how one combines plasma physics tools
in particular the gyrokinetic theorywith the ideas of a turbulent cascade of energy to arrive at a hierarchy of tractable
models of turbulence in various physically distinct scale intervals these models represent the branching pathways of a
generalized energy cascade in phase space the kinetic cascade see fig 5 and make explicit the fluid and kinetic
aspects of plasma turbulence
a detailed outline of these developments was given in the
introduction intermediate technical summaries were provided in  49  57 and  714 an astrophysical summary
and discussion of the observational evidence was given in  8
with a particular emphasis on space plasmas  8183 our
view of how the transformation of the largescale turbulent
energy into heat occurs was encapsulated in the concept of
a kinetic cascade of generalized energy it was previewed in
 14 and developed quantitatively in  3435  47  56

up a theoretical framework for astrophysical gyrokinetics

2007 closures appear to be the way forward in developing a
comprehensive numerical model of the kinetic turbulent cascade from the outer scale to the electron gyroscale of the
many astrophysical plasmas to which these results apply the
solar wind and perhaps the magnetosheath due to the high
quality of turbulence measurements possible in them appear
to be the most suitable test beds for direct and detailed quantitative comparisons of the theory and simulation results with
observational evidence the objective of all this work remains
a quantitative characterization of the scalingrange properties
spectra anisotropy nature of fluctuations and their interactions the ion and electron heating and the transport properties of the magnetized plasma turbulence

a braginskiis twofluid equations and reduced mhd

here we explain how the standard onefluid mhd equations used in  2 and the collisional limit of the krmhd system
 61 derived in appendix d both emerge as limiting cases of the twofluid theory for the case of anisotropic fluctuations
kk k  1 all of this can of course be derived from gyrokinetics but it is useful to provide a connection to the more well
known fluid description of collisional plasmas

in this form the twofluid theory starts resembling the standard onefluid mhd which was our starting point in  2 eqs a5a7 already look similar to the continuity momentum and induction equations the additional terms that appear in these equations

most of the properties of the collision operator that are used in the main body of this paper to order the collision terms

required we could in principle perform the ring average on the linearized operator c eq b2 and derive an explicit form of

unavoidable in most problems of interest further simplifications are possible the samespecies collisions are often modeled by
simpler operators that share the full collision operators conservation properties  b3 while the interspecies collision operators
are expanded in the electronion mass ratio  b4

for the ionelectron collisions s  i s  e using eqs 45 and 51 we find that both terms are  me mi 12 ii k

2 2
thus besides an extra factor of k i  the ionelectron collisions are also subdominant by one order in the massratio expansion
compared to the ionion collisions the same estimate holds for the interspecies contributions to the third and fourth terms in
2 2
eq b4 in a similar fashion the integral of the electronion collision operator s  e s  i is  ei k
e ne  which is the same
order as the integral of the electronelectron collisions
the conclusion of this section is that both for ion and for electron collisions the velocityspace integral at constant r of the
gyrokinetic collision operator is higher order than the collision operator itself by two orders of k s  this is the property that we
relied on in neglecting collision terms in eqs 104 and 137

b2 ordering of collision terms in eqs 125 and 137
in  5 we claimed that the contribution to the ionion collision term due to the zehiri t0i f0i part of the ion distribution
function eq 124 was one order of k i smaller than the contributions from the rest of hi  this was used to order collision
terms in eqs 125 and 137 indeed from eq b3

this estimate holds because as it is easy to ascertain using eq b2 the operator cii annihilates the first two terms in the
expansion and only acts nontrivially on an expression that is second order in k i  with the aid of eq 47 the desired ordering
of the term b9 in eq 125 follows when eq b9 is integrated over velocity space the result picks up two extra orders in
k i a general effect of integrating the gyroaveraged collision operator over the velocity space see eq b4

this is the operator that can be used in the righthand side of eq 145 as eg is done in the calculation of collisional transport
terms in appendix d3
in practical numerical computations of gyrokinetic turbulence the pitchangle scattering operator is not sufficient because the
distribution function develops small scales not only in  but also in v m barnes w dorland and t tatsuno 2006 unpublished
this is indeed expected because the phasespace entropy cascade produces small scales in v  rather than just in  see  791
in order to provide a cut off in v an energydiffusion operator must be added to the pitchanglescattering operator derived above
a numerically tractable model gyrokinetic energydiffusion operator was proposed by abel et al 2008 barnes et al 200948

c a heuristic derivation of the electron equations

here we show how the equations 116117 of  4 and the ermhd equations 226227 of  7 can be derived heuristically
from electron fluid dynamics and a number of physical assumptions without the use of gyrokinetics  c1 this derivation is
not rigorous its role is to provide an intuitive route to the isothermal electron fluid and ermhd approximations

these are faradays law the electron continuity equation and the generalized ohms law which is the electron momentum
equation with all electron inertia terms neglected ie effectively the lowest order in the expansion in the electron mass me  the
electron pressure is assumed to be scalar by fiat this can be justified in certain limits for example in the collisional limit as in
appendix a or for the isothermal electron fluid approximation derived in  4 the electronpressure term in the righthand side
of ohms law is sometimes called the thermoelectric term we now assume the same static uniform equilibrium e0  0 b0  b0 
that we have used throughout this paper and apply to eqs c1 the fundamental ordering discussed in  31

the righthand side and turns the above equation into eq 117 as for the first of the equations c4 the use of eq c6 and
substitution of b     ak turns it into the previously derived eq c2 whence follows eq 116
thus we have shown that eqs 116117 can be derived as a direct consequence of faradays law electron fluid dynamics
electron continuity equation and the electron force balance a k a the generalized ohms law and the assumption of isothermal
electronsall taken to the leading order in the gyrokinetic ordering given in  31 ie assuming strongly interacting anisotropic
fluctuations with kk  k 
we have just proved that eqs 116 and 117 are simply the perpendicular and parallel part respectively of eq c3 the
latter equation means that the magneticfield lines are frozen into the electron flow velocity ue  ie the flux is conserved the
result formally proven in  43 see eq 99
c2 electron mhd and the derivation of eqs 226227

one route to eqs 226227 already explained in  72 is to start with eqs c2 and c7 and assume boltzmann electrons
and ions and the total pressure balance another approach more standard in the literature on the hall and electron mhd is to
start with eq c3 which states that the magnetic field is frozen into the electron flow the electron velocity can be written in
terms of the ion velocity and the current density and the latter then related to the magnetic field via ampres law

the relative size of the two terms in each of these expressions is controlled by the size of k di  where di  i  i is the ion

second of the equations c4 the ne ne terms comes via eq c5 from the divergence of the ion velocity from eq c8

d fluid limit of the kinetic rmhd

taking the fluid collisional limit of the krmhd system summarized in  57 means carrying out another subsidiary
expansionthis time in kk mfpi  1 the expansion only affects the equations for the density and magneticfieldstrength
fluctuations  55 because the alfvn waves are indifferent to collisional effects
the calculation presented below follows a standard perturbation algorithm used in the kinetic theory of gases and in plasma
physics to derive fluid equations with collisional transport coefficients chapman  cowling 1970 for magnetized plasma
this calculation was carried out in full generality by braginskii 1965 whose starting point was the full plasma kinetic theory
eqs 3639 while what we do below is strictly speaking merely a particular case of his calculation see appendix a it has
the advantage of relative simplicity and also serves to show how the fluid limit is recovered from the gyrokinetic formalisma
demonstration that we believe to be of value
it will be convenient to use the krmhd system written in terms of the function  f i  g  v2 v2thi bk b0 f0i  which is the
perturbation of the local maxwellian in the frame of the alfvn waves eqs 150152 we want to expand eq 150 in powers

it must do because the collision operator in the lefthand side conserves particle number momentum and energy
solving eq d15 requires inverting the collision operator while this can be done for the general landau collision operator
see braginskii 1965 for our purposes it is sufficient to use the model operator given in appendix b3 eq b18 this simplifies
calculations at the expense of an orderone inaccuracy in the numerical values of the transport coefficients as the exact value of
these coefficients will never be crucial for us this is an acceptable loss of precision inverting the collision operator in eq d15

where the ion flow velocity ui satisfies the conventional mhd momentum equation 8 the hall mhd is an appealing theoretical
model that appears to capture both the mhd behavior at long wavelengths when ue  ui  and some of the kinetic effects that
become important at small scales due to decoupling between the electron and ion flows the appearance of dispersive waves
without bringing in the full complexity of the kinetic theory however unlike the kinetic theory it completely ignores the
collisionless
damping effects and suggests that the keypsmallscale physical change is associated with the ion inertial scale

di  i  i or when e  1 the ion sound scale s  i z2  see  e3 rather than the ion gyroscale i  is this an acceptable
model for plasma turbulence figure 8 illustrates the fact that at   1 the ion inertial scale does not play a special role linearly
the mhd alfvn wave becomes dispersive at the ion gyroscale not at di  and that the collisionless damping cannot in general
be neglected a detailed comparison of the hall mhd linear dispersion relation with full hot plasma dispersion relation leads to
the conclusion that hall mhd is only a valid approximation in the limit of cold ions namely   t0i t0e  1 ito et al 2004
hirose et al 2004 in this appendix we show that a reduced lowfrequency anisotropic version of hall mhd can indeed be
derived from gyrokinetics in the limit   150 this demonstrates that the hall mhd model fits into the theoretical framework
proposed in this paper as a special limit however the parameter regime that gives rise to this special limit is not common in
space and astrophysical plasmas of interest
e1 gyrokinetic derivation of hall reduced mhd

let us start with the equations of isothermal electron fluid eqs 116121 ie work within the assumptions that allowed us
to carry out the massratio expansion  48 in eq 120 perpendicular ampres law or gyrokinetic pressure balance taking

expansions can be carried out later and expand the ion gyrokinetics in k i  k di i  1 note that ordering e  1 means
that we have ordered i    1 we now proceed analogously to the way we did in  5 express the ion distribution in terms of

all terms in these equations can be ordered with respect to the small parameter i an expansion subsidiary to the gyrokinetic
expansion in  and the hall expansion in   1 the lowest order to which
 they enter is indicated underneath each term the
ordering we use is the same as in  52 but now we count the powers of i and order formally k di  1 and e  1 it is easy

and that the ion and electron terms in eqs e3 are comparable under this ordering so their competition is retained in fact this
could be used as the underlying assumption behind the ordering the fluctuation
frequency continues to be ordered as the alfvn

frequency   kk va  the collision terms are ordered via ii  kk mfpi  i and kk mfpi  1 although the latter assumption is
not essential for what follows because collisions turn out to be negligible and it is fine to take kk mfpi  1 from the outset and
neglect them completely

the first four terms are the energy of the alfvnic and slowwavepolarized fluctuations cf eq d12 unlike in rmhd these
are not decoupled in hrmhd unless a further subsidiary longwavelength limit is taken see  e4 it is easy to verify that the
sum of these four terms is indeed conserved by eqs e3 e8 and e9 the last term in eq e13 is an individually conserved
kinetic quantity its conservation reflects the fact that g is decoupled from the wave dynamics and passively advected by the
alfvnic velocities via eq e1251
the passive kinetic mode g can be thought of as a kinetic version of the mhd entropy mode and indeed reduces to it if the
collision operator
in eq e5 is upgraded to the leading order by ordering ii  1 ie by considering long parallel wavelengths

krk mfpi  i  in such a collisional limit g has to be a perturbed maxwellian with no density or velocity perturbation because

e4 summary of hall rmhd and the role of the ion inertial and ion sound scales
we have shown that in the limit of cold ions and low ion beta i    1 the hall limit gyrokinetic turbulence can be
described by five scalar functions the stream and flux functions  and  for the alfvnic fluctuations the parallel velocity and
magneticfield perturbations uki and bk for the slowwavepolarized fluctuations and g the zerodensity zerovelocity part of
the ion distribution function which is the kinetic version of the mhd entropy mode the first four of these functions satisfy a
closed set of four fluidlike equations derived in  e1 and collected here

we call these equations the hall reduced magnetohydrodynamics hrmhd to fully account for the generalized energy cascade one must append to the four hrmhd equations the fifth kinetic equation e12 for g which is energetically decoupled
from hrmhd and slaved to the alfvnic velocity fluctuations  e2
p
the equations given above are valid above the ion gyroscale k i  1 they contain a special scale di  1  2e which
is the ion inertial scale di for e  1 and the ion sound scale s  cs i for e  1 as becomes clear from the linear theory
 e3 the alfvn and slow waves become dispersive at this scale nonlinearly this scale marks the transition from the regime
in which
p the alfvnic and slowwavepolarized fluctuations are decoupled to the regime in which they are mixed namely when
become eqs 17 and 26 while eqs e20 remain unchanged
k di  1  2e  1 hrmhd turns into rmhd eqs e19p
and identical to eqs 18 and 27 in the opposite limit k di  1  2e  1 the ion motion decouples from the magneticfield
evolution and eqs e19 turn into the ermhd equations 226227
since we are considering the case i  1 both di and s are much larger than the ion gyroscale i  in the opposite limit of
i  1  e11 while di is the only scale that appears explicitly in eqs e4 we have di  i and the equations themselves
represent the dynamics at scales much smaller than the ion gyroscale so the transition between the rmhd and ermhd regimes
occurs at k i  1 the same is true for i  1 when di  i  the ion sound scale s  i does not play a special role when
i is not small it is not hard to see that for k s  1 the ion motion
p terms in eqs e19 dominate and we simply recover the
inertialrange krmhd model  5 by expanding in k i  k s 2 z  1
various theories of the dissipationrange turbulence based on hall and electron mhd are further discussed in  826
f twodimensional invariants in gyrokinetics

since gyrokinetics is in a sense a quasitwodimensional approximation it is natural to inquire if this gives rise to additional
conservation properties besides the conservation of the generalized energy discussed in  34 and how they are broken by the
presence of parallel propagation terms it is important to emphasize that except in a few special cases these invariants are only
invariants in 2d so gyrokinetic turbulence in 2d and 3d has fundamentally different properties despite its seemingly quasi2d
nature it is therefore generally not correct to think of the gyrokinetic turbulence or its special case the mhd turbulence as
essentially a 2d turbulence with an admixture of parallelpropagating waves fyfe et al 1977 montgomery  turner 1981
in this appendix we work out the 2d invariants without attempting to present a complete analysis of the 2d conservation
properties of gyrokinetics we limit our discussion to showing how some more familiar fluid invariants most notably magnetic
helicity emerge from the general 2d invariants in the appropriate asymptotic limits
f1 general 2d invariants
r
in deriving the generalized energy invariant we used the fact that d 3 rs hs hirs  hs   0 so eq 57 after multiplication
rby 3t0s hs f0s and integration over space contains no contribution from the poissonbracket nonlinearity since we also have
d rs hirs hirs  hs   0 multiplying eq 57 by qs hirs and integrating over space has a similar outcome subtracting the
latter integrated equation from the former and rearranging terms gives

f4 magnetic helicity in the rmhd limit

unlike in the case of ermhd the helicity of the perturbed magnetic field in rmhd is conserved only in 2d this is because
the induction equation for the perturbed field has an inhomogeneous term associated with the mean field eq 10 with b 
b0   b this issue has been extensively discussed in the literature see matthaeus  goldstein 1982 stribling et al 1994

this equation is a general 2d conservation law of the krmhd equations see  57 and can also be derived directly from them
if we integrate it over velocities and use eqs 146 and 147 we simply recover eq f4 however since eq f9 holds for
every value of vk and v  it carries much more information than eq f4
to make connection to mhd let us consider the fluid collisional limit of krmhd worked out in appendix d the distribution function to lowest order in the kk mfpi  1 expansion is g  v2 v2thi bk b0   f i0  where  f i0 is the perturbed maxwellian
given by eq d3 we can substitute this expression into eq f9 since in this expansion the collision integral is applied to  f i1
and is the same order as the rest of the terms see  d3 conservation laws are best derived by taking 1 vk  and v2 v2thi moments
of eq f9 so as to make the collision term vanish in particular multiplying
f9 by 1  2 3zv2v2thi  integrating over
r eq

velocities and using eqs d4 and d6 we obtain the evolution equation for drr ak bk  whichrcoincides with eq f7 note
that either proceeding in an analogous way one can derive similar equations for d 3 r ak ne and d 3 r ak uk these are also 2d
invariants of the rmhd system broken in 3d by the presence of the propagation terms the same result can be derived directly
from the evolution equations d8 and d10

schekochihin et al

f5 electrostatic invariant
interestingly the existence of the general 2d invariants introduced in  f1 alongside the generalized energy invariant given by
eq 73 means that one can construct a 2d invariant of gyrokinetics that does not involve any velocityspace quantities in order
to do that one must integrate eq f1 over velocities sum over species and subtract eq 73 from the resulting equation thus
removing the h2s integrals the result is not particularly edifying in the general case but it takes a simple form if one considers
electrostatic perturbations b  0 in this case    and the manipulations described above lead to the following equation

f6 implications for turbulent cascades and scalings
since invariants other than the generalized energy or its constituent parts are present in 2d and in some limits also in 3d one
might ask how their presence affects the turbulent cascades and scalings as an example let us consider the magnetic helicity in
kaw turbulence which is a 3d invariant of the ermhd equations  f3
a kolmogorovstyle analysis of a local kaw cascade based on a constant flux of helicity gives proceeding as in  75

r 3
where h is the helicity flux omitting constant dimensional factors the helicity is now defined as d r  and assumed to be
53
nonzero this corresponds to a k spectrum of magnetic energy
in order to decide whether we expect the scalings to be determined by the constanthelicity flux or by the constantenergy
flux as assumed in  75 we adapt a standard argument originally due to fjrtoft 1953 if the helicity flux of the kaw
turbulence originating at the ion gyroscale via partial conversion from the inertialrange turbulence see  7 is h  its energy
flux is kaw  h set   i in eq f11 and compare with eq 238 if the cascade between the ion and electron gyroscales
is controlled by maintaining a constant flux of helicity then the helicity flux arriving to the electron gyroscale is still h  while
the associated energy flux is h i e  kaw  ie more energy arrives to e than there was at i  this is clearly impossible in
a stationary state the way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the helicity cascade is in fact inverse ie directed
towards larger scales while the energy cascade is direct to smaller scales a similar argument based on the constancy of the
energy flux kaw then leads to the conclusion that the helicity flux arriving to the electron gyroscale is kaw e i  h  kaw 
ie the helicity indeed does not cascade to smaller scales it does not in fact cascade to large scales either because the ermhd
equations are not valid above the ion gyroscale and the helicity of the perturbed magnetic field in the inertial range is not a 3d
invariant  f4 the situation would be different if an energy source existed either at the electron gyroscale or somewhere in
between e and i  in such a case one would expect an inverse helicity cascade and the consequent shallower scaling eq f11
between the energyinjection scale and the ion gyroscale
other invariants introduced above can in a similar fashion be argued to give rise to inverse cascades in the hypothetical 2d
situations where they are valid and provided there is energy injection at small scales for the electrostatic case see plunk et al
2009 and numerical simulations by tatsuno et al 2009b the view of turbulence advanced in this paper does not generally
allow for this to happen first the fundamentally 3d nature of the turbulence is imposed via the critical balance conjecture and
supported by the argument that two dimensionality can only be maintained across parallel distances that do not exceed the
distance a parallelpropagating wave or parallelstreaming particles travels over one nonlinear decorrelation time see  12
 75 and  7103 secondly the lack of smallscale energy injection was assumed at the outset this can however be violated
in real astrophysical plasmas by various smallscale plasma instabilities eg triggered by pressure anisotropies see discussion
in  83 treatment of such effects falls outside the scope of this paper and remains a matter for future work

kinetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas

63

this is the general form of the momentum equation that is also valid for collisionless plasmas when k i  1 but kk mfpi is order unity or even large equation 12 together with the continuity equation a10 the induction equation a11 and a kinetic equation for the particle distribution function from the solution
of which p and pk are determined form the system known as kinetic mhd kmhd see kulsrud 1964 1983 the collisional limit kk mfpi  1 of kmhd
is again eqs a9a13
48 the collision operator now used the gs2 and astrogk codes see footnote 46 is their energydiffusion operator plus the pitchanglescattering operator b13
49 the third term in eq b20 is in fact never important at the electron scales k   1 it is negligible because of the bessel function in the velocity
 e
integral abel et al 2008
50 note that strictly speaking our ordering of the collision frequency does not allow us to take this limit see footnote 17 but this is a minor betrayal of rigor
which does not in fact invalidate the results
51 a similar splitting of the generalized energy cascade into a fluidlike cascade plus a passive cascade of a zerodensity part of the distribution function occurs
in the hasegawamima regime which is the electrostatic version of the hall limit plunk et al 2009
52 the full gyrokinetic dispersion relation in a similar limit was worked out in howes et al 2006 appendix d21
53 note that wave packets with k   k and satisfying eq e17 with k v  as a function of k given by eq e16 are exact nonlinear solutions of



k a
the hrmhd equations e3 and e8e9 this can be shown via a calculation analogous to that in  73 for the incompressible hall mhd this was done by
