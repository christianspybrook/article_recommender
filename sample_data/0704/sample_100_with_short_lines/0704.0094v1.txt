we present semianalytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy
cluster using the classical local group timing arguments we consider particle orbits in potential
models which fit the lensing data marginally consistent cdm models in newtonian gravity are
found with a total mass mcdm  1  1015 m of cold dm the bullet subhalo can move with
vdm  3000 km s1  and the bullet xray gas can move with vgas  4200 km s1  these are
nearly the maximum speeds that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated cdm halos in a
hubble time even without the ram pressure consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed 5000  5400 km s1  and the bullet gas would not be bound
by the subcluster halo for the hubble time models with vdm  4500 km s1  vgas would invoke
unrealistic large amount mcdm  7  1015 m of cdm for a cluster containing only  1014 m of
gas our results are generalisable beyond general relativity eg a speed of 4500 km s1 is easily
obtained in the relativistic mondian lensing model of angus et al 2007 however mondian
model with hot dark matter mhdm  061015 m and cdm model with a halo mass  11015 m
are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data

potential from timing

timing is a unique technique to establish the case for
dark matter halos first and most throughly explored in
the context of the local group kahn  woljter 1959
fich  tremaine 1991 peebles 1989 inga  saha 1998
in its simplest version the local group consists of the
milky way and m31 as two isolated point masses which
formed close to each other moved apart due to the hubble expansion and slowed down and moved towards each
other upto their present velocity  120 km s1 and separation about 700 kpc due to their mutual gravity the
age of the universe sets the upper limit on the period of
this galaxy pair hence the total mass of the pair through
keplers 3rd law assuming newtonian gravity
timing also finds a timely application in the pair of
merging galaxy clusters 1e065756 at redshift z  03
which is largely an extragalactic grand analogy of the
m31mw system the subcluster called the bullet
presently penetrates 400700 kpc through the main clus1
ter with an apparent speed of  4750710
marke550 km s
vitch 2006 the xray gas of the bullet amounts to
2  1013m  collides with the xray gas of the main cluster with the total gas up to 1014 m  and forms a mach3
cone in front of the bullet the two clusters have at
least four different centers which are offset by 400 kpc
between the pair of xray gas centers and by 700 kpc
between the pair of starlight centers which coincides
with the gravitational lensing centers and dark matter
potential centers clowe et al 2006 the penetration
speed is unusually high hard for standard cosmology to
explain statistically hayashi  white 2006 and modi

the timing method applies in in mondian gravity
as well as newtonian like lensing timing is merely a
method about constraining potential distribution and is
only indirectly related to the matter distribution in this
letter we model the bullet clusters as a pair of mass concentrations formed at high redshift and set constraint on
their mutual force using the simple fact that their radial
oscillation period must be close to the age of universe
at z  03 we check the consistency with the lensing
signal of the cluster and give interpretations in terms of
standard cdm and mond
first we can understand the speed of the bullet cluster analytically in simplified scenarios approximate the
two clusters as points of fixed masses m1 and m2 on a
headon orbit we can apply the usual mwm31 timing
argument the total mass m0  m1  m2 is constant

grom 1994 zhao 2007 in preparation for a typical mass
ratio
the predictions for simple newtonian keplerian gravity are given in fig 1 the more subtle case for a mondian cluster is discussed in the final section setting the
orbital period t  10gyrs the age of the universe at
the cluster redshift yields presently v  3200 km s1 in
newtonian for a normal combined mass of m1  m2 
07  1  1015 m for the clusters which is about 710
times their baryonic gas content  1014 m  for newtonian universe of   03 cold dark matter in agreement
with farrar  rosen and hayashi  white the simple timing argument suggests that dark halo velocities
of 4750 km s1  as high as the bullet xray gas would
require halos with unrealistically larger masses of dark
matter  1016 m  an order of magnitude more than
what a universal baryondark ratio implies as a sanity
check assuming a conventional 3  1012 m local group
dark matter mass fig1 predicts the relative velocity of
 100kms for the m31mw system at separation 700
kpc after 14 gyrs consistent with observation binney
 tremaine 1987
these analytical arguments while straightforward are
not precise given its simplifying assumptions for one
clusters do not form immediately at redshift infinity and
the cluster mass and size might grow with time graduallly more important is that point mass newtonian halo
models are far from fitting the weak lensing data of the
1e065756 a shallower newtonian potential makes it
even more difficult to accelerate the bullet on the other
hand angus shan zhao famaey 2007 show that there
are mondinspired potentials that fits lensing as commented in their conclusion the same potential is deep
enough that a v  4750 km s1 bullet is bound in an
orbit of apocenter rmax of a few mpc so the two clusters could be accelerated by mutual gravity from a zero
velocity apocenter to 4750 kms within the clusters lifetime this line of thought was further explored by the
more systematic numerical study of angus  mcgaugh
2007
our paper is a spinoff of these works and the works
of hayashi  white and farrar  rosen we emphasize
the unification of the semianalytical timing perspective
and the lensing perspective and aim to derive robust
constraints to the potential without being limited to a

specific gravity theory or dark matter candidate
towards the completion of this work we are made
aware by the preprint of springel  farrar 2007 that the
unobserved bullet dm halo could be moving slower than
its observed stripped xray gas these authors as well
as the preprint of milosovic et al 2007 emphasized the
effect of hydrodynamical pressure which we will not be
able to model realisticly here but to address the velocity
differences instead we treat the xray gas as a bullestic
particle we argue that our hypothetical ballistic particle must move slow enough to be bound to vicinity of the
subhalo before the collision but moves somewhat faster

now since it does not experience

ram pressure of the gas this model follows the spirit
of classical timing models of the separation of the large
and small magellanic clouds and the magellanic stream

3d potential from lensing

the weak lensing shear map of clowe et al 2006
has been fitted by angus et al 2007 using a fourcomponent analytical potential each being spherical but
on different centres for our purpose we redistribute the
minor components and simplify the potential into two
components centred on the moving centroid of galaxy
light of the main cluster with the present spatial coordinates r1 t  564 176 0 kpc and subcluster galaxy
centroid r2 t  145 0 0 kpc the coordinate origin is
set at the present brightest point of the bullet xray

gas presently the cluster is at z  03 or cosmic time
t  10gyrs we also apply a keplerian truncation to the
potential beyond the truncation radius rt  so the following 3d potential is adopted for the cluster 1e065756 at

transition of the potential across the truncation radius rt 
the truncation rt evolves with time since a precluster
region collapses gradually after the big bang and its

the size of a cluster in the interests of simplicity rather

is insensitive to the cluster truncation radius as long as

et al and strong lensing data of bradac et al it is
known that these two data sets are somewhat discrepant
to each other so the fit here is reasonable the method
is deprojection is essentially similar to the decomoposition method of bradac et al whose explicit assumption
of einsteinian gravity is however unnecessary
the important thing here is that as far as deprojecting the above potential is concerned no assumption is
needed on the gravity theory as long as light rays follow geodesics a feature built in most alternative gravity theory similarly orbits of massive particles are also
different geodesics in these theories the meaning of

orbits of the colliding clusters

we now use this potential to predict the relative speed
of the two clusters this is possible using the classical
timing argument in the style of kahn  wolter 159
fich  tremaine 1991 and voltonen et al 1998
we postpone most rigourous least action models peebles 1989 schmoldt  saha 1998 for later investigations since these require modeling a cosmological constant and other mass concentrations along the orbital
path of the bullet clusters which have technical issues in
nonnewtonian gravity we trace the orbits of the two
centroids of the potentials according to the equation of
2
motion ddtr2i  ri  we assign different relative velocities presently at z  03 and integrate backward
in time and require the two centroids of the potential be
close together at a time 10 gyrs ago the motions are
primarily in the sky plane but we allow for 600 kms
relative velocity component in the line of sight clearly
at earlier times when t is small the two centroids are
wellseparated compared to their sizes so they move in
the growing keplerian potential of each other at latter times the centroids came close and move in the cored

isothermal potential
we shall consider models with a normal truncation
rt  c  t  1000 kpc at time t  10 gyrs we also
consider models with a very large truncation c  t 
10000 kpc in the language of cdm the truncation
means the virial radius of the halo the present instantaneous escapepspeed of the model can be computed by vesc 
2x y z t we find vesc 
4200  4500 km s1 in the central region of the shallower
potential model with a present truncation 1000 kpc the
escape speed increases to vesc  5700 km s1 for models
with a present truncation 10000 kpc
fig 3 shows the predicted orbits for different present
dr1
2
relative velocities vdm   dr
dt  dt  among models
with a normal truncation we find vdm  2950 km s1  a
model with relative velocity vdm  2800 km s1 would
predict an unphysical orbital crossing at high redshift
while models with vdm  3000 km s1 would predict
that the two potential centroids were never close at high
redshift
larger halo velocities are only possible in models
with very large truncation if the relative velocity is
4200 km s1  vdm  4750 km s1 between two cluster gravity centroids then the truncation must be as big
as 10mpc at z  03
we also track the orbit of the bullet xray gas centroid as a tracer particle in the above bicentric potential we look for orbits where the bullet xray gas will
always be bound to one member of the binary system
since the ram pressure in a hydrodynamical collision is
unlikely to be so efficient to eject the xray gas out of
potential wells of both the main and subclusters this
means that the bullet speed must not exceed greatly the
present instantaneous escape speed of the model which is
 4200  4500 km s1 in the central region of the shallow
potential of a model with a present truncation 1000 kpc
the escape speed increases to  5700 km s1 for models
with a present truncation 10000 kpc the model with
normal truncation is marginally consistent with the ob1
served gas speed vgas  4750710
 the problem
550 km s
would become more severe if the potential were made
shallower by an even smaller truncation the gas speed
is less an issue in models with larger truncation
in short the present velocity and lensing data are easier explained with potential models of very large truncation models with normal truncation have smaller
gravitational power can only accelerate the subhalo to
3000 km s1 in 10 gyrs models with normal cdm truncation can only accelerate the bullet xray gas cloud to
 4200  4400 km s1  the escape speed marginally consistent with observations
above simulation results are sensitive to the present
cluster separation but insensitive to the present direction of the velocity vector unmodeled effects such as
dynamical friction associated with a live halo will reduce
the predicted vdm for the same potential but the effect
is mild since the actual collision is brief  01  03gyrs

newtonian and mondian meanings
of the potential model

assuming newtonian gravity the models with normal
truncation rt  1mpc at t  10gyrs correspond to cluster dark masses of m1  0745  1015 m and m2 
0345  1015m  the larger truncation rt  10mpc corresponds to m1  745  1015m and m2  345  1015m
in newtonian all these models fit lensing
interpreted in the mondian gravity the truncation
is due to external field effect and cosmic background

5
so to make the mond potential finite hence escapable
famaey bruneton zhao 2007 beyond the truncation radius mond potential becomes nearly keplerian the mondian models insensitive to truncation would have masses only m1  066  1015 m and
m2  016  1015 m  these masses are still higher
than their baryonic content  1014 m  implying the
need for eg massive neutrinos the neutrino density
is too low in galaxies to affect normal mondian fits to
galaxy rotation curves but is high enough to bend light
and orbits significantly on 1mpc scale the neutrinotobaryon ration approximately 71 in the bullet cluster
would be a reasonable assumption for a mondian universe with b  004 plus 2ev neutrinos hot dark matter
hdm  025  7  b sanders 2003 pointecoute 
silk 2005 skordis et al 2006 angus et al 2007 the
amount of hot dark matter inferred here is the same as
angus et al 2007 since their potential parameters are
fixed by the same lensing data
v

relative speeds between galaxies of the two clusters is predicted to be vdm  2900 km s1 in cdm and vdm 
4500 km s1 in hdm mond  hot dark matter if
the two clusters were born close to each other 10 gyrs
ago both models assume close to universal gasdm ratio
in clusters ie about 06  1  1015 m hot or cold
dm modeling the bullet xray gas as ballistic particle
we find the gas particle with speed of vgas  4200kms
at the lower end of observed speed is bound to the
potential of the subcluster for most part of the hubble
time for both above models insensitive to the preference
of the law of gravity but if future relative proper motion measurements of the subcluster galaxy speed is as
high as vdm  4500kms or the gas speed is as high as
vgas  5400 km s1  then newtonian models would need
to invoke unlikely 7  1015 m dm halos around 1014 m
gas

conclusion

in short a consistent set of simple lensing and dynamical model of the bullet cluster is found the present
