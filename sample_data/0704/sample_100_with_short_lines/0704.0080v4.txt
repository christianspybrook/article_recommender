abstract
we show that the globular cluster mass function gcmf in the milky way depends on cluster halfmass
density h  in the sense that the turnover mass mto increases with h while the width of the gcmf decreases
we argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low
masses predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal twobody relaxation we find excellent
agreement between the observed gcmfincluding its dependence on internal density rhoh  central concentration c and galactocentric distance rgc and a simple model in which the relaxationdriven massloss rates
12
of clusters are approximated by dmdt  ev  h  in particular we recover the wellknown insensitivity
of mto to rgc  this feature does not derive from a literal universality of the gcmf turnover mass but rather
from a significant variation of mto with h the expected outcome of relaxationdriven cluster disruption
plus significant scatter in h as a function of rgc  our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are
assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii as

1 introduction
the mass functions of star cluster systems provide an important point of reference for attempts to understand the connection between old globular clusters gcs and the young
massive clusters that form in local starbursts and galaxy mergers when expressed as the number per unit logarithmic mass
dnd log m the gc mass function gcmf is characterized by a peak or turnover at a mass mto  12  105 m
that is empirically very similar in most galaxies by contrast the mass functions of young clusters show no such feature but instead rise monotonically towards low masses over
the full observed range 106 m  m  104 m in the beststudied cases in a way that is well described by a power law
dnd log m  m 1 with   2 eg zhang  fall 1999
at the same time for high m  mto  old gcmfs
closely resemble the mass functions of young clusters and
of molecular clouds in the milky way and other galaxies
harris  pudritz 1994 elmegreen  efremov 1997 and
it is well known that a number of dynamical processes
cause star clusters to lose mass and can lead to their complete destruction as they orbit for a hubble time in the
potential wells of their parent galaxies eg fall  rees

whether the peaks in gcmfs can be explained by the deple1 dept of physics and astronomy university of leicester university

tion over many gyr of globulars from initial mass distributions that were similar to those of young clusters below mto
as well as above
our chief purpose in this paper is to establish and interpret an aspect of the galactic gcmf that appears fundamental but has gone largely unnoticed to date dnd log m has
a strong and systematic dependence on gc halfmass density h  3m8rh3 rh being the cluster halfmass radius in
the sense that the turnover mass mto increases and the width
of the distribution decreases with increasing h  as observed
facts these must be explained by any theory of the gcmf we
argue here that they are an expected signature of slow dynamical evolution from a mass function that initially increased
towards m  mto  if the longterm mass loss from surviving gcs has been dominated by stellar escape due to internal
twobody relaxation which we refer to from now on as either
relaxationdriven evaporation or simply evaporation
fall  zhang 2001 hereafter fz01 explain in detail why
cluster evaporation dominates the longterm evolution of the
lowmass shape of observable gcmfs briefly stellar evolution removes through supernovae and winds the same fraction of mass from all clusters of a given age and so cannot
change the shape of dnd log m unless special initial conditions are invoked cf vesperini  zepf 2003 meanwhile
for gcs like those that have survived for a hubble time in
the milky way the mass loss from gravitational shocks during disk crossings and bulge passages is generally less than
that due to evaporation for m  mto fz01 prieto  gnedin
20065
as we discuss further in 2 below the evaporation of tidally
5 it is possible that there existed a past population of gcs with low densities or concentrations or perhaps on extreme orbits that were destroyed in
less than a hubble time by shocks or stellar evolution our discussion does
not cover such clusters

limited clusters proceeds at a rate ev  dmdt that is approximately constant in time and primarily determined by
cluster density fz01 show that a constant massloss rate
leads to a powerlaw scaling dnd log m  m 1 with   0
corresponding to a flat distribution of clusters per unit linear mass at sufficiently low m  evt in the evolved mass
function of coeval gcs that began with any nontrivial initial dnd log m0 6 to accommodate this when dnd log m0
originally increased towards low masses as a power law a
timedependent peak must develop in the gcmf at a mass
of order mto t  evt fz01 but then since ev depends
fundamentally on cluster density so too must mto 
a   0 powerlaw scaling below the turnover mass has
been confirmed directly in the gcmfs of the milky way
fz01 and the giant elliptical m87 waters et al 2006 while
jordn et al 2007 show it to be consistent with dnd log m
data for 89 virgo cluster galaxies and it is apparent in deep
observations of some other gcmfs eg in the sombrero
galaxy m104 spitler et al 2006 as regards the peak itself
old gcs are observed eg jordn et al 2005 to have rather
similar densities on averageand therefore similar typical
ev in galaxies with widely different total luminosities and
hubble types inasmuch as cluster densities are set by tides
this is probably related to the mild variation of mean galaxy
density with total luminosity see fz01 and also jordn et al
2007 thus an evaporationdominated evolutionary origin
for a turnover in the gcmf appears to be consistent with
the wellknown fact that the mass scale mto generally differs very little among galaxies eg harris 2001 jordn et al
2006
if this picture is basically correct it implies that even
though mto may appear nearly universal when considering
the global mass functions of entire gc systems in fact the
gcmfs of subsamples of clusters with similar ages but different densities should have different turnovers in 2 we
showworking for definiteness and relatively easy observability with the halfmass density h that this is the case for
globulars in the milky way we fit the observed dnd log m
for gcs in bins of different h with models assuming that
1 the initial distribution increased as a   2 power law at
low masses and 2 the massloss rates of individual clusters
can be estimated from their halfmass densities by the rule
12
ev  h  in 3 we discuss the validity of this prescription
for ev  which is certainly approximate but captures the main
physical dependence of relaxationdriven mass loss in par12
ticular we show that the alternative massloss laws ev  t
34
and ev  t where t and t are the mean volume and
surface densities inside cluster tidal radiilead to models for
the gcmf that are essentially indistinguishable from those
12
based on ev  h  the normalization of ev required to fit
the observed gcmf implies cluster lifetimes that are within
a factor of  2 perhaps slightly on the low side if the initial powerlaw exponent at low masses was   2 of typical
values in theories and simulations of twobody relaxation in
tidally limited gcs
we also show in 2 that when the observed densities of individual clusters are used in our models to predict gcmfs
in different bins of galactocentric radius rgc  they fit the

in the development of longlived clusters after they have dispersed any remnants of their natal gas clouds survived the bulk of stellarevolution mass
loss and come into virial equilibrium in the tidal field of a galaxy

much weaker variation of dnd log m and mto as functions
of rgc  which is wellknown in the milky way and other large
galaxies see harris 2001 harris harris  mclaughlin
1998 barmby huchra  brodie 2001 vesperini et al 2003
jordn et al 2007 similarly applying our models to the
gcs in two bins of central concentration with only the measured h of the clusters in each subsample as input suffices
to account for previously noted differences between the mass
functions of low and highconcentration galactic globulars
smith  burkert 2002 the most fundamental feature of the
gcmf therefore appears to be its dependence on cluster density which can be understood at least qualitatively and even
quantitatively to within a factor of 2 in terms of evaporationdominated cluster disruption
there is a widespread perception that if the gcmf evolved
slowly from a rising power law at low masses then a weak
or null variation of mto with rgc can be achieved only in gc
systems with strongly radially anisotropic velocity distributions which are not observed see especially vesperini et al
2003 this apparent inconsistency has been cited to bolster some recent attempts to identify a mechanism by which
a universal peak at mto  105 m might have been imprinted on the gcmf at the time of cluster formation or
very shortly afterwards and little affected by the subsequent
destruction of lowermass gcs eg vesperini  zepf 2003
parmentier  gilmore 2007 however given the real successes of an evaporationdominated evolutionary scenario for
the origin of mto  as summarized above and added to below
it would be premature to reject the idea in favor of requiring a
nearformation origin solely on the basis of difficulties with
gc kinematics and in any event formationoriented models must now be reconsidered in light of the nonuniversality
of mto as a function of cluster density
we are not concerned in this paper with velocity anisotropy
in gc systems because we only predict an evaporationevolved dnd log m as a function of cluster density and age
and take the observed distribution of h versus rgc in the milky
way as a given to show consistency with the observed behavior of mto as a function of rgc  most other models fz01
vesperini et al 2003 and references therein predict dynamically evolved gcmfs directly in terms of rgc  and in doing
so are forced also to derive theoretical dependences of cluster
density on rgc  it is only at this stage that gc orbital distributions enter the problem and then only in conjunction with
several other assumptions and simplifications as we discuss
further in 3 below the radially biased gc velocity distributions that appear in such models could well be consequences
of one or more of these other assumptions rather than of the
main hypothesis about evaporationdominated gcmf evolution
2 the galactic gcmf as a function of

cluster density
in this section we define and model the dependence of
the galactic gcmf on cluster density first we describe
the dependence that is expected to arise from evaporationdominated evolution
twobody relaxation in a tidally limited gc leads to a
roughly steady rate of mass loss ev  dmdt  constant
in time thus the total cluster mass decreases approximately linearly as mt  m0  evt this behavior is exact
in some classic models of gc evolution hnon 1961 and
is found to be a good approximation in most other calculations eg lee  ostriker 1987 chernoff  weinberg 1990

shaping the gcmf by evaporation
vesperini  heggie 1997 gnedin lee  ostriker 1999
baumgardt 2001 giersz 2001 baumgardt  makino 2003
trenti heggie  hut 2007 the result comes from a variety
of computational methods semianalytical fokkerplanck
monte carlo and nbody simulation applied to clusters with
different initial conditions densities and concentrations on
different kinds of orbits circular and eccentric with and without external gravitational shocks and with different internal
processes and ingredients with or without stellar mass spectra binaries and central black holes to be sure deviations
from perfect linearity in mt do occur but these are generally
smallespecially away from the endpoints of the evolution
ie for 09  mtm0  01and neglecting them to assume
an approximately constant dmdt is entirely appropriate for
our purposes
when gravitational shocks are subdominant to relaxationdriven evaporation as they generally appear to be for
extant gcs they work to boost the massloss rate ev
slightly without altering the basic linearity of mt eg
vesperini  heggie 1997 gnedin lee  ostriker 1999 see
also figure 1 of fz01 a timedependent mass scale  
evt is then associated naturally with any system of coeval
clusters having a common massloss rate all those with initial
m0   are disrupted by time t and replaced with the remnants of objects that began with m0   as we mentioned
in 1 if the initial gcmf increased towards low masses as a
power law then  is closely related to a peak in the evolved
distribution which eventually decreases towards low m  
as dnd log m  m 1 with   0 fz01
in standard theory eg spitzer 1987 binney  tremaine
1987 section 83 the lifetime of a cluster against evaporation is a multiple of its twobody relaxation time trlx  for
a total mass m of stars within a radius r this scales to first
order ignoring a weak mass dependence in the coulomb logarithm as trlx r  mr3 12  m12  where   mr3  in a
concentrated cluster with an internal density gradient trlx r
of course varies throughout the cluster and the global relaxation timescale is an average of the local values see the
early discussion by king 1958 this can still be written as
trlx  m12  with m the total cluster mass and  an appropriate reference density we then have for the instantaneous
massloss rate ev  dmdt  mtrlx  12  insofar as this
is approximately constant in time a gcmf evolving from an
initial   1 power law at low masses should therefore develop a peak at a mass that depends on cluster density and age
through the parameter   12 t
it remains to identify the best measure of  in this context
a standard choice in the literature and the one that we eventually make to derive our main results in this paper is the
halfmass density h  3m8rh3  however in a steady tidal
field the mean density t inside the tidal radius of a cluster is
constant by definition and thus choosing   t instead is the
simplest way to ensure that ev  12 and ev  constant in
time are mutually consistent in fact king 1966 found from
direct calculations of the escape rate at each radius within his
standard lowered maxwellian models that the coefficient
12
in ev  t is only a weak function of the internal density
structure concentration of the models and thus only a weak
function of time for a cluster evolving quasistatically through
a series of such models
12
the rule ev  t is routinely used to set the gc massloss rates in models for the dynamical evolution of the gcmf

3

although such studies normally express ev immediately in
terms of orbital pericenters r p  most often by assuming t 
r2
p as for gcs in galaxies whose total mass distributions follow a singular isothermal sphere eg vesperini 1997 1998
2000 2001 vesperini et al 2003 baumgardt 1998 fz01
this bypasses any explicit examination of the gcmf as a
function of cluster density which is our main goal in this paper but it is done in part because tidal radii are the most
poorly constrained of all structural parameters for gcs in the
milky way their theoretical definition is imprecise and their
empirical estimation is highly modeldependent and sensitive
to lowsurface brightness data and they are exceedingly difficult if not impossible to measure in distant galaxies we
deal with this here by focusing on the gcmf as a function of
cluster density h inside the less ambiguous empirically better determined and more robust halfmass radius asking how
12
simple models with ev  h fare against the data
12
12
taking ev  h in place of ev  t  which we do to
construct evaporationevolved model gcmfs in 22 is most
appropriate if the ratio t h is the same for all clusters and
constant in time this is the case in hnons 1961 model
of gc evolution and in this limit adopted by fz01 in their
models for the galactic gcmf our analysis is rigorously justified however real clusters are not homologous t h differs among clusters and they do not evolve selfsimilarly h
may vary in time even if t does not the key assumption in
our models is that ev is approximately independent of time
for any gc which is wellfounded in any case by using current h values to estimate ev  we do not suppose that the halfmass densities are also constant but we in effect use a single
number for all gcs to represent a range of t h 12  equivalently we ignore a dependence on cluster concentration in
12
the normalization of ev  h  as we discuss further in 3
it is reasonable to neglect this complication in a first approximation because t h 12 varies much less among galactic
globulars than t and h do separately we demonstrate this
explicitly by repeating our analysis with h replaced by t and
recover essentially the same results for the gcmf
in 3 we also discuss some recent results which indicate
that the timescale for relaxationdriven evaporation depends
on a slightly lessthanlinear power of trlx baumgardt 2001
baumgardt  makino 2003 we point out that this implies
that ev may increase as a modest power of the average surface density of a cluster as well as or in an important special
case instead of the usual volume density however we show
in detail that making the appropriate changes throughout the
rest of the present section to reflect this possibility does not
change any of our conclusions

assumed for all gcs
harris 1996 gives the projected halflight radius rh for
141 of the clusters with a mass estimated in this way and for
these we obtain the threedimensional halfmass radius from
the general rule rh  43rh spitzer 1987 which assumes
no internal mass segregation the remaining five objects have
mass estimates but no size measurements to each of these
clusters we assign an rh equal to the median value for those
of the other 141 gcs having masses within a factor two of the
one with unknown rh  in all cases the halfmass density is

throughout this paper we use xb to denote the median of any quantity x

h  3m8rh3 
the leftmost panel in figure 1 shows immediately that
the cluster mass distribution has a strong dependence on
b increases with h while
halfmass density the median m
the scatter in log mthat is the width of the gcmf
decreases the first of these points is related to the fact that
rh correlates poorly with m eg djorgovski  meylan 1994
mclaughlin 2000 the second point that the dispersion of
dnd log m decreases with increasing h  is behind the finding kavelaars  hanes 1997 gnedin 1997 that the gcmf
is broader at very large galactocentric radii we return to this
in 22
a natural concern when plotting m against h as we have
done here is that any apparent correlation might only be a
trivial reflection of the definition h  mrh3  this may seem
particularly worrisome because as we just mentioned it is
known that size does not correlate especially well with mass
for gcs in the milky way or indeed in other galaxies
however the lack of a tight mrh correlation does not imply
that all gcs have the same rh  even within the unavoidable
measurement errors the rootmeansquare rms scatter of
log rh about its average value is 03 for galactic gcs and
the 68percentile spread in log rh is slightly greater than 05
or more than a factor of 3 in linear terms from the data in
harris 1996 see eg figure 8 of mclaughlin 2000 this
compares to an rms random measurement error from formal
2 fitting uncertainties of log rh   005 or about 10 relative error and an rms systematic measurement error ie
differences in the rh inferred from fitting different structural
models to a single cluster of perhaps log rh   003 see
mclaughlin  van der marel 2005 most of the scatter in
plots of observed halflight radius versus mass is therefore
real and contains physical information the lefthand panel
of figure 1 displays this information in a form that highlights
clear nontrivial overall trends requiring physical explanation

the notation xb represents the median of quantity x
mto is the peak mass of the model gcmfs traced by the solid curves in each panel of figure 2 which

of each cluster through equation 4

itself a strong hint that relaxationdriven cluster disruption
has significantly modified the gcmf at low masses recall that mrh3  constant defines one side of the gc survival triangle when the mh plot is recast as rh versus m
fall  rees 1977 okazaki  tosa 1995 ostriker  gnedin
1997 gnedin  ostriker 1997 it is also further evidence
that the weak correlation of observed rh with m is due to significant and real differences in cluster radii since if rh were
intrinsically the same for all gcs then we would see m  h
instead
the middle panel of figure 1 shows the wellknown result
that the typical gc mass depends weakly if at all on galactocentric radius at least until large rgc  3040 kpc where there
are too few clusters to discern any trend the righthand panel
of the figure shows why this is true even though the gcmf
depends significantly on cluster density although there is a
correlation between halfmass density and galactocentric position the large scatter about it is such that convolving the
observed m versus h with the observed h versus rgc results
in an almost null dependence of m on rgc 
we now divide the gc sample in figure 1 roughly into
thirds in two different ways first on the basis of halfmass
density and second by galactocentric radius these h and
rgc bins are defined in table 1 which also gives a few summary statistics for the globulars in each subsample we count
the clusters in every subsample in about 10 equalwidth bins
of log m to obtain histogram representations of dnd log m
first as a function of h and then as a function of rgc  these
gcmfs are shown by the points in figure 2 with errorbars
indicating standard poisson uncertainties the curves in the
figure trace model gcmfs which we describe in 22 for
the moment it is important to note that the dashed curve is the
same in every panel apart from minor differences in normalization and is proportional to the gcmf for the whole sample
of 146 gcs in the middleleft panel of figure 2 which pertains to clusters distributed tightly around the median h of
the entire gc system the dashed curve is coincident with the
solid curve running through the data
the lefthand panels of figure 2 show directly that the
gcmf is peaked for clusters at any density and that the mass
of the peak increases systematically with h see also the last
column of table 1 but note that the turnover masses there
refer to the model gcmfs that we develop below the statistical significance of this is very high and qualitatively it

is the behavior expected if mto owes its existence to cluster
disruption at a rate that increases with h  as is the case with
relaxationdriven evaporation
the righthand panels of figure 2 confirm once again that
the gcmf peak mass is a very weak function of galactocentric position in fact the observed distributions in the two rgc
bins inside  10 kpc are statistically indistinguishable in their
entirety and the main difference at larger rgc  10 kpc is a
slightly higher proportion of lowmass clusters rather than a
large change in mto  all of this is consistent with the primary dependence of the gcmf being that on h  since figure 1 shows that the gc density distribution is not sensitive to
galactocentric position for rgc  1020 kpc but has a substantial lowdensity tail at larger radii with a broader associated
gcmf as seen in the upperleft panel of figure 2
22 simple models
we now assess more quantitatively whether these results
are consistent with evaporationdominated evolution of the
gcmf from an initial distribution like that observed for
young clusters in the local universe we model the timeevolution of the distribution of m versus h in figure 1 but do
not attempt this for the distribution of h over rgc the details
of which likely depend on a complicated interplay between
the tidal field of the galaxy the present and past orbital parameters of clusters and the structural nonhomology of gcs
to compare our models to the current gcmf as a function of
rgc  we simply calculate them using the observed h of individual clusters in different ranges of galactocentric radius
we assume that the initial gcmf was independent of cluster density and that all globulars surviving to the present day
have been losing mass for the past hubble time at constant
rates we use the current halfmass density of each cluster
12
to estimate ev  h  as we discussed earlier an approximately timeindependent ev is indicated by most calculations
of twobody relaxation in tidally limited gcs we give a more
detailed a posteriori justification in 3 for using h  rather
than other plausible measures of cluster density to estimate
ev 
consider first a group of coeval gcs with an initial mass
function dnd log m0 and a single timeindependent massloss rate ev  the mass of every cluster decreases linearly as
mt  m0  evt and at any later time each has lost the same
amount   m0  mt  evt fz01 show rigorously that in

combining equations 1 and 2 gives the probability density that a single gc with known evaporation rate and age has

here the total mass losses i  evti may differ from cluster to cluster ti being the age of a single gc but both  and

mc are assumed to be constants independent of h in particular9 given each i  the normalizations ai in equation 3 are
defined so that the integral over d log m of each term in the
summation is unity
jordn et al 2007 have introduced a specialization of
equation 3 in which all clusters have the same  they refer
to this as an evolved schechter function and describe its properties in detail including giving a formula for the turnover
mass mto as a function of  and mc  for the case   2 here
we note only that at very young cluster ages or for slow massloss rates such that   mc and only the lowmass powerlaw part of the initial gcmf is significantly eroded any one
evolved schechter function has a peak at mto    1
for   1 as  increases relative to mc  the turnover at
first increases proportionately and the width of the distribution decreases since the highmass end at m  mto is largely
unchanged for large   mc  however the peak is bounded
above by mto  mc and the width approaches a lower limit10
thus the dependence of mto on  is weaker than linear when
mc is finite in the initial gcmf of equation 2 any peak in
the full equation 3 for a system of gcs with individual 
values is an average of n different turnovers and must be calculated numerically
in their modeling of the milky way gc system fz01 ef9 note that m appears to take on different values in the gcmfs of other
c
galaxies varying systematically with the total luminosity lgal jordn et al
2007 the reasons for this are unclear as is the origin of this mass scale in
the first place
10 the increase of m
to and the decrease of the full width of dnd log m
for increasing  eventually saturate when the mass loss per gc is so high
that it affects clusters in the exponential part of the initial schechterfunction

solution to equation 1

shaping the gcmf by evaporation
fectively compute mass functions of the type 3based on
the same initial conditions and dynamical evolutionwith a
distribution of  values determined by the orbital parameters of clusters in an idealized spherical and static logarithmic galaxy potential used both to fix ev in terms of cluster tidal densities and to estimate additional mass loss due
to gravitational shocks jordn et al 2007 fit gcmf data
in the milky way and scores of virgo cluster galaxies with
their version of equation 3 in which all gcs have the same
 they thus estimate the dynamical mass loss from typical clusters in these systems here we construct models for
the milky way gcmf using  values given directly by the
observed halfmass densities of individual gcs
we adopt   2 for the initial lowmass powerlaw index
in equation 2 which carries over into equation 3 for the
evolved dnd log m jordn et al 2007 have fitted the full
galactic gcmf with an evolved schechter function assuming
b for all surviving globulars they
  2 and a single

b  23  105 m  we use this value
find mc  10 m and 
b with the mass loss
of mc in equation 3 and we associate 
from clusters at the median halfmass density of the entire gc
system which is bh  246 m pc3 from the data in figure 1
12
since we are assuming that   evt  h t for coeval gcs
we therefore stipulate
12

  145  104 m h m pc3

for globulars with arbitrary h  assuming a typical gc age of
t  13 gyr this corresponds to a massloss rate of
12
ev  1100 m gyr1 h m pc3

5

in 3 we discuss the cluster lifetimes implied by this value
of ev  we emphasize here that the scaling of ev and 
12
with h follows rather generically from our hypothesis of
evaporationdominated cluster evolution while the numerical
coefficients in equations 4 and 5 are specific to the assumption of   2 for the powerlaw index at low masses in the
initial gcmf
the dashed curve shown in every panel of figure 2 is
the evolved schechter function fitted to the entire gcmf of
the milky way by jordn et al 2007 this has a peak at
mto  16  105 m magnitude mv  74 for a typical v band masstolight ratio of 15 in solar units and gives a very
good description of the observed dnd log m in the middle
density bin 79  h  530 m pc3  and in the two inner radius bins rgc  94 kpc this is expected since the median
halfmass density in each of these cluster subsamples is very
close to the systemwide median bh  246 m pc3 see table 1 even in the outermost rgc bin a kolmogorovsmirnov
ks test only marginally rejects the dashedline model at
the  95 level because this subsample still includes many
gcs at or near the global median bh see figure 1 by contrast the average gcmf is strongly rejected as a model for
the lowest and highestdensity gcs on the lefthand side of
figure 2 the ks probabilities that these data are drawn from
the dashed distribution are  104 in both cases this is also
expected since by construction these bins only contain clusters with densities well away from the median of the full gc
system for which the total mass lost by evaporation should be
b  b
significantly different from the typical 
h 
the solid curves in figure 2 which are different in every panel are the superpositions of many different evolved

7

schechter functions as in equation 3 with distinct  values
given by equation 4 using the observed h of each cluster in
the corresponding subsample these models provide excellent matches to the observed dnd log m in every h and rgc
bin with 2  13 per degree of freedom in all cases this is
the main result of this paper
the last column of table 1 gives the mass mto at which
each of the solid model gcmfs in figure 2 peaks we note
that these turnovers increase roughly as mto  bh0304 for
our specific binnings in h and rgc  somewhat shallower than
12
the h scaling of the cluster massloss rate that defines the
models this is partly because of the averaging over individual turnovers implied by the summation of many evolved
schechter functions in each gc bin and partly becauseas
we discussed just after equation 3the turnover mass of any
one evolved schechter function cannot increase indefinitely in
12
direct proportion to   h  but has a strict upper limit of
mto  mc 
our models are naturally consistent with the fact that the
gcmf is narrower for clusters with higher densities this
is obvious in the lefthand panels of figure 2 in the discussion immediately after equation 3 we described how it
12
follows from the increase of mto with   h for a single evolved schechter function in addition the superposition of many such functions with separate densitydependent
turnovers and widths results in wider gcmfs for cluster subsamples spanning larger ranges of h  this accounts in particular for the breadth of the mass function at rgc  94 kpc the
globulars at these radii have 0034  h  41  103 m pc3 
corresponding to individual evolved schechter functions with
turnovers at 27  103  mto  40  105 m  the composite gcmf in the lowerright panel of figure 2 is therefore
extremely broad and shows a very flat peak such that an overall mto cannot be established precisely from the data alone
this explains the findings of kavelaars  hanes 1997 who
pointed out that the gcmf of the outermost third of the milky
way cluster system has a turnover that is statistically consistent with the fullgalaxy average but a larger dispersion see
also gnedin 1997
finally if the gcmf evolved dynamically from initial conditions similar to those we have adopted then the data and
models in the lefthand panels of figure 2 argue against
the notion that external gravitational shocks rather than internal twobody relaxation were primarily responsible for
shaping the presentday gcmf this is because the massloss rate caused by shocks alone dmdt  sh  mh 
differs significantly from that caused by evaporation alone
12
dmdt  ev  h  the direct dependence of sh on m ensures that shocks become progressively less important compared to evaporation as clusters lose mass at a given h  and
consequently shocks are not likely to have had much effect on
the observed gcmf for m  mto  furthermore the inverse
dependence of sh on h is contrary to the direct dependence
of mto on h shown in figure 2 the different roles played
by shocks and evaporation in shaping the observed gcmf are
discussed more fully by fz01 we note here that gravitational
shocks may have been important in destroying very massive
or very lowdensity clusters early in the history of our galaxy

rule like ev  h  then it should be possible to reproduce
the distribution as a function of any other cluster attribute by
using the observed h of individual gcs in equations 3 and
4 to build model dnd log m for subsamples of the galactic
cluster system defined by that attributeas we did for the rgc
binning of 22 here we explore one example in which differences in the gcmfs of two groups of globulars can be seen
in this way to follow from differences in their h distributions
smith  burkert 2002 have shown that the mass function
of galactic globulars with king 1966 model concentrations
c  099 has a less massive peak than that for c  099 here
c  log rt r0  where rt is the fitted tidal radius and r0 a core
scale they further find that a powerlaw fit to the lowc gcmf just below its peak returns dnd log m  m 05 
shallower than the m 1 expected generically for a massloss
rate that is constant in timebut they confirm that the latter
slope applies for the gcmf at c  099 they discuss various
options to explain these results including a suggestion that if
the mass functions of both low and highconcentration clusters evolved slowly from the same youngclusterlike initial
distribution then the massloss law for lowc gcs may have
differed from that for highc clusters however they give no
physical explanation for such a difference and we can show
now that none is required
the upper panel of figure 3 plots concentration against
halfmass density for the same 146 gcs from figure 1 the
filled circles distinguish 24 clusters with c  099 there
is a correlation of sorts between c and h  which either derives from or causes the betterknown correlation between c
and m eg djorgovski  meylan 1994 mclaughlin 2000
the important point here is that the h distribution is offset to lower values and has a higher dispersion at c  099
following the discussion in 22 we therefore expect the
lowconcentration gcmf to have a smaller mto  a flatter
shape around the peak and a larger full width than the highconcentration gcmf
the lower panel of figure 3 shows the gcmfs for c  099
filled circles and c  099 open circles the curves are
again given by equation 3 with   2 mc  106 m  and individual  calculated from the observed cluster h through
equation 4 these models peak at mto  43  104 m
for the c  099 subsample but at mto  18  105 m for
c  099 entirely as a result of the different h involved
the larger width of dnd log m and its shallower slope at
any m  105 m for the lowconcentration gcs are also
clear in the model curves as well as the data it is further
evident that there are no lowc galactic globulars observed
with m  2  105 m  above the nominal turnover of the full
gcmf as smith  burkert 2002 noted but this is not surprising given that there are so few lowconcentration clusters
in total and they are expected to be dominated by lowmass
objects because of their generally low densities thus the
solid curve in figure 3 predicts perhaps  3 highmass clusters with c  099 where none is found
the apparent variation of the milky way gcmf with internal concentration is therefore consistent with the same
densitybased model for evaporationdominated dynamical
evolution that we compared to dnd log m as a function of
h and rgc in 22 to show this we have made use of the
densities h exactly as observed within the two concentration
bins indicated in figure 3just as we also took h directly
from the data for gcs in different ranges of rgc to construct
models for comparison with the observed dnd log m in the

f ig  3 top concentration parameter as a function of halfmass density
for 146 galactic gcs the line of points at c  25 comes from the practice of
assigning this value to corecollapsed clusters in the harris 1996 catalogue
and its sources bottom gcmf data and models eqs 3 and 4 for 24
clusters with c  099 filled circles and solid curve and 122 clusters with
c  099 open circles and dashed curve

righthand panels of figure 2 of course this is not the same
as explaining the distribution of h versus rgc or c doing so
would certainly be of interest in its own right but it is beyond
the scope of our work here
3 discussion

in this section we first show that the massloss rate in equation 5 above implies cluster lifetimes that compare favorably
with those expected from relaxationdriven evaporation then
12
we discuss why it is reasonable to approximate ev  h in
the first place finally we address the issue of possible conflict in some other models for evaporationdominated gcmf
evolution between the nearconstancy of mto as a function
of rgc and the observed kinematics of gc systems
31 cluster lifetimes
the disruption time of a gc with mass m and a steady
massloss rate ev is just tdis  mev  it is convenient
for purposes of comparison with evaporation times in the
literature to normalize tdis to the relaxation time of a
cluster at its halfmass radius in general this is trh

clusters with realistic stellar mass spectra will have slightly

the numerical value of tdis trh somewhat but does not alter any
scalings
12
we obtained the normalization of ev  h in 22 by
fitting to observed gcmfs constructed by applying a specific masstolight ratio v to every cluster with models assuming a specific form for the initial dnd log m0  thus
bv
the result in equation 6 depends both on the median 
and on the powerlaw index  at low masses in the original

  are tied directly to dynamical determinations 21
to understand the dependence on  in equation 7 recall
first that the coefficients in our expressions for  and ev
as functions of h eqs 4 and 5 followed from choosing   2 for the powerlaw exponent at low masses in the
initial gcmf equation 2 as we mentioned just after
equation 3 the turnover mass of an evolved schechter function with any   1 is mto    1 in the limit of low
12
  h  and mto  mc for very high  in this sense
the strongest observational constraints on the normalizations
of  and ev come from the lowdensity clusters all other
things being equal their gcmf can be reproduced with  6 2
if  and ev are multiplied by   1 at fixed h  therefore
tdis  1ev  1  1 observations of young massive clusters eg zhang  fall 1999 indicate that  is near 2 but if
it were slightly shallower then the cluster lifetimes we infer
from the old gcmf would increase accordingly even a relatively minor change to   15 would double tdis trh from 10
to  20
in the model of hnon 1961 for singlemass clusters
evolving selfsimilarly fixed ratio t h of mean densities inside the tidal and halfmass radii in a steady tidal field t
constant in time a cluster loses 45 of its remaining mass
every halfmass relaxation time the time to complete disruption is therefore tdis trh  10045  22 for nonhomologous
clusters in a steady tidal field tdis trh is a function of central
concentration and can differ from the hnon value by factors
of about two from onedimensional fokkerplanck calculations gnedin  ostriker 1997 find tdis trh  1040 for king
1966 model clusters with c values similar to those found in
real gcs and with gravitational shocks suppressed see their

9

figure 6 thus even though the evaporation time in equation
6 may be slightly shorter than is typically found in theoretical calculations it is certainly within the range of such calculations moreover the assumptions of a steady tidal field and
a single stellar mass in hnon 1961 and gnedin  ostriker
1997 are important part of the difference between the typical lifetimes in these particular theoretical treatments and
our estimate of tdis trh from the gcmf is that the former do
not include gravitational shocks which may have accelerated
somewhat the evolution of real clusters although we stress
again that shocks do not appear in general to have dominated
the evolution of extant galactic gcs and are not expected
to affect the basic timeindependence of the net massloss
rate see vesperini  heggie 1997 gnedin lee  ostriker
1999 fz01 and prieto  gnedin 2006 a spectrum of stellar masses in the clusters may also have contributed to an increase in evaporation rate over the singlemass values eg
johnstone 1993 lee  goodman 1995
estimates of evaporation times from other numerical
methods and for models of multimass clusters can be rather
sensitive to the detailed computational techniques and input
assumptions and approximations and differences at roughly
the factoroftwo level in tdis trh between different analyses
are not uncommon see eg vesperini  heggie 1997
takahashi  portegies zwart 1998 2000 baumgardt
2001 joshi nave  rasio 2001 giersz 2001 and
baumgardt  makino 2003 thus although the lifetimes
in these studies tend to be broadly comparable to those in
hnon 1961 and gnedin  ostriker 1997 noticeably
shorter values do occur in some models in any case we
are encouraged by consistency to within factors of two or
three between estimates of tdis or ev by such vastly different
methodsone purely observational based on the mass
functions of cluster systems the other purely theoretical
based on idealized models for the evolution of individual
clustersparticularly since each method involves several
uncertain inputs and parameters
12

32 approximating ev  h
321 halfmass versus tidal density
the dimensionless disruption time in equation 6 is independent of any cluster property other than the coulomb logarithm because we have used gc halfmass densities to esti12
12
mate tdis  mev  mh  while trh also scales as mh 
however as we mentioned above the fokkerplanck calculations of gnedin  ostriker 1997 in particular show that
tdis trh is actually a function of central concentration c for
king 1966 model clusters in steady tidal fields the constant
12
of proportionality in ev  h should therefore also depend
on c a detail that we have neglected to this point we show
now that this has not biased any of our analysis or affected our
conclusions
the dotted curve in figure 4 illustrates the dependence of
tdis trh on c for singlemass king models as given by equation
30 of gnedin  ostriker 1997 the solid curve is proportional to h t 12  rt3 2rh3 12  which we have calculated
as a function of c for these models and multiplied by a constant to compare directly with tdis trh  evidently there is an
approximate equality tdis trh  215ht 12  which holds to
within  15 over the range of concentrations shown in figure 4 note that all but 6 galactic gcs have 07  c  25
corresponding to central potentials 3  w0  11 thus if the

f ig  4 dependence of tdis trh dotted line from gnedin  ostriker
1997 and h t 12 solid line after scaling by a factor of 215 on central concentration for singlemass kingmodel clusters over the range of c
shown which includes nearly all galactic globulars the approximate proportionality tdis trh  h t 12 holds to within better than 15 thus to this
level of accuracy the evaporation time tdis is roughly the same multiple of
12
mt for clusters with any internal density profile
12

evaporation time is written as tdis  trh h t 12  mt 
then the constant of proportionality in the massloss rate ev 
12
mtdis  t should be nearly independent of c in fact king
1966 originally concluded from quite basic arguments that
the evaporation rate of a cluster with a loweredmaxwellian
12
velocity distribution would take the form ev  t with
only a weak dependence on c an essentially concentration12
independent scaling of ev with t is also found in nbody simulations of tidally limited multimass clusters eg
vesperini  heggie 1997 and so is not an artifact of any assumptions specific to the calculations of either king 1966 or
gnedin  ostriker 1997
this suggests that it might have been more natural to spec12
ify cluster evaporation rates proportional to t rather than
12
h when developing our gcmf models in 2 for any cluster in a steady tidal field with a constant t  such a choice
would also have been automatically consistent with an approximately timeindependent ev and the corresponding linear mt dependence that we have adopted throughout this
paper as we discussed at the beginning of 2 our decision to work with h rather than t was motivated by the
fact that the halfmass density is much better defined in principle and more accurately observed in practice neverthe12
12
less rewriting ev  t as ev  t h 12  h makes
it clear that the validity of our models with a fixed coefficient
12
in ev  h  depends on the extent to which variations in
t h 12 can safely be ignored
figure 4 shows that the full range of possible values for
h t 12 in kingmodel clusters with c  07 is only a factor
of  4 between minimum and maximum therefore using
a single intermediate value of this density ratio to describe
all gcs or a single gc evolving in time through a series of

quasistatic king modelswhich we have effectively done
by using a gcmf fit to normalize  and ev in equations 4
and 5should never be in error by more than a factor of 2 or
so this is a relatively small inaccuracy given that measured
gc densities range over four to five orders of magnitude
12
to confirm more directly that our models with ev  h
are good approximations to gcmf evolution under a mass12
loss law ev  t  we have repeated the analysis of 2 in full
but using the gc tidal densities t derived from the values of
rt listed by harris 1996 in place of h throughout all of our
main results persist
for example the two panels of figure 5 which are analogous to the left and rightmost panels of figure 1 above show
that 1 the gc mass distribution has a clear dependence on
t  with a lower envelope that is well matched by a line of
12
constant evaporation time m  t the dashed line in the
plot and 2 although the scatter in the distribution of t
over galactocentric radius is smaller than the scatter in h versus rgc  it is still significant because the mrgc distribution
can now be viewed as the convolution of the mt distribution with the t rgc distribution the scatter in t versus rgc is
again critical in explaining the weak or null dependence of the
gcmf on galactocentric radius the mrgc distribution is
of course unchanged from that shown in the middle panel of
figure 111
figure 6 shows the milky way gcmf for globulars in three
equally populated bins of tidal density defined as indicated in
the lefthand panels of the plot and in the same three bins of
galactocentric radius that we used in 22 above our models for these distributions are based as before on equation 3
with   2 but now the total mass lost from any gc is estimated from its tidal density rather than its halfmass density
specifically we take
12
  21  105 m t m pc3

the numerical coefficient in equation 8 is such that it gives a
 identical to that in equation 4 for a gc with h t  210
which is the median value of this density ratio for the 146 gcs
in the harris 1996 catalogue
as in figure 2 the dashed curve in every panel of figure
6 is the same representing a fit to the average dnd log m of
the entire galactic gc system thus it is immediately clear
that the peak mass of the gcmf increases significantly and
systematically with increasing t  just as it does with increasing h  meanwhile the solid curves are subsamplespecific
model gcmfs obtained by using the observed tidal density
of each cluster in any t or rgc bin to specify individual  values via equation 8 for each of the evolved schechter functions in the summation of equation 3 as expected there is
no appreciable difference in terms of the fits to any of the observed gcmfs between these models based on evaporation

another potential concern comes from recent arguments
see especially baumgardt 2001 baumgardt  makino 2003

11 as was also the case with our earlier plots involving  in figure 1
h
the scatter and structure in both panels of figure 5 are real since the rms
scatter of log rt about the bestfit lines to either of log m or log rgc is 03035

that the total evaporation time of a tidally limited cluster
is not simply a multiple of an internal twobody relaxation
time trlx  mr3 12  but depends on both trlx and the crossing
x 1x
time tcr  mr3 12 through the combination tdis  trlx

with x  1 the massloss rate ev  mtdis then scales as
12
m 32x r32  which for x 6 1 differs from the rates ev  h
12
and ev  t that we have so far adopted however our
gcmf models are still meaningful because postulating tdis 
x 1x
trlx
tcr implies a dependence of ev on a measure of cluster
12
density that is once again well approximated by h for
galactic gcs before showing this we briefly discuss the
reasons and the evidence for a possible dependence of tdis on
both trlx and tcr 
if stars are assumed to escape a cluster as soon as they
have attained energies above some critical value as a result
of twobody relaxation then tdis  trlx is expected and confirmed by nbody simulations eg baumgardt 2001 however more complicated behavior may arise when escape not
only depends on stars satisfying such an energy criterion but
also requires them to cross a spatial boundary then although the stars are still scattered to near and aboveescape
energies on the timescale trlx  they require some additional
time to actually leave the cluster this escape timescale is
related fundamentally to tcr but also depends on details of
the stellar orbits the external tidal field and the shape of
the zeroenergy surface the longer this extra time the
higher is the probability that further encounters with bound
cluster stars may scatter any potential escapers back down
to subescape energies the net result is a slowdown retardation of the overall evaporation rate chandrasekhar

x 1x
tcr 
tcr trlx 1x for some x  1 then tdis  trlx tcr trlx 1x  trlx
while such a retardation of evaporation can be expected
to occur at some level in all clusters there are physical subtleties in the effect that are probably not captured adequately
x 1x
by a simple reparametrization of lifetimes as tdis  trlx
tcr 
in particular it is unlikely that this expression can hold for
clusters of all masses with a single value of x  1 since
tcr trlx  m 1  very massive clusters have tcr  trlx  and stars
scattered to greater than escape energies by relaxation cross
the tidal boundary effectively instantaneouslyimplying that
the standard tdis  trlx  or x  1 applies in the highmass limit
indeed if this were not the case and a fixed x  1 held for all
m then an unphysical tdis  trlx would obtain at high enough
masses see baumgardt 2001 for further discussion unfortunately very massive is not well quantified in this context
and it is not yet clear if a single value of x is accurate for the
entire gc mass regime so far it has been checked directly
only for initial cluster masses below the current peak of the
gcmf
it is also worth noting that the analysis and simulations
aimed at this problem to date have dealt with clusters on circular or moderately eccentric orbits in galactic potentials that
are static and spherical this means that any tidal perturbations felt by stars within the clusters are relatively weak andor
slow compared to their own orbital periods leading to nearly
adiabatic or at least nonimpulsive responses in more realistic situations the galactic potential would be timedependent
and nonspherical and there might be additional tidal pertur

bations including disk and bulge shocks these perturbations
could in some cases accelerate the escape of weakly bound
stars from the clusters and thus counteract the retardation effect to some degree further study is therefore needed to dex 1x

baumgardt
2001
and
baumgardt  makino 2003 hereafter bm03 have fitted this formula to the lifetimes of a suite of nbody clusters
with initial masses m0  7  104 m and several different
initial concentrations and orbital eccentricities bm03 at
first write tdis in terms of the relaxation and crossing times
of clusters at their halfmass radii so that trlx  mrh3 12 
32
tcr  mrh3 12  and tdis  m x12 rh see their equation
5 however they immediately take a factor of rt rh 32
out from the normalization of this scalingin effect to obtain
32
tdis  m x12 rt with a different constant of proportionality
and then use a simple definition of the tidal radius their
equation 1 rt3  gmr2p 2vc2  which is appropriate for a
circular orbit of radius r p in a logarithmic potential with
circular speed vc  see innanen harris  webbink 1983
to obtain the total lifetime of a cluster as a function of its
initial mass perigalactic distance and vc their equation
7 a single exponent x  075 and a single normalization
in this function then suffice to predict to within 10 the
lifetimes of the simulated clusters regardless of their initial
concentrations by implication if trlx and tcr were fixed at rh
rather than rt  then tdis would have an additional concentration
dependence related to the ratio rt rh 32 very similar to
what we discussed in 321 for the case x  1
we now reexamine the milky way gcmf in terms of
this prescription for retarded evaporation bearing in mind the
caveats mentioned above to avoid any explicit dependences
on concentration we also focus on the tidal radius and write
32
tdis  m x12 rt for general x  1 but we do not substitute a
potential and orbitspecific formula for rt in terms of r p and
galactic properties such as vc  instead to keep the emphasis entirely on cluster densities we rewrite the scaling of the
lifetime in terms of the mean surface density inside the tidal
radius t  mrt2  and the corresponding volume density

clearly the standard ev  t  which we have already discussed is recovered for x  1 while for x  075 we have the
34
equally straightforward ev  t 
bm03 find that even with the retarded evaporation implied
by x  075 the masses of their simulated clusters still decrease approximately linearly with time after stellarevolution
effects which are only important for the first few 108 yr are
separated out see especially their figure 6 equation 12 and
related discussion thus if the gcmf initially rose towards
low masses and has been eroded by slow relaxationdriven
cluster destruction then in this modified description of evaporation we might expect the current mass function to depend
fundamentally on t rather than h or t  but because mt
34
still decreases nearly linearly with t only now with ev  t
for each cluster the shape of the evolved gcmf and its dependence on t should resemble our earlier results for h and

shaping the gcmf by evaporation
t 
we have confirmed this expectation by repeating all of our
34
analyses in 2 again now using ev  t to estimate cluster
massloss rates as before we calculate t from the data in
the harris 1996 catalogue although we caution once more
that the tidal radii and thus the derived t  are more uncertain
than rh and h 
figure 7 which should be compared to figures 1 and 5
above shows that the average galactic gc mass increases
systematically with t  that the lower envelope of the mt
34
distribution is described well by m  t the dashed line in
the lefthand panel of figure 7 which is a locus of constant
34
lifetime against evaporation for ev  t  and that the scatter in the distribution of cluster t versus galactocentric radius righthand panel of the figure is substantial as required
to account for the almost nonexistent correlation between m
and rgc 
the lefthand side of figure 8 shows the mass functions
of globulars in three bins of t  as defined in each panel
the righthand side of the figure shows dnd log m in the
same three intervals of rgc as in figures 2 and 6 above as
in those earlier plots the dashed curve in all panels of figure
8 is a model gcmf with the same parameters in every case
representing the mass function of the entire galactic gc system once again compared to the average mto  the observed
turnover mass is significantly lower for clusters in the lowest
t bin and higher for clusters in the highest t bin while the
width of dnd log m decreases noticeably as t increases
the solid curves in figure 8 are again different in every
panel they are the sums of evaporationevolved schechter
functions as in equation 3 with the usual   2 assumed
but with total mass losses estimated individually for each gc
34
in any t or rgc bin according to   t rather than  
12
12
h or   t  however it turns out not to be necessary
12
to change the normalization of   h in equation 4 to
achieve good fits to the observed gcmf as a function of either
t or rgc  thus in figure 8 we have simply used
  145  104 m t m pc2

x 1x
the fits of these models based on tdis  trlx
tcr with x 
075 are indistinguishable from the fits of our original models based on the standard tdis  trlx  ie x  1 we have confirmed that adopting individual  given by equation 10 also
reproduces the gcmfs of lowand highconcentration gcs
in figure 3 as well as before it was somewhat unexpected
that equation 10 and equation 4 should have the same numerical coefficient but we note that this follows empirically
from the fact that the measured h and t of galactic gcs
are consistent with the simple nearequality h m pc3 
t m pc2 15 in the mean this is illustrated in figure 9
which also shows that there is significant scatter about the relation12 however this scatter does not correlate with cluster mass or galactocentric radius from a pragmatic point of
12
34
view therefore h and t are near enough to interchangeable for our purposes and there is no practical difference be12 although it may be only a coincidence that the constant of proportionality in h  t15 is so near unity the basic scaling itself holds because
combining the observed correlation between cluster mass and central concentration djorgovski  meylan 1994 mclaughlin 2000 with the intrinsic
dependence of rt rh on c in king models leads roughly to rt rh   m 16

tween gcmf models based on one or the other measure of
gc density
one further check on this is to verify that the massloss rate
associated with equation 10 is roughly in keeping with that
implied by the nbody simulations pointing to x  075 in the
first place thus we compare the rate
ev  13 gyr  1100 m gyr1 t m pc2 34 11
to a formula implicit in bm03 starting with their equation 7 for the lifetime tdis as a function of initial cluster
mass and perigalactic distance and circular speed in a logarithmic halo potential using their x  075 and their normalization of 191  106 yr multiplied as in their equation 9
by 1  e to allow for eccentric orbits with apo and perigalactic distances related by e  ra  r p ra  r p  inserting their equation 1 for rt  taking the mean mass of cluster stars to be m  055 m  as they do using   002 as

this is appropriate for clusters that just fill their roche lobes
at perigalacticon which is where t0 is specified the factor
of 07 in the first equality accounts for mass loss due to stellar
evolution in the bm03 simulations which as they discuss
can be treated as having occurred almost immediately and in
full at the beginning of a clusters life
our gcmfbased ev is a factor of  2 faster than the nbody value for clusters on circular orbits with e  0 and in
steady tidal fields in the simulations and our ev is still
within a factor of about three of the nbody rate for clusters on
eccentric orbits with e  05 in bm03 e  0506 is typical
for tracers with an isotropic velocity distribution in a logarithmic potential van den bosch et al 1999 this is very similar
to the comparison of lifetimes in 31 for our original models
12
based on ev  h  moreover our new estimate of ev and
that in bm03 are still subject to their own separate uncertainties and reflect different idealizations and assumptions for
example our rate still depends on the exact powerlaw exponent  at low masses in the initial gcmf as discussed after
equation 7 while the rate from bm03 still neglects gravitational shocks from disk crossings and passages by a discrete galactic bulge and may additionally be biased low for
m0  105 m if x  075 at such masses all of thisnot
to mention again the large uncertainties and possible systematics in the estimates of tidal radii needed to calculate t 
makes the near agreement between equations 11 and 12
more striking than any apparent discrepancy
12
in summary although the relation ev  h  constant
in time is rigorously correct only in rather specific circumstances our gcmf models based on it in 2 are good proxies
in all respects for models based on other plausible characterizations of relaxationdriven cluster mass loss this result will
likely be important for future studies of the mass functions of
extragalactic cluster systems where it may well be necessary

to adopt procedures based on h rather than t or t because
of the difficulty or impossibility of estimating tidal radii
33 mto versus rgc  and velocity anisotropy in gc systems
in this paper we have directly modeled dnd log m as a
function only of gc density and age and used the observed h
or t  or t  of clusters in relatively narrow ranges of galactocentric position to show that such models are consistent with
the current nearconstancy of the gcmf as a function of rgc 
most other models in the literature for evaporationdominated
gcmf evolution in either the milky way or other galaxies
instead predict the distribution explicitly as a function of rgc at
any time they therefore need in effect to derive theoretical
densityposition relations for clusters in galaxies alongside
their main gcmf calculations this usually begins with the
adoption of analytical potentials to describe the parent galaxies of gcs taking these to be spherical and static for a hubble time allows the use of standard tidallimitation formulae
to write gc densities ab initio in terms of the fixed pericenters r p of unique orbits in the adopted potentials cluster
relaxation times and massloss rates ev then follow as functions of r p as well finally specific initial mass space and
velocity or orbital eccentricity distributions are chosen for
entire gc systems so that at all later times it is known what
the dynamically evolved dnd log m is for globulars with any
single r p  how many clusters with a given r p survive and what
the distributions of r p and all dependent cluster properties are
at any instantaneous position rgc 
in this approach if the gcmf began with a powerlaw rise
towards low masses and its current peak is due entirely to cluster disruption then a dependence of mto on r p is expected in
general because the densities of tidally limited gcs decrease
with increasing r p  thus models along these lines that assume the orbit distribution of a gc system to be the same
at all radii in a galaxy ie that the time average of the ratio rgc r p is independent of position have typically had difficulty in accounting for the observed weak or noncorrelation
between mto and present rgc in large galaxies this is partic

15

ularly a problem if it is assumed that the initial gcmf was a
pure power law with the same index at arbitrarily high masses
as low eg baumgardt 1998 vesperini 2001 it is potentially less of a concern if dnd log m started as a schechter
function with an exponential cutoff at masses m  mc  as
we have assumed since then the existence of a strict upper
bound mto  mc 22 means that the dependence of an
evaporationevolved mto on r p and rgc must saturate for small
enough galactocentric radii high enough gc densities even
so the scalefree models of fz01 in which mc  106 m
and all gcs in a milky waylike galaxy potential have the
same timeaveraged rgc r p  still predict a gradient in mto versus rgc that is stronger than observed
fz01 showed that if they left all of their other assumptions
unchanged then a dependence of gcmf peak mass on rgc
could be effectively erased by an appropriately varying radial
velocity anisotropy in the initial gc system thus in their
eddington models the eccentricity of a typical cluster orbit increases with galactocentric distance the time average of
rgc r p increases with radius such that globulars spread over
a larger range of current rgc can have more similar r p and associated mto  however the initial velocityanisotropy gradient
required to fit the milky way gcmf data specifically is only
marginally consistent with the observed kinematics of the gc
system eg dinescu girard  van altena 199913 subsequently vesperini et al 2003 constructed broadly similar
models for the gcmf of the virgo elliptical m87 and concluded that there too a variable radial velocity anisotropy is
required to match the observed mto versus rgc  but the model
anisotropy profile in this case is clearly inconsistent with the
true velocity distribution of the gc system which is observed
to be isotropic out to large rgc romanowsky  kochanek
2001 ct et al 2001
these results certainly suggest that some element is lacking
in rgc oriented gcmf models developed as outlined above
but they do not mean that the fault lies with the main hypothesis that the difference between the mass functions of young
clusters and old gcs is due to the effects of slow relaxationdriven disruption in the latter case any conclusions about
velocity anisotropy depend on the totality of steps taken to
connect the densities and positions of clusters and it is possible that reasonable changes to one or more of these ancillary
assumptions could make the models compatible with the observed kinematics of gcs in both the milky way and m87
without abandoning a basic physical picture of evaporationdominated gcmf evolution that is otherwise quite successful
one issue is that previous models have always specified
evaporation rates a priori as functions of cluster density or orbital pericenter usually normalizing ev so that tdis trh  20
40 as in standard treatments of twobody relaxation however following our discussion in 31 and 32 it would seem
worthwhile to investigate these models with ev increased at
fixed h or r p to allow tdis trh  10 if   2 for the lowmass
powerlaw part of the initial gcmf
fz01 and vesperini et al 2003 both consider velocity distributions parametrized by a galactocentric anisotropy radius
ra  inside of which a cluster system is essentially isotropic
and beyond which it is increasingly dominated by radial or13 the fact that clusters on radial orbits are preferentially disrupted lessens
any inconsistency between the radial anisotropy required in the initial velocity distribution and observational constraints on the present velocity distribution

16

mclaughlin  fall

bits in these terms the difficulty with the published models
is that to reproduce the observed insensitivity of mto to rgc
given standard normalizations of ev  they require values of
ra that are smaller than allowed by observations especially
for m87 increasing ra to more realistic values while keeping the normalization of ev fixed leads to a stronger gradient in mto  the orbits of gcs at small rgc  ra remain
closely isotropic and the typical r p and mto are essentially
unchanged while at large galactocentric distances the cluster orbits are on average less radial than before with larger
r p  lower densities and lower evolved mto for a given rgc 
this effect is illustrated for example in figure 9 of fz01
however it can be compensated at least in part by increasing ev by a common factor for all gcs with the new larger
ra fixed if the initial mass function is assumed to have been
a schechter function rather than a pure power law extending to arbitrarily high masses a faster evaporation rate
will then lead to a roughly proportionate increase in the
evolved gcmf peak mass for gcs with relatively low densities ie those at large rgc and r p  but the increase in mto
will be smaller and eventually even negligible for higherdensity clusters at progressively smaller rgc again because
12
mto grows less than linearly with ev  h when there is
an upper limit mto  mc due to an exponential cutoff in the
initial dnd log m0  thus the qualitative effect of increasing
the normalization of ev in models with radially varying gc
velocity anisotropy is to weaken the amount of radialorbit
bias required to fit an observed mto versus rgc 
another point emphasized by fz01 has to do with the
standard starting assumption that gcs orbit in galaxies that
are perfectly static and spherical in reality galaxies grow
hierarchically in this case even if the values of ev are not
changed much of the burden for the weakening or erasing of
any initial gradients in mto versus rgc may be transferred from
velocity anisotropy to the timedependent evolution of the
galaxies themselves violent relaxation major mergers and
smaller accretion events all work to move clusters between
different parts of galaxies and between different progenitors
scrambling and combining any number of pericenterdensity
mto relations any position dependences in the gc h distribution and in mto itself for the final galaxy are therefore
bound to be weaker more scattered and more difficult to relate accurately to a cluster velocity distribution than in the
case of a monolithic nonevolving potential allowing for
a nonspherical galaxy potential would have qualitatively the
same effect because in this case every cluster explores a range
of pericenters and different maximum tidal fields on each of
its orbits
in this situation it may be important to ask how evaporation rates can still be approximately constant in timeso that
cluster masses still decrease approximately linearly with t as
our models assumeif the tidal field around any given gc
changes significantly over time thus consider first a system of gcs in a single static galaxy potential the massevolution curve for each cluster is approximately a straight
line mt  m0  evt with ev depending on some measure
12
12
34
of internal density which may be h  t  or t  the average massevolution curve for the entire system of clusters
is also approximately linear hmti  hm0 i  hev it if now
a merger or other event rearranges the clusters in the galaxy
then after the event the massloss rates of some clusters will
be higher than before and the rates of other clusters will be
lower than before however if the mean density of the galaxy

as a whole is roughly the same after the event as before then
so too will be the average of the gc densities because of
12
tidal limitation the average hev i  hh i say will differ
even less between the pre and postmerger systems thus although using instantaneous densities to estimate the past ev
of individual clusters may err on the high side for some clusters and on the low side for others these errors will average
away to a small or even zero net bias the approximation
ev  constant in time in our gcmf models will then still be
valid in the mean and the average hmti dependence of sufficiently large numbers of clusters will remain roughly linear
this type of scenario might be expected to pertain at least
to galaxies that evolve on the fundamental plane since this
entails a connection between the total baryonic plus dark
masses and circular speeds of galaxies of the form mgal  vc3
or mgal  vc4  by the virial theorem the average densities
12
0
scale as gal  vc6 m 2  and thus gal  mgal
or gal  mgal 
insofar as hh i  ht i  gal for the gcs the systemwide av12
erage hev i  hh i should therefore not change drastically
even after a major merger between two fundamentalplane
galaxies at most the ratio of final to initial hev i will be
roughly of order the 14 power of the ratio of final to initial mgal  note that this line of reasoning is closely related to
that applied by fz01 to explain the small observed galaxytogalaxy differences in the average turnover masses of entire
gc systems although nonzero differences do exist and can
be accomodated in these sorts of arguments see jordn et al
2006 2007
a full exploration of questions such as these about the wide
range of ingredients in current gcplusgalaxy models will
most likely require large nbody simulations set in a realistic
cold dark matter cosmology until these can be carried out
it is our view that the kinematics of globular cluster systems
cannot be used as decisive side constraints on theories for the
gcmf
4 conclusions

we have shown that the mass function dnd log m of globular clusters in the milky way depends significantly on cluster halfmass density h  with the peak or turnover mass mto
increasing and the width of the distribution decreasing as h
increases this behavior is expected if the gcmf initially
rose towards masses below the present turnover scaleas the
mass functions of young cluster systems like that in the antennae galaxies doand has evolved to its current shape via
the slow depletion of lowmass clusters over gyr timescales
primarily through relaxationdriven evaporation the fact that
mto increases with cluster density favors evaporation over
external gravitational shocks as the primary mechanism of
lowmass cluster disruption since the massloss rates associated with shocks depend inversely on cluster density and
directly on cluster mass our results therefore add to previous arguments supporting an interpretation of the gcmf in
terms of evaporationdominated evolution based on the fact
that dnd log m scales as m 1 with   0 in the lowmass
limit fall  zhang 2001
the observed gcmf as a function of h is fitted well
by simple models in which the initial distribution was
a schechter function dnd log m0  m01 exp m0 mc
with   2 and mc  106 m assumed and in which clusters
have been losing mass for a hubble time at roughly steady
rates that can be estimated from their current halfmass den

12

sities as ev  h  we have shown that although this prescription is approximate it captures the main physical dependence of relaxationdriven evaporation in particular it leads
to model gcmfs that are entirely consistent with those resulting from alternative characterizations of evaporation rates
in terms of cluster tidal densities t or mean surface densities
t 32 the normalization of ev at a given h or t  or t 
required to fit the gcmf implies total cluster lifetimes that
are within range of the lifetimes typically obtained in theoretical studies of twobody relaxation although our values may
be slightly shorter than the theoretical ones if the lowmass
powerlaw part of the initial cluster mass function was as steep
as we have assumed
taking clusters in various bins of central concentration c
and galactocentric radius rgc and using their individual observed densities as direct input to our models yields dynamically evolved gcmfs as functions of c and rgc that agree
well with all data this again indicates that the most fundamental physical dependence in the gcmf is that on cluster density moreover our models for dnd log m versus
rgc obtained in this way are consistent in particular with the
wellknown insensitivity of the gcmf peak mass to galactocentric position this is seen to follow from a significant
variation of mto with h or t  or t due in our analysis
to evaporationdominated cluster disruptioncombined with
substantial scatter in the gc densities at any galactocentric
position
we have not invoked an anisotropic gc velocity distribution to explain the observed weak variation of mto with rgc 
indeed we have made no predictions or assumptions whatsoever about velocity anisotropy we have emphasized that
when velocity anisotropy enters other longterm dynamicalevolution models for the gcmf it is only in conjunction with

17

several additional interrelated assumptions made as part of
larger efforts to derive theoretical densityrgc relations for
gcswhich we have not attempted to do here the apparent need in some current models for a strong bias towards
higheccentricity cluster orbits to explain the nearconstancy
of mto versus rgc might well be avoided by changing one or
more ancillary assumptions in the models without having to
discard the underlying idea that the peak and lowmass shape
of the gcmf are the result of relaxationdriven cluster disruption
it clearly will be of interest to test and refine the main
ideas in this paper through modeling of the gcmfs in other
galaxies for the time being at least doing so will require the estimation of approximate massloss rates using
cluster halfmass densities rather than tidal quantities simply because gc halflight radii can be measured accurately
in many systems beyond the local group whereas tidal
radii are much more modeldependent and difficult to observe chandar fall  mclaughlin 2007 have recently
shown that the peak mass of the gcmf in the sombrero
galaxy m104 increases with h in a way that is reasonably
well described by sums of evolved schechter 1976 functions
as in the models presented in this paper it should be relatively straightforward to pursue similar studies in other nearby
galaxies
