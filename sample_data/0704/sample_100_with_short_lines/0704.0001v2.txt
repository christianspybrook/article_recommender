in addition to the initialstate logarithmi

and iii a 3 a full and

conclusions

the theoreti al study of

ontinuum diphoton produ tion in hadron

ollisions is interesting

and valuable for several reasons there are data from the cdf and d

ollaborations at

fermilab with the promise of larger event samples there are new theoreti al

hallenges
