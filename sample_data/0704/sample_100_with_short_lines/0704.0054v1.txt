the hardylorentz spaces h pq rn 
wael abushammala and alberto torchinsky
abstract
in this paper we consider the hardylorentz spaces h pq rn  with
0  p  1 0  q   we discuss the atomic decomposition of
the elements in these spaces their interpolation properties and the
behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them

the real variable theory of the hardy spaces represents a fruitful setting for
the study of maximal functions and singular integral operators in fact it
is because of the failure of these operators to preserve l1 that the hardy
space h 1 assumes its prominent role in harmonic analysis now for many
of these operators the role of l1 can just as well be played by h 1  or
weak h 1  however although these operators are amenable to h 1  l1 and
h 1  l1 estimates interpolation between h 1 and h 1 has not been
available similar considerations apply to h p and weak h p for 0  p  1
the purpose of this paper is to provide an interpolation result for the
hardylorentz spaces h pq  0  p  1 0  q   including the case of
weak h p as and end point for real interpolation the atomic decomposition
is the key ingredient in dealing with interpolation since in this context neither
truncations are available nor reiteration applies
the paper is organized as follows the lorentz spaces including criteria
that assure membership in lpq  0  p   0  q   are discussed in
section 1 in section 2 we show that distributions in h pq have an atomic
decomposition in terms of h p atoms with coefficients in an appropriate mixed
norm space an interesting application of this decomposition is to h pq lp
estimates for caldernzygmund singular integral operators p  q  
also by manipulating the different levels of the atomic decomposition we
show that for 0  q1  q  q2   h pq is an intermediate space between
h pq1 and h pq2  this result applies to caldernzygmund singular integral
operators including those with variable kernels marcinkiewicz integrals and
other operators

the lorentz spaces

the lorentz space lpq rn   lpq  0  p   0  q   consists of those
measurable functions f with finite quasinorm kf kpq given by

the lorentz quasinorm may also be given in terms of the distribution function mf   x  rn  f x   loosely speaking the inverse of the
nonincreasing rearrangement f  of f  indeed we have

note that in particular lpp  lp  and lp is weak lp 
the following two results are useful in verifying that a function is in lpq 
lemma 11 let 0  p   and 0  q   assume that the nonnegative
sequence k  satisfies 2k k   lq  further suppose that the nonnegative
function  verifies the following property there exists 0    1 such that
given an arbitrary integer k0  we have   k0  k0  where k0 is essentially
bounded and satisfies kk0 k  c 2k0  and

then   lpq  and kkpq  c k2k k klq 
proof it clearly suffices to verify that k2k    2k 1p klq   where 
is an arbitrary positive constant now given k0  let k0 and k0 be as above
and put   c  1 where c is the constant in the above inequalities for this
choice of     2k0   k0  2k0

when 0  q   let 1    2 and rewrite the righthand side above

the reader will have no difficulty in verifying that for lemma 11 to hold
it suffices that x0 satisfies

all k0 

this holds for instance when kx0 krr  c 2k0r pk0  0  r   in fact the
assumptions of lemma 11 correspond to the limiting case of this inequality
as r  
another useful condition is given by our next result the proof is left to
the reader
lemma 12 let 0  p   and let the nonnegative sequence k  be
such that 2k k   lq  0  q   further suppose that the nonnegative
function  satisfies the following property there exists 0    1 such that
given an arbitrary integer k0  we have   k0 k0  where k0 and k0 satisfy

we will also require some basic concepts from the theory of real interpolation let a0  a1  be a compatible couple of quasinormed banach spaces

ie both a0 and a1 are continuously embedded in a larger topological vector

where f  f0  f1  f0  a0 and f1  a1

the hardylorentz spaces h pq

in this paper we adopt the atomic characterization of the hardy spaces h p 
0  p  1 recall that a compactly supported function a with n1p  1
vanishing moments is an h p atom with defining interval i of course i is
a cube in rn  if suppa  i and i1p ax  1 the hardy space

f that can be written as f

p

j p   and the convergence is
in the sense of distributions as well as in h p  furthermore
x
1p
kf kh p  inf
j p

where the infimum is taken over all possible atomic decompositions of f 
this last expression has traditionally been called the atomic h p norm of f

c fefferman rivire and sagher identified the intermediate spaces between the hardy space h p0  0  p0  1 and l  as
h p0  l q  h pq 

1p  1  p0  0  q   

where h pq consists of those distributions f whose radial maximal function
mf x  supt0 f  t x belongs to lpq  here  is a compactly supported smooth function with nonvanishing integral see 10 r fefferman
and soria studied in detail the space h 1  which they called weak h 1  see
11
just as in the case of h p  h pq can be characterized in a number of
different ways including in terms of nontangential maximal functions and
lusin functions in what follows we will calculate the quasinorm of f in h pq
by the means of the expression
 k
2 mmf 2k 1p
 0  p  1 0  q   
lq

where mf is an appropriate maximal function of f 
passing to the atomic decomposition of h pq  the proof is divided in two
parts first we construct an essentially optimal atomic decomposition parilov has obtained independently this result for h 1q when 1  q see 14
also r fefferman and soria gave the atomic decomposition of weak h 1 
see 11 and alvarez the atomic decomposition of weak h p  0  p  1 see

theorem 21 letp
f  h pq  0  p  1 0  q   then f has an atomic
decomposition f  jk jk ajk  where the ajk s are h p atoms with defining
intervals ijk that have bounded overlap uniformly for each k the sequence
 
p p
p qp 1q
jk  satisfies



  and the convergence is in the

p p
p qp 1q
sense of distributions furthermore

 kf kh pq

j jk 

proof the idea of constructing an atomic decomposition using calderns
reproducing formula is well understood so we will only sketch it here for
further details see 5 and 18 let nf x  supf  t y  x  y  t
denote the nontangential maximal function of f with respect to a suitable
smooth function  with nonvanishing integral one considers the open sets
ok  nf  2k  all integers k and builds the atoms with defining interval
associated to the intervals actually cubes of the whitney decomposition
of ok  and hence satisfying all the required properties more precisely one
6

k
constructs a sequence of bounded
p functions fk with norm not exceeding c 2
for each k and such that f  kn fk  0 as n   in the sense of distrip
butions these functions have the further property that fk x  j jk x 
where jk x  c 2k  c is a constant each jk has vanishing moments up
to order n1p  1 and is supported in ijk  roughly one of the whitney
cubes  where the ijk s have bounded overlaps for each k uniformly in k it
only remains now to scale jk 

jk x  jk ajk x 
and balance the contribution of each term to the sum let jk  2k ijk 1p 
then ajk x is essentially an h p atom with defining interval ijk  and one

as an application of this atomic decomposition the reader should have
no difficulty in showing directly the c fefferman rivire sagher characterization of h pq  see 10
another interesting application of this decomposition is to h pq  lp
estimates for caldernzygmund singular integral operators t  p  q  
this approach combines the concept of pquasi local operator of weisz see
17 with the idea of variable dilations of r fefferman and soria see 11
intuitively since hrmanders condition implies that t maps h 1 into l1  say
for t to be defined in h 1s  1  s   some strengthening of this condition
is required this is accomplished by the variable dilations moreover since
we will include p  1 in our discussion as p gets smaller more regularity of
the kernel of t will be required this justifies the following definition
given 0  p  1 let n  n1p  1 and associated to the kernel
kx y of a caldernzygmund singular integral operator t  consider the
modulus of continuity p given by
z
ip
hz
x

p   sup
 kx y 
y  yi  k x yi  dy dx 
i i rn 2i

where 0    1 and the sup is taken over the collection of arbitrary intervals
i of rn centered at yi  here for a multiindex   1      n 
k x yi  


1 
d kx y yy 
i


p  controls the behavior of t on atoms more precisely if a is an h p atom
with defining interval i and 0    1 observe that
z

t ax  kx y 
y  yi  k x yi  ay dy

and consequently

t axp dx  p  
rn 2i

we are now ready to prove the h pq  lp estimate for a caldernzygmund singular integral operator t with kernel kx y
theorem 22 let 0  p  1 and p  q   assume that a caldernzygmund singular integral operator t is of weaktype r r for some 1  r 
 and that the modulus of continuity p of the kernel k satisfies a dini
condition of order qq  p namely

then t maps h pq continuously into lp  and kt f kp  c apq kf kh pq

let f  k j jkp

21 and set f1

 and recall that kk klq  kf kh pq

since kf1 krr  c 2k0rp kf kph p  we have

and since kf kh p  c kf kh pq for all q we have finished

we pass now to the converse of theorem 21 it is apparent that a
condition that relates the coefficients j with the
p corresponding atoms aj
involved in an atomic decomposition of the form j j aj x is relevant here
more precisely if ij denotes the supporting interval of aj  let
ik  j  2k  j ij 1p  2k1  
and for   j  put
kkpq

we then have
theorem
and let f be a distribution given
p 23 let 0  p  1 0  q  
p
by f  j j aj x  where the aj s are h atoms and the convergence is in
the sense of distributions further assume that the family ij  consisting of
the supports of the aj s has bounded overlap at each level ik uniformly in k
and kkpq   then f  h pq  and kf kh pq  c kkpq
proof let mf x  supt0 f  t x denote the radial maximal function
of f with respect to a suitable smooth function  with support contained in
x  1 and nonvanishing integral we will verify that mf satisfies the
conditions of lemma 11 and is thus in lpq 
fix an integer k0 and let
xx
gx 
j aj x 
kk0 jik

since kmgk  kgk it suffices to estimate gx let c be the bounded
overlap constant for the family of the supports of the aj s then for j  ik

next let

since aj has n  n1p  1 vanishing moments it is not hard to see
that if ij is the defining interval of aj and ij is centered at xj  and  
n  n  1n  1p then with c independent of j j x  maj x satisfies
j x  c

the next result is of interest because it applies to arbitrary decompositions in h pq  the proof relies on lemma 12 and is left to the reader
theorem
p 24 let 0  p  1 0  q   and let f be a distribution given
by f  j j aj x  where the aj s are h p atoms and the convergence is

interpolation between hardylorentz spaces

we are now ready to identify the intermediate spaces of a couple of hardylorentz spaces with the same first index p  1
theorem 25 let 0  p  1 given 0  q1  q  q2   define 0    1
by the relation 1q  1  q1  q2  then with equivalent quasinorms
h pq  h pq1  h pq2 q 
proof since the nontangential maximal function nf of a distribution f in
h pq1 is in lpq1  and that of f in h pq2 is in lpq2  we have
kt nf  lpq1  lpq2   c kt f  h pq1  h pq2  
thus
knf kpq  knf klpq1 lpq2 q  c kf kh pq1 h pq2 q 
and h pq1  h pq2 q  h pq 
to show thep
other
p embedding with the notation in the proof of theorem
21 write f  k j jk ajk  and recall that for every integer k the level
1p
k
set ik  j
the sequence jk 
p  jk ipjk   2  contains
pexclusively
p
q
q
let k  jik jk   by construction k k  kf kh pq  now rearrange
k  into l  and for each l  1 let kl p
be suchpthat kl  l  for
l0  1 let kl0  k1      kl0  and put f1l0  kkl
j jk ajk and f2l0 
0
pq1
f  f1l0  then by theorem 22 f1l0  h  f2l0  h pq2  and with the
usual interpretation for q2  
kf1l0 kh pq1  c

l0
x
1

l q1

1q1



kf2l0 kh pq2  c

l q2

so for t  0 and every positive integer l0  we have

h

c

l0
hx

l q1

1q1

t


x

l q2

1q2 i



now by homstedts formula there is a choice of l0 such that the righthand
side above  kt k  lq1  lq2  and consequently
kt f  h pq1  h pq2   c kt k  lq1  lq2  
12

thus
kf kh pq1 h pq2 q  c kk klq1 lq2 q
 c kk klq  c kf kh pq 
and h pq  h pq1  h pq2 q 



the reader will have no difficulty in verifying that theorem 25 gives that
if t is a continuous sublinear map from h 1 into l1  and from h 1 into l1 
then kt f k1q  c kf kh 1q for 1  q   this observation has numerous
applications for instance consider the caldernzygmund singular integral
operators with variable kernel defined by
z
x xy
t f x  pv
f y dy 
x  yn
rn
under appropriate growth and smoothness assumptions on  t maps h 1
continuously into l1  see 6 and h 1 continuously into l1  see 8 thus
if  satisfies the assumptions of both of these results t maps h 1q continuously into l1q for 1  q   a similar result follows by invoking the
characterization of h 1q given by c fefferman rivire and sagher however in this case the h p lp estimate requires additional smoothness of  as
shown for instance in 6 similar considerations apply to the marcinkiewicz
integral see 9 and 7
finally when p  1 our results cover for instance the cz operators
satisfying t  1  0 discussed by alvarez and milman see 3 these operators as well as a more general related class introduced in 15 preserve h p
and h p for nn    p  1 and consequently by theorem 25 they
also preserve h pq for p in that same range and q  p
