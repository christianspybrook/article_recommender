abstract part i describes an intelligent acoustic emission
locator while part ii discusses blind source separation time
delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission
sources
acoustic emission ae analysis is used for characterization
and location of developing defects in materials ae sources
often generate a mixture of various statistically independent
signals a difficult problem of ae analysis is separation and
characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown recently
blind source separation bss by independent component analysis
ica has been used to solve these problems the purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ica to locate
two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources
on an aluminum band specimen the method is promising for
nondestructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic
emission analysis

i ntroduction
a common goal of many nondestructive testing methods is
to detect defects in materials acoustic emission analysis ae
is a passive testing method used to locate and characterize
defects which emit sound10
there are many ways to deduce the location of an ae
source from electrical signals detected by a chain of sensors
the corresponding problems may be classified by the type of
acoustic source mechanism as the location of a continuous
emission source such as that generated by a leak or as the
location of discrete emission such as an ae burst caused by a
growing crack this paper describes a method for processing
continuous ae signals to determine the time delay td
between signals and thus to provide information for location
of ae sources it should be pointed out that application of
ae source characteristics such as count count rate amplitude distribution and conventional time delay measurement
becomes meaningless when dealing with continuous acoustic
sources
the basic information for ae source location consists of
td between stress waves detected at different positions on
a specimen in the case of only one active ae source td of continuous acoustic waves can be estimated using the
crosscorrelation function ccf of sensor signals described
in part i of this article10 7 in the case of two or
manuscript generated january 31 2007

more simultaneously active ae sources this method is not
applicable since analysis of the ccf leads only to the td
of the most powerful ae signal detection of simultaneously
active independent ae source signals therefore requires a more
sophisticated approach
the purpose of our study was to find a suitable method for
processing a mixture of two simultaneously active continuous
ae signals to determine the td and related to this the
coordinates of both ae sources we found that the blind
source separation bss method solves this problem satisfactorily bss is a general signal processing method involving
the recovery of the contributions of different sources from
a finite set of observations recorded by sensors independent
of the propagation medium and without any prior knowledge
of the sources bss has already been successfully applied
in medicine telecommunications image processing etc8
however it is also a promising method for ae analysis of
aircraft structures because ae signals are often hidden in a
mixture of signals from various sources bss could extract
the specific signature of each ae source which can further
be used for location and characterization purposes or to
isolate ae sources from background noise we conducted
experiments with bss on an aluminum beam on which two
continuous ae sources were generated simultaneously by air
flow
m ethods
in this section we explain two different methods for time
delay estimation of ae sources the first method is based on
analysis of the ccf and is convenient for td estimation of
one active continuous ae source as is described in part i10
7 12 the ccf exhibits a peak when the delay parameter
compensates the td between the sensor signals 10 the td
is thus determined by the position of the highest peak of the
ccf the second method is based on bss algorithm and is
convenient for td estimation of two or more simultaneously
active continuous ae sources9 location of two simultaneously active ae sources was performed by an intelligent
locator based on a general regression neural network5 as is
described in part i
multichannel blind source separation has recently received
increased attention due to the importance of its potential

2

applications3 it occurs in many fields of engineering and
applied sciences including processing of signals from antenna
array speech and geophysical data processing noise reduction
biological system analysis etc it consists of recovering signals
emitted by unknown sources and mixed by an unknown
medium material where waves propagate using only several
observations of the mixtures the only assumptions made
are the linearity of the mixing system and the statistical
independence of original signals
bss methods may be classified in several ways one
possible classification that can be made depends on whether
the mixtures are instantaneous or convolutive 4 convolutive mixtures correspond to a mixing system with time
dependent memory they represent a more general case than
instantaneous mixtures and they have in particular acoustic
applications recently the principle of independent component
analysis ica was applied in bss and it was found to
be a simple and powerful tool6 this study deals with the
separation of two convolutively mixed independent continuous
ae signals by ica and the intelligent locator was used to
locate two independent continuous ae sources based on td

the mixing and filtering processes of unknown input signals
sj t may have different mathematical or physical backgrounds depending on specific applications in this paper
we focus mainly on the simplest cases with n signals xi t
linearly mixed in n unknown statistically independent zero
mean source signals sj t the composition is expressed in
matrix notation as x  a  s 8 where  denotes a
convolution x  x1 t     xn tt is the vector of sensor
signals s  s1 t     sn tt is the vector of source signals
and a is an unknown full rank n  n mixing matrix whose
elements are finite inpulse response fir filters we assume
that only vector x is available the goal of ica is to find a
matrix w  by which vector x can be transformed into source
signals u  w  x
matrix w is simply the inverse of a however when noise
corrupts the signals matrix w must be found by an optimal
statistical treatment of the inverse problem the optimal matrix w can be estimated by a feedforward neural network
operating in the frequency domain a learning algorithm with
amaris natural gradient can be written as1   w  x
w   1  w     w     w   1 w 
i    h  w    tanhr   tanhi where  is
the learning rate  is the constant of learning i is the identity
matrix and the tilde   represents a frequency domain
the ica algorithm runs offline and proceeds as follows

e xperiments
we performed experiments with two independent continuous ae sources on an aluminum band of dimensions 4000 
40  5 mm3  reflections at the end of the band were reduced
by wrapping the ends in putty the testing area was on the
longitudinal axis in the middle of the band where 23 holes of
diameter 2 mm and mutual separation 100 mm were prepared
as shown in fig 2

two ae sensors were mounted 100 mm away from the
terminal holes that is 24 m from each other the origin of
the coordinate system was in the middle of the band and the
testing area extended from 11 m to 11 m ae signals
were excited by two independent air jets flowing through
the holes the source position was arbitrarily selected at
100 mm and 800 mm air jets were formed by two nozzles
of diameter 1 mm using pressure 7 bar the experimental setup consisted of the test specimen aluminum band two ae
sensors pinducers two ae sources air jets two amplifiers
a digital oscilloscope ad converter and a computer bss
module locator plotter as shown in fig 3 three experiments
were performed  1 td estimation using a ccf of two ae
signals that were not simultaneously active 2 td estimation
using a ccf of two ae signals which were simultaneously

active and 3 td estimation of ae signals using ica
location of sources based on td by the intelligent locator
was performed in all three cases

in the first experiment only one air jet was activated for
a particular measurement in the second experiment both air
jets were activated sensor signals were linear convolutive
mixtures of two independent continuous ae sources as shown
in fig 4 the autocorrelation r11  r22 and crosscorrelation
functions r12  r21 were calculated from sensor signals only
one td of two signals can be estimated from the highest
peak in both ccf regardless of the number of independent
ae sources on the test specimen as shown in fig 5 this
means that a ccf can not be used for automatic td estimation of multiple ae signals on the test specimen the ccf
exhibits various peaks which belong to various independent
ae sources but it is ussually impossible to relate these peaks
to corresponding coordinates of ae sources

in the third experiment the ica algorithm was used to
solve this problem satisfactorily the ica algorithm results
in demixing fir filters which extract the independent source
signals from sensory signals by inverting the demixing filters
w we obtain mixing filters a in the case of two independent

ae sources and two sensors the components of a are four
fir mixing filters as shown in fig 6 there are two direct
a11  a22 and two cross mixing filters a12  a21  the first index
of the filter represents the number of the sensor while the
second index represents the number of the source the position
of the highest peak of the cross fir filters determines the td between two signals from two sensors if we substract the
coordinate of the highest peak of a direct mixing fir filter
a11 from the coordinate of the highest peak of cross filter a21
we obtain the td of first independent ae source since each
of the highest peaks in the fir filters belongs to different
independent ae signals
r esults
the results of td estimation of two continuous independent
ae sources are shown in fig 7 three experiments were done
in the first experiment the td was estimated by a ccf of two
ae sources which were not active simultaneously as marked
by  locations of these two sources estimated by the
intelligent locator were 181 mm and 784 mm the second
experiment was performed with both ae sources active simultaneously td were also estimated by a ccf the highest peak

position corresponds to the source location marked by  
and was 784 mm the third experiment was performed using
ica for td estimation and location by intelligent locator the
result is marked by  estimated positions of this two sources
were 179 mm and 784 mm respectively if we compare the
coordinates of both independent ae sources estimated by
the first experiment and by the third experiment we find a
good correspondence if we compare estimated ae source
coordinates with actual coordinates which were 100 mm and
800 mm respectively we observe a slight disagreement due to
experimental error experimental error is about 3 regarding
the distance between sensors absolute error in this case is
79 mm and 16 mm respectively the results also depend on
the number and distribution of prototype sources marked by
 which are essential for operation of the intelligent locator
if the number of prototype sources is increased location error
is reduced in our case the prototype sources were distributed
along the beam from 11 m to 11 m separated by 01 m so
that systematic error of the locator was set to several procents

and

c onclusion

ccf is applicable to td estimation only in the case of one
active ae source the goal of our research is to develop a new
method to estimate td between ae signals in the case of multiple simultaneously active continuous ae sources we have
shown that for this purpose ica is an applicable option ica
finds a linear coordinate system the unmixing filters such that
the resulting signals are statistically independent this is an
advantage of ica over ccf it represents a new approach to
processing of ae data and further expands the applicability of
ae analysis in the field of nondestructive testing in machines
or in an industrial environment multiple sources are usually
active simultaneously often representing environmental disturbances the corresponding complex signals are not directly
applicable to characterization of particular sources however
separation of contributions by ica analysis in fact represents a
kind of filtering increasing the applicability of filtered signals
to characterization of sources in complex environments future
research will be focused on location of multiple ae sources
on twodimensional and threedimensional specimens
