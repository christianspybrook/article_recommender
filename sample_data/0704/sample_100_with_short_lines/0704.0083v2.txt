the path integral over euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the
universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology this ensemble
corresponds to a uniform weight one distribution in phase space of true physical variables but
in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddlepoints of the
lorentzian path integral they are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons
limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant inflationary cosmologies generated by these
instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose lowenergy scale can be attained
within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions thus together with the bounded
range of the early cosmological constant this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of
constraining the landscape of string vacua and simultaneously a possible solution to the dark energy
problem in the form of the quasiequilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the universe

euclidean quantum gravity eqg is a lame duck in
modern particle physics and cosmology after its summit in early and late eighties in the form of the cosmological wavefunction proposals 1 2 and baby universes
boom 3 the interest in this theory gradually declined
especially in cosmological context where the problem of
quantum initial conditions was superseded by the concept of stochastic inflation 4 eqg could not stand the
burden of indefiniteness of the euclidean gravitational
action 5 and the cosmology debate of the tunneling vs
noboundary proposals 6
thus a recently suggested eqg density matrix of the
universe 7 is hardly believed to be a viable candidate
for the initial state of the universe even though it avoids
the infrared catastrophe of small cosmological constant
 generates an ensemble of universes in the limited
range of  and suggests a strong selection mechanism
for the landscape of string vacua 7 8 here we want to
justify this result by deriving it from first principles of
lorentzian quantum gravity applied to a microcanonical
ensemble of closed cosmological models
thermal properties in quantum cosmology 9 are incorporated by a mixed physical state which is dynamically more preferable than a pure state of the hartlehawking type this follows from the path integral for
the eqg statistical sum 7 8 it can be cast into the
form of the integral over a minisuperspace of the lapse

and the density matrix 5 can be regarded as an operator

this notation should not be understood literally because
this multiple deltafunction is not well defined for the
operators  do not commute and form a quasialgebra
with nonvanishing structure functions moreover exact operator realization  is not known except the
first two orders of a semiclassical expansion 12 fortunately we do not need a precise form of these constraints because we will proceed with their pathintegral
solutions well adjusted to the semiclassical perturbation
theory this strategy does not extend beyond typical
fieldtheoretic considerations when the path integral is
regarded more fundamental than the schrodinger equation marred with the problems of divergent equaltime
commutators operator ordering etc
the very essence of our proposal is the interpretation
of 5 and 8 as the density matrix of a microcanonical
ensemble in spatially closed quantum cosmology a simplest analogy is the density matrix of an unconstrained
system having a conserved hamiltonian  in the microcanonical state with a fixed energy e     e
major distinction of 8 from this case is that spatially
closed cosmology does not have freely specifiable constants of motion like the energy or other global charges
rather it has as constants of motion the hamiltonian and
momentum constraints h  all having a particular value
 zero therefore the expression 8 can be considered
as a most general and natural candidate for the quantum
state of the closed universe below we confirm this fact

by showing that in the physical sector the corresponding statistical sum is just a uniformly distributed with
a unit weight integral over entire phase space of true
physical degrees of freedom thus this is a sum over
everything however in terms of the observable quantities like spacetime geometry this distribution turns out
to be nontrivially peaked around a particular set of universes semiclassically this distribution is given by the
eqg density matrix and the saddlepoint instantons of
the above type 7
from the normalization of the density matrix in the
physical hilbert space the statistical sum follows as the
path integral

includes the deltafunction of unitary gauge conditions

the path integral 10 is gaugeindependent onshell

therefore from eqs910 with phys  0 the statistical sum of our microcanonical ensemble equals

this ultimate equipartition not modulated by any nontrivial density of states is a result of general covariance
and closed nature of the universe lacking any freely specifiable constants of motion the volume integral of entire

not known is very nontrivial however below we show
that semiclassically it is determined by eqg methods

range of the cosmological constant

the euclidean case we decompose  q n  into a minisuperspace  al t nl t  and the matter l x variables the subscript l indicating their lorentzian nature with a relevant decomposition of the measure

where l  al  nl  is a lorentzian effective action the
stationary point of 13 is a solution of the effective equation l nl t  0 in the gauge nl  1 it reads as
a lorentzian version of the euclidean equation 4 and
the bootstrap equation for the radiation constant
r c with
the wick rotated   it a   al t   i dtal t
however with these identifications c turns out to be
purely imaginary
r in view of the complex nature of the
free energy f i dtal  therefore no periodic solutions exist in spacetime with a real lorentzian metric
on the contrary such solutions exist in the euclidean
spacetime alternatively the latter can be obtained with
the time variable unchanged t    al t  a  but
with the wick rotated lapse function

in the gauge n  1 nl  i these solutions exactly
coincide with the instantons of 7 the corresponding
saddle points of 13 can be attained by deforming the
integration contour 6 of nl into the complex plane to
pass through the point nl  i and relabeling the real
lorentzian t with the euclidean   in terms of the euclidean n   a  and x the integrals 13 and 14

however the integration contour for the euclidean n  
runs from i to i through the saddle point n  1
this is the source of the conformal rotation in euclidean
quantum gravity which is called to resolve the problem of
unboundedness of the gravitational action and effectively

renders the instantons a thermal nature even though
they originate from the microcanonical ensemble this
mechanism implements the justification of eqg from
canonical quantization of gravity 14 see also 15 in
black hole context
to show this we calculate 1 in the oneloop approximation with the measure inherited from the canonical

in view of periodic boundary conditions for both operators their determinants cancel each other their zero
modes to be eliminated because they correspond to the
conformal killing symmetry of frw instantons 13
therefore the contribution of the conformal mode reduces to the selection of instantons with a fixed time period effectively endowing them with a thermal nature
as suggested in 7 8 16 these instantons serve as
initial conditions for inflationary universes which evolve
according to the lorentzian version of eq4 and at late
stages have two branches of a cosmological acceleration

by the new quantum gravity scale suggested in 8  the
upper bound of the instanton range max  3m2p b
to match the model with inflation and the dark energy
phenomenon one needs b of the order of the inflation
scale in the very early universe and b  10120 now so
that this parameter should effectively be a growing function of time
this picture seems to fit into string theory at its lowenergy fieldtheoretic level then with a bounded range
of  it might constrain the landscape of string vacua
7 8 moreover string theory has a qualitative mechanism to promote the constant b to the level of a moduli variable indefinitely growing with the evolving size

the decreasing r as n  mp  r23  thus the effect
of indefinitely growing b is possible for both scenarios
with expanding or contracting extra dimensions in the
first case this is the growing tower of superhorizon
p kk
modes which make the horizon scale h  mp 2b 
mp mp r13 indefinitely decreasing with r   in
the second case this is the tower of superhorizon winding
modes which make this acceleration scale decrease with
the decreasing r as h  mp rmp  13  this effect
is flexible enough to accommodate the present day acceleration scale h0  1060 mp though by the price of
finetuning an enormous coefficient of expansion or contraction of r this gives a new dark energy mechanism
driven by the conformal anomaly and transcending the
inflationary and matterdomination stages starting with
the state of the microcanonical distribution
to summarize within a minimum set of assumptions
the equipartition in the physical phase space 11
we seem to have the mechanism of constraining the
landscape of string vacua and get the full evolution of
the universe as a quasiequilibrium decay of its initial
microcanonical state thus contrary to anticipations
of sidney coleman there is nothing rather than
something 3 one can say that something rather
than nothing comes from everything
