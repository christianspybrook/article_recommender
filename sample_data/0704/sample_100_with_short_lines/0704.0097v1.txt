introduction

a mathematically rigorous approach to quantum field theory based on operator algebras is called an algebraic quantum field theory it has a long
history since pioneering works of araki haag kastker see 22 for a general treatment of algebraic quantum field theory this theory works on
minkowski spaces on any spacetime dimension and there have been some
recent results on curved spacetimes or even noncommutative spacetimes in
the case of 1  1dimensional minkowski space with higher spacetime symmetry conformal symmetry we have conformal field theory and there we have
seen many new developments in the recent years so we survey such results
here our emphasis is on representation theoretic aspects of the theory and
we make various comparison with another mathematically rigorous and more
recent approach to conformal field theory that is theory of vertex operator
algebras

roughly speaking a mathematical study of quantum field theory is a
study of wightman fields which are certain type of operatorvalued distributions on a spacetime with covariance with respect to a given spacetime
symmetry group we have mathematically rigorous axioms for such wightman fields but they involve distributions and unbounded operators so these
cause various kinds of technical difficulty in contrast in the algebraic quantum field theory our fundamental object is a net of von neumann algebras
of bounded linear operators on a hilbert space see 46 for general theory of von neumann algebras technical problems on definition domains of
unbounded operators do not arise in this approach
a basic idea is as follows suppose we have a wightman field  on a
spacetime fix a bounded region o in the space time and consider a test
function  with support contained in o then the pairing h i produces
an unbounded operator we have many  and  for a fixed o and obtain
many unbounded operators from such pairing then we consider a von neumann algebra of bounded linear operators on this hilbert space generated
by these unbounded operators for example if we have a selfadjoint unbounded operators we consider its spectral projections which are obviously
all bounded in this way we deal with only bounded operators this is regarded as a von neumann algebra generated by observables in the spacetime
region o a von neumann algebra is an algebra of bounded linear operators
which is closed under the adjoint operation and the strong operator topology in this way we have a family ao of von neumann algebras on the
same hilbert space parameterized by spacetime regions since the spacetime
regions make a net with respect to the inclusion order we call such a family a
net of von neumann algebras now we forget wightman fields and consider
only a net of von neumann algebras we have some expected properties for
such nets of von neumann algebras from a physical consideration and now
we use these properties as axioms so our mathematical object is a net of
von neumann algebras subject to certain set of axioms our mathematical
aim is to study such nets of von neumann algebras

conformal quantum field theory

we first explain formulation of full conformal quantum field theory on the
1  1dimensional minkowski space in algebraic quantum field theory as a
spacetime region o above it is enough to consider only open rectangles o
2

with edges parallel to t  x in 1  1dim minkowski space in this way
we get a family ao of operator algebras parameterized by spacetime
regions o rectangles in order to realize conformal symmetry we have to
make a partial compactification of the 1  1dimensional minkowski space if
two rectangles are spacelike separated then we have no interactions between
them even at the speed of light so our axiom requires that the corresponding
two von neumann algebras commute with each other this is the locality
axiom since this is not our main object in this paper we omit details of the
other axioms see 29 for full details
next we briefly explain that boundary conformal field theory can be handled within the same framework now we consider the halfspace x t 
x  0 in the 1  1dimensional minkowski space and only rectangles o contained in this halfspace in this way we have a similar net of von neumann
algebras ao parameterized with rectangles in the halfspace see 38
for full details of the axioms
if we have a net of von neumann algebras over the 1  1dimensional
minkowski space we can restrict the net of von neumann algebras to two
chiral conformal field theories on the light cones x  t in this way we
have two nets of von neumann algebras on the compactified s 1 as description
of two chiral conformal field theories since this net is our main mathematical
object in this article we give a full set of axioms see 29 for details of this
restriction procedure
now our spacetime is s 1 and a spacetime region is an interval i
which means a nonempty nondense open connected subset of s 1  we have
a family ai of von neumann algebras on a fixed hilbert space h these
von neumann algebras are simple and such von neumann algebras are called
factors so the family ai satisfying the axioms below is called a net of
factors or an irreducible local conformal net of factors strictly speaking
actually the set of intervals on s 1 is not directed with respect to inclusions
so the terminology net is not mathematically appropriate but is widely used
1 isotony for intervals i1  i2  we have ai1   ai2 
2 locality for intervals i1  i2 with i1 i2   we have ai1  ai2   0
3 mbius covariance there exists a strongly continuous unitary representation u of p sl2 r on h satisfying ugaiug  agi for
any g  p sl2 r and any interval i
3

4 positivity of energy the generator of the oneparameter rotation subgroup of u called the conformal hamiltonian is positive
5 existence of the vacuum there exists a unit uinvariant vector
 in
w
h called the vacuum vector and the von neumann algebra is 1 ai
generated by all ais is bh
6 conformal covariance there exists a projective unitary representation
u of diffs 1  on h extending the unitary representation of p sl2 r
such that for all intervals i we have
ugaiug  agi g  diffs 1 
ugaug  a a  ai g  diffi  
where diffs 1  is the group of orientationpreserving diffeomorphisms
of s 1 and diffi   is the group of diffeomorphisms g of s 1 with gt  t
for all t  i
the isotony axiom is natural because we have more test functions or more
observables for a larger interval the locality axiom takes this simple form on
s 1  the choice of the spacetime symmetry is not unique and we can use the
poincar symmetry on the minkowski space or the mbius covariance on s 1 
for example but in the conformal field theory we use conformal symmetry
which means diffeomorphism covariance as above this set of axioms imply
various nice conditions such as the reehschlieder property the bisognanowichmann property and the haag duality see 28 and references there for
details
in the usual situation all the von neumann algebras ai are isomorphic
to the socalled arakiwoods type iii1 factor for all nets a and all intervals
i so each von neumann algebra does not contain any information about
the conformal field theory but it is the relative position of the von neumann
algebras in the family that encodes the physical information of the theory
it is similar to subfactor theory of jones where we study a relative position
of one factor in another
at the end of this section we compare our formulation of conformal
quantum field theory with another mathematically rigorous approach theory of vertex operator algebras a vertex operator algebra is an algebraic
axiomatization of wightman fields on s 1  called vertex operators if we
have an operator valued distribution on s 1  its fourier expansion should give
4

countably many possibly unbounded operators as the fourier coefficients
under the socalled statefield correspondence any vector in the space of
states should give an operatorvalued distribution a quantum field and
its fourier expansion gives countably many operators in this way one vector
should give countably many operators on the space of these vectors in other
words for two vectors v w we have countably many binary operations vn w
n  z the action of the nth operator given by v on w an axiomatization
of this idea gives a notion of vertex operator algebra see 16 for a precise
definition there is a slightly weaker notion of a vertex algebra see 27
for its precise definition and related results in theory of vertex operator
algebra one considers a vector space of states without an inner product and
even when we have a positive definite inner product one considers this vector space without completion here in comparison to nets of factors we are
interested in the case where we have positive definite inner products on the
spaces of states we say that such a vertex operator algebra is unitary
both of one unitary vertex operator algebra and one net of factors
should describe one chiral conformal field theory so unitary vertex operator
algebras and nets of factors should be in a bijective correspondence at least
under some nice additional conditions but no general theorems have been
known for such a correspondence though there is a recent progress due to s
carpi and m weiner however if we have one construction or an idea on one
side we can often translate it to the other side though it can be highly nontrivial from a technical viewpoint fundamental sources of constructions for
vertex operator algebras are affine kacmoody algebras and integral lattices
the corresponding constructions for nets of factors have been done by a
wassermann 47 and his students and dongxu 12 respectively after the
initial construction of buchholzmacktodorov 5 if we have examples with
some nice properties we canoften construct new examples from them and
as such methods of constructions of vertex operator algebras we have simple
current extensions the coset construction and the orbifold construction the
simple current extensions for nets of factors are simply crossed products by
dhrautomorphisms and easy to realize see the next section for a notion
of dhrendomorphisms the coset and orbifold constructions for nets of
factors have been studied in detail by f xu 50 51 52
for nets of factors we have introduced a new construction of examples
in 28 based on longos notion of qsystems 36 further examples have
been constructed by xu 55 with this method this can be translated to the
setting of vertex operator algebras as we will see in this article later

representation theory

an important tool to study nets of factors is a representation theory for a
net of factors ai all the algebras ai act on the initial hilbert space
h from the beginning but we also consider their representations on another
hilbert space that is a family i  of representations i  ai  bk
where k is another hilbert space common for all i for i1  i2  we must
have that the restriction of i2 on ai1 is equal to i1  the representation on
the initial hilbert space is called the vacuum representation and plays a role of
a trivial representation we also have to take care of the spacetime symmetry
group when we consider a representation but this part is often automatic
see 20 so we now ignore it for simplicity see 20 for a more detailed
treatment note that a representation of a net of factors is a counterpart of
a module over a vertex operator algebra
notions of irreducibility and a direct sum for such representations are
easy to formulate nontrivial notions are dimensions and tensor products
each representation i  is in a bijective correspondence to a certain endomorphism  of an infinite dimensional operator algebra called a doplicherhaagroberts dhr endomorphism 13 15 and we can restrict  to a single
factor ai for an arbitrarily but fixed interval i then ai  ai is
a subfactor and we have its jones index 26 see 14 41 43 for general
theory of subfactors the square root of this jones index plays the role of
the dimension of the representation 35 in algebraic quantum field theory
such a dimension was called a statistical dimension and it is analogous to
a quantum dimension in the theory of quantum groups it is a positive real
numbers in the interval 1  we can also compose endomorphisms and
this composition gives the correct notion of tensor products we then get a
braided tensor category as in 15
in representation theory of a vertex operator algebra and also a quantum
group it sometimes happens that we have only finitely many irreducible representations such finiteness is often called rationality possibly with some
extra assumptions on some finite dimensionality this also plays an important role in theory of quantum invariants in low dimensional topology in 32
we have introduced an operator algebraic condition for such rationality for
nets of factors as follows and we called it complete rationality we split the
circle into four intervals i1  i2  i3  i4 in this order say counterclockwise then
complete rationality is given by the finiteness of the jones index for a subfactor ai1   ai3   ai2   ai4  where  means the commutant together
6

with the split
split property is known to hold if the vacuum
p property the
n
character
n0 dim hn q  is convergent
l for q  1 by 9 so it usually
holds and is easy to verify here h  
n0 hn is the eigenspace decomposition of the original hilbert space for the positive generator of the rotation
group so this convergence property can be verified simply by looking at
the hilbert space not the von neumann algebras in the original definition
of complete rationality in 32 we required another condition called strong
additivity but it was proved to be redundant by longoxu 39 we have
proved in 32 that this complete rationality implies that we have a modular
tensor category as a representation category of ai a modular tensor
category produces a 3dimensional topological quantum field theory see 45
for general theory of topological quantum field theory the sunk net of
wassermann has been shown to be completely rational by 49
we now introduce an important notion of induction for an inclusion
of nets of factors ai  bi we have an induction procedure analogous
to the group representation so from a representation of the smaller net a
we would like to construct a representation of the larger net b but what
we actually obtain is not a genuine representation of the larger net b in
general and is something weaker called solitonic this induction procedure
is called the induction and depends a choice of braiding so we write 
and   this was first defined in longorehren 37 and studied in detail
in xu 48 then bckenhauerevans 1 made a further study and 2 3
unified this study with ocneanus graphical method 42 the intersection
of the irreducible endomorphisms appearing in the images of  induction
and  induction gives the true representation category of bi if a is
completely rational by 2 32
this induction opens an important and new connection with theory
of modular invariants a modular tensor category produces a unitary representation  of sl2 z through its braiding as in 44 and its dimension
is the number of irreducible objects so a completely rational net of factors produces such a unitary representation note that our representation
of sl2 z comes from the braiding structure not from the action of this
a  b
group on the characters through change of variables  7
 though in
c  d
all the nice known examples these two representations coincide see 30
for a discussion on this matter

7

it has been proved in 2 that the matrix z  defined by
z  dim hom   
is in the commutant of the representation  using ocneanus graphical calculus 42 such a matrix z is called a modular invariant and we have only
finitely many such z for a given  for any completely rational net ai
any extension bi  ai produces such z matrices z are certainly
much easier to classify than extensions and this is a source of classification
theory in the next section

classification theory

for a net of factors we can naturally define a central charge and it is wellknown to take discrete values 1  6mm  1 m  3 4 5     below 1 and
all values in 1  by 17 18 we have the virasoro net virc i for each
such c and it is the operator algebraic counterpart of the virasoro vertex
operator algebra with the same c any net of factors ai with central
charge c is an extension of the virasoro net with the same central charge and
it is automatically completely rational if c  1 as shown in 28 so we can
apply the above theory and we get the following complete classification list
for the case c  1 as in 28
1 the virasoro nets virc i with c  1
2 the simple current extensions of the virasoro nets with index 2
3 four exceptionals at c  2122 2526 144145 154155
the unitary representations of sl2 z for the virasoro nets are the wellknown ones and all the modular invariants for these have been classified by
6 our result shows that each of the socalled type i modular invariants in
the classification list of 6 corresponds to a net of factors uniquely they
are labeled with pairs of ad2n e68 dynkin diagrams with coxeter numbers
differing by 1 three in 3 of the above list have been identified with coset
models but the remaining one does not seem to be related to any other
known constructions this is constructed with extension by qsystem
xu 55 recently applied this construction to many other coset models and
8

obtained infinitely many new examples based on 54 called mirror extensions classification for the case c  1 has been also done under some extra
assumption 7 53
this classification theorem also implies a classification of certain types of
vertex operator algebras as follows
let v be a rational vertex operator algebra and wi be its irreducible
modules we would like to classify all vertex operator
algebras arising from
l
putting a vertex operator algebra structure on i ni wi and using the same
virasoro element as v  where ni is multiplicity and w0  v  n0  1 from
a viewpoint of tensor category this classification problem of extensions of
a vertex operator algebras is the same as the classification problem of
extensions of a completely rational net of factors as shown in 24
so the above classification theorem of local conformal nets implies a classification theorem of extensions of the virasoro vertex operator algebras with
c  1 as above and we obtain the same classification list that is besides
the virasoro vertex operator algebras themselves we have their simple current extensions and four exceptionals at c  2122 2526 144145 154155
with the usual notation of lc h for a module with central charge c and
conformal weight h of the virasoro vertex operator algebras with c  1 the
four exceptionals are listed as follows
1 l2122 0  l2122 8 it has 15 irreducible representations and has
two coset realizations from su92  e8 2 and e8 3  e8 2 e8 1 
2 l2526 0  l2526 10 it has 18 irreducible representations and
has a coset realization from su211  so51  su21 
3 l144145 0  l144145 24  l144145 78  l144145 189 it
has 28 irreducible representations and no coset realization has been
known
4 l154155 0  l154155 26  l154155 84  l154155 203 it
has 30 irreducible representations and has a coset realization from
su229  g2 1  su21 
note that it is not obvious that the representation category of the virasoro
net virc and the representation category of the virasoro vertex operator
algebra lc 0 are isomorphic but as long as the two are braided tensor
category and have the same s and t matrices the arguments in 28 work
so we obtain the above classification result for vertex operator algebras
9

using the above results and more techniques we can also completely
classify full conformal field theories within the framework algebraic quantum
field theory for the case c  1 full conformal field theories are given as
certain nets of factors on 1  1dimensional minkowski space under natural symmetry and maximality conditions those with c  1 are completely
labeled with the pairs of ade dynkin diagrams with the difference of
their coxeter numbers equal to 1 as shown in 29 we now naturally have
d2n1  e7 as labels unlike in the chiral case the main difficulty in this
work lies in proving uniqueness of the structure for each modular invariant
in the cappelliitzyksonzuber list 6 this is done through 2cohomology
vanishing for certain tensor categories in the spirit of 25
furthermore using the above results and more techniques we can also
completely classify boundary conformal field theories for the case c  1
boundary conformal field theories are given as certain nets of factors on a 1
1dimensional minkowski halfspace under a natural maximality condition
these with c  1 are now completely labeled with the pairs of ade dynkin
diagrams with distinguished vertices having the difference of their coxeter
numbers equal to 1 as shown in 33 based on a general theory in 38 the
chiral fields in a boundary conformal field theory should produce a net
of factors on the boundary which is compactified to s 1  as in the operator
algebraic approach then a general boundary conformal field theory restricts
to this boundary to produce a nonlocal extension of this chiral conformal
field theory on the boundary

moonshine conjecture

the moonshine conjecture formulated by conwaynorton 8 is about mysterious relations between finite simple groups and modular functions since
an observation due to mckay
today the classification of all finite simple groups is complete and the
classification list contains 26 sporadic groups in addition to several infinite
series the largest group among the 26 sporadic groups is called the monster
group and its order is about 8  1053
one the one hand the nontrivial irreducible representation of the monster having the smallest dimension is 196883 dimensional on the other
hand the following function called jfunction has been classically studied

10

in algebra
j   q 1  744  196884q 
21493760q 2  864299970q 3    
for
 q  exp2i

 im  0 we have modular invariance property j  
a  b
a b
j
for
 sl2 z and this is the only function up to
c d
c  d
the constant term satisfying this property and starting with q 1 
mckay noticed 196884  196883  1 and similar simple relations for
other coefficients of the jfunction and dimensions of irreducible representations of the monster group turned out to be true then conwaynorton
8 formulated the moonshine conjecture roughly as follows which has been
now proved by borcherds 4 in 1992
1 l
we have a natural infinite dimensional graded vector space v 

n0 vn with some algebraic structure having a monster action preserving the grading and each vn is finite dimensional
p
n1
2 for any element g in the monster the power series 
n0 tr gvn q
is a special function called a hauptmodul for some discrete subgroup
of sl2 r when g is the identity element the series is the jfunction
minus constant term 744
for the part 1 of this conjecture frenkellepowskymeurman 16 gave
a precise definition of some algebraic structure as a vertex operator algebra
and constructed a particular example v  which is now called the moonshine
vertex operator algebras and denoted by v  
the construction roughly goes as follows in dimension 24 we have an
exceptional lattice  called the leech lattice then there is a general construction of a vertex operator algebra from a certain lattice and the one for
the leech lattice gives something very close to our final object v   then we
take a fixed point algebra under a natural action of z2z arising from the
lattice symmetry and then make a simple current extension of order 2 the
resulting vertex operator algebra is the moonshine vertex operator algebra
v   the final step is called a twisted orbifold construction the series
p

 n1
is indeed the jfunction minus constant term 744
n0 dim vn q
miyamoto 40 has a new realization of v  as an extension of a tensor
power of the virasoro vertex operator algebra with c  12 l12 048
11

based on dongmasonzhu 11 this kind of extension of a virasoro tensor
power is called a framed vertex operator algebra as in 10
we have given an operator algebraic counterpart of such a construction
in 31
we realize a leech lattice net of factors on s 1 as an extension of vir12 48
using certain z4 code then we can perform the twisted orbifold construction
in the operator algebraic sense to obtain a net of factors the moonshine net
a  theory of induction is used for obtaining various decompositions we
then get a miyamototype description of this construction as an operator
algebraic counterpart of the framed vertex operator algebras we then have
the following properties
1 c  24
2 the representation theory is trivial
3 the automorphism group is the monster
4 the hauptmodul property as above
outline of the proof of these four properties is as follows
it is immediate to get c  24 we can show complete rationality passes
to an extension and an orbifold in general with control over the size of the
representation category using the jones index with this we obtain 2 very
easily such a net is called holomorphic property 3 is the most difficult
part for the virasoro voa l12 0 the vertex operator is indeed a wellbehaved wightman field and smeared s
fields produce the virasoro net vir12 
using this property and the fact that g gl12 048 for all g  autv  
generate the entire moonshine voa v   we can prove that the automorphism
group as a vertex operator algebra and the automorphism group as a net
of factors are indeed the same then 4 is now a trivial corollary of the
borcherds theorem 4
we note that the baby monster the second largest among the 26 sporadic
finite simple groups can be treated similarly with hhns construction of the
shorter moonshine super vertex operator algebra
still these examples are treated with various tricks case by case we
expect a bijective correspondence between vertex operator algebras and nets
of factors on s 1 under some nice conditions on the side of vertex operator

12

algebras the most natural candidate for such a nice condition is the c2 finiteness condition of zhu 56 with unitarity on the operator algebraic
side our complete rationality in 32 seems to be such a nice condition but
the actual relations between the two notions are not clear at this moment
the essential condition for complete rationality is the finiteness of the jones
index arising from four intervals on the circle and this finiteness somehow
has formal similarity to the finiteness appearing in the definition of the c2 finiteness
at the end we list some open problems the operator algebraic approach
has an advantage in control of representation theory but is behind of theory
of vertex operator algebras in the theory of characters
for a net of factors we can naturally define a notion of a character for
each representation but even convergence of these characters have not been
proved in general and the modular invariance property the counterpart of
zhus result 56 is unknown though we certainly expect it to be true we
also expect the verlinde identity holds which has been proved in the context
of vertex operator algebras recently by huang 23 we would need an smatrix version of the spinstatistics theorem 21 for nets of factors
