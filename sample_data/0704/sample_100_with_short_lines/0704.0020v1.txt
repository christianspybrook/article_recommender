introduction

measurements of exclusive semileptonic d decays provide an accurate determination of the hadronic form factors entering in these decays assuming that the ckm
matrix is unitary the elements vcs  and vcd  can be determined

using the measured values 1 of vud  and vcb  and the
sine of the cabibbo angle   sinc   0227 theoretical predictions give estimates of the form factors in
exclusive semileptonic b and d meson decays precise
measurements of the hadronic form factors in d decays
can help to validate predictions from qcd calculations in
both d and b decays better understanding of the form
factors in b decays is necessary to improve the precision
on the determination of vcb  and vub 
in d0  k  e e decays 2 with a pseudoscalar

where gf is the fermi constant q 2 is the invariant mass

this paper we present measurements of the q 2 variation
and absolute value of the hadronic form factor at q 2  0
for the decay d0  k  e e  the data consist of
d mesons produced in e e  cc continuum events at
a center of mass energy near the  4s mass and were
recorded by the babar detector at the stanford linear
accelerator centers pepii collider a semiinclusive
reconstruction technique is used to select charm semileptonic decays with high efficiency as a result of this approach events with a photon radiated during the d0 decay are included in the signal the systematic uncertainties are kept as low as possible by using control samples
extracted from data where possible
measurements of d  k ll  based on smaller signal
events samples have been published by the cleo 4
focus 5 and belle 6 collaborations
this paper is organized as follows a general description of the hadronic form factor f q 2  is given in section ii where the different parameterizations considered

theoretical approaches proposed to determine the values of corresponding parameters are considered in the

having measured the first coefficients of this expansion
eq 9 can constrain the others this constraint which
depends on v  may have to be abandoned in the case of
charm decays as the charmquark mass may not be large
enough to prevent the previous evaluation of v from
receiving large 1mc and qcd corrections however the
parameterization given in eq 6 remains valid and it
has been compared 7 with available measurements the
first two terms in the expansion were sufficient to describe
the data
modeldependent parameterizations

a less general approach assumes that the q 2 variation
of f q 2  is governed mainly by the ds pole and that
the other contributions can be accounted for by adding
another effective pole at a higher mass 11

quantitative expectations

values of the parameters that determine f q 2  were
obtained initially from constituent quark models and
from qcd sum rules these two approaches have an intrinsically limited accuracy in this respect results from
lattice qcd computations are more promising because
their accuracy is mainly limited by available computing
resources
1

quark models

quark model calculations estimate meson wave functions and use them to compute the matrix elements that
appear in the hadronic current there are a large variety
of theoretical calculations 12 among these models we
have selected the isgw model 13 simply because it is
widely used to simulate heavy hadron semileptonic decays this model was expected to be valid in the vicinity
2
 a region of maximum overlap between the iniof qmax
tial and final meson wave functions in isgw2 14 the
exponential q 2 dependence of the form factor has been
replaced by another parameterization with a dipole behavior expected to be valid over a larger q 2 range

qcd sum rules

qcd sum rules 15 and their extension on the light
cone 16 are expected to be valid at low q 2  using a
value of 150 mev for the strange quark mass one obtains
16
f 0  078  011 and pole  007015

14

using the modified pole ansatz the uncertainty of f 0
is estimated to be of order 15 and the q 2 dependence
is expected to be dominated by a single pole at the ds
mass because the value of pole is compatible with zero
3

lattice qcd

lattice qcd computation is the only approach able
to compute f q 2  from first principles current results
must be extrapolated to physical values of light quark
masses and corrected for finite lattice size and discritization effects there have been several evaluations of
f q 2  for different values of the momentum transfer in
the quenched approximation 17 18 these results have
been combined 17 giving f 0  073  007 the
first unquenched calculation has been published recently

corresponding parameters and expected values where

the babar detector and dataset

a detailed description of the babar detector and of the
algorithms used for charged and neutral particle reconstruction and identification is provided elsewhere 20 21
charged particles are reconstructed by matching hits
in the 5layer doublesided silicon vertex tracker svt

with track elements in the 40layer drift chamber dch
which is filled with a gas mixture of helium and isobutane slow particles which do not leave enough hits in the
dch due to the bending in the 15t magnetic field are
reconstructed in the svt charged hadron identification
is performed combining the measurements of the energy
deposition in the svt and in the dch with the information from the cherenkov detector dirc photons are
detected and measured in the csitl electromagnetic
calorimeter emc electrons are identified by the ratio of the track momentum to the associated energy deposited in the emc the transverse profile of the shower
the energy loss in the dch and the cherenkov angle in
the dirc muons are identified in the instrumented flux
return composed of resistive plate chambers interleaved
with layers of steel and brass
the results presented here are obtained using a total integrated luminosity of 75 fb1 registered by the
babar detector during the years 20002002 monte carlo
mc simulation samples of  4s decays charm and
other light quark pairs from continuum equivalent respectively to 28 12 and 07 times the data statistics
respectively have been generated using geant4 22
these are used mainly to evaluate background components quark fragmentation in continuum events is described using the jetset package 23 the mc distributions have been rescaled to the data sample luminosity
using the expected cross sections of the different components 13nb for cc 0525 nb for b  b  and b 0 b 0  209nb
for light u dd  and ss quark events dedicated samples of pure signal events equivalent to seven times the
data statistics are used to correct measurements for efficiency and finite resolution effects they have been generated using the modified pole parameterization ansatz
for f q 2  with pole  050 radiative decays d0 
k  e e  are modeled by photos 24 to account for
one of the most important sources of background a special event sample with in each event at least one cascade
decay d  d0    d0  k   0 e e or its charge
conjugate has been generated with a parameterization
of the form factors in agreement with measurements from
the focus collaboration 25 events with a d and
a d0 decaying into k    or k     0 have been reconstructed in data and simulation these control samples
have been used to adjust the cquark fragmentation distribution and the kinematic characteristics of particles
accompanying the d meson in order to better match the
data they have been used also to measure the reconstruction accuracy on the missing neutrino momentum

iv

signal reconstruction

we reconstruct d0  k  e e  decays in e e 
cc events where the d0 originates from the d  d0   
the main sources of background arise from events with
a kaon and electron candidate such events come from
 4s decays and the continuum production of charmed

9
hadrons their contribution is reduced using variables
sensitive to the particle production characteristics that
are different for signal and background events

signal selection

charged and neutral particles are boosted to the center of mass system cm and the event thrust axis is
determined the direction of this axis is required to be
in the interval  costhrust   06 to minimize the loss of
particles in regions close to the beam axis a plane perpendicular to the thrust axis is used to define two hemispheres equivalent to the two jets produced by quark
fragmentation in each hemisphere we search for pairs
of oppositely charged leptons and kaons for the charged
lepton candidates we consider only electrons or positrons
with cm momentum greater than 05 gevc
since the e momentum is unmeasured a kinematic
fit is performed constraining the invariant mass of the
candidate e k  e system to the d0 mass in this fit
the d0 momentum and the neutrino energy are estimated
from the other particles measured in the event the d0
direction is taken as the direction opposite to the sum of
the momenta of all reconstructed particles in the event
except for the kaon and the positron associated with the
signal candidate the energy of the jet is determined
from the total cm energy and from the measured masses
of the two jets the neutrino energy is estimated as the
difference between the total energy of the jet and the
sum of the energies of all reconstructed particles in the
hemisphere a correction which depends on the value
of the missing energy measured in the opposite jet is
applied to account for the presence of missing energy due
to particles escaping detection even in the absence of a
neutrino from the d0 decay
the d0 candidate is retained if the 2 probability of
the kinematic fit exceeds 103  detector performance for
the reconstruction of the d0 direction and for the missing
energy are measured using events in which the d0 decays
into k     corrections are applied to account for observed differences between data and simulation each
d0 candidate is combined with a charged pion with the
same charge as the lepton and situated in the same hemisphere the mass difference m  md0     md0 
is evaluated and is shown in fig 1 this distribution contains events which in addition pass the requirements on
the fisher discriminant fb b suppressing b b background
and also give a satisfactory kinematic fit constraining the
invariant mass  this last requirement is the reason of
the slow decrease of the m distribution at large m
values a small excess of background is measured in data
and the simulation is rescaled accordingly only events

background rejection

background events arise from  4s decays and

are used to reduce the contribution from b b events
r2 the ratio between the second and zeroth order foxwolfram moments 26 the total charged and neutral
multiplicity and the momentum of the soft pion s  from
the d  these variables exploit the topological differences between events with b decays and events with cc
fragmentation the particle distribution in  4s decay
events tends to be isotropic as the b mesons are produced near threshold while the distribution in cc events
is jetlike as the cm energy is well above the charm
threshold this also results in a softer d momentum
spectrum in  4s decays compared to cc events
corresponding distributions of these variables for signal and background events are given in fig 2 these
variables have been combined linearly in a fisher discriminant the requirement fb b  05 retains 65 of
signal and 6 of b bbackground events

background events from the continuum arise mainly
from charm particles as requiring an electron and a kaon
reduces the contribution from lightquark flavors to a low
level because charm hadrons take a large fraction of the
charm quark energy charm decay products have higher
average energies and different angular distributions relative to the thrust axis or to the d direction compared
with other particles in the hemisphere emitted from the
hadronization of the c and c quarks these other particles are referred to as spectator in the following the

values for signal events

to obtain the unfolded q 2 distribution for signal events
corrected for resolution and acceptance effects the singular value decomposition svd 27 of the resolution matrix has been used this method uses a twodimensional
matrix which relates the generated q 2 distribution to the
detected distribution qr2  as input after subtracting the
estimated background contribution the measured binned
qr2 distribution is linearly transformed into the unfolded
q 2 distribution this approach provides the full covariance matrix for the bin contents of the unfolded distribution singular values sv are ordered by decreasing
values these values contain the information needed to
transform the measured distribution into the unfolded
spectrum along with statistical uncertainties from fluctuations not all sv are relevant nonsignificant values
have zero mean and standard deviation equal to unity
27 using toy simulations we find that seven sv have
to be kept with events distributed over ten bins because
the measurement of the formfactor parameters relies on
the measured qr2 distribution it does not require unfolding and is independent of this particular choice

cquark hadronization tuning

the signal selection is based on variables related to
cquark fragmentation and decay properties of signal
events simulated events have been weighted to agree
with the distributions observed in data weights have
been obtained using events with a reconstructed d0 decaying into k     after applying these corrections
the distribution of the fisher discriminant that contains
these variables is compared for data and simulation the
remaining difference is used to evaluate the corresponding systematic uncertainty it corresponds to the variations on fitted quantities obtained by correcting or not

for this difference which is below 5 over the range of
this variable

resolution on q 2

to measure possible differences between data and
simulation on the q 2 reconstruction accuracy d0 
k     0 events are used again distributions of the difference qr2  q 2  obtained by selecting events in a given
bin of q 2 are compared these distributions are systematically slightly narrower for simulated events and the
fraction of events in the distant tails are higher for data
see fig 9
with the d0  k    sample we study in data and
simulation the accuracy of the d0 direction and missing
energy reconstruction for the d0  k  e e analysis
this information is used in the massconstrained fits and
thus influences the q 2 reconstruction once the simulation is tuned to reproduce the results obtained on data
for these parameters the q 2 resolution distributions agree
very well as shown in fig 9 one half of the measured
variation on the fitted parameters from these corrections
has been taken as a systematic uncertainty

it is important to verify that the q 2 variation of the
selection efficiency is well described by the simulation
this is done by analyzing d0  k     0 as if they were
k  e e events the two photons from the  0 are removed and events are reconstructed using the algorithm
applied to the semileptonic d0 decay the missing  0
and the charged pion play respectively the roles of the
neutrino and the electron to preserve the correct kinematic limits it is necessary to take into account that
the fake neutrino has the  0 mass and that the fake
electron has the   mass
data and simulated events which satisfy the same
analysis selection criteria as for kee  have been compared for this test the cose  and pe are removed from
the fisher discriminant because distributions for these
two variables are different from the signal events
the ratio of efficiencies measured in data and simulation is fit with a linear expression in q 2  the corresponding slope 071068 indicates that there is no significant bias when the event selection criteria are applied
the measured slope is used to define a correction and to
estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty

background estimate

the background under the d signal has two components that have respectively nonpeaking and peaking
behavior
the nonpeaking background originates from noncc
events and from continuum charm events in which the
s candidate does not come from a cascading d  by
comparing data and simulated event rates for m 
018 gevc2 see fig 1 a correction of 105 is determined from simulation for the nonpeaking background
this correction is applied and an uncertainty of 005 is
used as the corresponding systematic uncertainty
events which include a slow pion originating from d
decay contribute in several ways to the peaking background the production rate of d mesons in the simulation is in agreement with expectations based on measurements from cleo 28 the uncertainty of 006 on
this comparison is dominated by the systematic uncertainty from the cleo result
to study the remaining effects the peaking background components have been divided according to the
process from which they originate and have been ordered
by decreasing level of importance
 the k  and the electron originate from a d0 decay 54 the main source comes from d0 
k   0 e e  we have corrected the decay branching fraction used for this channel in the mc 202
using recent measurements 217  016 1 the
uncertainty on this value has been used to evaluate
the corresponding systematic uncertainty
 the electron comes from a converted photon or a
dalitz decay 24 it has been assumed that the
simulation correctly accounts for this component
 the k  does not originate from a charm hadron
14 this happens usually when there is another
negative charged kaon accompanying the d  we
have studied the production of charged kaon accompanying a d using d0  k    events and measure a correction factor of 087002 and 053002
respectively for same sign and opposite sign kd pairs the simulation is modified accordingly
and the remaining systematic uncertainty from this
source becomes negligible
 fake kaon candidate mainly pions 6 or fake
electrons 1 differences between data and mc
on the evaluation of fake rates have been studied
in babar as this affects small components of the

fitting procedure and radiative events

to fit form factor parameters we compare the number of expected events in each bin with the measured
one after all corrections in this approach it is always
assumed that the q 2 variation of f q 2  is given exactly by the form factor parameterization this hypothesis is not correct a priori for radiative decays as
q 2  pd  pk 2  pe  p  p 2 is not perhaps equal
to the variable that enters in f for such decays photos is used to generate decays with additional photons
and the modified pole ansatz is taken to parameterize
the hadronic form factor in signal events to quantify
possible distortion of the fit we compare the fitted value
of a form factor parameter with the one obtained from a
fit to the generated q 2 distribution see table iv

fitted values of parameters quoted uncertainties correspond

without using photos measured differences are given
in the last column of table iv they have not been
applied to the values quoted in table iii for the different
parameters we measure also that radiative effects affect
mainly the fraction of the decay spectrum in the first bin
in table ii which has to be increased by 00012 to correct
for this effect

summary of systematic errors

the systematic uncertainties for determining form factor parameters are summarized in table v
the systematic error matrix for the ten unfolded values is computed by considering in turn each source of
uncertainty and by measuring the variation i  of the corresponding unfolded value in each bin i the elements
of the uncertainty matrix are the sum over all sources
of systematic uncertainty of the quantities i  j  the
total error matrix is evaluated as the sum of the matrices
corresponding respectively to statistical and systematic
uncertainties

comparison with expectations and with other
measurements

the summary of the fits to the normalized q 2 distributions are presented in table iii as long as we allow
the form factor parameters to be free in the fit the fitted distributions agree well with the data and it is not
possible to reject any of the parameterizations
however if the form factor parameters are constrained
to specific predicted values the agreement is not good
for the isgw2 model the predicted dependence of the
form factor on q 2 disagrees with the data and the fitted value of the parameter i differs from the predicted
value i  0104 gev2 by more than a factor two
as observed by previous experiments the simple pole
model ansatz with mpole  mds  2112 gevc2 does
not reproduce the measurements this means that the
contribution from the continuum dk interaction cannot be neglected if one introduces a second parameter pole to account for contributions from an effective

for different experiments the fitted pole masses are all
well below the mass of the ds meson the results presented here are consistent within the stated uncertainties

presented the data are compared to earlier measurements by the focus experiment as well as with predictions from lattice qcd calculations 19 as stated
above the data favor a somewhat lower value for pole 
the data have also been mapped into the variable z
figure 11 shows the product p    f as a function of
z by convention this quantity is constrained to unity
at z  zmax  which corresponds to q 2  0 we perform a
fit to a polynomial p    f  1  r1 z  r2 z 2  the
data are compatible with a linear dependence which is
fully consistent with the modified pole ansatz for f q 2 
as illustrated in fig 11

selection of candidate signal events

the selection of d0  k  e e candidates is explained
in section iv a for the rate measurement the constraint on the d mass is not applied and also the
momentum of the soft pion candidate is not included
in the fisher discriminant variable designed to suppress
b bbackground since generic simulated signal events
used in this measurement have been generated with the
isgw2 model they have been weighted so that their q 2
distribution agrees with the measurement presented in
this paper furthermore we require for the fisher discriminant fb b  0 and restrict m  016 gevc2 
after background subtraction there remain 76283  323
and 95302  309 events in data and simulation respectively this gives
n d0  k  e e data
 08004  00043
n d0  k  e e mc

18

to select d0  k    candidates the same data samples are used and particles in each event are selected in
the same way the same selection criteria on the fisher

discriminant to suppress b bevents on the thrust axis
direction and on other common variables are applied
events are also analyzed in the same way with two hemispheres defined from the thrust axis in each hemisphere
a d0 candidate is reconstructed by combining a charged
k with a pion of opposite sign these tracks have to
form a vertex and the k mass must be within the range
177 195 gevc2  another charged pion of appropriate sign is added to form a d candidate
in addition the following selection criteria are used
 the fraction of the beam momentum in the cm
frame taken by the d candidate must exceed 048
to remove contributions from b b events

 the measured d0 mass must be in the range between 183 and 189 gevc2  this requirement
eliminates possible contributions from remaining
d0  k  k  or     decays see fig 12a
 the vertex fit for the d0 and d have to converge

the m distribution for candidate events is shown in
fig 12c the following components contribute to the

efficiency corrections

the impact of the selection requirement on the reconstructed k mass has been studied the k mass distribution signal for simulated events not including radiative photons is compared with the corresponding distribution obtained with data after background subtraction
the background contributions are taken from the simulation the fraction of d0 candidates in the selected mass
range between 183 and 189 gevc2  is 9764  025

the m distribution corresponding to other event

such that this difference has a small effect on the measured number of d events in data and in the simulation there are 166960409 and 134537374 candidates
selected in the interval m  0142 0149 gevc2 for

systematic uncertainties on rd

 

since d  k e e events have been selected using
a selection requirement on m we need to confirm that
the distribution of this variable is similar in data and
simulation this is checked by comparing the distributions obtained with d0  k     0 events analyzed as
if they were semileptonic decays the m distributions
are compared in fig 13 below 016 gevc2  there are
093552000066 of the d candidates in the simulation
and 093219  000078 for data the corresponding ratio
of efficiencies mcdata is equal to 10036  00010
using d0  k     0 events we also measure the difference between the fraction of events retained after the
massconstrained fits namely it is 098038  000037 in
the simulation compared to 097438  000049 in data
the relative efficiency mcdata for this selection is
10062  00006 based on these two measured corrections the ratio of efficiencies are

d0  k  e e data
the quoted uncertainties in this section are of statistical
origin and will be included in the statistical uncertainty
on rd  other differences between the two analyzed channels are considered in the following section and contribute
to systematic uncertainties

a summary of the systematic uncertainties on rd are
given in table vii they originate from selection criteria
which are different for the two channels some of these
uncertainties are the same as those already considered
for the determination of the q 2 variation of f 

1

correlated systematic uncertainties

systematic uncertainties on the decay rate coming
from effects that contribute in the measurement of the
q 2 dependence of f q 2  are evaluated in section v a
and the full covariance matrix for the measurements of
the number of d0  k  e e signal events and the fraction of the decay spectrum fitted in each of the ten bins
is determined among the sources of systematic uncertainties listed in table v those corresponding to
 the reconstruction algorithm
 the tuning of the resolution on q 2 
 the corrections applied on electron identification
and

20
 the background normalization
are taken as common sources corresponding relative
uncertainties on rd are given in table vii
other systematic uncertainties contributing to the
form factor measurement also affect the reference channel and so their effects on rd cancel they are related to
the chadronization tuning and to the corrections applied
on the kaon identification

selection requirement on the fisher discriminant

the stability of the fraction of d0  k  e e events
selected in data and in simulation as a function of the
fisher discriminant fcc  designed to suppress cc background has been examined this is done by comparing
the distributions of this variable measured in data and in
simulation as given in fig 4 for two selected intervals in
m
the value corresponding to fcc  0 and for events selected in the range m  016 gevc2 is used as the
central result and half the difference between the measurements corresponding to fcc greater than 025 and 
025 is taken as systematic uncertainty this range corresponds to a relative change of 40 of the efficiency for
signal events and gives an uncertainty of 00061 on the
ratio of data and simulated signal candidates

d counting in d0  k   

d candidates are selected in the range m 
0142 0149 gevc2  from the simulation it is expected that the fraction of signal events outside this
interval is equal to 14 even though the d signal is slightly narrower in the simulation there is not
a large discrepancy in the tails the fraction of signal
events measured in the sidebands m  0140 0142
0149 0150 gevc2 is 04 and 05 respectively for
simulation and data an uncertainty of 0004 corresponding to 30 uncertainty on the total fraction of
events outside the selected m interval is assumed

summary

the decay rate distribution for the channel d0 
k e e  has been measured in ten bins in table ii
several theoretical expectations for the variation of this
form factor with q 2 have been considered and values for
the corresponding parameters have been obtained see
table iii the q 2 variation of the form factor can be
parameterized with a single parameter using different expressions the isgw2 model with expected values for
the parameters is excluded as is the pole mass parameterization with mpole  mds 
the value of the decay branching fraction has been also
measured independent of a model
combining these measurements the value of the
hadronic form factor is obtained
