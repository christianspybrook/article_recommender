abstract the very nature of the solar chromosphere
its structuring and dynamics remains far from being
properly understood in spite of intensive research here
we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this longstanding problem computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere
due to carlsson and stein demonstrate that millimeter
emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in
the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to
look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0850
mm the model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths as will be provided by
alma will have the unique property of reacting to
both the hot and the cool gas and thus will have the
potential of distinguishing between rival models of the
solar atmosphere thus initial results obtained from
the observations of the quiet sun at 35 mm with the
bima array resolution of 12  reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50150 k and frequencies of
158 mhz with a tendency toward shortperiod oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network
regions however higher spatial resolution such as that
provided by alma is required for a clean separation
between the features within the solar atmosphere and

1 introduction
the chromosphere remains the least understood layer of
the solar atmosphere with the very basics of its structure being hotly debated is it better described by the
classical picture of a steady temperature rise as a function of height with superposed weak oscillations eg
semi empirical models of vernazza et al 8 fontenla
et al 5 or does the temperature keep dropping outwards with very hot shocks producing strong localized
heating radiation hydrodynamic simulations of carlsson  stein 3 4 and wedemeyer et al 9 the
latter concept is consistent with the ir observations of
carbon monoxide which require cool gas to be present
at chromospheric heights see eg ayres 1
thus existing models cannot provide a complete description of the solar chromosphere consequently nowadays two alternative pictures of the chromosphere coexist and the role played by chromospheric dynamics in
the structuring of this atmospheric layer is a subject of
intense scientific debate
one reason for conflicting models is that they are
based either on atomic chromospheric lines and continua in the uv or on molecular lines in the ir since
uv observations are practically blind to cool gas in a
dynamic chromosphere while the ir observations sample only the cool part of the chromosphere improved
and more sensitive diagnostics of the chromospheric
structure and dynamics that sample both the hot and

the cool gas and should distinguish between the rival models are provided by observations at millimeter wavelengths with an acceptable spatial resolution
as was proposed by loukitcheva et al 6 in this contribution we review the unique chromospheric observations at 35 mm with the berkeleyillinoismaryland
array and the analysis of the intensity variations expected from the model of carlsson  stein for mm
wavelengths we postulate the requirements for mm observations with the future instruments with emphasis
on spatial and temporal resolution finally we discuss
the prospects for chromospheric studies with alma

21 analysis of the bima observations at 35 mm
the berkeleyillinoismaryland array bima operating at a wavelength of 35 mm frequency of 85 ghz

has been the only interferometer in the mm range frequently used for solar observations the bima telescopes are now part of the carma array which will
also carry out such observations with the bima data
obtained in the years 2003 and 2004 we have constructed
twodimensional maps of the solar chromosphere with a
resolution of 12  which represents the highest spatial
resolution achieved so far at this wavelength for nonflare solar observations the bima images have led
to new insights in to chromospheric structure and to
the detection of spatiallyresolved chromospheric oscillations at mm wavelengths the details of the restoration procedure and extensive tests of the sensitivity of
the bima data to the detection of dynamic signatures
can be found in white et al 11
with the currently available resolution the contrast
of the brightness structures is evaluated to be up to
30 of the quietsun brightness at 35 mm white et
al 11 however the similarity of brightness struc

tures derived from the mm images and seen in other
chromospheric emissions fig1 in spite of the difference in resolution of the images 12 resolution of the
uv images implies that the bima resolution is not
enough to resolve the millimeter fine structure and observations with spatial resolution much higher than 12
are required a detailed analysis of the relations between the millimeter emission magnetic field and other
chromospheric diagnostics is in preparation
in the millimeter brightness we detected intensity
oscillations with typical amplitudes of 50150 k in the
range of periods from 120 to 700 seconds frequency
range 158 mhz we found a tendency toward short
period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in
network regions in the quiet sun which is in good agreement with the results obtained at other wavelengths at
3 mm the inner parts of the chromospheric cells exhibit
a behavior typical of the internetwork with the maximum of the fourier power in the 3minute range however most of the oscillations are quasiperiodic showing up in wave trains of finite duration lasting for typically 13 wave periods see also loukitcheva et al 7

ent wavelengths are caused primarily by the difference
in the formation heights of the emitted radiation in
general the amplitudes of the oscillations compared to
the radiation temperature are large in this sense mm
wavelength radiation combines the advantages of the
co lines which mainly see the cool gas with those of
atomic lines and uv continua which mainly sample the
hot gas
on the whole the brightness temperatures are extremely timedependent at millimeter wavelengths following changes in the atmospheric parameters with
increasing wavelength the amplitude of the brightness
oscillations grows significantly reaches its maximum
value at 22 mm expected to be 15 of the quietsun
brightness temperature and decreases rapidly towards
longer wavelengths thus we can identify the range 0850 mm as the appropriate range of mm wavelengths at
which one can expect the clearest signatures of dynamic
effects a careful look at the mm brightness spectrum
as a function of time see fig 2 reveals a time delay
between the oscillations at long and short millimeter
wavelengths hence it is possible to study wave modes
traveling in the chromosphere by comparing submm
with mm observations

22 analysis of the cs model millimeter spectrum
the response of the submillimeter and millimeter radiation to a timeseries generated by carlsson  stein
cs was computed under the assumption of thermal
freefree radiation by loukitcheva et al 6 the results

as a function of time and wavelength

wave periods of approximately 3 min can be clearly
distinguished in the intensity at all considered wavelengths though the dominant frequency of the oscillations changes slightly with wavelength for all mm wavelengths it lies in the range of 3 minutes the difference
from one period of time to another can be explained
by the presence of merging shocks during certain time
intervals the differences in the light curves at differ

3 discussion
the cs model predicts that spatially and temporally
resolved observations should clearly exhibit the signatures of the strong shock waves however a direct comparison of the observational data products rms values histogram skewness fourier and wavelet spectra
etc referring to regions with weak magnetic field like
the quiet sun internetwork with the corresponding products expected from the simulations of carlsson  stein
exhibits large differences in particular the rms of the
brightness temperature is nearly an order of magnitude
larger in the model 800 k at 3 mm than in the observations 100 k another difference is the absence of
longer periods in the model power spectrum but these
discrepancies do not rule out the cs models on the
one hand the model is one dimensional and hence does
not predict a coherence length of the oscillations while
on the other hand we are not able to resolve individual
oscillating elements due to the limited spatial resolution
of the observations
consequently we estimated the influence of the spatial smearing on the model parameters of chromospheric
dynamics and on the observed oscillatory power thus
we confirmed that the very limited spatial resolution
currently available hinders a clean separation between
cells and network and typically both network and internetwork areas contribute to the recorded bima ra

diation from the analysis of the observational data it
was found that power in all frequency ranges increases
significantly with improving resolution consistency between the power predicted by the cs model and the
observed power is obtained if the coherence length of
oscillating elements is on the order of 1 
our results are consistent with wedemeyer et al
10 who computed the millimeter wave signature resulting from the 3d simulations of wedemeyer et al
9 although the 3d simulations suffer from the fact
that the radiative transfer of energy is computed entirely in lte which becomes a poor assumption at
chromospheric heights the authors believe that the chromospheric pattern and its temporal evolution is representative of the nonmagnetic internetwork regions of
the solar chromosphere the simulations display a complex 3d structure of the chromospheric layers which is
highly dynamical on temporal scales of 2025 s and on
spatial scales comparable to solar granulation which is
in good agreement with the 1 size of oscillating elements that we deduced according to wedemeyer et al
9 the chromospheric temperature structure is characterized by a pattern of hot shock waves which originate
from convective motions and cool gas lying between the
shocks the intensity distribution at mm wavelengths
follows the pattern of the shocks in the chromosphere
with a sub arcsecond size of the features associated with
the shocks all this complex and dynamic 3d structure
can be deduced from observations at mm wavelengths
with a sufficiently high spatial resolution of better than

4 summary
simultaneous mmsubmm observations at different wavelengths can be used for the tomography of the solar
atmosphere as radiation at the different wavelengths
originates from different layers with the average formation height increasing with wavelength such observations also provide a strong test of present and future
models however observations that might be able to
uncover the nature of the chromosphere should meet
the following requirements
 multiband observations in mmsubmm domain 0850 mm to address shock waves and chromospheric
oscillation modes
 arcsecond spatial resolution to resolve fine structure
 temporal resolution better than a few seconds to
follow its evolution in time
 fov size of order of 1
 accurate absolute calibration of the observations bastian 2

these requirements look very similar to the technical specification of the continuum observations with the
atacama large millimeter array alma which represents an enormous advance over existing instrumentation operating at mmsubmm wavelengths alma will
produce images of the highest resolution available for
the foreseeable future although the technical problem
of sampling both large and small spatial scales simultaneously required for highquality imaging of the chromosphere will remain a challenge and will be the most
sensitive instrument operating at submmmm wavelengths
to summarize alma will be an extraordinarily powerful instrument for studying the solar chromosphere it
will finally allow the mapping of the threedimensional
thermal structure of the solar chromosphere which will
be a real breakthrough in solar studies
