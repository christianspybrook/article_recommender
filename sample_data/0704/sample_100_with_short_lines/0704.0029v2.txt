abstract
in qm a quark can emit goldstone bosons the flavor symmetry breaking in the goldstone
boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavorspin structure in this paper we
study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in qm caused by the goldstone boson
emission process in nucleon from a simplified model hamiltonian derived from qm the intrinsic
wave functions of constituent quarks are determined then the obtained transition probabilities
of the emission of goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor
symmetry breaking in nucleon flavorspin structure

introduction

the measurements of the polarized structure functions of the nucleon in deep inelastic
scatteringdis experiments1 2 3 4 show the complication in proton spin structure only
a portion of the proton spin is carried by valence quarks moreover several experiments5 6
7 clearly indicate the d asymmetry as well as the existence of the strange quark content s in
the proton sea also the distribution of strange quark in the proton sea is polarized negative
the dis results deviate significantly from the nave quark model nqm expectation
nqm gives many fairly good descriptions of hadron properties why does nqm work
it is a puzzle that the quarks inside a hadron could be treated as nonrelativistic particles
in nqm the chiral quark model qm tries to bridge between qcd and nqm it was
originated by weinberg8 and formulated by manohar and georgi9 between the qcd
confinement scale qcd 200mev and a chiral symmetry breaking scale sb 1gev
the strong interaction is described by an effective lagrangian of quarks q gluons g and
numbugoldstone bosons  an important feature of the qm is that betweetn qcd and
sb  the internal gluon effects in a hadron can be small compared to the internal goldstone
bosons  and quarks q so the effective degrees of freedom in this region can be q and 
it is interesting that qm can also be used to explain why nqm does not work in the
above dis experiments by the emission of goldstone boson qm allows the fluctuation
of a quark q into a recoiling quark plus a goldstone boson q  q    the q   system then
further splits to generate quark sea through
 the helicityflipping process
q    q  q q   q

 and the helicitynonflipping process
q    q  q q   q

where the subscript indicates the helicity of quark in both the process q   is in a relative pwave state in the helicityflipping process 1 the orbital angular momentum along helicity
direction must be hlz i  1 in the helicitynonflipping process 2 hlz i  0 the process
cause a modification of the spin content of the nucleon because a quark changes its helicity
2

in 1 also it causes a modification of the flavor content because the generated quark sea
from  is flavor dependent10 11
qm was first used to explain the nucleon sea flavor asymmetry and the smallness of
the quark spin fraction by eichten hinchliffe and quigg10 the flavor asymmetry of sea
quark distribution arises from the mass differences in different quark flavors and in different
goldstone bosons only the lightest goldstone boson  was considered since its contribution
dominates from a perturbation calculation the probability for an up quark to emit a  
was estimated to be a  0083 this would induce a flavor asymmetry in parton distributions
of nucleon and other hadrons
however the estimated transition probability is not enough to full account the flavor
asymmetry in dis experiments contribution from other s and even   was considered by
cheng and li11 explicit suf 3 breaking in the transition probabilities was later introduced in refs 12 13 and further used by several authors14 15 16 17 18 19 nevertheless
in all these calculations the transition probabilities were put into model by hand to fit the
 01
experimental data the probability of an up quark emitting   needs to be set to a 
which is about 20 larger than the perturbation calculation although the probability of 
emission can be enlarged by using a higher momentum cut off   qm in the perturbation
calculation 20 however the chiral quark model is no longer valid at arbitrary high energies
  qm 
we should not be surprised by this discrepancy since the qm works in a region right
above the qcd confinement scale qcd  there one may expect the confinement effect is
important and the perturbative calculation of qcd may contain large error however there
is another essential difference between the above model calculations and the perturbation
calcultion in the perturbation calculation the emitted goldstone bosons are virtual particles in the above model calculations which are closely related to nqm however the
goldstone bosons are close to mass shell under the nonrelativistic approximation
since qm can be a bridge between nqm and qcd it is interesting to explore qm
from nqm side where we use the wave function method this will give the above model calculations a concrete foundation in nqm and help us further understand the flavor symmetry
breaking mechanism
in this paper we will use wave function method to investigate the flavor symmetry breaking in qm in a conventional quark model21 a hadron consists of confined constituent
3

quarks and its wave function is constructed in the configuration space of the constituent
quarks to incorporate the transition process of emitting goldstone boson of qm into the
quark model the constituent quarks will have intrinsic wave functions within the configuration q  q  
in sec ii we first present the composite wave function of constituent quarks including
components of q   the wave functions and the transition probabilities of q  q   are
determined from a simplified qm hamiltionian in sec iii and sec iv the obtained
transition probabilities are used to calculate nucleon flavorspin structure and baryon octet
magnetic moments respectively the numerical results and a brief summary are presented
in sec v

this allows the fluctuation of a quark into a recoil quark plus a goldstone boson q  q  
in quark model a hadron is built with constituent quarks in accordance with qm
we should treat a constituent quark as a composite particle including such components q

is the qm interaction hb is an accessary interaction which is needed to bind the q  
together in our simplified hamiltonian we will not disscuss the explicit formalism of hb 
instead we will put some physical restriction conditions on it later in this section which is
sufficient to our calculation

however we need a binding interaction hb in the hamiltonian yet we do not know how
to write out the explicit form of hb  however hb should provide enough binding energy

then the wave function of a composite constituent quark is determined from schrdinger

by diagonalizing this hamiltonian matrix we will obtain a new mass of the constituent u
quark mu and its composite wave function the constituent masses and wave functions of
d and s quarks can be obtained similarly we have

after the diagonalization the goldstone bosons  are separated from quarks q approximately with only degrees of freedom q one can rebuild the quark model and so mu  md

flavor and spin structure of proton

having known the wave functions of constituent quark q and the transition amplitudes
of q emitting each goldstone bosons  we are able to calculate the quark distribution in
a constituent quark following refs 11 12 13 in qm  will further split into a quarkantiquark pair by substituting the quark contents of  into wave functions 28 38 and
39 we can rewrite the wave functions of constituent quark q as

we can further calculate the spin structure of proton here one should consider the effects
of configuration mixing generated by spinspin forces22 we take the baryon wave functions

where eq and e are the electric charges carried by q and  respectively  the quark spin
operator and l the relative angular momentum bewteen q and  the first term in eq54
is the intrinsic magnetic moment of quark and the other two terms are the contribution of
the orbital angular momentum here we have to consider the relativistic effect since the
relative momentum of q or  are comparable to their masses in the q system
pq    mq 
with the sho wave functions of 20 the magnetic moment of q system 54 can be
readily calculated then we can recalculate the magnetic moments of constituent quarks

the magnetic moments of d and s quarks can be calculated similarly

numerical results and conclusions

in the numerical calculation most of the parameters can be taken from the experimental
data or the chiral quark model we collect these fixed input parameters of our calculation

for the quark masses since our work focuses on the inner context of the constituent quarks
in quark model naturally we will refer to the quark masses from quark model instead of
the chiral quark model values here we will use the quark mass values from the widely
accepted isgurs quark model21 as shown in table ii however one should be cautious
that in our model it is the quark with the goldstone boson mixing which corresponds to
the constituent quark in quark model that is mass values mq after the diagonalization
process should be set to the quark masses in isgurs model our strategy is to adjust the
quark masses mq in the model hamiltonian to fit the mq values
finally we are left only with one free parameter  which describes the confinement of the
emitted goldstone boson in our model an overall fit to the experimental data of nucleon
flavorspin structure and octet baryon magnetic moments shows that the best value should
be 152mev with this value of  and a minimun binding energe eb  218mev the

d    0145 is significantly larger than the perturbation calculation a0083 one may
notice that the  parameter value 152mev in our wave function which is below qcd  is
rather small than another energy scale qm in chiral quark model surely this will weaken
the interaction between q and q   however one should also notice that the binding energy
eb  218mev will make the energy of a q system much close to the single quark energy

this will enhance the mixing of q   components in a constituent quark

also we notice that the asymmetry between the probabilities of ud  s  k and
s  ud  k whether this asymmetry leads to any observable consequence in hadron
structure needs further investigation

next we will compare our calculate results with the experimental data since our emphasis is on the substructure of a constituent quark in nqm here we also quote the results
from nqm in table v the calculated flavor and spin structures of the proton are shown

polarization leads to a better agreement with experimental data for the spin structure
the calculated magnetic moments of octet baryons are given in table vi although the
deviation is somewhat around 30 in the case of   our overall fit to octet baryon magnetic
moments is in good agreement with experiments also it should be mentioned that even in
the case of  the fit can perhaps be improved if corrections due to pion loops are taken
into account32 33
in the model calculations 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 the goldstone boson sector in
qm is usually extended to include the   meson with u3 symmetry according to cheng
and li11 in the large nc limit of qcd there are nine goldstone bosons including the usual
octet and the singlet    thus an constituent quark can also transit to a quark  system we
have also made an u3 calculation with the inclusion of    we find that the probabilities
for   emission from light and strange quarks p u  u    p d  d    00021 and
p s  s    00018 which are negligibly small as compared to those of octet goldstone

boson emissions we therefore conclude that the contribution of   is not important due to
the obvious axial u1 symmetry breaking in meson mass spectra m  mk 
to summarize the qm builds a bridge between the qcd and lowenergy quark model
this allows us to understand the mechanism of flavor symmetry breaking and nucleon flavorspin structure in nqm through the consideration of the sea quark and goldstone bosons
in the substructure of constituent quarks using the simple sho wave function we have
modeled the wave functions of the composite constituent quarks and thus estimated the
transition probabilities for goldstone boson emissions these transition probabilities indeed
reflect the flavor su3 symmetry breaking in qm from the differences in quark masses
ms  mud and differences in goldstone bosons masses mk  m and they are roughly
in agreement with the parametrizations of other model calculations 11 12 13 14 15 16
