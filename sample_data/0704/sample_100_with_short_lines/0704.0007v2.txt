a rather nonstandard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent
years due to its possible relation with planck scale physics in particular this approach has been
followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology here we
explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary schrdinger theory and the polymer
description the paper has two parts in the first one we derive the polymer quantum mechanics
starting from the ordinary schrdinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an
appropriate limit in the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory namely the
reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary
schrdinger quantum mechanics we consider several examples of interest including the harmonic
oscillator the free particle and a simple cosmological model

introduction

the socalled polymer quantum mechanics a nonregular and somewhat exotic representation of the
canonical commutation relations ccr 1 has been
used to explore both mathematical and physical issues in
background independent theories such as quantum gravity 2 3 a notable example of this type of quantization
when applied to minisuperspace models has given way to
what is known as loop quantum cosmology 4 5 as in
any toy model situation one hopes to learn about the
subtle technical and conceptual issues that are present
in full quantum gravity by means of simple finite dimensional examples this formalism is not an exception
in this regard apart from this motivation coming from
physics at the planck scale one can independently ask
for the relation between the standard continuous representations and their polymer cousins at the level of mathematical physics a deeper understanding of this relation
becomes important on its own
the polymer quantization is made of several steps
the first one is to build a representation of the
heisenbergweyl algebra on a kinematical hilbert space
that is background independent and that is sometimes
referred to as the polymeric hilbert space hpoly  the
second and most important part the implementation of
dynamics deals with the definition of a hamiltonian or
hamiltonian constraint on this space in the examples

studied so far the first part is fairly well understood
yielding the kinematical hilbert space hpoly that is however nonseparable for the second step a natural implementation of the dynamics has proved to be a bit more
difficult given that a direct definition of the hamiltonian
 of say a particle on a potential on the space hpoly is
not possible since one of the main features of this representation is that the operators q and p cannot be both
simultaneously defined nor their analogues in theories
involving more elaborate variables thus any operator
that involves powers of the not defined variable has to
be regulated by a well defined operator which normally
involves introducing some extra structure on the configuration or momentum space namely a lattice however
this new structure that plays the role of a regulator can
not be removed when working in hpoly and one is left
with the ambiguity that is present in any regularization
the freedom in choosing it can be sometimes associated
with a length scale the lattice spacing for ordinary
quantum systems such as a simple harmonic oscillator
that has been studied in detail from the polymer viewpoint it has been argued that if this length scale is taken
to be sufficiently small one can arbitrarily approximate
standard schrdinger quantum mechanics 2 3 in the
case of loop quantum cosmology the minimum area gap
a0 of the full quantum gravity theory imposes such a
scale that is then taken to be fundamental 4
a natural question is to ask what happens when we
change this scale and go to even smaller distances that
is when we refine the lattice on which the dynamics of
the theory is defined can we define consistency conditions between these scales or even better can we
take the limit and find thus a continuum limit as it

these relations known as the canonical commutation relation ccr become the most common corner stone of
the kinematics of the quantum theory they should be
satisfied by the quantum system when represented on a
hilbert space h
there are alternative points of departure for quantum
kinematics here we consider the algebra generated by
the exponentiated versions of q and p that are denoted
by

has been shown recently in detail the answer to both
questions is in the affirmative 6 there an appropriate
notion of scale was defined in such a way that one could
define refinements of the theory and pose in a precise
fashion the question of the continuum limit of the theory
these results could also be seen as handing a procedure
to remove the regulator when working on the appropriate space the purpose of this paper is to further explore
different aspects of the relation between the continuum
and the polymer representation in particular in the first
part we put forward a novel way of deriving the polymer
representation from the ordinary schrdinger representation as an appropriate limit in sec ii we derive two
versions of the polymer representation as different limits of the schrdinger theory in sec iii we show that
these two versions can be seen as different polarizations
of the abstract polymer representation these results
to the best of our knowledge are new and have not been
reported elsewhere in sec iv we pose the problem of
implementing the dynamics on the polymer representation in sec v we motivate further the question of the
continuum limit ie the proper removal of the regulator
and recall the basic constructions of 6 several examples are considered in sec vi in particular a simple
harmonic oscillator the polymer free particle and a simple quantum cosmology model are considered the free
particle and the cosmological model represent a generalization of the results obtained in 6 where only systems
with a discrete and nondegenerate spectrum where considered we end the paper with a discussion in sec vii
in order to make the paper selfcontained we will keep
the level of rigor in the presentation to that found in the
standard theoretical physics literature

from this perspective quantization means finding an
unitary representation of the weyl algebra w on a
hilbert space h that could be different from the ordinary schrdinger representation at first it might look
weird to attempt this approach given that we know how
to quantize such a simple system what do we need such
a complicated object as w for it is infinite dimensional
whereas the set s  1 q p the starting point of the
ordinary dirac quantization is rather simple it is in
the quantization of field systems that the advantages of
the weyl approach can be fully appreciated but it is
also useful for introducing the polymer quantization and
comparing it to the standard quantization this is the
strategy that we follow
a question that one can ask is whether there is any
freedom in quantizing the system to obtain the ordinary
schrdinger representation on a first sight it might seem
that there is none given the stonevon neumann uniqueness theorem let us review what would be the argument
for the standard construction let us ask that the representation we want to build up is of the schrdinger type
namely where states are wave functions of configuration
space q there are two ingredients to the construction
of the representation namely the specification of how the
basic operators q p will act and the nature of the space
of functions that  belongs to that is normally fixed by
the choice of inner product on h or measure  on r
the standard choice is to select the hilbert space to be

in this section we derive the so called polymer representation of quantum mechanics starting from a specific
reformulation of the ordinary schrdinger representation
our starting point will be the simplest of all possible
phase spaces namely   r2 corresponding to a particle
living on the real line r let us choose coordinates q p
thereon as a first step we shall consider the quantization
of this system that leads to the standard quantum theory
in the schrdinger description a convenient route is to
introduce the necessary structure to define the fock representation of such system from this perspective the
passage to the polymeric case becomes clearest roughly
speaking by a quantization one means a passage from the
classical algebraic bracket the poisson bracket

to a quantum bracket given by the commutator of the
corresponding operators

in our case this specification of j induces such a unique

is it possible to find other representations in order to
appreciate this freedom we go to the weyl algebra and
build the quantum theory thereon the representation
of the weyl algebra that can be called of the fock type
involves the definition of an extra structure on the phase
space  a complex structure j that is a linear mapping from  to itself such that j 2  1 in 2 dimensions all the freedom in the choice of j is contained in
the choice of a parameter d with dimensions of length it
is also convenient to define k  p that has dimensions
of 1l we have then

this object together with the symplectic structure
q p q   p   q p  p q  define an inner product on
 by the formula gd       jd  such that

in this representation the vacuum is given by the identity function 0 q  1 that is just as any plane wave
normalized note that for each value of d  0 the representation is well defined and continuous in  and 
note also that there is an equivalence between the qrepresentation defined by d and the krepresentation defined by 1d
how can we recover then the standard representation
in which the measure is given by the lebesgue measure
and the operators are represented as in 4 it is easy to
see that there is an isometric isomorphism k that maps
the drepresentation in hd to the standard schrdinger
representation in hschr by

from which one can build the standard fock representation thus one can alternatively view the introduction
of the length parameter d as the quantity needed to define dimensionless complex coordinates on the phase
space but what is the relevance of this object j or
d the definition of complex coordinates is useful for
the construction of the fock space since from them one
can define in a natural way creation and annihilation
operators but for the schrdinger representation we are
interested here it is a bit more subtle the subtlety is
that within this approach one uses the algebraic properties of w to construct the hilbert space via what is
known as the gelfandnaimarksegal gns construction this implies that the measure in the schrdinger
representation becomes non trivial and thus the momentum operator acquires an extra term in order to render
the operator selfadjoint the representation of the weyl
algebra is then when acting on functions q 7

thus we see that all drepresentations are unitarily equivalent this was to be expected in view of the stonevon

so even when there is no information about the parameter d in the representation itself it is contained in the
vacuum state this procedure for constructing the gnsschrdinger representation for quantum mechanics has
also been generalized to scalar fields on arbitrary curved
space in 8 note however that so far the treatment has
all been kinematical without any knowledge of a hamiltonian for the simple harmonic oscillator of mass m
and frequency  there is a natural
q choice compatible

and


v   q  e d2 q2 q  


with the dynamics given by d 
m   in which some
calculations simplify for instance for coherent states
but in principle one can use any value of d

the hilbert space structure is introduced by the definition of an algebraic state a positive linear functional
3

as happens with the standard lebesgue measure but
on the other hand the measure that for any finite value
of d is a gaussian becomes more and more spread
it is important to note that in this limit the operators
  become discontinuous with respect to  given that
for any given 1 and 2 different its action on a given
basis vector  q yields orthogonal vectors since the
continuity of these operators is one of the hypotesis of
the stonevon neumann theorem the uniqueness result
does not apply here the representation is inequivalent
to the standard one
let us now analyze the other operator namely the
action of the operator v  on the basis  q

our study will be simplified by focusing on the fundamental entities in the hilbert space hd  namely those
states generated by acting with  on the vacuum
0 q  1 let us denote those states by

the inner product between two such states is given by

note incidentally that contrary to some common belief
the plane waves in this gns hilbert space are indeed
normalizable
let us now consider the polymer representation for
that it is important to note that there are two possible
limiting cases for the parameter d i the limit 1d 7 0
and ii the case d 7 0 in both cases we have expressions that become ill defined in the representation or
measure so one needs to be careful

to summarize the resulting theory obtained by taking
the limit 1d 7 0 of the ordinary schrdinger description that we shall call the polymer representation of
type a has the following features the operators u 
are well defined but not continuous in  so there is no
generator no operator associated to q the basis vectors  are orthonormal for  taking values on a continuous set and are eigenvectors of the operator p that is
well defined the resulting hilbert space ha will be the
aversion of the polymer representation let us now
consider the other case namely the limit when d 7 0

8

from this we can indeed construct the representation
by means of the gns construction in order to do that
and to show how this is obtained we shall consider several
expressions one has to be careful though since the limit
has to be taken with care let us consider the measure
on the representation that behaves as

the d 7 0 case

let us now explore the other limiting case of the
schrdingerfock representations labelled by the parameter d just as in the previous case the limiting algebraic
state becomes b  limd0 d such that

so the measures tends to an homogeneous measure but
whose normalization constant goes to zero so the limit
becomes somewhat subtle we shall return to this point
later
let us now see what happens to the inner product
between the fundamental entities in the hilbert space hd
given by 7 it is immediate to see that in the 1d 7 0
limit the inner product becomes
h   id 7 

2

that is continuous on  thus in the limit the operator
p  iq is well defined also note that in this limit
the operator p has  q as its eigenstate with eigenvalue
given by 

the first observation is that from the expressions 5 and
6 for the algebraic state d  we see that the limiting
cases are indeed well defined in our case we get a 
lim1d0 d such that
and

which in the limit 1d 7 0 goes to

the 1d 7 0 case

a    0




b    1

and

b v   0

10

from this positive linear function one can indeed construct the representation using the gns construction
first let us note that the measure even when the limit
has to be taken with due care behaves as

dd   e d2 dq 7 q dq
d 

with  being kroneckers delta we see then that the
plane waves  q become an orthonormal basis for the
new hilbert space therefore there is a delicate interplay
between the two terms that contribute to the measure in
order to maintain the normalizability of these functions
we need the measure to become damped by 1d in order
to avoid that the plane waves acquire an infinite norm

that is as diracs delta distribution it is immediate to
see that in the d 7 0 limit the inner product between
the fundamental states  q becomes
h   id 7 1

11

thus in this new bpolymer representation the hilbert
space hb is the completion with respect to the inner
product 13 of the states generated by taking finite
linear combinations of basis elements of the form  
x
14
bi i q
q 

this in fact means that the vector      belongs
to the kernel of the limiting inner product so one has to
mod out by these and all zero norm states in order to
get the hilbert space
let us now analyze the other operator namely the
action of the operator v  on the vacuum 0 q  1
which for arbitrary d has the form

i

let us now introduce an equivalent description of this
hilbert space instead of having the basis elements be
halfdeltas as elements of the hilbert space where the
inner product is given by the ordinary lebesgue measure
dq we redefine both the basis and the measure we
could consider instead of a halfdelta with support  a
kronecker delta or characteristic function with support
on 



  v   0 q  e d2 q2
the inner product between two such states is given by
1

h   id  e 4d2 

2

in the limit d  0 h   id    we can see then
that it is these functions that become the orthonormal
discrete basis in the theory however the function  q
in this limit becomes ill defined for example for   0
it grows unboundedly for q  2 is equal to one if
q  2 and zero otherwise in order to overcome these
difficulties and make more transparent the resulting theory we shall consider the other form of the representation
in which the measure is incorporated into the states and
the resulting hilbert space is l2 r dq thus the new
state
 q  k  v   0 q

 q  q
these functions have a similar behavior with respect to
the product as the halfdeltas namely  q   q 
  the main difference is that neither  nor their
squares are integrable with respect to the lebesgue measure having zero norm in order to fix that problem we
have to change the measure so that we recover the basic
inner product 13 with our new basis the needed measure turns out to be the discrete counting measure on r
thus any state in the half density basis can be written
using the same expression in terms of the kronecker
basis for more details and further motivation see the
next section
note that in this bpolymer representation both 
and v have their roles interchanged with that of the
apolymer representation while u  is discontinuous
and thus q is not defined in the arepresentation we
have that it is v  in the brepresentation that has this
property in this case it is the operator p that can not
be defined we see then that given a physical system for
which the configuration space has a well defined physical meaning within the possible representation in which
wavefunctions are functions of the configuration variable
q the a and b polymer representations are radically different and inequivalent
having said this it is also true that the a and b
representations are equivalent in a different sense by
means of the duality between q and p representations
and the d  1d duality the apolymer representation
in the qrepresentation is equivalent to the bpolymer
representation in the prepresentation and conversely
when studying a problem it is important to decide from
the beginning which polymer representation if any one
should be using for instance in the qpolarization this
has as a consequence an implication on which variable is
naturally quantized even if continuous p for a and q
for b there could be for instance a physical criteria for
this choice for example a fundamental symmetry could
suggest that one representation is more natural than another one this indeed has been recently noted by chiou
in 10 where the galileo group is investigated and where
it is shown that the b representation is better behaved

12

we can now take the limit and what we get is
lim  q   12 q 

d70

where by  12 q  we mean something like the square
root of the dirac distribution what we really mean is
an object that satisfies the following property
 12 q    12 q   q  
that is if    then it is just the ordinary delta otherwise it is zero in a sense these object can be regarded as
halfdensities that can not be integrated by themselves
but whose product can we conclude then that the inner
product is
z

dq q    
dq  q  q 
h   i

13
which is just what we expected note that in this representation the vacuum state becomes 0 q   12 q 0
namely the halfdelta with support in the origin it is
important to note that we are arriving in a natural way to
states as halfdensities whose squares can be integrated
without the need of a nontrivial measure on the configuration space diffeomorphism invariance arises then in a
natural but subtle manner
note that as the end result we recover the kronecker
delta inner product for the new fundamental states

the operator  is symmetric and the operators 
defines a oneparameter family of unitary operators on
hpoly  where its adjoint is given by      this
action is however discontinuous with respect to  given
that i and   i are always orthogonal no matter
how small is  thus there is no hermitian operator
that could generate   by exponentiation
so far we have given the abstract characterization of
the hilbert space but one would like to make contact
with concrete realizations as wave functions or by identifying the abstract operators  and  with physical operators
suppose we have a system with a configuration space
with coordinate given by q and p denotes its canonical
conjugate momenta suppose also that for physical reasons we decide that the configuration coordinate q will
have some discrete character for instance if it is to
be identified with position one could say that there is
an underlying discreteness in position at a small scale
how can we implement such requirements by means of
the polymer representation there are two possibilities
depending on the choice of polarizations for the wavefunctions namely whether they will be functions of configuration q or momenta p let us the divide the discussion into two parts

in the other polarization namely for wavefunctions
of p the picture gets reversed q is discrete for the arepresentation while p is for the bcase let us end this
section by noting that the procedure of obtaining the
polymer quantization by means of an appropriate limit
of fockschrdinger representations might prove useful in
more general settings in field theory or quantum gravity

polymer quantum mechanics
kinematics

in previous sections we have derived what we have
called the a and b polymer representations in the qpolarization as limiting cases of ordinary fock representations in this section we shall describe without
any reference to the schrdinger representation the abstract polymer representation and then make contact
with its two possible realizations closely related to the a
and b cases studied before what we will see is that one
of them the a case will correspond to the ppolarization
while the other one corresponds to the qrepresentation
when a choice is made about the physical significance of
the variables
we can start by defining abstract kets i labelled by
a real number  these shall belong to the hilbert space
hpoly  from these states we define a generic cylinder
states that correspond to a choice of a finite collection of
numbers i  r with i  1 2     n  associated to this
choice there are n vectors i i so we can take a linear
combination of them

how are then the operators  and  represented note

we see then that the operator v  corresponds precisely
to the shift operator   thus we can also conclude
that the operator p does not exist it is now easy to
identify the operator q with

k

q   p  i

where the sum is over k that labels the intersection points
between the set of labels j  and i  the hilbert
space hpoly is the cauchy completion of finite linear combination of the form 15 with respect to the inner product 16 hpoly is nonseparable there are two basic
operators on this hilbert space the label operator

namely with the abstract operator  the reason we
say that q is discrete is because this operator has as its
eigenvalue the label  of the elementary state  p and
this label even when it can take value in a continuum
of possible values is to be understood as a discrete set
given that the states are orthonormal for all values of
 given that states are now functions of p the inner
product 16 should be defined by a measure  on the
space on which the wavefunctions are defined in order

 i   i
and the displacement operator

that is the basic objects in this representation are kronecker deltas this is precisely what we had found in
sec ii for the btype representation how are now the
basic operators represented and what is the form of the
inner product regarding the operators we expect that
they are represented in the opposite manner as in the
previous ppolarization case but that they preserve the
same features p does not exist the derivative of the kronecker delta is ill defined but its exponentiated version
v  does

to know what these two objects are namely the quantum configuration space c and the measure thereon1 
we have to make use of the tools available to us from
the theory of c  algebras if we consider the operators
v  together with their natural product and relation
given by v    v  they have the structure of
an abelian c  algebra with unit a we know from
the representation theory of such objects that a is isomorphic to the space of continuous functions c 0  on a
compact space  the spectrum of a any representation
of a on a hilbert space as multiplication operator will be
on spaces of the form l2  d that is our quantum
configuration space is the spectrum of the algebra which
in our case corresponds to the bohr compactification rb
of the real line 11 this space is a compact group and
there is a natural probability measure defined on it the
haar measure h  thus our hilbert space hpoly will be
isomorphic to the space

and the operator q that now acts as multiplication has
as its eigenstates the functions  q  q

the answer comes from one of the characterizations of
the bohr compactification we know that it is in a precise
sense dual to the real line but when equipped with the
discrete topology rd  furthermore the measure on rd
will be the counting measure in this way we recover the
same properties we had for the previous characterization
of the polymer hilbert space we can thus write

note that in the ppolarization this characterization corresponds to the aversion of the polymer representation

this completes a precise construction of the btype polymer representation sketched in the previous section note
that if we had chosen the opposite physical situation
namely that q the configuration observable be the quantity that does not have a corresponding operator then
we would have had the opposite realization in the qpolarization we would have had the typea polymer representation and the typeb for the ppolarization as
we shall see both scenarios have been considered in the
literature
up to now we have only focused our discussion on the
kinematical aspects of the quantization process let us
now consider in the following section the issue of dynamics and recall the approach that had been adopted in the
literature before the issue of the removal of the regulator
was reexamined in 6

polymer quantum mechanics
dynamics

as we have seen the construction of the polymer
representation is rather natural and leads to a quantum theory with different properties than the usual
schrdinger counterpart such as its nonseparability the

here we use the standard terminology of configuration space to
denote the domain of the wave function even when in this case
it corresponds to the physical momenta p

7

the more important difference lies in that the system is
constrained
let us return to the case of the particle in a potential and for definiteness let us start with the auxiliary kinematical framework in which q is discrete p
can not be promoted and thus we have to approximate
the kinetic term p2 2m how is this done the standard prescription is to define on the configuration space
c a regular graph 0  this consists of a numerable
set of points equidistant and characterized by a parameter 0 that is the constant separation between
points the simplest example would be to consider the
set 0  q  r  q  n 0   n  z
this means that the basic kets that will be considered
n i will correspond precisely to labels n belonging to
the graph 0  that is n  n 0  thus we shall only
consider states of the form
x
i 
bn n i 
21

nonexistence of certain operators and the existence of
normalized eigenvectors that yield a precise value for
one of the phase space coordinates this has been done
without any regard for a hamiltonian that endows the
system with a dynamics energy and so on
first let us consider the simplest case of a particle of
mass m in a potential v q in which the hamiltonian h
takes the form
h

1 2
p  v q
2m

suppose furthermore that the potential is given by a nonperiodic function such as a polynomial or a rational function we can immediately see that a direct implementation of the hamiltonian is out of our reach for the simple
reason that as we have seen in the polymer representation we can either represent q or p but not both what
has been done so far in the literature the simplest
thing possible approximate the nonexisting term by a
well defined function that can be quantized and hope for
the best as we shall see in next sections there is indeed
more that one can do
at this point there is also an important decision to be
made which variable q or p should be regarded as discrete once this choice is made then it implies that
the other variable will not exist if q is regarded as discrete then p will not exist and we need to approximate
the kinetic term p2 2m by something else if p is to be
the discrete quantity then q will not be defined and then
we need to approximate the potential v q what happens with a periodic potential in this case one would
be modelling for instance a particle on a regular lattice
such as a phonon living on a crystal and then the natural
choice is to have q not well defined furthermore the potential will be well defined and there is no approximation
needed
in the literature both scenarios have been considered
for instance when considering a quantum mechanical
system in 2 the position was chosen to be discrete
so p does not exist and one is then in the a type for
the momentum polarization or the type b for the qpolarization with this choice it is the kinetic term the
one that has to be approximated so once one has done
this then it is immediate to consider any potential that
will thus be well defined on the other hand when considering loop quantum cosmology lqc the standard
choice is that the configuration variable is not defined
4 this choice is made given that lqc is regarded as
the symmetric sector of full loop quantum gravity where
the connection that is regarded as the configuration variable can not be promoted to an operator and one can
only define its exponentiated version namely the holonomy in that case the canonically conjugate variable
closely related to the volume becomes discrete just as
in the full theory this case is however different from the
particle in a potential example first we could mention
that the functional form of the hamiltonian constraint
that implements dynamics has a different structure but

n

this small hilbert space h0  the graph hilbert space
is a subspace of the large polymer hilbert space hpoly
but it is separable the condition for a state of the form
21 to belong to the hilbert space h0 is that the cop
efficients bn satisfy n bn 2  
let us now consider the kinetic term p2 2m we have
to approximate it by means of trigonometric functions
that can be built out of the functions of the form ei p 
as we have seen in previous sections these functions can
indeed be promoted to operators and act as translation
operators on the kets i if we want to remain in the
graph  and not create new points then one is constrained to considering operators that displace the kets
by just the right amount that is we want the basic
shift operator v  to be such that it maps the ket with
label n i to the next ket namely n1 i this can indeed achieved by fixing once and for all the value of the
allowed parameter  to be   0  we have then
v 0   n i  n  0 i  n1 i
which is what we wanted this basic shift operator will
be the building block for approximating any polynomial
function of p in order to do that we notice that the
function p can be approximated by

 p
0 p

  i 0 p
0
p

e   ei 
sin
0

2i0

where the approximation is good for p  0  thus
one can define a regulated operator p0 that depends on
the scale 0 as


v 0   v 0   n i 
2i0
i

n1 i  n1 i
22
20

p0  n i 

in order to regulate the operator p2  there are at least
two possibilities namely to compose the operator p0
8

on a circle for the simple reason that by restricting
ourselves to a regular graph 0  the functions of p that
preserve it when acting as shift operators are of the
form ei m 0 p for m integer that is what we have
are fourier modes labelled by m of period 2 0 in p
can we pretend then that the phase space variable p is
now compactified the answer is in the affirmative the
inner product on periodic functions 0 p of p coming
from the full hilbert space hpoly and given by
z l
1
hppipoly  lim
dp p p
l7 2l l

with itself or to define a new approximation the operator p0  p0 has the feature that shifts the states two
steps in the graph to both sides there is however another operator that only involves shifting once

which corresponds to the approximation p2  2

20
cos0 p valid also in the regime p  0  with
these considerations one can define the operator 0 
the hamiltonian at scale 0  that in practice lives on
the space h0 as

is precisely equivalent to the inner product on the circle
given by the uniform measure

24

with p  0  0  as long as one restricts attention to the graph 0  one can work in this separable
hilbert space h0 of square integrable functions on s 1 
immediately one can see the limitations of this description if the mechanical system to be quantized is such
that its orbits have values of the momenta p that are
not small compared with 0 then the approximation
taken will be very poor and we dont expect neither the
effective classical description nor its quantization to be
close to the standard one if on the other hand one is always within the region in which the approximation can be
regarded as reliable then both classical and quantum descriptions should approximate the standard description
what does close to the standard description exactly
mean needs of course some further clarification in
particular one is assuming the existence of the usual
schrdinger representation in which the system has a behavior that is also consistent with observations if this is
the case the natural question is how can we approximate such description from the polymer picture is there
a fine enough graph 0 that will approximate the system
in such a way that all observations are indistinguishable
or even better can we define a procedure that involves
a refinement of the graph 0 such that one recovers the
standard picture
it could also happen that a continuum limit can be defined but does not coincide with the expected one but
there might be also physical systems for which there is
no standard description or it just does not make sense
can in those cases the polymer representation if it exists provide the correct physical description of the system under consideration for instance if there exists a
physical limitation to the minimum scale set by 0  as
could be the case for a quantum theory of gravity then
the polymer description would provide a true physical
bound on the value of certain quantities such as p in
our example this could be the case for loop quantum
cosmology where there is a minimum value for physical
volume coming from the full theory and phase space
points near the singularity lie at the region where the

that is a well defined symmetric operator on h0  notice that the operator is also defined on hpoly  but there
its physical interpretation is problematic for example
it turns out that the expectation value of the kinetic term
calculated on most states states which are not tailored
to the exact value of the parameter 0  is zero even
if one takes a state that gives reasonable expectation
values of the 0 kinetic term and uses it to calculate the
expectation value of the kinetic term corresponding to
a slight perturbation of the parameter 0 one would get
zero this problem and others that arise when working
on hpoly  forces one to assign a physical interpretation
to the hamiltonian 0 only when its action is restricted
to the subspace h0 
let us now explore the form that the hamiltonian takes
in the two possible polarizations in the qpolarization
the basis labelled by n is given by the functions n q 
qn  that is the wave functions will only have support on the set 0  alternatively one can think of a
state as completely characterized by the fourier coefficients an  q  an  which is the value that the wave
function q takes at the point q  n  n 0  thus
the hamiltonian takes the form of a difference equation
when acting on a general state q solving the time
independent schrdinger equation     e  amounts
to solving the difference equation for the coefficients an 
the momentum polarization has a different structure
in this case the operator p20 acts as a multiplication

the operator corresponding to q will be represented as a

for a generic potential v q it has to be defined by
means of spectral theory defined now on a circle why
9

mapping in a dense subset d of hs where the values of the
functions are well defined recall that in hs the value of
functions at a given point has no meaning since states are
equivalence classes of functions we could for instance
ask that the mapping be defined for representatives of the
equivalence classes in hs that are piecewise continuous
from now on when we refer to an element of the space
hs we shall be refereeing to one of those representatives
notice then that an element of hs does define an element
of cyl  the dual to the space cyl  that is the space
of cylinder functions with support on the finite lattice
  1  2      n  in the following way

approximation induced by the scale 0 departs from the
standard classical description if in that case the polymer quantum system is regarded as more fundamental
than the classical system or its standard wheelerde
witt quantization then one would interpret this discrepancies in the behavior as a signal of the breakdown
of classical description or its naive quantization
in the next section we present a method to remove
the regulator 0 which was introduced as an intermediate step to construct the dynamics more precisely we
shall consider the construction of a continuum limit of
the polymer description by means of a renormalization
procedure
v

q  cyl  c

the continuum limit

such that
this section has two parts in the first one we motivate
the need for a precise notion of the continuum limit of
the polymeric representation explaining why the most
direct and naive approach does not work in the second part we shall present the main ideas and results of
the paper 6 where the hamiltonian and the physical
hilbert space in polymer quantum mechanics are constructed as a continuum limit of effective theories following wilsons renormalization group ideas the resulting
physical hilbert space turns out to be unitarily isomorphic to the ordinary hs  l2 r dq of the schrdinger
theory
before describing the results of 6 we should discuss
the precise meaning of reaching a theory in the continuum let us for concreteness consider the btype representation in the qpolarization that is states are functions of q and the orthonormal basis  q is given by
characteristic functions with support on q   let us
now suppose we have a schrdinger state q  hs 
l2 r dq what is the relation between q and a state
in hpolyx  we are also interested in the opposite question that is we would like to know if there is a preferred
state in hs that is approximated by an arbitrary state
q in hpolyx  the first obvious observation is that a
schdinger state q does not belong to hpolyx since it
would have an infinite norm to see that note that even
when the wouldbe state can be formally expanded in the
 basis as
x
q 
  q

qq  i 

x




n
x
i1

 h  

i  i

note that this mapping could be seen as consisting of two
parts first a projection
p  cyl  cyl such that
p
p    q  i i  i q  cyl  the state
 is sometimes refereed to as the shadow of q on
the lattice  the second step is then to take the inner
product between the shadow  q and the state q
with respect to the polymer inner product h ipoly 
now this inner product is well defined notice that for
any given lattice  the corresponding projector p can be
intuitively interpreted as some kind of coarse graining
map from the continuum to the lattice  in terms of
functions of q the projection is replacing a continuous
function defined on r with a function over the lattice
  r which is a discrete set simply by restricting  to
 the finer the lattice the more points that we have
on the curve as we shall see in the second part of this
section there is indeed a precise notion of coarse graining
that implements this intuitive idea in a concrete fashion
in particular we shall need to replace the lattice  with
a decomposition of the real line in intervals having the
lattice points as end points
let us now consider a system in the polymer representation in which a particular lattice 0 was chosen say
with points of the form qk  r qk  ka0   k  z
namely a uniform lattice with spacing equal to a0  in this
case any schrdinger wave function of the type that we
consider will have a unique shadow on the lattice 0  if
we refine the lattice  7 n by dividing each interval in
2n new intervals of length an  a0 2n we have new shadows that have more and more points on the curve intuitively by refining infinitely the graph we would recover
the original function q even when at each finite step
the corresponding shadow has a finite norm in the polymer hilbert space the norm grows unboundedly and the



where the sum is over the parameter   r its associated norm in hpolyx would be
x
q2poly 
2  


which blows up note that in order to define a mapping
p  hs  hpolyx  there is a huge ambiguity since the
values of the function q are needed in order to expand
the polymer wave function thus we can only define a
10

as the coarse graining map between the dual hilbert
spaces that sends the part of the elements of the dual
basis to zero while keeping the information of the rest

at every scale the corresponding effective theory is
given by the hamiltonian hn  these hamiltonians will
be treated as quadratic forms hn  hcn  r given by

limit can not be taken precisely because we can not embed hs into hpoly  suppose now that we are interested
in the reverse process namely starting from a polymer
theory on a lattice and asking for the continuum wave
function that is best approximated by a wave function
over a graph suppose furthermore that we want to consider the limit of the graph becoming finer in order
to give precise answers to these and other questions we
need to introduce some new technology that will allow us
to overcome these apparent difficulties in the remaining
of this section we shall recall these constructions for the
benefit of the reader details can be found in 6 which
is an application of the general formalism discussed in
9
the starting point in this construction is the concept
of a scale c which allows us to define the effective theories and the concept of continuum limit in our case a
scale is a decomposition of the real line in the union of
closedopen intervals that cover the whole line and do
not intersect intuitively we are shifting the emphasis
from the lattice points to the intervals defined by the
same points with the objective of approximating continuous functions defined on r with functions that are
constant on the intervals defined by the lattice to be
precise we define an embedding for each scale cn from
hpoly to hs by means of a step function

where 2cn is a normalizaton factor we will see later
that this rescaling of the inner product is necessary in
order to guarantee the convergence of the renormalized

is obtained as

and the renormalized hamiltonians are compatible with
each other in the sense that

in order to analyze the conditions for the convergence
in 28 let us express the hamiltonian in terms of its
eigencovectors end eigenvalues we will work with effective hamiltonians that have a purely discrete spectrum
labelled by  hn  cn  ecn cn  we shall also
introduce as an intermediate step a cutoff in the energy
levels the origin of this cutoff is in the approximation
of the hamiltonian of our system at a given scale with
a hamiltonian of a periodic system in a regime of small
energies as we explained earlier thus we can write

m

with n q a characteristic function on the interval
m  man  m  1an  thus the shadows living on
the lattice were just an intermediate step in the construction of the approximating function this function is
piecewise constant and can be written as a linear combination of step functions with the coefficients provided
by the shadows
the challenge now is to define in an appropriate sense
how one can approximate all the aspects of the theory
by means of this constant by pieces functions then the
strategy is that for any given scale one can define an
effective theory by approximating the kinetic operator
by a combination of the translation operators that shift
between the vertices of the given decomposition in other
words by a periodic function in p as a result one has a
set of effective theories at given scales which are mutually
related by coarse graining maps this framework was
developed in 6 for the convenience of the reader we
briefly recall part of that framework
let us denote the kinematic polymer hilbert space at
the scale cn as hcn  and its basis elements as ei cn 
where i  ian  i  1an   cn  by construction this
basis is orthonormal the basis elements in the dual

hilbert space hc
are denoted by i cn  they are also

orthonormal the states i cn have a simple action on

in the presence of a cutoff the convergence of the
microscopically corrected hamiltonians equation 28 is
equivalent to the existence of the following two limits

we clarify that the existence of the above limit means
that ren

11

this hamiltonian quadratic form in the continuum can
be coarse grained to any scale and as can be expected it yields the completely renormalized hamiltonian quadratic forms at that scale however this is not
a completely satisfactory continuum limit because we can
not remove the auxiliary cutoff cutoff  if we tried as
we include more and more eigencovectors in the hamiltonian the calculations done at a given scale would diverge
and doing them in the continuum is just as divergent
below we explore a more successful path
we can use the renormalized inner product to induce

at all will require the tuning of the normalization factors

existence of the limit

a natural action of the eigen covectors in the continuum

examples

in this section we shall develop several examples of
systems that have been treated with the polymer quantization these examples are simple quantum mechanical
systems such as the simple harmonic oscillator and the
free particle as well as a quantum cosmological model
known as loop quantum cosmology

the nature of the physical hilbert space whether it is
isomorphic to the schrdinger hilber space hs  or not is
determined by the normalization factors 2cn which can
be obtained from the conditions asking for compatibility of the dynamics of the effective theories at different
scales the dynamics of the system under consideration
selects the continuum limit
let us now return to the definition of the hamiltonian in the continuum limit first consider the continuum limit of the hamiltonian with cutoff in the sense
of its pointwise convergence as a quadratic form it
turns out that if the limit of equation 32 exists for

that is we are approximating for each scale cn the
sho by a pendulum there is however an important
difference from our knowledge of the pendulum system
we know that the quantum system will have a spectrum
for the energy that has two different asymptotic behaviors the sho for low energies and the planar rotor in
the higher end corresponding to oscillating and rotating
solutions respectively2  as we refine our scale and both
the length of the pendulum and the height of the periodic
potential increase we expect to have an increasing number of oscillating states for a given pendulum system
there is only a finite number of such states thus it
is justified to consider the cutoff in the energy eigenvalues as discussed in the last section given that we only
expect a finite number of states of the pendulum to approximate sho eigenstates with these consideration in
mind the relevant question is whether the conditions for
the continuum limit to exist are satisfied this question
has been answered in the affirmative in 6 what was
shown there was that the eigenvalues and eigen functions of the discrete systems which represent a discrete
and nondegenerate set approximate those of the continuum namely of the standard harmonic oscillator when
the inner product is renormalized by a factor 2cn  12n
this convergence implies that the continuum limit exists
as we understand it let us now consider the simplest
possible system a free particle that has nevertheless the
particular feature that the spectrum of the energy is continuous

at each scale the energy of the particle we can describe
is bounded from above and the bound depends on the
scale note that in this case the spectrum is continuous which implies that the ordinary eigenfunctions of
the hilbert are not normalizable this imposes an upper
bound in the value that the energy of the particle can
have in addition to the bound in the momentum due to
its compactification
let us first look for eigensolutions to the time independent schrdinger equation that is for energy eigenstates in the case of the ordinary free particle these
correspond to constant momentum plane waves of the
ipx
form e   and such that the ordinary dispersion relation p2 2m  e is satisfied these plane waves are
not square integrable and do not belong to the ordinary
hilbert space of the schrdinger theory but they are still
useful for extracting information about the system for
the polymer free particle we have

are still delta functions in the p representation and thus

by the ordinary haar measure on s 1  and there is no
quantization of the momentum its spectrum is still truly
continuous

note that both types of solutions are in the phase space closed
this is the reason behind the purely discrete spectrum the
distinction we are making is between those solutions inside the
separatrix that we call oscillating and those that are above it
that we call rotating

13

let us now consider the time dependent schrdinger
equation

to a massless scalar field  as we shall see a proper
treatment of the continuum limit of this system requires
new tools under development that are beyond the scope
of this work we will thus restrict ourselves to the introduction of the system and the problems that need to be
solved
the system to be quantized corresponds to the phase
space of cosmological spacetimes that are homogeneous
and isotropic and for which the homogeneous spatial
slices have a flat intrinsic geometry k  0 condition
the only matter content is a massless scalar field  in
this case the spacetime geometry is given by metrics of
the form

the wave function p t
in order to check out the convergence of the microscopically corrected hamiltonians we should analyze the
convergence of the energy levels and of the proper covectors in the limit n   ecn  e  p2 2m so
we can be certain that the eigenvalues for the energy
converge when fixing the value of p let us write the

it is easy to see that given any basis vector ei  hcm
the following limit

if as is normally done one chooses  to act as an internal time the right hand side would be promoted in
the quantum theory to a second derivative the left
hand side is furthermore symmetric in a and pa  at

that will be quantized and the variable that will not be
well defined in the polymer representation the standard
choice is that pa is not well defined and thus a and any
geometrical quantity derived from it is quantized furthermore we have the choice of polarization on the wave
function in this respect the standard choice is to select
the apolarization in which a acts as multiplication and
the approximation of pa  namely sin pa  acts as a
difference operator on wave functions of a for details of
this particular choice see 5 here we shall adopt the opposite polarization that is we shall have wave functions
pa  
just as we did in the previous cases in order to gain
intuition about the behavior of the polymer quantized
theory it is convenient to look at the equivalent problem in the classical theory namely the classical system
we would get be approximating the nonwell defined observable pa in our present case by a well defined object
made of trigonometric functions let us for simplicity
choose to replace pa 7 sin pa  with this choice
we get an effective classical hamiltonian constraint that

polymer quantum cosmology

in this section we shall present a version of quantum
cosmology that we call polymer quantum cosmology the
idea behind this name is that the main input in the quantization of the corresponding minisuperspace model is
the use of a polymer representation as here understood
another important input is the choice of fundamental
variables to be used and the definition of the hamiltonian
constraint different research groups have made different choices we shall take here a simple model that has
received much attention recently namely an isotropic
homogeneous frw cosmology with k  0 and coupled

we can now compute effective equations of motion by
means of the equations   f c  for any observable
f  c   and where we are using the effective first
order action

as the polymer wheelerdewitt equation
in order to approach the problem of the continuum
limit of this quantum theory we have to realize that the
task is now somewhat different than before this is so
given that the system is now a constrained system with
a constraint operator rather than a regular nonsingular
system with an ordinary hamiltonian evolution fortunately for the system under consideration the fact that
the variable  can be regarded as an internal time allows
us to interpret the quantum constraint as a generalized
kleingordon equation of the form

with the choice n  1 the first thing to notice is that
the quantity p is a constant of the motion given that
the variable  is cyclic the second observation is that
p
  8 g a3 has the same sign as p and never vanishes
thus  can be used as a n internal time variable the

next observation is that the equation for a  namely
the effective friedman equation will have a zero for a
nonzero value of a given by

this is the value at which there will be bounce if the
trajectory started with a large value of a and was contracting note that the size of the universe when the
bounce occurs depends on both the constant p that
dictates the matter density and the value of the lattice
size  here it is important to stress that for any value
of p that uniquely fixes the trajectory in the a pa 
plane there will be a bounce in the original description
in terms of einsteins equations without the approximation that depends on  there in no such bounce if
  0 initially it will remain negative and the universe
collapses reaching the singularity in a finite proper time
what happens within the effective description if we refine the lattice and go from  to n  2n  the only
thing that changes for the same classical orbit labelled
by p  is that the bounce occurs at a later time and for
a smaller value of a but the qualitative picture remains
the same
this is the main difference with the systems considered
before in those cases one could have classical trajectories that remained for a given choice of parameter 
within the region where sinp is a good approximation to p of course there were also classical trajectories
that were outside this region but we could then refine the
lattice and find a new value  for which the new classical trajectory is well approximated in the case of the
polymer cosmology this is never the case every classical
trajectory will pass from a region where the approximation is good to a region where it is not this is precisely
where the quantum corrections kick in and the universes
bounces
given that in the classical description the original
and the corrected descriptions are so different we expect
that upon quantization the corresponding quantum theories namely the polymeric and the wheelerdewitt will
be related in a nontrivial way if at all

where the operator  is time independent this allows us to split the space of solutions into positive and
negative frequency introduce a physical inner product
on the positive frequency solutions of this equation and
a set of physical observables in terms of which to describe the system that is one reduces in practice the
system to one very similar to the schrdinger case by
taking thepositive square root of the previous equation

   the question we are interested is
  
whether the continuum limit of these theories labelled
by  exists and whether it corresponds to the wheelerdewitt theory a complete treatment of this problem
lies unfortunately outside the scope of this work and
will be reported elsewhere 12

discussion

let us summarize our results in the first part of the
article we showed that the polymer representation of the
canonical commutation relations can be obtained as the
limiting case of the ordinary fockschrdinger representation in terms of the algebraic state that defines the
representation these limiting cases can also be interpreted in terms of the naturally defined coherent states
associated to each representation labelled by the parameter d when they become infinitely squeezed the two
possible limits of squeezing lead to two different polymer
descriptions that can nevertheless be identified as we
have also shown with the two possible polarizations for
an abstract polymer representation this resulting theory has however very different behavior as the standard
one the hilbert space is nonseparable the representation is unitarily inequivalent to the schrdinger one and
natural operators such as p are no longer well defined
this particular limiting construction of the polymer theory can shed some light for more complicated systems
such as field theories and gravity
15

in the regular treatments of dynamics within the polymer representation one needs to introduce some extra
structure such as a lattice on configuration space to construct a hamiltonian and implement the dynamics for the
system via a regularization procedure how does this resulting theory compare to the original continuum theory
one had from the beginning can one hope to remove
the regulator in the polymer description as they stand
there is no direct relation or mapping from the polymer
to a continuum theory in case there is one defined as
we have shown one can indeed construct in a systematic
fashion such relation by means of some appropriate notions related to the definition of a scale closely related
to the lattice one had to introduce in the regularization
with this important shift in perspective and an appropriate renormalization of the polymer inner product at
each scale one can subject to some consistency conditions define a procedure to remove the regulator and
arrive to a hamiltonian and a hilbert space
as we have seen for some simple examples such as
a free particle and the harmonic oscillator one indeed
recovers the schrdinger description back for other systems such as quantum cosmological models the answer
is not as clear since the structure of the space of classical solutions is such that the effective description intro

duced by the polymer regularization at different scales
is qualitatively different from the original dynamics a
proper treatment of these class of systems is underway
and will be reported elsewhere 12
perhaps the most important lesson that we have
learned here is that there indeed exists a rich interplay between the polymer description and the ordinary
schrdinger representation the full structure of such relation still needs to be unravelled we can only hope that
a full understanding of these issues will shed some light
in the ultimate goal of treating the quantum dynamics
of background independent field systems such as general
relativity
