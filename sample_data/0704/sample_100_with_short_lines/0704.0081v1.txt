we discussed quantum deformations of d  4 lorentz and poincar algebras in
the case of poincar algebra it is shown that almost all classical rmatrices of s zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of abelian and jordanian
types a part of twists corresponding to the rmatrices of zakrzewski classification

introduction

the quantum deformations of relativistic symmetries are described by hopfalgebraic
deformations of lorentz and poincar algebras such quantum deformations are classified
by lorentz and poincar poisson structures these poisson structures given by classical
rmatrices were classified already some time ago by s zakrzewski in 1 for the lorentz
algebra and in 2 for the poincar algebra in the case of the lorentz algebra a complete
list of classical rmatrices involves the four independent formulas and the corresponding
quantum deformations in different forms were already discussed in literature see 3 4 5
6 7 in the case of poincar algebra the total list of the classical rmatrices which satisfy
the homogeneous classical yangbaxter equation consists of 20 cases which have various
numbers of free parameters analysis of these twenty solutions shows that each of them
can be presented as a sum of subordinated rmatrices which almost all are of abelian
and jordanian types a part of twists corresponding to the rmatrices of zakrzewski
classification are given in explicit form

here entering the parameter deformation  is a matter of convenience
it is easy to verify that the twotensor 27 indeed satisfies the homogenous classical yangbaxter
equation 21 with   0 if the elements x  y   0 1     n are subject to the relations 28

where   12 ln1  y0 3
let r be an arbitrary rmatrix of g we denote a support of r by supr4  the
following definition is useful
definition 21 let r1 and r2 be two arbitrary classical rmatrices we say that r2 is
subordinated to r1  r1  r2  if r1 supr2   0 ie
r1 x  x  1  1  x r1   0 

x  supr2  

210

if r1  r2 then r  r1  r2 is also a classical rmatrix see 15 the subordination
enables us to construct a correct sequence of quantizations for instance if the rmatrix
of jordanian type 27 is subordinated to the rmatrix of abelian type 22 ra  rj 
then the total twist corresponding to the resulting rmatrix r  ra  rj is given as follows
fr  frj fra 

211

the further definition is also useful
definition 22 a twisting twotensor fr  of a hopf algebra satisfying the conditions
24 and 25 is called locally rsymmetric if the expansion of fr  in powers of the
parameter deformation  has the form
fr   1  c r  o 2    

212

where r is a classical rmatrix and c is a numerical coefficient c 6 0
it is evident that the abelian twist 23 is globally rsymmetric and the twist of jordanian
type 29 does not satisfy the relation 212 ie it is not locally rsymmetric

quantum deformations of lorentz algebra

the results of this section in different forms were already discussed in literature see
3 4 5 6 7
the classical canonical basis of the d  4 lorentz algebra o3 1 can be described
by antihermitian six generators h e  h  e  satisfying the following nonvanishing
commutation relations5 
h e   e 
h e   e

and moreover

34

the corresponding twists for lie algebras sln son and sp2n were firstly constructed in the
papers 10 11 12 13
p
4
the support supr is a subalgebra of g generated by the elements xi  yi  if r  i xi  yi 
5
since the real lie algebra o3 1 is standard realification of the complex lie sl2 c these relations
are easy obtained from the defining relations for sl2 c ie from 31

a complete list of classical rmatrices which describe all poisson structures and generate
quantum deformations for o3 1 involve the four independent formulas 1
r1   e  h 

35

r2   e  h  e  h   2 e  e

r3   e  e  e  e    e  e  e  e   2 h  h 

r4   e  e  e  e  2h  h  e  e 

37
38

if the universal rmatrices of the quantum deformations corresponding to the classical
rmatrices 3538 are unitary then these rmatrices are antihermitian ie
rj  rj

j  1 2 3 4 

39

therefore the operation 34 should be lifted to the tensor product o3 1  o3 1
there are two variants of this lifting direct and flipped namely
x  y  x  y 

  direct 

310

x  y  y   x

  flipped 

311

we see that if the direct lifting of the operation 34 is used then all parameters in
3538 are pure imaginary in the case of the flipped lifting 311 all parameters
in 3538 are real
the first two rmatrices 35 and 36 satisfy the homogeneous cybe and they are
of jordanian type if we assume 310 the corresponding quantum deformations were
described detailed in the paper 6 and they are entire defined by the twist of jordanian

for the rmatrix 36 it should be recalled that the twists 312 and 313 are not
locally rsymmetric a locally rsymmetric twist for the rmatrix 35 was obtained in
14 and it has the following complicated formula

the last two rmatrices 37 and 38 satisfy the nonhomogeneous modified cybe
and they can be easily obtained from the solutions of the complex algebra o4 c

the classical rmatrix r3  37 and r4  38 in terms of the complex basis 316 317
take the form

321

r4  4 e1  e2
for the sake of convenience we introduce parameter6  in r4  it should be noted that
r3  r3 and r4  r4 are themselves classical rmatrices we see that the rmatrix r3 is simply
a sum of two standard rmatrices of sl2 c satisfying the antihermitian condition
r   r analogously it is not hard to see that the rmatrix r4 corresponds to a belavindrinfeld triple 15 for the lie algebra sl2 c  sl2 c indeed applying the cartan
automorphism e2  e2  h2  h2 we see that this is really correct see also 16
we firstly describe quantum deformation corresponding to the classical rmatrix r3
320 since the rmatrix r3 is abelian and it is subordinated to r3 therefore the algebra
o3 1 is firstly quantized in the direction r3 and then an abelian twist corresponding
to the rmatrix r3 is applied we introduce the complex notations z     it


should be noted that z  z
if the parameters  and  are real and z  z
if
the parameters  and  are pure imaginary from structure of the classical rmatrix r3
it follows that a quantum deformation ur1 o3 1 is a combination of two qanalogs of
usl2 c with the parameter qz and qz  where qz  exp z  thus ur3 o3 1

we can reduce this parameter  to  21 by automorphism of o4 c

in this case the coproduct r1 and antipode sr1 for the generators qzh

and there exit two liftings direct and flipped namely

329

330

for any a  b  ur3 o3 1  ur3 o3 1 where the direct involution corresponds to
the case of the pure imaginary parameters   and the flipped involution corresponds
to the case of the real deformation parameters   it should be stressed that the hopf
structure on ur3 o3 1 satisfy the consistency conditions under the involution
r3 a   r3 a

331

now we consider deformation of the quantum algebra ur3 o3 1 secondary quantization of uo3 1 corresponding to the additional rmatrix r3  320 since the
generators h1 and h2 have the trivial coproduct
r3 hk   hk  1  1  hk

332

therefore the unitary twotensor
fr  fr1

333

satisfies the cocycle condition 24 and the unital normalization condition 25 thus
the complete deformation corresponding to the rmatrix r3 is the twisted deformation of
ur3 o3 1 ie the resulting coproduct r3 is given as follows
r3 x  fr1 r1 xfr1

and in this case the resulting antipode sr3 does not change sr3  sr  applying the

next we describe quantum deformation corresponding to the classical rmatrix r4
321 since the rmatrix r4   r4 is a particular case of r3     r3  namely
r4   r3    0    therefore a quantum deformation corresponding to the rmatrix r4 is obtained from the previous case by setting   0    and we have the
following formulas for the coproducts r4

where we set   
consider the twotensor

345

using properties of qexponentials see 17 is not hard to verify that fr4 satisfies the cocycle equation 24 thus the quantization corresponding to the rmatrix r4 is the twisted

quantum deformations of poincare algebra

the poincar algebra p3 1 of the 4dimensional spacetime is generated by 10 elements
the sixdimensinal lorentz algebra o3 1 with the generators mi  ni i  1 2 3
mi  mj   ijk mk  mi  nj   ijk nk  ni  nj   ijk mk 

41

and the fourmomenta pj  p0 j  1 2 3 with the standard commutation relations
mj  pk   jkl pl

42

nj  pk   jk p0 

nj  p0   pj

the physical generators of the lorentz algebra mi  ni i  1 2 3 are related with the
canonical basis h h  e  e as follows
h  n3 

e  n1  m2 

44

h  m3 

e  n2  m1 

45

the subalgebra generated by the fourmomenta pj  p0 j  1 2 3 will be denoted by p
and we also set p  p0  p3 
s zakrzewski has shown in 2 that each classical rmatrix r  p3 1  p3 1 has
a decomposition
r abc 
46
where a  p  p b  o3 1  p c  o3 1  o3 1 satisfy the following relations

here   means the schouten bracket moreover a total list of the classical rmatrices
for the case c 6 0 and also for the case c  0 t  0 was found7 it was shown that
there are fifteen solutions for the case c  0 t  0 and six solutions for the case c 6 0
where there is only one solution for t 6 0 thus zakrzewski found twenty rmatrices which
satisfy the homogeneous classical yangbaxter equation t  0 in 49 analysis of these
twenty solutions shows that each of them can be presented as a sum of subordinated rmatrices which almost all are of abelian and jordanian types therefore these rmatrices
correspond to twisted deformations of the poincar algebra p3 1 we present here
rmatrices only for the case c 6 0 t  0

therefore the total twist defining quantization in the direction to this rmatrix is the
ordered product of two the abelian twits

classification of the rmatrices for the case c  0 t 6 0 is an open problem up to now

the fifth rmatrix r5 is the rmatrix of the lorentz algebra 36 and the corresponding twist is given by the formula 313
