abstract we report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the
first round of the mock lisa data challenges mldc for white dwarf binaries we
implemented an endtoend pipeline consisting of a gridbased coherent preprocessing
unit for signal detection and an automatic markov chain monte carlo postprocessing
unit for signal evaluation we demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent
approach is secure and accurate and is increased in accuracy and supplemented
with additional information on the signal parameters by our markov chain monte
carlo approach we also demonstrate that the markov chain monte carlo routine is
additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of
interest

1 introduction
the data obtained from lisa 1 will contain a large number of white dwarf binary
systems across the whole observational window 2 at frequencies below  3 mhz the
sources are so abundant that they produce a stochastic foreground whose intensity
dominates the instrumental noise 3 the closer and louder sources will still be
sufficiently bright to be individually resolvable above  3 mhz the sources become
sufficiently sparse in parameter space and in particular in the frequency domain that
the detectable sources become individually resolvable the identification of white dwarfs
in the lisa data set represents one of the most interesting analysis problems posed by
the mission the total number of signals in the data set is unknown the effective noise

level affecting the measurements is not easily estimated from the data streams and
there is a large number of overlapping sources to the limit of confusion
bayesian inference provides a clear framework to tackle such a problem 4 5 6
some of us have carried out exploratory studies and proof of concept analyses
on simplified problems that have demonstrated that bayesian techniques do indeed
show good potential for lisa applications 11 10 12 similarly other authors have
successfully implemented techniques using bayesian inference 18 17 16 in this paper
we present the first results of an endtoend analysis pipeline developed in the context of
the mock lisa data challenges that has evolved from our earlier work this pipeline
is applied to the simplest singlesource challenge data sets 111a and 111b and all the
results presented here are obtained after the release of the key files in a companion
paper 19 we present results that we have obtained for the analysis of the data sets
containing gravitational radiation from a massiveblackhole binary inspiral our group
submitted an entry for the mldc analysing the blind data set 111c 13 14 however
that result suffered from the fact that the pipeline was not complete the analysis code
was inefficient and we encountered hardware problems with the beowulf cluster used to
perform the analysis
the results that we present here are obtained with a twostage endtoend analysis
pipeline i we first process the data set with a gridbased coherent algorithm to identify
candidate signals ii we then follow up the candidate signals with a markov chain
monte carlo code to obtain probability density function on the model parameters our
method differs from other mcmc methods that have been proposed and applied to
the mldc data in the context of white dwarf binaries 18 17 16 the mcmc is not
used to search but only in the final stage of the analysis to produce posterior density
functions of the model parameters the noise spectral level is included as one of the
unknown parameters and is estimated together with the parameters of the gravitational
wave sources
2 analysis method
in this section we describe the two stage approach that we have adopted for the analysis
the signal produced by a white dwarf binary system is modelled as monochromatic in
the source reference frame following the conventions adopted in the first mldc 7 8 9
it is described by 7 parameters ecliptic latitude e and longitude e  inclination  and
polarisation angle  frequency at a reference time f0 and corresponding overall phase
0 and amplitude a
the data distributed for the mldc are the three tdi v15 michelson observables
x y and z  from those we construct the two orthogonal tdi outputs

by diagonalizing the noise covariance matrix following the procedure presented in 23
the noise affecting the channels a and e is uncorrelated and described by the onesided
noise spectral density sn f  we model the lisa response function in the low frequency
limit in order to improve the computational efficiency of our analysis
21 first stage grid based search
the first stage of the pipeline consists of a fast search of the data for the best
matched filter based on the wellknown f statistic algorithm first developed for triaxial
pulsar signals in the context of groundbased observations 20 this exploits the fast
fourier transform to perform matching in the frequency domain to templates which are
generated at an array of fixed points in the parameter space

likelihood as a measure of match as given by log l  d

the scalar product as defined in 20 a single signal in the f statistic algorithm is
reparameterised as a linear function of four orthogonal variables and the frequency
f0  the detection statistic is based on four parameters af  bf  cf and df  found by
integrating over the response functions at and bt to the two polarisation states of
the gravitational wave signal 20

t is the phase of the gravitational wave signal as is described in 22
as the lisa array moves in space the frequency f0 is affected by doppler
modulations this modulation changes with differing position of the source in the sky
implying the need to recalculate the modulations and thus at and bt for each sky
position that is tested  a significant factor in the performance of this approach the
differing modulation structure however also allows us to estimate the location of the

source in the sky by maximising the 2f value the resolution possible on the sky with
this method is not as good as from a full bayesian posterior probability calculation as
performed in the parameter estimation stage as shown in an example for challenge
111a in figure 1 nevertheless since this statistic can be computed fairly quickly it
serves as a useful way of finding initial values to feed into the mcmc routine as adopted
within the pipeline the resolution achievable on the sky increases with frequency which
implies that the mismatch between filter and signal falls off more rapidly at higher
frequencies requiring a greater number of templates to cover the sky therefore for
challenge 111b at f  3 mhz a sky grid of size 5752 points was used in comparison
with 765 points for challenge 111a at f  1 mhz
the f statistic search was implemented using the ligo lalapps suite of software
24 in which the pulsar search code was modified by reinhard prix and john whelan
to use the lisa response function for the tdi variables x y  and z 21 these input
data streams were given in the form of short fourier transforms each of length one day
created from the mldc1 challenge data for each challenge the full specified range of
frequencies was searched for the signal as it would be in a blind search the code was
run on a single cpu and executed in a few hours with the runtime increasing at higher
frequency due to the higher resolution of sky and frequency grid that had to be used
the candidate chosen to pass to the mcmc stage was simply that which triggered the
highest value of 2f

distribution is multimodal and nongaussian and has a poor resolution in comparison
with that can be achieved with the mcmc and a bayesian likelihood but by finding the
maximum it serves well as a starting point for the more refined parameter estimation

we implemented an automatic random walk metropolis sampler stroeer 
vecchio 2007 in prep to sample from the posterior probability density function in
form of a markov chain metropolis sampling eliminates the need to explicitly calculate
the normalisation constant in bayes theorem and the evolving markov chain gives
easy access to joint as well as marginalised posterior density distribution the sampler
was started from the parameter set which triggered the highest value of 2f in our grid
based coherent run of the analysis see former section the automated function of the
metropolis sampling is achieved by controlling the sampling stepsize with adaptive
acceptance probability techniques 26 the sampler therefore does not depend on
assumptions about the signal in the data set in order to perform successfully and reliably
it develops a suitable algorithm and approach by itself based on the properties of the
likelihood as found on the fly in the initial steps of the sampler the length of our
markov chain was preset to 106  with the initial 104 chain states discarded as the
burnin phase of our sampler the runtime for one data analysis run is 5 hours on a
single 2 ghz cpu on the tsunami cluster of the university of birmingham

we found that the most promising candidate signal from the f statistic search already
matched the true embedded signal to high accuracy particularly in frequency and
sky location our mcmc sampler as a postprocessing unit thus only needed 1000
iterations to burn in and to establish a reliable sampling from the posterior the
marginalised posteriors are shown in figs 2 and 3 we found as seen in latter
figures that the mcmc sampler further refined the initial guesses from the f statistic
as measured by the absolute difference between the true value of a given parameter
and the median of the marginalised posterior recovered for that parameter table 1

4 conclusions
we have presented a new approach to lisa data analysis in the form of an endtoend
pipeline we first detected and identified candidate signals in the lisa data stream with
a gridbased coherent algorithm and then postprocessed the most promising candidate
signals with an automatic markov chain monte carlo code to obtain probability
densities for the models parameters we demonstrated successful identification and
postprocessing of the signals from the double white dwarf single source mldc data
sets 111a and 111b furthermore the automatic markov chain monte carlo code
successfully identified the noise level within a small frequency window of interest in
these data sets we note that a parallel approach to the data analysis of binary inspiral
signals is being developed by rver et al with a markov chain monte carlo method
that can successfully postprocess a candidate signal generated from the true parameters
of the signal signal detection in a preprocessing stage is currently being tested within
parallel tempered mcmc methods andor timefrequency analyses 19
we identify two prominent and promising features of our pipeline its ability to
determine good initial conditions for the mcmc and its ability to run the mcmc
automatically as we have demonstrated in this paper the width of the marginalised
posterior density for the frequency parameter is extremely narrow it is therefore vital
that the initial estimate of the frequency is within this region as the almost flat structure
of the posterior pdf outside this region gives little to no information on the location of
the peak the chances of finding the mode through a random sampling are decreased
further still with a larger prior range for the parameter adding an f statistic search as
the first stage in the pipeline solves this problem since the frequency and position in the
sky are recovered very accurately to within the limits of the posterior probability region
of interest before the mcmc performs postprocessing and parameter estimation the
automatic feature of the mcmc ensures a successful postprocessing for the other
astrophysical parameters that may have been located outside the posterior region of
interest by the f statistic approach as in the case for the amplitude of challenge
111a convergence is aided by the ability of our code to increase or decrease sampling
stepsizes according to its experience of the sampling quality of the posterior during the
burnin phase
we are working on an extension of the pipeline as shown in this document to
successfully tackle multisource data sets required for the second round of the mldc
current work includes the exploration of our gridbased coherent search on such data
streams in order to automatically identify the most promising individual candidate
signals and the implementation of an automatic reversible jump markov chain monte

carlo routine eg as already demonstrated in 10 to find the transdimensional
probability density functions of the parameters of an unknown total number of signals
we highlight that the noise level determination presented here already serves as a key
ingredient to round 2 where the simulation of a galactic white dwarf binary population
introduces additional confusion noise levels from unresolvable sources
