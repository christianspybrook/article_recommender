abstract serre obtained the padic limit of the integral fourier coefficients of modular
forms on sl2 z for p  2 3 5 7 in this paper we extend the result of serre to weakly
holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on 0 4n  for n  1 2 4 the proof
is based on linear relations among fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral
weight as applications of our main result we obtain congruences on various modular
objects such as those for borcherds exponents for fourier coefficients of quotients of
eisentein series and for fourier coefficients of siegel modular forms on the maass space

1 introduction and statement of main results
serre obtained the padic limits of the integral fourier coefficients of modular forms on
sl2 z for p  2 3 5 7 see thorme 7 and lemma 8 in 20 in this paper we extend
the result of serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on 0 4n
for n  1 2 4 the proof is based on linear relations among fourier coefficients of modular
forms of half integral weight as applications of our main result we obtain congruences
for various modular objects such as those for borcherds exponents for fourier coefficients
of quotients of eisentein series and for fourier coefficients of siegel modular forms on the

that the genus of 0 4n is zero if and only if 1  n  4 let m 1 0 4n be the space

it remains to check that re 4n is an isomorphism since there exists no holomorphic

since z  1 mod 2 theorem 31 implies that af 2b  n  0 mod p



to apply theorem 44 we need the following two propositions
proposition 45 proposition 32 in 22 suppose that p is an odd prime k and n are
integers with n p  1 let
x
f z 
anq n  m 1 0 4n

suppose that   cp2 d  with ac  0 then there exist n0  h0  n with h0 n a sequence

proposition 46 proposition 51 in 1 suppose that p is an odd prime such that p  n
and consider

anq n  s 1 0 4npj   lq for each j  n

n1

suppose further that p  ol is any prime ideal with pp and that an is pintegral for
every integer n  1 then there exists gz  s  1 0 4n  ol q such that
2

gz  gz mod p
where

   12 pj  pe p  1 with en large

remark 47 proposition 46 was proved for p  5 in 1 one can check that this holds
also for p  3
now we prove theorem 1
proof of theorem 1 take

using properties of etaquotients see 12 note that gp z vanishes at every cusp of
0 16 except  if p  2 and vanishes at every cusp ac of 0 4np2  with p2  n if p  3
thus proposition 45 implies that there exist positive integers l m k such that

if p  2
f upm zgp zl  sk 1 0 16

f upm zgp zl  sk 1 0 4p2 n
2

if p  3

note that k   mod p  1 using proposition 46 we can find
f z  sk  1 0 4n
2

such that f z  f zupm gp zl  f upm z mod p and k   k mod p  1
theorem 44 implies that there exists a positive integer b such that f up2b z  0
mod p thus we have shown so far that if   p  p2  all the fourier coefficients of
1

 f zupm2b are pintegral repeat this argument to complete our claim

42 proof of theorem 2 theorem 2 can be derived from theorem 31 by taking a
special modular form
proof of theorem 2 take a positive integer l and a positive even integer u such that

for large u the residue theorem implies theorem 2 by letting u  2b therefore it
is enough to check a pintegral property of fourier coefficients of f z at each cusp

and f z  ol q q 1  note that p  4n since 1  n  4 and p  5 is a prime

so fourier coefficients of j4n z n12e z and z
completes our claim
