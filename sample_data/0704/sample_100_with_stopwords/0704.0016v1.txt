sciences pobox 918 beijing 100049 pr china abstract in this work we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons cc cc and cc we care fully calculate the nonspectator contributions at the quark level where the cabibbosuppressed diagrams are also included the hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator model our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model however all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent selex measurement this discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the selex collaboration there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored email email email email zhangzxitpaccn allongdemailnankaieducn lixqnankaieducn wangymmailihepaccn introduction the quite large difference of the lifetimes between d and d 0 and the lifetimes close to each other for b and b 0 are well explained by taking into account the nonspectator effects1 this success implies that the mechanism which governs the reactions at quark level is well understood when we apply the mechanism to the heavy baryon case some problems emerge the famous puzzle in the heavyflavor field that the lifetime of b is remarkably shorter than that of b meson is much alleviated recently when the operators of higher dimensions are taken into account2 3 the more recent experimental value of the ratio b b 0 1041 00574 is close to the theoretical evaluation3 however in the theoretical works one can notice that the evaluation of hadronic matrix elements is still very rough and based on some approximations the possible errors brought up by the uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements are still uncontrollable in our recent work5 we find that the shortdistance contributions to the branching ratio of b which is evaluated in the pqcd approach are much smaller than that from longdistance effects therefore even though one has a full reason to believe that the lowenergy qcd should solve the discrepancy if it exists he must find a proper way to deal with the hadronic matrix elements the observation of doubly charmed baryon cc by the selex collaboration at fermilab6 provides an opportunity to investigate the hidden problems hopefully the study may shed some lights on the unknown nonperturbative qcd effects which result in obvious difference between baryons and mesons because cc contains two heavy quarks by the heavy quark effective theory hqet the situation may become relatively simple and clear compared to the case of b or c which possesses only one heavy quark thus a careful study on the cc is necessary and interesting several groups already investigated the twoheavyflavor baryons a long time ago7 8 in their work the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements is based on the quarkdiquark structure of the baryons this is definitely reasonable it is believed that two heavy quarks can constitute a more stable and compact colorantitriplet diquark9 however since charm quark even bquark is not so heavy that the degree of freedom of the light flavor can be ignored the diquark scenario may bring up certain errors especially when evaluating lifetimes of baryons because only inclusive processes are concerned in this work we do not use the diquark picture but instead adopt a simpler nonrelativistic model for the baryon and reevaluate the hadronic matrix elements as a byproduct one can compare the results by the diquark picture with that by the three valencequark picture it may help us to better understand the diquark picture and its application range the advantage is obvious that we only concern the inclusive processes in terms of the optical theorem when calculating the lifetime therefore we do not need to deal with the hadronization to light hadrons the only nonperturbative effects come from the wave function of the heavy baryon moreover since there are two heavy quarks in the baryon the relativistic effects are not so significant and the framework of nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator model might lead to a reasonable result moreover at the quark level we carry out similar calculations as that in the literature but we keep some new operators which are ckm suppressed and contribute to the lifetime they appear at the nonspectator scattering at order of m3c in heavy quark expansionhqe later our numerical results show that their contributions are indeed very tiny to make any substantial contributions all the concerned parameters in the model are obtained by fitting data therefore we avoid some theoretical uncertainties and obtain reasonable results comparing these results with data we may gain information about the the whole picture our paper is organized as follows in sectionii we derive the formulation for the lifetimes of cc cc and cc which include the nonspectator effects in sectioniii we use a simple model ie the harmonic oscillator to estimate the hadronic matrix elements in sectioniv we present our numerical results along with the values of all the input parameters the last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion formulation for lifetimes of cc cc cc spectator contribution to lifetimes of cc cc cc the lifetime is determined by the inclusive decays thus one can use the optical theorem to obtain the total width lifetime of the heavy hadron by calculating the absorptive part of the forwardscattering amplitude the total width is then written as hq x im d4 xhhq t hq i hhq hq i mhq 2mhq where t t ilef f x lef f 0 and lef f is the relevant effective lagrangian 1mq is the expansion parameter and the nonlocal operator t is expanded as a sum of local operators and the corresponding wilson coefficients include terms with increasing powers of 1mq definitely the lowest dimensional term dominates in the limit mq and it is the dimensionthree operator

where the coefficients ci f depend on the masses of the internal quarks in the loop the coefficient c3 f has been calculated to oneloop order12 13 14 whereas the coefficient c5 f is evaluated at the tree level15 16 vckm is the cabibbokabayashimaskawa mixing matrix elements and g is the gluonic field strength tensor since the third term involves light quarks it can be different for charmed hadrons with various light flavors thus the difference appears at the 1m3c order and in the hadronic matrix elements of fourquark operators the contributions at orders higher than 1m3c are neglected to the lowest order the main contribution comes from the heavy quarkcharm quark decays while the light flavors are treated as spectators the contributions are due to the semileptonic and the nonleptonic decays as follows c s csl csqq qq uds the semileptonic and nonleptonic decay rates of the c quark up to order 1m2c has been evaluated by many authors17 and here we would directly use their results

to invoke concrete phenomenological models to carry out the computations in this work we adopt a simple nonrelativistic model ie the harmonic oscillator20 this model has been widely employed in similar researches21 22 23 24 25 26 in fact an advantage of the calculations of the lifetimes of heavy hadrons is that one does not need to deal with the hadronization process of lighter products quarks or even gluons and the heavy hadrons can be well described by such simple nonrelativistic models and the results are relatively reliable than for light hadron decays ithe inclusive decays of cc

because a reflects the coupling between two charm quarks we set it to be the same as that for j a reflects the coupling of the light quark with these two charm quark thus we can reasonably set it to be the same as a in dmesons with these parameters as input the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons can be evaluated out see tablei if the nonspectator effects are taken into account conclusion and discussion in this work we evaluate the lifetimes of doubly charmed baryons with the nonspectator effects being properly taken into account as argued in the introduction to evaluate the lifetimes the total widths only the inclusive processes are concerned and then the nonperturbative effects are all from the wavefunctions of the doubly charmed baryons due to existence of the two heavy charm quarks the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator model should apply in this case mainly we carefully calculate the contribution of nonperturbative effects to the lifetimes in the model which are closely related to the bound states of the baryons our numerical results indicate that the nonspectator contributions to the lifetimes of cc cc and cc are substantial the nonspectator contributions to the width of cc are mainly from the we diagrams the pi diagrams which contribute are ckm suppressed since the we contribution is constructive therefore the lifetime of cc is much suppressed by contraries for and cc the nonspectator contributions are mainly from the pi diagrams and the net effect is destructive it is noted that for cc there still are cabibbosuppressed we diagrams but for cc there are only pi diagrams therefore the predicted lifetime of cc is larger than that of other two baryons we also employ other values for parameters a a and find that the resultant values can vary within 20 uncertainty our results are cc 025 ps cc 067 ps and cc 021 ps these are generally consistent with the results obtained by kiselev et al7 and guberina et al8 even though they used different models for calculating the hadronic matrix elements concretely they used the diquark picture and attributed the nonperturbative effects into the wavefunction of the diaquark at origin kiselev et al gave cc 016 022 ps cc 040 065 ps and cc 024 028 although all the theoretical predictions based on different models agree with each other they are obviously one order larger than the upper limit of the measured value on the lifetime of cc 0033 ps by the selex collaboration6 this deviation as suggested by some authors may come from experiments28 so far the difference between theoretical predictions and experimental data may imply some unknown physics mechanisms which drastically change the value if the future experiment say at lhcb confirms the measurement of the selex recently several groups have studied the possibility of doubly heavy baryon production at hadron collider lhc and future linear collider ilc29 30 and the effective field theories for two heavy quarks system are also further investigated31 we are expecting the new data from more accurate experiments at lhc and ilc to improve our theoretical framework and determine if there are contributions from new physics beyond the
