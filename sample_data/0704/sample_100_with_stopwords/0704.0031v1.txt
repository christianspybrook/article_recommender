crystal channeling of lhc forward protons with preserved distribution in phase space vm biryukov institute for high energy physics protvino 142281 russia abstract we show that crystal can trap a broad x x y y e distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision this sampledandhold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream in simulations for the 7 tev large hadron collider a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90 of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle we set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency 100fold proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 01 rad this makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the lhc 1 introduction a particle entering the crystal lattice parallel to a major crystallographic direction can be captured and channeled by the lattice along a crystal axis or plane 1 for instance a positive particle can be channeled between adjacent atomic planes in a bent crystal the channeled particles can follow the bend 2 this led to elegant technique of beam steering by bent channeling crystals 3 now experimentally explored over six decades in energy from low mev 4 to 1 tev 5 the technique is used on permanent basis in ihep protvino where crystal systems extract protons from 70 gev main ring with efficiency of 85 at intensity up to 41012 protons using si crystals just 2 mm along the beam 6 bent crystals channel in good agreement with predictions up to the highest energies 69 crystal applications at the 7tev large hadron collider are considered for beam collimation and extraction 10 and in situ calibration of cms and atlas calorimeters 11 in another proposal crystal could capture the particles emerging from the interaction point ip with small angles and channel them out of the beam 12 this could help to improve on measurement of small angle elastic and quasielastic scattering in cms and atlas where lower momentum transfers might become available for pp elastics scattering and lower proton momentum losses for diffractive physics 12 groups in both cms with totem and atlas would like to add very forward proton detectors 420 m downstream on both sides a project fp420 13 by detecting protons that have lost less than 1 of their longitudinal momentum a rich qcd electroweak higgs and bsm program becomes accessible with the potential to make measurements which are unique at lhc and difficult even at a future linear collider 13 the measurement of the displacement x and angle x in the horizontal plane of the outgoing protons relative to the beam allows the momentum loss pp and transverse momentum of the scattered protons to be reconstructed protons emerging from diffractive scattering at lhc have very small emission angles 10150 rad and fractional momentum loss 108 01 hence they are very close to the beam and can only be detected in the roman pots downstream if their displacement at the detector location is large enough to escape the beam halo 13 2 crystal efficiency as practice shows crystal can go into a very limited space and get particles from there 6 most efficient crystal applications are based on so called multipass mode where particles can encounter a crystal many times in the ring 614 there are also successful experimental demonstrations of highly efficient channeling in a single pass with efficiency up to 60 at cern sps 15 throughout this paper we consider only a singlepass channeling we show with simulations that at the lhc a crystal can efficiently channel forward protons for channeling simulations we apply a monte carlo code catch 16 successfully used for prediction of experiments at cern sps 9 ihep u70 6 tevatron 7 rhic 8 and kek 17 and crystal applications at the lhc 1011 crystal capture is very selective in angle the critical angle c within which the capture is possible is as small as about 5 rad e12tev at a high energy e in silicon 110 planes proton divergence of 150 rad is almost 100 times c at 7 tev therefore it is not possible to capture all these protons by a plain crystal however we can suggest an efficient solution benefiting from the fact that all diffractively scattered protons originate from a small region at the ip for standard lhc optics with beta function value at the ip 055 m the beam size at the ip is beam16 m rms the spread in the transverse position of the vertex point where outgoing protons originate from is determined by the rms spread of the beam and equals beam2 13 as protons emerge from diffractive scattering at lhc with emission angles up to 150 rad and interaction width beam2 the emittance of the beam to be trapped by a crystal is 2 radmm only this corresponds to the acceptance of a si crystal of 1 mm transverse size the match of the diffractiveprotons emittance to the crystal acceptance means that the particles could be httpmailiheprubiryukov trapped and channeled efficiently to realize this one has to match the crystal design and location to the application for the lhc scenario with high luminosity we find the most efficient design to be a crystal with a pointtoparallel focusing entry face focusing crystal proposed by ai smirnov in 1985 has a face shaped so that the tangents to the crystal planes cross at a focus line at some distance lf from the crystal 3 this kind of crystal was successfully tested at ihep where it efficiently trapped a beam of 2 mrad divergence or 100 times c 18 the crystal traps protons emerging from the focus line uniformly from all the angular range if the entry face has a proper shape 18 we find that for most efficient channeling in the lhc the focus distance lf of this crystal should be equal to the effective distance leff between the crystal location and the ip in a drift space leff is geometrical distance in accelerator lattice leff c12sin where c is value at the crystal and is the phase advance from the ip to the crystal a plain crystal with a flat entry face has lf in simulations with the low optics settings a focusing crystal shows best efficiency if installed at a location with effective distance leff 15 m from the ip it can be a si 110 or 111 crystal of 015 mradleff 25 mm transverse size in order to capture efficiently all diffractive protons simulation predicts that a focusing si110 crystal with lfleff traps 90 of 7 tev protons emerging from the ip in the angular range of 150 rad width into channeling mode the efficiency figure is almost independent of the crystal location provided leff 15 m the reason for high efficiency at high leff is that at a distance leff from the ip any point at the crystal entry face sees the beam source of size at the ip at an angle of leff channeling efficiency reduces by a factor of about 1leffc212 3 the reduction in efficiency by a factor of 122l2effc2 becomes negligible for l2eff 22c2 4c2 where is beam emittance with 055 m and si110 crystal channeling efficiency saturates for l2eff 4 one more idea for efficient channeling of forward protons in the lhc is that a crystal can be installed with planes parallel to either x or y plane for application it is not critical whether crystal bends protons in horizontal or vertical plane to produce an offset at the detector but the distance leff in accelerator lattice from the ip to the crystal can be very different in x and y planes then channeling efficiency is very different whether crystal traps protons in x or y plane we suggest in this case to install crystal for channeling in the plane with larger leff for instance on the location 200 m downstream of the ip5 cms and some 20 m ahead of the roman pot station at 220 m where crystal could be installed leff 6 m in x and 20 m in y plane according to the analysis above channeling efficiency in y plane should be great while in x plane moderate indeed our simulations for this location show channeling efficiency of 87 in y and only 60 in x plane for 055 m and optimal crystals of si110 a plain si crystal has channeling efficiency in x plane of just 35 or 17 times lower than a si focusing crystal adapted to the lhc lattice for the runin phase of the lhc with 2 m we find that channeling efficiency of 85 can be achieved if crystal is located at leff 30 m downstream of the ip the nominal high luminosity optics of the lhc is not optimized for forward proton detection therefore a possibility to use a channeling crystal can be very helpful as it offers opportunities for diffractive physics studies otherwise inaccessible in the nominal lhc settings the lhc options with a high 1540 and 90 m are devised for the studies of diffractive physics with 1540 m the emittance of diffractively scattered protons increases to 50 radmm this corresponds to the acceptance of a si crystal of 30 mm transverse size such a crystal is not out of question however the problem is where to fit it in the lhc in terms of leff good channeling efficiency requires a location with l2eff 130 m2 in this optics we simulated channeling on the location 200 m from the ip5 in 1540 m optics a 10cm si110 crystal trapped and bent protons 05 mrad in x plane with efficiency of 41 a ge110 crystal shows there 48 efficiency ie comparable to si all figures assumed a perfect match lfleff in crystal a plain si crystal gives efficiency of 1 or 300 times lower than a si focusing crystal adapted to the lhc lattice on this location in 90 m option on the same location the choice of plane is important because leff 10 m in x and 170 m in y plane preferred location should have l2eff 60 m2 so we expect very different efficiencies in x and y planes our simulations give crystal efficiency of 72 in y and only 7 in x plane for 90 m here crystal application is feasible only with bending in vertical plane low efficiency may exclude a crystal use for doublepomeronexchange events pppxp with doublearm reconstruction because the probability to have channeling in both arms in coincidence becomes small eg 41217 for reconstruction of singlediffraction events pppx more detailed studies are required before the benefits or their absence from a crystal use with high options can be understood in this paper we suggest the use of a single crystal for proton extraction from halo and delivery to the detector the use of a 2stage crystal system 12 first crystal for extracting a proton and second one for bending it a big angle would reduce the overall efficiency by a factor of 06 ideally or less the 2nd crystal traps only part of the protons channeled in the 1st one finally we notice that one can filter diffraction events with a crystal instead of trapping all forward protons crystal acceptance can be made smaller and sample eg only the most forward protons emerging from the ip with the angles of a few rad 3 precise transmission in a single x x plane whereas protons are physically delivered from the ip to detector with good efficiency the essential question is whether the information on phase space x x y y e distribution of particles is lost or corrupted while the particles are captured and transmitted in crystal the success of experiments on measuring forward high momentum protons at the lhc depends on the angular precision of proton track reconstruction a plain crystal would destroy the phase space information first by selecting particles from just a single direction and then disturbing the exit angle of particle by coherent and incoherent scattering in crystal plain crystal acceptance is c and crystal accuracy in angle transmission is again c that means a plain crystal traps and delivers about zero bit information on angle distribution in this paper we design a crystal with the acceptance of 100 c and angle transmission accuracy of 01 c although it sounds against the nature of crystal channeling suppose particles are coming with a distribution over x x y y e ideally we would like the crystal to trap all coming particles and preserve their distribution over x x y y e and then shift an angle of each particle towards a physical setup where this distribution can be analyzed in detail one should solve two problems one problem was to trap and bend a beam with a divergence much greater than the critical angle a focusing crystal adapted to the lhc optics solves this problem in simulations a focusing crystal traps with 90 efficiency all protons emerging from the ip with the angular distribution 100 times c notice that the trapped particles fully preserve also their distribution over the angle in the plane orthogonal to the plane of channeling in such a crystal particles are trapped uniformly from a very broad distribution over x and y a bent crystal would transform x x y y at the entrance into x x y y at the exit to do so each trapped particle has to be channeled over the same distance in crystal therefore the shape of the crystal exit face must match the entry face then in a bent crystal each channeled particle receives the same bending angle although the crystal described above can solve the idea of sampling a broad distribution of particles and delivering it to a required destination second problem is how to preserve the sampled distribution x x y y frozen on transmission through the crystal lattice as precise as possible the coordinates x y of particles are obviously preserved in crystal so one should take care of the accuracy in transmission of angles x y only the protons channeled between atomic planes in crystal are disturbed by 1 oscillations in the channeling plane with an amplitude up to c and by 2 scattering on a rarefied electronic gas mostly valence electrons in both planes x and y notice that nuclear scattering will not disturb the sample of transmitted channeled particles as this process is strongly suppressed for channeled positive particles simply saying any particle nuclear scattered would be dechanneled and thus not present in the sample of bent particles that gives us the first idea that partially solves the problem of transmission accuracy the idea is that the information on crystalcaptured particles is very well preserved in one plane eg x x while the particles are trapped and bent in another plane eg y y notice that particle distribution in the plane orthogonal to channeling is favored twice firstly they are easily trapped with a broad angular distribution secondly they are transmitted with a very little scattering information in this plane will be best preserved the opportunity to have perfect data on just one plane is interesting for applications the reconstruction of the higgs boson mass in reaction ppphp requires x x data in horizontal plane only 13 figure 1 the difference in proton angles x and y before and after a si110 crystal oscillations in the channeling plane on the atomic coherent potential are a greater problem fig 1 shows a distribution of the difference in proton angle in x and y planes before and after a channeling in crystal xout xin and yout yin 01 mrad as obtained in simulations for a si110 bent crystal channeling in y plane the accuracy in x transmission in crystal is very good indeed 01 rad rms the width of yout yin 01 mrad distribution is much greater due to oscillations in the potential of si 110 planes 4 precise transmission in both planes to solve the problem of accuracy in the other plane ie the plane of channeling one solution is to use a channel with a lower critical angle for instance si100 instead of 110 or 111 a more universal solution is to use a strongly bent crystal the critical angle c is gradually reduced to zero when the crystal curvature approaches a critical value the strong focusing of a strongly bent crystal suppresses channeling oscillations to any low level needed in the application fig 2 shows the difference in proton angle in x and y planes before and after channeling in a crystal xout xin 01 mrad and yout yin as obtained in simulations for a 2 mm si100 crystal bent 01 mrad the protons were channeled in x plane the rms value of angle smearing found in simulations is 02 rad both for x and y figure 2 the same as in fig 1 but for a strongly bent si 100 crystal this accuracy should be compared to the angular resolution of the detectors downstream of the crystal measuring proton coordinates with 10 m resolution 13 over a base of 8 m as allowed by a drift space would give an angular accuracy of 1410m8m18 rad addition quadratic of crystal transmission accuracies doesnt change this resolution that would be perfect for crystal with a much better resolution on the detector side down to 05 rad the overall resolution becomes 055 rad ie just slightly disturbed crystal transmission in both planes x and y is still almost perfect because of scattering on electronic gas the protons loose energy in crystal in simulations the energy loss and its fluctuations in crystal are ee 107106 ie much smaller than even the nominal energy spread in the lhc beam 11104 energy losses in bent crystals were studied in experiments at cern sps with protons of 450 gev and pb ions of 33 tev where catch predictions were also validated 9 the diffractively scattered protons would have energy spread on the order of 100 gev or ee 15 at the crystal entrance in simulations with 0552 m optics channeling efficiency was completely independent of energy even for ee10 in high options crystal efficiency was uniform within 07 for ee 15 one can say that a phase space distribution x y x y e can be perfectly preserved in crystal and no information is lost on transmission in crystal figure 3 an example of beam space x y at the entrance to the crystal a and at the exit b fig 3 shows an example of a x y plot at the entrance to the crystal a and at the exit of it b where we tried to show how accurately a crystal can transmit a signature in angular space semicircle chosen as a probe the resolution of the image transmitted by a crystal is 02 rad in both planes in terms of the critical channeling angle c the obtained resolution is an order of magnitude finer than c while the size of the trapped and channeled area can be some orders of magnitude greater than c in the applications there is no point to have a crystal transmission too perfect it should match the other sources of inaccuracy like a multiple scattering in the detectors and vacuum chambers etc by tuning crystal parameters in principle one could very much improve in precision of the beam image downstream of the crystal but loose in brightness of the image ie in statistics rate as the efficiency of crystal transmission could be affected finally we suggest another idea for the channeling plane a microscope idea that improves not only the crystal accuracy but even the detector resolution in that plane crystal can magnify beam image in one plane eg transform the entrance values x x y y into exit values x nx  y y the magnification factor n can be as big as 2 or 10 or even 100 and serve the purpose to increase strongly the overall angular resolution in x in the above examples the overall resolution was 1 rad defined by detector resolution with magnification optics the overall inaccuracy in x would be effectively reduced by factor n bringing it below 01 rad rms magnification is realized by making the shape of the crystal exit face different from the entry face with a magnification factor of 10 eg the entry angular opening of 50 rad would correspond to the exit opening of 500 rad 5 conclusion we have shown in simulations that crystal lattice can trap with 90 efficiency a beam with a x y distribution much broader than a critical angle c to achieve that one has to match the crystal focus length to the effective length between the particle source and the crystal in the accelerator lattice crystal adaptation to accelerator lattice improved channeling efficiency up to 300fold crystal can transmit the trapped particles in channeled states with the phase space x x y y e distribution preserved with accuracy an order of magnitude finer than c several solutions were proposed and supported by simulations for achieving a fine resolution in crystal transmission this may give a beam instrument for collision products in colliders usually accelerator beam instruments prepare particles for collision by cooling them bending focusing etc detectors sort out the results of collision we change this a bit by introducing crystal optics between the collision point and detectors a crystal adapted to the lhc lattice can trap with 90 efficiency all protons emerging from the ip with divergence of 150 rad or 100c the trapped protons can be channeled to detectors with precision down to 01 rad rms this makes feasible a crystal application for the measurement of diffractive scattering in cms and atlas at the lhc while we showed the physical capabilities of crystal channeling its actual application in the lhc environment has to take into account many technical considerations to fit into existing infrastructure of accelerator and detectors crystal channeling of lhc forward protons can improve proton acceptance in momentum loss and fourmomentum transfer t both in totem and fp420 and allow to reach the smallest possible value of the scattering angle 9 now the sensitive detector area starts at 1215 from the lhc beam 10 crystal can be placed at 6 from the lhc beam as it is very small cm si and does not provoke beam instability such a crystal can trap and deliver a very useful information on most forward high momentum quasielastic and elastic protons at lhc unavailable otherwise there are practical benefits as well crystal would relax tough requirements on needed for totem crystal may allow totem to run at the early start of the lhc possibly running in parallel to other experiments thanks to crystal fp420 detectors could possibly reside out of the cold region the detectors dont need to be edgeless crystal works best with low where fp420 is interested most if detectors can be more distanced from the beam background conditions may improve for injection the active areas of the detectors must be kept away from the beams and then moved back instead one can move a crystal crystal can be introduced to experiment on a later stage in an attempt to expand the horizons of the physics program references 1 ds gemmel rev mod phys 46 1 1974 2 en tsyganov fnal tm682 1976 as
