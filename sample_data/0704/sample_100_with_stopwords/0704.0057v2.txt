highspin to lowspin and orbital polarization transitions in multiorbital mott systems philipp werner and andrew j millis arxiv07040057v2 condmatstrel 19 sep 2007 columbia university 538 west 120th street new york ny 10027 usa dated june 30 2007 we study the interplay of crystal field splitting and hund coupling in a twoorbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the eg shell we use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures the fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of coulomb repulsion exchange coupling and crystal field splitting we find that the hund coupling can drive the system into a novel mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility away from halffilling the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective mott state pacs numbers 7110fd 7110fd 7128d 7130h the mott metalinsulator transition plays a fundamental role in electronic condensed matter physics 1 much attention has focused on the oneorbital case in part because of its presumed relevance to high temperature superconductivity 2 and in part because appropriate theoretical tools for the multiorbital case have until recently not been available in most mott systems however more than one orbital is relevant 3 and the redistribution of electrons among different orbitals leads to new phenomena such as orbital ordering or orbital selective mott transitions recent studies of nickelates 4 titanates 5 cobaltates 6 manganates 7 vanadates 8 9 10 and ruthenates 3 11 12 13 have focused interest on the interplay between the mott metalinsulator transition and orbital degeneracy a fundamental question in this field relevant in particular to the issue of lattice distortions in strongly correlated materials is the response of multiorbital systems to a perturbation which breaks the orbital degeneracy in this paper we show that a two orbital model with hund coupling and crystal field splitting exhibits two fundamentally different mott phases one characterized by a vanishing orbital susceptibility and one adiabatically connected to the band insulating state we characterize these phases in terms of the atomic ground states multiorbital models are more difficult to study both because of the larger number of degrees of freedom and because the physically important exchange and pairhopping terms are not easy to treat by standard hubbardstratonovich methods 14 weak coupling approaches 12 have been used to show that exchange and pair hopping interactions act to suppress the response to a crystal field splitting and some authors have studied the model without exchange and pair hopping terms 9 but a reliable extension of these results to physically relevant slaterkanamori interactions and the strong coupling regime has been lacking dynamical mean field theory dmft provides a nonperturbative and computationally tractable framework to study correlation effects and has allowed insights into the mott metalinsulator transition 15 in its single site version dmft ignores the momentum dependence of the selfenergy and reduces the original lattice problem to the selfconsistent solution of a quantum impurity model given by the hamiltonian hqi hloc hhyb hbath for multiorbital models hloc jklm cj ck cl cm where m i jklm u m m cm cm denotes both orbital and spin indices and u jklm some general fourfermion interaction hhyb and hbath are the impuritybath mixing and bath hamiltonians respectively while the dmft approximation simplifies the problem enormously replacing a 3 1 dimensional field theory by a quantum impurity model plus a self consistency condition the extra complications associated with exchange couplings in multiorbital systems have until recently prohibited extensive numerical work interesting progress has been made using a finite temperature exact diagonalization technique 6 13 but this approach requires a truncation of hbath to a small number of levels in refs 16 17 we have introduced a continuoustime impurity solver which can handle the general interactions in hloc the method which is free from systematic errors is based on a diagrammatic expansion of the partition function in the impuritybath hybridization hhyb here we employ this solver to study the physically relevant case in which the number of electrons matches the number of orbitals the local hamiltonian is x x hloc n1 n2 12 u n n u n1 n2 u jn1 n2  j1 2 1 2 1 1 hc 1 with

transition is characterized by a jump in filling and a coexistence region where both insulating and metallic solutions exist our data show the region of stability of the metallic phase ju0 ju025 orbitally polarized insulator metal u 2j which follows from symmetry considerations for dorbitals in free space and is also assumed to hold in solids with this choice the hamiltonian 1 is rotationally invariant in orbital space and the condition for halffilling becomes 12 23 u 25 j in the dmft selfconsistency loop we use a semicircular density of states of bandwith 4t bethe lattice the temperature unless otherwise noted is t t 002 and we suppress magnetic order by averaging over spin up and down in each orbital no sign problem is encountered in the simulations the main result is shown in fig 1 which for several values of and ju plots the filling per spin n1 of orbital 1 as a function of interaction strength the half filling nonmagnetic condition implies n2 1 n1 in the t 0 limit three phases are found a metallic phase which may have any value of n1 between 0 and 05 an orbitally polarized insulator favored by large and small j and a mott insulator with n1 05 n2 favored by large u small and large j if u is increased from zero to a small value the orbital splitting either increases small ju or decreases large ju consistent with the findings of ref 12 as interaction strength is further increased one of several things may happen at very small ju n1 continues to decrease and the system eventually undergoes a transition to an orbitally polarized insulator for large essentially a band insulator for somewhat larger ju the occupancy n1 after an initial decrease goes through a minimum and begins to increase at even stronger interactions one then observes a transition either to an orbitally polarized insulator where n1 may take a range of values or into a special type of insulator fig 2 phase diagram in the plane of crystal field splitting and intraorbital coulomb repulsion u for indicated values of ju for j 0 the phase boundary is a monotonic function of whereas for ju 0 it peaks near 2j indicated by the dotted lines the insulating state in the region 2j is characterized by a vanishing orbital susceptibility with n1 05 figure 2 shows the metalinsulator phase diagram in the space of crystal field splitting and coulomb repulsion for several values of ju in the absence of a crystal field splitting 0 we observe a metalinsulator transition at a strongly jdependent critical u this finding is consistent with data presented in ref 18 as is increased the critical u changes for j 0 and fixed u n1 decreases until the band is emptied and a metalinsulator transition occurs the monotonic decrease of the critical u with at j 0 is a special case for j 0 the first effect of a small is to stabilize the metallic phase then at larger a reentrant insulating phase occurs we shall show below that this behavior arises from the unusual nature of the insulating state at j 0 and small which is characterized at t 0 by a strictly vanishing orbital susceptibility if is increased at large u this state makes a transition to an orbitally polarized insulator at 2j we therefore plot in fig 2 the curves 2j as dotted lines and suggest that they correspond to the t 0 phase boundary ju01 005 002 045 t03 t05 t07 035 weight filling of orbital 1 025 015 005 basis state

smaller than c 2j indicated by a vertical line the orbital susceptibility in the t 0 limit is completely suppressed solid lines are for t 50 dotted lines show results for t 125 25 and 100 respectively between two distinct insulating states figure 3 plots the filling of orbital 1 as a function of crystal field splitting for fixed ut and several values of ju the leftmost curve in the upper panel shows the density variation for ju 002 at 0 the model is metallic the rapid variation of n1 with reflects the large but finite orbital susceptibility of the metal which for this small value  of j is strongly enhanced by u at t 0325 2j an apparently first order transition occurs to the orbitally polarized insulating state which then evolves smoothly as is increased to the band insulator n1 0 the two largerj values reveal a different behavior for c 2j the insulating state is characterized by an orbital occupancy which is independent of crystal field splitting then an apparently discontinuous transition occurs to a metallic state with a large orbital susceptibility which at even larger exhibits a first order transition to the orbitally polarized insulating state the lower panel of fig 3 shows the be havior for larger u where the model is always insulating our data for j 0 exhibit a rapid variation of n1 with  the slope is set by the inverse of the kugelkhomskii superexchange t2 u thermal effects are unimportant at t 50 for j 0 and small the model is insulatingwith a vanishing orbital susceptibility then near  2j makes a transition to the orbitally polarized insulating phase with a differential susceptibility n1 determined by kugelkhomskii physics note that the transition between the two insulators is sharp only at t 0 for t 0 a rapid but smooth crossover occurs to gain insight into these phenomena we look at the contribution to the partition function from the different eigenstates of the local hamiltonian hloc has 16 eigenstates which we number essentially as in table ii of ref 17 for the following discussion it is important to note that 6i 7i and 8i are the three spin triplet states with energy u 3j 2 while 10i and 11i are linear combinations of the states 0i and 0i with two electrons in one orbital and none in the other the latter two states are coupled by the pair hopping and affected by the crystal field splitting here we choose them to be eigenstates of hloc corresponding to the eigenenergies u j 2 42 2 1 2 12 0i 0i  j 2 42 2j in particular we choose 10i to be the eigenstate with lower energy figure 4 shows the weights of these states for the three phases found at ut 6 ju 005 see fig 3 in the small phase the triplet states are occupied with small excursions into states with occupancy 1 or 3 we therefore call this phase the triplet mott insulator the triplet states of course have one electron in each orbital and gain no energy from orbital polarization the remarkable fact is that this feature is preserved af orbital 1 075 orbital 2 filling 065 055 fig 5 filling n1 n2 for ut 4 ju 025 and t 04 full open symbols correspond to insulating metallic solutions at halffilling t 35 the system is in a triplet mott insulating state for 39 t 46 in an orbital selective mott state and for t 46 metallic in both bands ter coupling to the lattice in the metallic phase a large number of states is visited while in the orbitally polarized insulator the dominant local state whose weight increases continuously with is a singlet 10i the triplet states are almost completely suppressed in the orbitally polarized phase the largeu insulatorinsulator transition exhibits the same features but without the intermediate metallic phase and is therefore also a transition between high and low spin states comparison of the eigenenergies of the spin triplet states and 10i show that these levels cross at 2j thus the transition from triplet mott insulator to orbitally polarized insula tor occurs at c 2j consistent with our numerical data we also note that the wavefunction of state 10i depends on the ratio j leading in the large limit to n1 j42 in the low spin phase the orbital susceptibility has therefore two contributions one originating from kugelkhomskii physics and one of order j 2 3 from hloc the latter explains the roundings seen in the right most curve of fig 3 we briefly address the issue of the orbital selective mott transition which provides a mechanism for local moment formation in correlated materials and has been the subject of much recent debate 11 previous studies focused on twoorbital models with different bandwidths and integer number of electrons we find that in the presence of a crystal field splitting shifting the chemical potential can drive the system into an orbital selective mott state even if the bandwidths are equal figure 5 shows the filling per spin in both orbitals as a function of for ut 4 ju 025 and t 04 doping occurs first in one of the bands leaving the other in a mott state with a magnetic moment further change of the chemical potential drives the second band metallic in conclusion we have shown that multiorbital impurity models with realistic couplings can be efficiently simulated with the method of ref 17 we have presented numerical evidence based on single site dmft calculations for the existence of two distinct mott insulating phases in a halffilled twoorbital model with hund coupling and crystal field splitting at strong interactions and j 2 the system in the t 0 limit is in a phase characterized by a vanishing orbital susceptibil ity and a spin 1 moment on each site for j 2 an orbitally polarized insulator is found the exchange terms promote insulating behavior at 0 but can stabilize a metallic phase at values of for which the noninteracting model is a bandinsulator it is interesting to compare our results to recent work on the bilayer hubbard model 19 20 the model which these authors study is equivalent to our model with u u j and replaced by the interlayer hopping in the low energy sector of this model only four states essentially our three triplets and the pair hopping state 10i are relevant and what these authors describe as the mott insulator to band insulator crossover corresponds to our transition apparently sharp at t 0 between triplet mott insulator and orbitally polarized insulator the existence of two distinct insulating phases raises many interesting questions including the theory of an insulator with strictly vanishing orbital susceptibility which should exhibit an orbital gauge symmetry and the nature and properties of the different metalinsulator transitions the physics near the triple point remains to be studied our results away from halffilling suggest that lightly doped la2 nio4 is in an orbitally selective mott phase the calculations have been performed on the hreidar beowulf cluster at eth zrich using the alpslibrary 21 we thank m troyer for the generous allocation of computer time
