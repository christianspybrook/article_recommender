source separation time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources the location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of nondestructive testing this article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator the intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network which solves the location problem based on learning from examples locator performance was tested on different test specimens tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen the dimensions of the tested area and the properties of stored data the location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided this is a promising method for nondestructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method i ntroduction acoustic emission ae concerns nondestructive testing methods and is used to locate and characterize developing cracks and defects in material in nondestructive testing of aviation frame structures acoustic emission is a well accepted method 8 the location problem is usually solved by various triangulation techniques based on the analysis of ultrasonic ray trajectories 10 1 3 solving and programming the related equation is rather cumbersome and cannot be simply performed if the structure of the tested specimen is geometrically complicated acoustic emission testing of aircraft structures is a challenging and difficult problem the structures involve bolts fasteners and plates all of which move relative to one another due to differential structural loading during flight the complex geometry of the airframe results in multiple mode conversions of ae source signals compounding the difficulty of relating the source event to the detected signal in order to avoid difficulties with equation solving and programming of the triangulation procedure several empirical approaches based on learning from examples have already been proposed 5 we developed an intelligent locator capable of learning from examples which we therefore called an intelligent locator the purpose of developing the intelligent manuscript generated january 31 2007 locator is to replace information obtained from the analysis of sonic ray trajectories by information obtained directly from simulated ae events on the specimen under test in this way the calibration procedure which has to be performed anyway could be generalized to the training of the intelligent locator the development of such an intelligent locator has been described elsewhere 4 in the locator developed a general regression neural network grnn is employed 9 which acquires data about the detected ae signals and parameters of their sources during learning the grnn uses these data in testing when estimating the unknown source position from detected ae signals for this purpose associative grnn operation is utilized the basis of such operation is statistical estimation determined by the conditional average 6 consequently the accuracy of the intelligent locator also depends on the learning procedure and must be examined before testing this article describes the results obtained by testing the intelligent locator on experimental continuous ae sources the purpose of this study was to test and examine the advantages of the intelligent locator compared to a conventional locator as described in part i in part ii an experiment will be explained in which an intelligent locator was used to locate two simultaneously active continuous ae sources generated by leakage air flow location of more than one source at the same time on the test specimen is a new approach in acoustic emission testing and is a very promising method for aircraft and airspace structural testing when preparing the experiments we focused on locating evolving defects in stressed materials and constructions and leakage of vessels we therefore performed location experiments on four different specimens with three different ae sources the specimens comprised bands plates rings and vessels while the ae sources were simulated by rupture of a pencil lead pen test material deformation during tensile test and leakage air flow through a small hole in a sample the positions of ae sources used in testing were well specified actual positions were compared with estimated ones and the discrepancy was used to describe the inaccuracy of the locator in this article only the experiment with leakage air flow through a small hole in a sample is explained in part i location of one continuous ae source is explained this part is intended for better understanding of part ii and comparison of results in part ii a new approach to the location of two t heoretical background in this section we describe a nonparametric approach to empirical modeling of ae phenomena and solving the location problem this modeling stems from a description of physical laws in terms of probability distributions since it has been explained in detail elsewhere we present here just its basic concepts 6 5 the object of empirical modeling is the relationship between variables which are simultaneously measured by a set of sensors in our example the variables are source coordinates and ae signal characteristics let them be represented by a vector of m components x 1 m in the empirical description of an ae phenomenon we repeat the observation n times to create a database of prototype vectors x1 xn instead of formulating a relation between the components of x we instead treat this vector as a random variable and express the joint probability density function f by the estimator f x 1 x x xn n n1 here denotes diracs delta function for the purposes of modelling we must also estimate the probability density in the space between the prototype points this is achieved by expressing the singular delta function in eqs 1 by a smooth function such as for example the gaussian kx xn k2 wn x xn exp n 1 n 2 2 in which denotes the smoothing parameter the data vectors determine an empirical model of the probability density function their acquisition corresponds to the learning phase of the empirical modeling let us further assume that observation of ae phenomenon provides only partial information that is given by a truncated vector g 1 s in which denotes missing components the problem is to estimate the complementary vector of missing or hidden components h s1 m such that the complete data vector is determined by concatenation x g h 1 s s1 m a statistically optimal solution to this problem is determined by the conditional average estimator which is expressed by a superposition of terms 6 bn g hn where wg g n bn g pn k1 wg g k the basis functions bn g represent a measure of similarity between the truncated vector g given by a particular observation and truncated vectors from the database g n the higher the value of bn g the higher the contribution of hn to the sum 7 estimating hence estimation of the hidden vector resembles associative recall which is characteristic of intelligence the conditional average represents a general nonparametric regression 6 during the learning phase of operation an intelligent locator of ae sources accepts ae signals and source coordinates and stores prototype data vectors while during application it accepts only ae signals and estimates the corresponding source position each of these phases can be performed in a separate unit which can be interpreted as a layer of a sensoryneural network in order to ensure acceptable properties of the locator the smoothing parameter must be properly chosen2 the purpose of function smoothing is to estimate the probability density function between the prototype data points a unique method for optimal specification of the smoothing parameter is as yet unknown in this case it is numerically simpler to specify by the half distance to the closest neighbor point n 05 min kg i g n k for all i 6 n signal preprocessing the intelligent locator comprised a sensor antenna signal preprocessing unit and source locating unit as shown in fig 1 the first unit calculates the time delay t from ae signals y1 t and y2 t while the second unit estimates the source position from the time delay t ae signals y1 t and y2 t are detected by sensors and filtered using a butterworth bandpass filter without the bandpass filter time delays cannot be easily mapped to source positions on the sample band and therefore the applicability of this method depends on the proper choice of bandpass filter function hf we found on dispersive specimens that information in the continuous ae signal about source position is located in a narrow frequency band a wave packet with approximately constant wave velocity along the specimen must be extracted by this filter the filter function hf is determined during training procedure of the locator test specimen simultaneously active continuous ae sources is explained below the article first explains the theoretical background for application of the conditional average to the location problem then describes auxiliary ae signal processing and finally demonstrates performance of the experimental intelligent locator signal preprocessing unit y1 t sensory1 t bandpass cross ry1 y2 peak detector sensor y2 t filter y2 t correlator hf fig 1 ae signal processing by the intelligent locator source location locator ry1 y2 y1 t y2 t 515 khz 1525 khz 2535 khz t ms two conventional methods for time delay estimation between two signals are known threshold function and crosscorrelation function estimation of time delay by the threshold function is simple but only applicable in the case of discrete ae more general but also more demanding is time delay estimation from the crosscorrelation function of ae signals 11 the crosscorrelation function l m l m l m 3545 khz 4555 khz 5565 khz generally exhibits a peak when parameter corresponds to the time delay t between signals y1 t and y2 t the time delay is thus determined from the position of the peak of the crosscorrelation function one advantage of the application of the crosscorrelation function is that it does not depend on the discrete or continuous character of ae signals this method for time delay estimation is only applicable when one ae source is active at the time of detection in the event of two or more simultaneously active continuous ae sources a different approach should be used which will be discussed in the part ii a filter function is calculated during calibration of the intelligent locator as follows during calibration a set of prototype sources is generated on the test specimen by a pen test at a prepared coordinate net8 this net in most cases has linear sections where the prototype sources are positioned on a straight line in this case we know that time delays between signals are also linearly dependent if we have a test specimen with a complicated geometrical structure then a precalibration process has to be performed in which we have to choose a geometrically simple part of the specimen and carry out a precalibration procedure on this part such that time delays between signals are linearly dependent for calibration we used ae signals generated by a pen test we obtained 12 pairs of ae signals from two sensors concatenated with known coordinates of sources the positions of simulated sources were uniformly distributed along a straight line on a specimen in such cases time delay t is linearly related to source position z this is of advantage for optimal determination of bandpass filter because the reference is a straight line calculation of time delays on the same set of prototype ae signals was repeated 70 times the bandpass filter of f 10 khz was shifted by 1 khz at each repetition from 5 to 75 khz time delays were calculated at each repetition and the distribution obtained was compared with a straight line as shown in fig 2 the frequency bandwidth was considered optimal when the root mean square error rmse was minimal as shown in fig 3a the optimal frequency band for this specimen was 3545 khz and the velocity of elastic waves was 17 km s1 the filter was further used for preprocessing samples of prototype as well as test sources as shown in fig 3b the pairs z t estimated from filtered signals fit a straight line except one outlier which results from experimental error e xperiment the intelligent ae source locator is shown schematically in fig 4 it includes an automatic dataacquisition system l m l m l m fig 2 distribution of time delays and their linear approximation along the band specimen by this procedure an optimal bandpass filter can be determined controlled by computer and a network of ae sensors the ae sensors are piezoelectric transducers pinducers the diameter of the transducer active area is 13 mm and so it can be considered a pointlike sensor the signals from sensors are fed to a digital oscilloscope where they are digitized and transferred to a pc operation of the intelligent locator is determined by software in the pc that controls data acquisition and estimates the position of unknown ae sources the locator operates in two different modes 1 in learning or calibration mode a set of n pen tests is performed in which complete information about the ae phenomenon is acquired the operator must prepare an orientation net the shape of which depends on the shape of the test specimen the recommended shape is an equidistant net since such position of prototype sources yield a minimum error of the locator from source coordinates and time delays between preprocessed ae signals the prototype vectors are created and stored in the memory of the neural network as a data base 2 in application mode only time delays between ae signals are provided there are then associated in the neural network with the estimated source coordinates in the case of discrete ae the time delay can visually be estimated from a marked jump in the burst of the ae signal or can be instrumentally determined using a threshold function hence in the case of continuous ae time delays cannot be simply estimated although a crosscorrelation function has already been used for this purpose in our approach we therefore applied a crosscorrelation function the purpose of this experiment was to determine the accuracy of location of continuous ae sources on a onedimensional specimen two experiments on aluminum band specimen are explained in this article we tested the locator on an aluminum band specimen of dimensions 4000 40 5 mm3 reflection of ae signals at the ends of the band specimen was reduced by sharpening the ends for testing we selected a test area rmse fopt 1525 3545 5565 7585 f khz frequency band r esults the results of locator testing are shown in fig 5a the absolute location error for each test source is shown in fig 5b location error in the experiment ranges from 13 mm to 60 mm with average value a 20 mm ignoring the outlier if we describe the error with respect to the distance between sensors 24 m the relative value is less than 1 increasing the number of prototype sources can reduce the error despite the complexity of continuous ae signals the location problem was solved satisfactorily with respect to the accuracy required in nondestructive testing results also show that a standard calibration procedure with discrete ae signals generated by pen test can be used for locator training

time delays of prototype and test sources legend prototype source test source in the middle of the band specimen where 23 holes were prepared the distance between holes was 100 mm and the diameter of holes was 2 mm two ae sensors were mounted 100 mm away from the terminal holes for the purpose of locator training we generated 12 prototype sources separated by 200 mm while all 23 holes were applied for locator testing in this experiment we calibrate the locator by pen test and examine it by continuous ae generated by air flow the air flow was produced by expansion of compressed air through nozzle of 1 mm diameter the nozzle was mounted 1 mm above the band specimen surface two experiments were performed in the first experiment only one continuous ae source was active on the band specimen while in the second experiment two continuous ae sources were active simultaneously on the band specimen successive simultaneous location of two sources is explained in part ii signals were processed as shown in fig 1 the first step in processing was calculation of crosscorrelation function of ae signals the corresponding signal was sent through a bandpass butterworth filter of bandpass from 35 to 45 khz determination of this filter is explained earlier in this article 1000 500 outlier 500 1000 1000 500 500 1000 x mm actual location  mm absolute error x mm estimated loc 1000 500 500 1000 z mm

source b absolute location error a average error d iscussion and c onclusion estimation of source coordinates by the conditional average is subject to systematic error caused by smoothing of the delta function 5 this error can be reduced by increasing the number of prototype sources since it is not always possible to increase the number of prototype sources due to the complexity of experiments a compromise must be found by trial and error experimental error is acceptable so we decided to make additional tests as will be discussed in part ii this study shows that a conventional ae locator operating on the triangulation method can be successfully replaced by an intelligent locator that learns from examples the results show that the intelligent locator can locate sources with acceptable accuracy in cases of 1 discrete ae on band and plate 2 continuous ae on band 3 discrete ae on plate with hole ring 4 discrete ae generated by specimen rupture during the tensile test and 5 discrete ae on pressure vessel is has been also shown that the locator can perform zonal locating7 comparing mean errors of all experiments and the distances between prototype sources we find that the average error is always less than 30 of the distance between prototype sources while the maximal error is always less than 50 of the distance between prototype sources the accuracy of the locator can be controlled by the number of prototype sources excited during training the experimental error of the locator is a consequence of wave dispersion on a specimen that operates as a waveguide reflections from boundaries and attenuation we found for dispersive waves that an optimal wave packet must be found which has approximately constant velocity along the test specimen estimation of time delay between ae signals by the crosscorrelation function is only applicable for one active ae source if there are several simultaneously active ae sources then blind source separation should be used as
