real options for project schedules rops 1 introduction this paper is a brief description of a methodology of developing options in the sense of financial options eg with all greeks to be applied in collaboration with michael bowman as a first example to scheduling a massive us army project future combat systems fcs 1 the major focus is to develop real options for nonfinancial projects as discussed in other earlier papers 3412 data and some guidance on its use has been reported in a previous study of fcs 25 the need for tools for fairly scheduling and pricing such a complex project has been emphasized in recommendations for executive action in a report by the us general accounting office gao on fcs 14 and they also emphasize the need for management of fcs business plans 13 2 goals a given plan results in st money allocated by the clientgovernment is defined in terms of projects s it st s it where ait may be some scheduled constraints pathtree processes a probability tree developed over the life of the plan t divided into n nodes at times t n each with mean epoch length dt 11 options including all greeks familiar to financial markets are calculated for quite arbitrary nonlinear means and variances of multiplicative noise 69 this ability to process nonlinear functions in probability distributions is essential for realworld applications each task has a range of durations with nonzero ai with a disbursement of funds used defining s it n any task dependent on a task completion is slaved to its precursors we develop the plan conditional probability density cpd in terms of differenced costs ds ps ds t n dts t n p is modeledcastfit into the functional form ps ds t n dts t n 2 g2 dt expldt ds fdt2 2g2 dt 2 where f and g are nonlinear function of cost s and time t the g2 variance function absorbs the multiple task cost and schedule statistical spreads to determine pds t giving rise to the stochastic nature of dollars spent on the plan a given project i with task k has a mean duration i ik with a a mean cost s ik the spread in ds has two components arising from 1 a stochastic duration around the mean duration and 2 a stochastic spread of mean dollars around a deterministic disbursement at a given time different finitewidth asymmetric distributions are used for durations and costs for example the distribution created for adaptive simulated annealing asa 8 originally called very fast simulated reannealing 7 is a finiteranged distribution with shape determined by a parameter temperature q for each state whether duration or cost a a random binary choice can be made to be higher or lower than the mean using any ratio of probabilities selected by the client b then an asa distribution is used on the chosen side each side has a different q each falling off from the mean this is illustrated and further described in fig 1 at the end of the tree at a time t t also can be a parameter there is a total cost at each node st called a final strike in financial language a final strike might also appear at any node before t due to cancellation of the project using a particular kind of schedule alternative working backwards options are calculated at time t0 greeks functional derivatives of the option assess sensitivity to various variables eg like those discussed in previous papers 12 but here we deliver precise numbers based on as much realworld information available lester ingber real options for project schedules rops 12 absy q log1 1q asa q 01 fig 1 the asa distribution can be used to develop finiterange asymmetric distributions from which a value can be chosen for a given state of duration or cost a a random binary distribution is selected for a lowerthan or higherthan mean using any ratio of probabilities selected by the client each side of the mean has its own temperature q here an asa distribution is given for q 01 the range can be scaled to any finite interval and the mean placed within this range b a uniform random distribution selects a value from 11 and a normalized asa value is read off for the given state 3 data the following data are used to develop plan cpd each task i has a a projected allocated cost c i b a projected time schedule t i c a cpd with a statistical width of funds spent sw s i d a distribution with a statistical width of duration sw t i e a range of durations rt i f a range of costs r s i expert guesses need to be provided for cf for the prototype study a given plan must be constructed among all tasks specified the ordering of tasks eg obeying any sequential constraints among tasks 4 three recursive shell 41 outer shell there may be several parameters in the project eg as coefficients of variables in means and variances of different cpd these are optimized in an outer shell using asa 8 this end product including multimin states returned by asa gives the client flexibility to apply during a full project 12 we may wish to minimize costt or costoverrun costinitialt etc lester ingber real options for project schedules rops 42 middle shell to obtain the plan cpd an middle shell of monte carlo mc states are generated from recursive calculations a weibull or some other asymmetric finite distribution might be used for task durations for a given state in the outer middle a mc state has durations and mean cost disbursements defined for each task 43 inner shell at each time for each task the differenced cost s ik t dt s ik t is subjected to a inner shell stochastic variation eg some asymmetric finite distribution the net costs ds ik t for each project i and task k are added to define dst for the plan the inner shell cost cpd is reapplied many times to get a set of ds at each time 5 real options 51 plan options after the outer mc sampling is completed there are histograms generated of the plans dst and dstst dt at each time t the histograms are normalized at each time to give pds t at each time t the data representing p is curvefit to the form of eq 0 where f and g are functions needed to get good fits eg fitting coefficients of parameters x f x f 0 x f 1 s x f 2 s 2 g x g0 x g1 s x g2 s 2 at each time t the functions f and g are fit to the function ln pds t which includes the prefactor containing g and the function l which may be viewed as a pad approximate of these polynomials complex constraints as functions of s ik t can be easily incorporated in this approach eg due to regular reviews by funding agencies or executives these ps are input into pathtree to calculate options for a given strategy or plan 52 risk management of project options if some measure of risk among projects is desired then during the mc calculations developed for the toplevel plan sets of differenced costs for each project ds it and ds its it dt stored from each of the projects tasks then histograms and project cpds are developed similar to the development of the plan cpd a copula analysis coded in trd for risk management of financial markets are applied to develop a relative risk analysis among these projects 10 in such an analysis the project marginal cpds are all transformed to gaussian spaces where it makes sense to calculate covariances and correlations an audit trail back the original project spaces permits analysis of risk dependent on the tails of the project cpds 6 generic applications rops can be applied to any complex scheduling of tasks similar to the fcs project the need for government agencies to plan and monitor such large projects is becoming increasingly difficult and necessary 15 many large businesses have similar projects and similar requirements to manage their complex projects lester ingber real options for project schedules rops references m bowman and l ingber real options for us
