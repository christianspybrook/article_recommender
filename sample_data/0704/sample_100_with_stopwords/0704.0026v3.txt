02361 february 15 2013 abstract zerodivisors zds derived by cayleydickson process cdp from ndimensional hypercomplex numbers n a power of 2 and at least 4 can represent singularities and as n fractals and thereby scalefree networks any integer 8 and not a power of 2 generates a metafractal or sky when it is interpreted as the strut constant s of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called boxkites the fundamental zd building blocks remarkably simple bitmanipulation rules or recipes provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of wolframs class 4 complexity 1 introduction by way of reprise from boxkites to ets the creation of 2n dimensional analogues of complex numbers and it was not a trivial insight of 19th century algebra that legitimate analogs always have dimension a power of 2 is handled by a now wellknown algorithm called the cayleydickson process cdp its name suggests a compressed account of its history for arthur cayley simultaneously with but independently of john graves  email address rdemarraisalummitedu jumped on hamiltons initial generalization of the 2d imaginaries to the 4d quaternions within weeks of its announcement producing by the method later streamlined into leonard dicksons closetomodern cookiecutter procedure the 8d octonions the hope voiced by no less than gauss had been that an infinity of new forms of number were lurking out there with wondrous properties just awaiting discovery whose magical utility would more than compensate for the loss of things long taken for granted as their seekers ascended into higher dimensions but such fantasies were quashed quite abruptly by adolph hurwitzs proof just a few years before the 20th century loomed that it only took four dimensiondoublings past the real number line to find trouble the 16d sedenions had zerodivisors which meant division algebra itself broke down which meant researchers were so at a loss to find anything good to say about such numbers that nobody bothered to even give their 32d immediate successors a name much less investigate them seriously but it is with these 32d pathions for short for pathological which well call them from now on that our own account will pick up in this second part of our study of placeholder substructures ie zero divisors for due to a phenomenon we dubbed carrybit overflow in the first installment strange yet predictable things are found to be afoot in the zd equivalent of a cayley table as well see shortly this is a listing in a square array of the zd emanations or lack of same of all zd elements with each other all that is sharing membership in an ensemble defined not by a shared identity element but a common strut constant what well see is that the lacks are of the essence for each doubling of n the emanation table et for the 2n1 ions of same strutconstant will contain that of its predecessor leading to an infinite boxeswithinboxes deployment whose empty cells define as n grows ever larger an unmistakable fractal limit the full algorithmic analysis of such matrioshkadolllike metafractal aspects by the simple rules of what well call recipe theory after the r c and p values related to the row label column label and their cellspecific products in such tables must await our third and last installment but the coloredquiltlike graphics can be viewed by any interested readers at their leisure in the powerpoint slideshow online at wolfram science from our midjune presentation at nks 20061 the slideshows title is almost identical to that of this monograph as this latter is meant to be the theoremproof exposition of that iconic hence largely intuitive and empirically driven narration what well need to undertake this voyage is a quick reprise of the results from part i 2 as the hardest part as a hundred years of denial would imply is finding the right way to think about the phenomenology of zerodivision not understanding its basic workings once theyre hit upon such a summary can be much more brief and easy to follow than the proofs required to produce and justify it we need but grasp 3 rather simple things first we must internalize the path and vertex structure of an octahedron for properly annotated and storyboarded this will provide us with the boxkite representation that completely catalogs zds in the 16d arena where they first emerged and as well see in our roundabout theorem herein underwrites all higherdimensional zd emergences as well second instead of the cumbersome apparatus of cdp that one finds in algebra texts and the occasional software treatment we offer two easy algebraic oneliners which inspired by dr seusss thing 1 and thing 2 we simply call rule 1 and rule 2 which operate in almost pythagorean earnest on triplets of integers indices of associative triplets among our hypercomplex units as well learn and which by so doing accomplish everything the usual cdp tactics do but without the alltoofrequent obfuscation there is also a very useful albeit quite trivial rule 0 which merely states that any integertriple serving to index an associative triplet for one power of n will continue to do so for all higher powers what makes this useful is its allowing us to recursively take triplet givens for lowerlevel 2n ions than those of current interest and toss them into the central circle of the third thing we must grasp well need that is to be able to draw the simplest finite projective groups 7line 7node representation the socalled psl27 triangle the rules plus the triangle applied to boxkite edgetracings and nodal indices are all well need indeed the boxkite itself can be readily derived from the triangle by suppressing the central node and then recognizing four correspondences first see the triangles 3 triplenoded sides two vertices plus midpoint as the sources of the boxkites trio of filledin triangles dubbed trefoil sails second link the 1 triplenoded circle which is a projective line after all wrapped around the suppressed center and threading the midpoints as the 4th such triangle the quite special zigzag sail third envision the 3 lines from midpoints to angles as underwriting the zdchallenged part of the diagram because zds housed at the midpoint node cannot mutually zerodivide any housed at the opposite vertex node the struts whence strut constants fourth and last imagine the other four triangles of the boxkite meeting as with the first four each to each at corners only like samecolored checkerboard squares as the vents where the wind blows they keep the kite afloat letting the four prettily colored jibshaped sails show off while the trio of wooden or plastic dowels that form the struts thanklessly provide the structural stability that makes the kite able to fly in the first place as euclid knew well 3 points determine a triangle as well as a circle which is how we can glibly switch gears between representations based on these projective lines but the easy convertibility of lines to circles is what projective means here and is as well at the very heart of linking the above geometrical images to imaginary numbers from argands diagram to riemanns sphere this has been the essence of complex geometry on the latter image only place a sphere on a flat tabletop call the point of contact s for south and then direct rays from its polar opposite point n rays through the equator intersect the table in a circle whose radius we ascribe an absolute value of 1 with center s 0 this circle is just the trace of the usual ei2 exponentialorbit equation with the i in the exponent of course being the standard imaginary any diameter through this circle extended indefinitely in either direction is clearly a projective pencil of a circular motion in the plane containing both it and n and centered on the latter what each line then in the psl27 triangle represents is a coherent system interrelating 3 distinct imaginaries one per nodal point that is a quaternion copy sans the reals which latter like our n s polar axis in the above must stand outside the number space itself since 3d visualization is all used up by the nodes dimensional requirements hence the 7 lines are the 7 interconnected quaternion copies which constitute the 8d octonions and what makes this especially rich for our purposes is the builtin recursiveness of this octonionlabeling scheme for higherdimensional isomorphs embedded in the sorts of ensembles well be needing ets to investigate more thoroughly to see how this relates to actual integers take the prototype of the 7 lines in the triangle and consider the quaternions strictly from the vantage of cdps rule 1 the first task in studying any system of 2n ions is generating its units so start with n 0 treat this singleton as the index of the real axis i0 that is is identically 1 add a unit whose index 20 1 and we have the complex plane now add in a unit whose index is the next available power of 2 with n 1 this is 2 itself call this unit and its index g for generator and declare this inductive rule the index of the product of any two units is always the xor of the indices of the units being multiplied but for any unit with index u g the product of said unit written on the left right with the generator written on its right left has index equal to their indices simple sum and sign equal opposite to the product of the signs of their units i1 i2 i3 but i2 i1 i3 but this is just a standard way of summarizing quaternion multiplication now set n 2 making g 4 applying the same logic but slightly generalized we get three more triplets of indices dispensing with the tedious overhead of explicitly writing the indices as subscripts to explicit copies of the letter i these are written in cyclical positive order cpo as follows 1 4 5 2 4 6 3 4 7 cpo is not mysterious it just means read the triplet listing in leftright order and so long as we multiply any unit with any such index by the unit whose index is to the right of it the third term will result with signing as specified above eg i4 i5 i1 i4 i3 i7 we now have 4 of the octonions 7 triplets forming labels on the nodes of 4 of psl27s lines call the central circle spanning the medians the rule 0 line the quaternions starter kit we just fed into our rule 1 induction machine putting g 4 in the center the 3 lines through it are our rule 1 triplets if we further array the quaternion indexset 1 2 3 in clockwise order around the 4 starting from the left slopes midpoint at 10 oclock these lines are all oriented pointing into the angles now with rule 2 lets construct the lines along the triangles sides heres all that rule 2 says given an associative indextriplet henceforth trip like the quaternions 1 2 3 fix any one among them then take its two cpo successors and add g to them swap the order of the resulting two new units and you have a new trip hence fixing 1 2 and 3 in turn in that order rule 2 gives us these 3 triplets 1 7 6 2 5 7 3 6 5 if youve drawn psl27 with the octonion labels per the instructions in the last paragraph youve already seen these 3 trips are the answers and now you know how and why theyre oriented too clockwise in parallel with the rule 0 circle weve now laid out all the ingredients we need to do a basic runthrough of boxkite properties well merely state and describe them rather than prove them but well give the roman numerals of the theorem numbers from last installment for those who want to follow them the first feature in need of elucidating which should have those whove been reading attentively scratching their heads just about now is this the relations between the indices at the nodes of psl27 qua octonion labeling scheme are clear enough but how can these same labeled nodes serve to underwrite the 16d sedenion framework that boxkites reside in the answer has two parts first part since all imaginaries have negative reals as squares imaginaries whose products are zero must have different indices meaning that the simple case which we call primitive zds will always involve products of pairs of differentlyindexed units whose respective planes share no points other than 0 iv second part given any such zd dyad neither index can ever equal g ii and one must have index g while the other has index g i iii the octonion labeling scheme maps to the four sails of a legitimate sedenion boxkite v because it only provides the lowindex labels at each of the 6 octahedral vertices the 4 in the center of our example meanwhile is no longer the g for this setup since that role in now played by 8 the next power of 2 in the cdp induction in the context of the boxkite scheme it is now represented by a different letter s for strut constant the only octonion index not on a boxkite vertex which is why from one vantage there are 7 distinct but isomorphic boxkites in sedenion space because weve 7 choices of which octonion to suppress 6 vertices times 7 gives us the 42 assessors of our first zd paper 3 a term well use interchangeably with dyad throughout we can in fact tug on the network of interconnected lines wokcooking style stirring things into and out of the hot oil in the center of the boxkite s as stirfry constant to find the octonion copy labeling low indices on boxkite vertices where the 5 say is suppressed trace the line containing it and the 4 and rotate the 1 now goes from the left slopes midpoint to the bottom right angle to be replaced by the 4 while the 5 heads for the middle with cpo order and hence orientation of the line remaining unchanged of the other 2 trips the 5 belongs to only one will preserve midpointtoangle orientation along the 6 oclocktomidnight vertical 2 5 7 as one can check in an instance the two possibilities must orient oppositely when placed along the same line since one is rule 1 the other rule 2 from this point everything is forced this is obviously a procedure that is trivial to automate for any octonion copy regardless of the ambient dimensionality the boxkite it underwrites might float in this simple insight will be the basis in fact of our proof method both in this paper and its sequel another simple insight will tell us how to find the highindex term for any vertexs dyad two indices per vertex leaves 4 that are suppressed 0 for the reals g and s and the xor and also simple sum of the latter two which well shorthand x these four clearly form a quaternion copy one in fact which has no involvement whatsoever in its containing boxkites zerodivisions putting the index of the one among these which is itself an lunit center stage gives us the full array of lindex sets trips composed of those indices of a sails 3 vertices g associated with the 4 sails putting in g or x then must give us the full array of uindex sets u as in upper since each node belongs to 3 lines in psl27 the strut constant belongs to 3 trips each containing one term from the rule 0 zigzag sails lindex set and one from the vent which resides opposite it on the boxkites octahedral frame in the sedenions three simple rules govern interactions of the vent and zigzag dyads sharing a strut writing the u and l index terms in upper and lower case respectively we can symbolize their dyads as v v and z z respectively the three viziers derived as sideeffects of vii with one for each non0 member of our zdfree index set read as follows vz1 v z v z s vz2 z v v z g vz3 v v z z x the first vizier motivates the term strut constant for the same pattern obtains for it regardless of the strut being investigated the second vizier shows us that g connects strut opposites always by rule 1 logic but clearly the third vizier gives us the simplest way to answer any questions concerning the relations between indices within a dyad the l and u indices of any dyad belong to the same trip as x with cpo ordering determined by whether or not the dyad belongs to the zigzag proper or the vent opposite it beyond the sedenions vz2 is universally true but vz1 and vz3 are only so up to sign eg the vz1 ltrip for an arbitrary strut can read z c s in certain higherdimensional contexts this is ultimately a sideeffect of the same carrybit overflow that creates the phenomenon of most interest to us here the missing boxkites in all 2n ions n at least 5 for s 8 and not a power of 2 correlated with such zdfree structures are type ii boxkites with s 8 or more generally g2 indistinguishable from the standard type i variety but for strut orientations with exactly 2 of a type iis 3 struts always being reversed see appendix b their twist products operating similarly on parallel sides of each of the 3 orthogonal squares or catamarans of a boxkites orthogonal wireframe as opposed to the 4 triangular sails which are our sole focus in this monograph let them act as middlemen between the normal and zdfree structures our arguments here will make no use of such twist product subtleties on which see theorem 6 in part i and the caveat that follows it and the more developed remarks and diagrams in 4 indeed their phenomenology falls under the radar of our sailbased analysis strutopposite assessors after all do not mutually zerodivide given our limited purposes here therefore our toolkit once the viziers are dropped in it is complete for all our later proofs we must simply remember that invocations of vz1 and vz3 implicitly concern signfree relations between vent and zigzag terms that is indices of xor products only whats left to do still get our hands messy with the plumbing and then clean up with a last grand construct lets start with the plumbing and add some notation label the zigzag dyads with the letters a b c label their strutopposite terms in the vent f e d respectively specify the diagonal lines containing all and only zds in any such dyad k as k and k for c ik ik and c ik ik respectively c an arbitrary real scalar the twelve edges of the octahedral grid are so many pipes through which course the twoway streets of edgecurrents for the 3 edges of the zigzag and the 3 defining the opposite vent currents joining arbitrary vertices m and n are called negative since they have this form m n m n 0 tracing the perimeter of the zigzag with ones finger performing zd products in natural sequence a b followed by the latter times c then this times a and so forth one should quickly see how the zigzags name was suggested suppressing all letters one is left with just this cyclically repeating sequence currents along all 6 edges joining zigzag and vent dyads on the contrary connect similarly sloping diagonals hence are called positive yielding the shorthand sequence for trefoil sail traversals z v z v 0 consider the chain of zd multiplications one can make along the zigzag between a and b then b and c then c and a for s 4 the first term of this 6cycle of zero products once fully expanded is writable thus a b i1 i13 i2 i14 i3 i15 i15 i3 c c c c 0 we can readily see here where the notion of emanation arises traversing the edge between any two vertices in a sail yields a balancepan pairing of oppositely signed instances of the terms at the sails third vertex the 0 being then an instance of balanced bookkeeping whence the term assessor our synonym for dyad this suggests the spontaneous emanation of particleantiparticle pairings from the quantum vacuum rather than true emptiness finally a sideeffect of such sail dynamics is this astonishing phenomenon each sail is an interlacing of 4 associative triplets for the zigzag these are the lindex a b c plus the 3 uindex trips obtained by replacing all but one of these lowercase letters with their uppercase partners ergo a bc a bc a b c ultimately this tells us that zds are extreme preservers of order since they maintain associativity in rigorous lockstep patterns for all 2n ions no matter how close to their n might become put another way the centurylong aversion reaction experienced by virtually all mathematicians faced with zerodivisors was profoundly misguided 2 emanation tables conventions for construction theorem 7 guaranteed the simple structure of ets because any assessors uppercase index iu is strictly determined by g and s once we are given these two values the table need only track interactions among the lowercase indices il this will only lead to ambiguities in the very place these are meaningful in the recursive articulation of a boxeswithinboxes tabulation of metafractal or sky behaviors in such cases the overlaying will be as rich in significance as the multiplicity of sheets of a riemann surface in complex analysis an et does for zd interactivity what a cayley table does for abstract groups it makes things visible we otherwise could not see and in a similar way each assessors lindex is entered in a manner well soon specify as a row r or column c value with xor products p values among them being placed in the spreadsheet cell rc uniquely fixed by r and c weve noted such values only get entered if p is the lindex of a legitimate emanation that is the assessor it represents mutually zerodivides forms dmzs with for divisors making zero both the assessors represented by the r and c labels of its cell as already suggested the natural use of the letters r c p here inspired calling the study of nkslike simple rules for cooking fractals from their bitstrings recipe theory four conventions are used in building ets first their labeling scheme obeys the same nestedparentheses ordering weve already used in designating assessors a through f with d e f the strut opposites of a b c in reverse of the order just written the lindices then are entered as labels running across the top and down the left the label of the lowest lindex is placed flush left abutting the ceiling with the corresponding label of its strut opposite being entered flush right atop the floor as there will always be g 2 hence an even number of indices to enter repeating this procedure after each pair has been copied to horizontal and vertical labels will completely exhaust them all second convention as the point of an et is to display all legitimate dmzs any cell whose r and c do not mutually zerodivide is left blank even if in fact there is a welldefined xor value hence if r and c reference the same assessor the xor of their lindices will be 0 if they reference strut opposites the xor will be s but in both cases the cell hence the p value is left blank all normal ets then will have both long diagonals populated by blank cells while all other cells are filled third convention the two zd diagonals associated with any assessor are not distinguished in the et although various protocols are possible that would make doing so easy the reasons are parsimony and redundancy rather than create longer or twice as many entries we assume both entries for the same boxkite edge will contain the positivesloping diagonal when the lower lindex appears as the row label else the negativesloping diagonal when the higher lindex appears first instead such niceties wont concern us much here the key thing is that in fact all 24 filled cells of a boxkites et entries can be mapped onetoone to its zd diagonals recall per theorem 3 that both zd diagonals of an assessor form dmzs with the same assessor according to the same edgesign logic this leads us to the fourth convention although they are superfluous for many purposes edge signs provide critical information for others and so are indicated in all ets provided here each of a boxkites 12 edges conducts two currents one per zd diagonal and does so according to one or the other orientational option zd diagonals are conventionally inscribed so that the horizontal axis of their assessor plane is the lindexed unit while the vertical is the uindexed unit but even if this convention were reversed the diagonal leading from lower left quadrant to upper right would still correspond to the state of synchrony implied by kil iu for some assessor u we write u conversely the orthogonal diagonal indicative of antisynchrony is written u if dmzs formed by the assessors bounding an edge are both of same kind then we call the edge blue or notate it  if assessors u and v only form dmzs from oppositely oriented zd diagonals u v 0 u v 0 then we call the edge red or notate it however for et purposes since the red edges are the most informative allrededged zigzags providing the stable basis of boxkite structure while allrededged def vents play a key role in twistproduct interpreting a deep topic touched upon in part i which wont concern us further here we leave them unmarked the six blue edges bounding the hexagonal view of the boxkite however are preceded by an extra mark best interpreted as a dash rather than a minus sign this has the pragmatic advantage that when zoomed a large et will have its entries with an extra mark become unreadable in many software systems eg one sees only asterisks and so we want the unmarked entries to be those likely to be of most interest since given x or alternatively g or n and s we can reconstruct a boxkite from just its zigzags lindex trip gleaning this information from an et is worth explaining if a given row contains the indices of any such zigzag ltrips they will appear as the row label itself plus two unmarked cell entries with the column label of the one appearing as the content of the other if either cell in such a complementary set be marked with a dash then we are dealing with a def vent index each zigzag ltrip will also appear 3 times in an et once in each row whose label is one of its indices its 2 nonlabel indices appearing in undashed cell entries each time here is a readily interpreted emanation table having 6 23 2 rows and columns g 8 so n 4 making this a sedenion et encoding thereby a single boxkite and since 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 the strut constant s 1 as well a scan of the first row shows 6 and 5 unmarked under headings 4 and 7 respectively however these two labels appear as cell values which are marked making these edges that connect assessors in the d e f vent in the fourth row of entries though column labels 5 and 3 contain cell values 3 and 5 respectively both unmarked with their row label 6 then these form the zigzag lindex set 3 6 5 which hence must map to assessors a bc using the mirroropposite logic of the labeling scheme to determine strut opposites it is clear that the six row and column headings 2 4 6 7 5 3 correspond in that order to the assessors f d b ec a the unmarked contents 6 and 5 in the first row having labels 2 4 and 2 7 thereby map to edges fd and fe connecting def vent assessors as claimed finally the long diagonals are all empty those cells in the diagonal beginning at the upper left all have identical row and column labels those in the mirroropposite slots meanwhile have labels which are strutopposites by our second convention all these cells are left blank before beginning an indepth study of emanation tables by type there is one general result that applies to them all and whose proof will give us the chance to put the three viziers to good use while seemingly quite concrete we will use it in roundabout ways to simplify some otherwise quite complicated arguments beginning with next sections theorem 9 this roundabout theorem is our theorem 8 the number of filled cells in any emanation table is a multiple of 24 proof since 24 is the number of filled cells in a sedenion boxkite this is equivalent to claiming that cdp zerodivisors come in clusters no smaller than boxkites we have already seen in theorem 5 that the existence of a dmz implies the 3assessor system of a sail which further as theorem 7 spelled out entails a system of 4 interlocking trips the sails ltrip plus 3 trips comprising each ltrip index plus the uindices of its assessors 2 sailing partners since we have an et we have a fixed s and fixed g hence if we suppose our dmz corresponds to a zigzag edgecurrent we immediately can derive its ltrip by theorem 5 and all 3 zigzag strutopposites lindices by vz 1 and all 6 uindices by vz 3 we then can test whether the trefoil sails edgecurrents are all dmzs as follows as we wrote in theorem 7 u v w maps to the zigzag ltrip in cpo but not necessarily in a b c order hence uopp wopp v is an ltrip and can be mapped to any of the trefoils in other words given the zigzags 3fold rotational symmetry proving the truth of the following arithmetical result proves the dmz status of all trefoil edges yet we can avail ourselves of all 3 zigzag utrips in proving it wopp wopp uopp uopp v v v v the left bottom result is a given of the trip we started with the result to its right is a threestep deduction from one of the zigzag utrips use uopp w vopp rule 2 gives uopp vopp g wg the second vizier tells us this is uopp vwopp but the negative inner sign on the upper dyad reverses the sign this trip implies yielding v for the answer the top results are derived similarly find which of the 4 zigzag trips underwrites the vizierderived harmonic which contains the pair of terms being multiplied and flip signs as necessary hence the top left uses u wopp vopp then applies rule 2 and the second vizier to get v while the top right uses the zigzag ltrip itself u v w w g v u g wopp vuopp which multiplied by 1 yields v remark the implication that regardless of how large n grows zds only increase in their interconnectedness rather than see their basic structures atrophy flies in the face of a centurys intuition based on the hurwitz proof that there are no standalone edgecurrents nor even standalone sails bespeaks an astonishing and hitherto quite unsuspected stability in the realm of zds corollary an easy calculation makes it clear that the maximum number of filled cells in any et for any 2n ions is just the square of a row or columns length in cells minus twice the same number to remove all the blanks in long diagonals that is 2n1 22n1 2 2 2n1 4 22n2 6 2n1 8 2n1 42n1 2 4 2n2 12n2 2 by roundabout we now know this number is divisible by 24 hence indicates an integer number of boxkites but two dozen into this number is just 2n2 12n2 26 the trip count for the 2n2 ions see section 2 of part i we have then the very important tripcount twostep the maximum number of boxkites that can fill a 2n ion et tripn2 we will see just how important this corollary is next section 3 ets for n 4 and s 7 one of the immediate corollaries of our cdp rules for creating new triplets from old ones is something we might call the zeropadding lemma if two kbitlong bitstring representations of two integers r and c being xored are stuffed with the same number n of 0s between bits j and j 1 0 j k their xor will but for the extra n bits of 0s in the same positions be unchanged and so will the sign of the product p of cdpderived imaginary units with these three bitstrings representing their respective indices examples 1 2 3 2 4 6 4 8 12 add 1 then 2 0s to the right of each bitstring 1 2 3 1 4 5 1 8 9 add 1 then 2 0s just before the rightmost bit in each bitstring 3 4 7 3 8 11 3 16 19 add 1 then 2 0s just after the leftmost bit in each bitstring proof rule 1 will create a new unit of index g l from any unit of index l g regardless of what power of 2 g might be rule 2 meanwhile uses any power of 2 which exceeds all indices of the trip it would operate on then adds this g to two of the members of the trip creating a new trip with reversed orientation one of an infinite series of such differing only in the power of 2 hence position of the leftmost bit used to construct them the lemma then is an obvious restatement of the fundamental implications of the cdp rules but creation of uindices associated with lindices in assessor dyads is the direct result of creating new triplets with gs as their middle term hence if we call the current generator g and that of the next higher 2n ions g 2 g then if assessors with lindices u and v form dmzs in the sedenions for a given strut constant s their uindices will increment by g in the pathions and zero division will remain unaffected by induction the emanation table contents of the sedenion rcp entries will remain unchanged for all n for all fixed s 7 this leads us to theorem 9 all nonlongdiagonal cell entries in all ets for all n for all fixed s 7 will be filled proof keeping the same notation the 2n ions will have g more assessors than their predecessors with indices ranging from g itself to 2g1 g1 consider first some arbitrary zigzag assessor with lindex z g whose uindex is g z s if it were a vent assessor or a zigzag on a reversedorientation strut in a type ii boxkite the second part of the expression would be reversed s z per the first vizier this effects triplet orientation but not absolute value of the index however and it is only the latter which matters at the moment now consider the assessor whose lindex is the lowest of those new to the 2n ions g we know it is a vent assessor in all boxkites with s g of which there are 7 per each such s in the pathions 35 in the 64d 26 ions and so on for it belongs to the trip s g g s rule 1 so that its uindex appears on its immediate left in the triplet g g s g g s rule 2 and last parentheses its uindex then is g g s or recall rule 1 just g g s we claim these assessors form dmzs or writing out the arithmetic that the following termbyterm multiplication is true g g g s z g z s g g z s z g z g g g z s because one assessor is assumed a zigzag while the other is proven a vent the inner signs will be the same simple sign reversals akin to those involving our frequently invoked binary variable sg will let us generalize our proof to include the venttimesvent case later lets examine the terms one at a time starting with the bottom line its left term is an obvious application of rule 1 as z g the latter being the generator of the prior cdp level which also contained z as an lindex the term on bottom right we derive as follows we know that z and its uindex partner in the 2n1 ions belong to the triplet mediated by g s z g z s g s supplementing this cpo expression by adding g to the righthand terms rule 2 we get the triplet containing both multiplicands of the bottomright quantity z g g s g g z s the multiplicands appear in this trip in their order of application in forming the product therefore their resultant is a plussigned copy of the trips third term as shown above moving to the lefthand term of the top line what trip do the multiplicands belong to within the prior generation rule 1 tells us that zs strut opposite z s multiplies g on the left to yield g z s application of rule 2 to the terms 6 g reverses order and gives us this g g z s g g z s but what weve written above is the product of multiplying the third and second terms of the trip together in cporeversed order hence the negative sign is correct finally we get the negative of z g by similar tactics the term is the uindex of zs strutopposite assessor in the prior cdp generation hence belongs to the trip with this cpo expression g s z g z s rule 2 gives us g g s g z s z g hence the product written above is properly signed now what effect does our initial assumption that z is the lindex of a zigzag assessor have on the argument the lowerleft term is obviously unaffected but the upperleft term perhaps less obviously also is unchanged while it seems to depend on z s in fact this is only used to define the lindex of zs strut opposite which multiplies g on the left to precisely the same effect as z itself both being less than it the two terms on the right just as clearly do have their signs changed for in both the order relations of l and u indices vis vis g s or x are necessarily invoked but both signs on the right can be rereversed to obtain the desired result if we change the inner sign of the topmost expression which is to say we have an effect analogous to that achieved in earlier arguments by use of the binary variable sg as claimed since one cdp levels g is the g of the next level up the above demonstration clearly obtains by the obvious induction for all 2n ions including and beyond the pathions but what if one or both lindices in a candidate dmz pairing exceed g rather than answer directly we use the roundabout theorem of last section given a dmz involving assessors with lindices u g and g we are assured a full boxkite exists with a trefoil ltrip u g g u the remaining assessors being their strut opposites then have lindices uopp g s and g u s as u varies from 1 to 7 skipping s 8 zeropadding assures us that all dmzs from prior cdp generations exist for higher n for all lindices u v 8 only those boxkites created by zeropadding from priorgeneration boxkites of which there can be but 1 inherited per fixed s among the 7 found in the pathions for instance will have all lindices g for all others the model shown with those having g as an lindex must obtain hence only one strut will have lindices  g the rest being comprised of some w with lindex 8 the others deriving their lindices from the xor of w with the strut just mentioned or with s but what will guarantee that any edgecurrents will exist between arbitrary assessors with lindices u g and g k 0 k g since there is not even one dmz to be found among assessors with lindices g in the candidate boxkite they would share we can now narrow the focus of our original question considerably by making use of the curious computational fact we called the tripcount twostep in part is preliminary arguments concerning cdp we showed that the number of associative triplets in a given generation of 2n ions or tripn can be derived from a simple combinatoric formula call the count of complete boxkites in an et bkns for s 8 bkns tripn2 provided all lindices g k 0 k g form dmzs in the candidate boxkites implied to begin an induction let us consider a new construction along familiar lines which will provide us an easy way to comprehend the pathion tripsystems of all s 8 beginning with n 5 we designate tripn2 trips for each s 8 as type rule 0 in the manner the singleton 22 ion trip 1 2 3 was used in our introductions wokcooking discussion which part i section 5 used as the basis of its slipcover proofs but now instead of putting the octonions g 4 in the center of the psl27 triangle we put the sedenions 8 for consistency of examples we continue to assume s 1 so well begin with 3 6 5 the zigzag ltrip for s 1 in the sedenions and also by zeropadding an ltrip zigzag for 1 of the 7 boxkites with s 1 among the pathions extending rays from the 3 6 5 midpoints through the center creates rule 1 trips which end in 11 14 13 a b c get sent to f e d respectively the rule 2 trips along the sides in order of zigzag lindex inclusion then correspond to trefoil utrips all oriented clockwise they read symbolically literally as follows ead 14 3 13 dbf 13 6 11 fce 11 5 14 we claim each of these 7 lines when its nodes are attached to their strut opposites map 1to1 to an s 1 pathion boxkite we have this as a given for the rule 0 trip we need to explain this for the rule 1 trips which roundabout already tells us are boxkites and we need to prove it for the rule 2 trips that make the sides and once we do prove it and frame the suitable induction for all higher n the task which originally motivated us will be done for these utrips house the assessors with lindices g whose candidate boxkites dont include g the rule 1 trips in all instances within this example correspond to assessor lindices a d e with g 8 at d the third vizier tells us c 8 s sedenion x a b c thereby reads within the sedenions as a a x but in the pathions all 3 terms are less than g hence can comprise an lindex trip for a sail  and specifically a zigzag else the order of a and x would be reversed simi16 larly the old sedenion f f are the new pathion f e with the new trip f c e being the third viziers way of saying f x f from the sedenions vantage for the rule 2 trips we prove one relation in one of them a dmz which roundabout tells us implies the whole boxkite while symmetry allows us to assume the same of the other two consider then the ade trefoil utrip instantiated by 3 13 14 in our example specifically compute the product of the assessors containing a and d c g as lindices their uindices within the pathions must be g a s g f and g g c s g g d respectively we write their dyads when multiplying with opposite inner signs as we assume their dmz is an edge in a zigzag we claim the truth of this arithmetic c g g g d  g f g g e b g b g g g e bottom left a b c a c g b g rule 2 with n 4 bottom right a d e a g e g d a g g d g g e rule 2 twice n 4 then n 5 upper dyads inner sign reverses that of product top left f c e e g c g f g f c g g e g rule 2 twice n 4 then n 5 top right f d b b g d g f b g g f g g d rule 2 twice n 4 then n 5 upper dyads inner sign reverses that of product a similar brief exercise with either dmz formed with the emanated assessor will show it too has a negative inner sign with respect to a positive in its dmz partner two negative edgesigns in one sail means zigzag means three negative edgesigns in fact our proof up through the pathions is complete we need only indicate the existence of a constructive mechanism for pursuing this same strategy as n grows arbitrarily large consider now the same psl27 triangle but in its center put a 16 g g2 for the 64d chingons after the 64 hexagrams of the i ching to give them a name then put all 7 of the pathions s 1 zigzag ltrips into the rule 0 circle one gets 3 7 21 rule 2 zigzag ltrips and the 10 integers g found in them and the 7 rule 0 zigzag ltrips implies there are 10 rule 1 trefoil ltrips each associated with a distinct boxkite but that would make for 7 21 10 38 zigzag ltrips when we know there can only be 35 the extra 3 indicate theres some doubleduty occurring specifically 3 of the rule 1 trefoil ltrips in fact designate not the standard a d e but f d b with d g 16 in each instance when 5 14 11 is fed into our trip machine as rule 0 circle both 11 16 27 and 14 16 30 map to f d b trips tied to rule 0 zigzag lindices 10 27 17 and 15 30 17 whose a d e trips appear as rays on triangles for 3 10 9 and 3 13 14 respectively 11 16 27 also shows as an f d b with rule 0 trip 6 11 13 readers are encouraged to use the code in the appendix to 4 to generate ets for low s and n tripmachining details for our s 1 example are in appendix a for n 7 use the 35 justderived s 1 ltrips as rule 0 circles with a central 32 and so on 4 the number hub theorem s 2n2 for 2n ions given the lengths required to prove the fullness of ets for s 8 it might be surprising to realize that the infinite number of cases for s 2n2 for all 2n ions are so simple to handle that they almost prove themselves yet the proof of this number hub theorem while technically trivial has farreaching implications theorem 10 for all 2n ions with zds n 3 and s g g2 all nonlong diagonal entries in the emanation table are filled more each such filled cell in the ets upper left quadrant is unmarked indeed indicates an edgecurrent in a zigzag further the row column and cell entries are isomorphic to those found in an unsigned cdpgenerated multiplication table for the 2n2 ions finally the tripn2 zigzag lindex sets which underwrite its boxkites are precisely all and only those trips contained in said 2n2 ions the et effectively serving as their highlevel atlas proof as the largest lindex of any assessor is 2g 1 and each s in the ets in question is precisely g then the row column labels will ascend from 1 to g 1 in simple increments from top to bottom left to right in the upper left quadrant making its square of filled cells isomorphic to unsigned entries in the corresponding 2n2 ion multiplication table also all these filled cells of the et will only contain xors of indices g hence all and only lindex trips will have the edges of their necessarily zigzag sails residing in said quadrant all nonlongdiagonal cells in the et are meanwhile filled since all candidate assessors have form m m g g m and for any cpo triplet a b c whose row and column labels plus cell entry are contained in the upper left quadrant it is easy to show that the following arithmetic is true b g g b a g g a g g c c c g g c therefore the tripn2 boxkites the zigzag lindex set of each of which is one of the tripn2 trips contained in the 2n2 ions all have this simple form a b c d e f a b c g c g b g a remarks as will become ever more evident powers of 2 which is to say singleton 1bits in indefinitely long binary bitstrings play a role in zd number theory most readily analogized to that of primes in traditional studies and while integer triples from pythagoras to fermat play a central role in primefactorbased traditional studies all xor triplets at two cdp generations remove from the power of 2 in question are collected by its et in this new approach all other integers sufficiently large meaning 8 are meanwhile associated with fractal signatures to each of which is linked a unique infinitedimensional space spanned by zd diagonals but can such a vantage truly be called number theory at all we say indeed it can that it is in fact the new kind of number theory that must accompany stephen wolframs new kind of science in his massive 2002 book he tells us that common wisdom to the contrary complex behavior can be derived from the simplest arithmetical behavior the obstacle to seeing this resides in the common wisdom itself 5 p 116  traditional mathematics makes a fundamental idealization it assumes that numbers are elementary objects whose only relevant attribute is their size but in a computer numbers are not elementary objects instead they must be represented explicitly typically by giving a sequence of digits but that ultimately implies strings of 0s and 1s where the matter of importance becomes which places in the string are held and which are vacant the original meaning of our decimal notations sense of itself as placeholder arithmetic the study of zero divisors placeholder substructures then becomes the natural way to investigate the composite characteristics of numbers qua bitstrings when we discover in what follows that composite integers meaning those requiring multiple bits to be represented are inherently linked when seen as strutconstant bitstrings with infinitedimensional metafractals the continuation of the quote on the following page should ring true in traditional mathematics the details of how operations performed on numbers affect sequences of digits are usually considered quite irrelevant but precisely by looking at such details we will be able to see more clearly how complexity develops in systems based on numbers the sand mandala flipbook 8 s 16 n 5 in the first concrete exploration of zd phenomenology beyond the sedenions 6 pp 1319 a startling set of patterns were discovered in the ets for values of s beyond the bott limit that is for 8 s 16 the upper bound being the g of the 32d pathions the filled cells sufficed to define not 7 but only 3 boxkites for n 5 more the primary geometric figures in each such et transformed into each other with each integer increment of s in a manner exactly reminiscent of the flipbooks which anticipated cartoon animation while these seemed perplexing in mid2002 when they were found their logic is in fact profoundly simple first each such ets s is just the x of one already seen in the sedenions we continue our convention of using g to indicate the g of the prior cdp generation employ s for said generations s and reference all prior assessor indices by suffixing their letters with asterisks then since s g s the trip s g g s mandates by the first vizier whose signed version we invoke due to the direct derivation from the sedenions that g must belong to the zigzag sail if its to be an assessor lindex at all note that this is not a truly legitimate argument as well see shortly albeit the results are correct as shown by other means in 6 this is because type ii boxkites first emerge in this current context but are not among the 3 x 7 flipbook denizens of immediate interest we will assume for simplicity of presentation that the first vizier does obtain here proving that it does however requires a background argument concerning type ii boxkites their s values must be less than g hence none of our flipbook candidates can qualify but they are just as numerous as the flipbook boxkites there being 3 for each of the seven values of s g for their listing and theoretical framing of type ii phenomenology see appendix b we will content ourselves here with giving this as an empirical result and assume therefore the validity of the signed version of the first vizier in the case at hand based on this assumption we can further claim that the sedenion vent lindices f e d must also be associated with zigzag assessors by an argument exactly akin to that of last section we then have 3 candidate boxkites to consider since the 3 vent lindices are all less than g they must be mapped to the 3 assessors a g 8 must adhere to b and s 1 to e while the lindices of the c assessors associated with f e d must be a b c respectively the proof is easy taking the new a c assessors f g g a and g g s in that order as readily generalizable representatives we do the arithmetic g g s  f g g a g a f g  f g g a the bottom left is just rule 1 for the bottom right start with the first vizier  f a s f g s g a f g s g a the top left is derived thus a g g a g g a g g a g g a g g a finally a s f g a g f s g g a g s g f but the negative inner sign of the top dyad reverses sign as shown the 3 boxkites thus derived are the only among the 7 candidates to be viable for the zigzag lindex of the s 1 sedenion boxkite does not underwrite a sail hence by what lawyers would call a fruit of the poisoned tree argument neither do the 3 utrips associated with the same failed zigzag using a and b then invoking the roundabout theorem we see this readily b g g e a g g f g g d c c g g d not zero only cs cancel with the appending of two successive bits to the left the bottomleft and topright products are identical to those obtaining without the g g being included similarly the topleft product uses rule 2 twice to similar effect but with g g included in the outcome since f d b is cpo we then get g g d for the topright result meanwhile the two high bits induce a double reversal then are killed by xor leaving the product the same as if they hadnt been there  f c e g e c g f g g f c g g e hence c we have an argument reminiscent of theorem 2 depending on the inner sign of the upper dyad one pair of products cancels or the other but not both we see then that the construction given without explanation at the end of part i is correct the arguments given there concerning the vital relationship of a boxkites nonzd structures to semiotic modeling suggest that this offing to use the appropriately binary slang linked to mafia hitmen of a zigzags 4 triplets should have a similarly significant role to play in such modeling this has bearing not just on semiotic but physical models since the key dynamic fact implicit in the zigzag l and u trips or just ztrips henceforth is their similarity of orientation since a b c a bc a bc a b c are all cpo as written we are effectively allowed to do pairwise swaps of upper and lower case lettering among them without inducing anything a physicist might deem observable eg a 180 reversal or spin quantum this condition of trip sync breaks down as soon as we attempt to allow similar swapping between ztrips and their trefoil compatriots in particular those 2 which dont share an assessor with the zigzag the toy model of 7 would use these features to designate the basis of a creation pressure that leads to the output of the string theorists e8 e8 symmetry this symmetry as discussed there breaks in the standard models when one of the primordial e8 s decays into an e6 which has 72 roots to parallel the 72 filled cells of our sand mandalas for present purposes the key aspect of this correspondence is that in zd theory at least the explosion of a singleton boxkite into a sand mandalic trinity throws the offswitch on the source of the dynamics the ztrips which underwrite trip sync no longer even underwrite boxkites the whole scenario suggests nothing so much as those boxes which when opened by pushing an external lever emit an arm which pulls up on the same lever forcing the box to close and the arm to return to its hiding place inside it lets turn now to the et graphics of the flipbook sequence so suggestive of cellular automata for each of the 7 ets in question all labels g are monotonically increasing since s and hence their strut opposites exceed them all but the only filled but for longdiagonal crossings rows and columns will be those with labels equal to s g s and its strutopposite g for these lindices reside at e and b respectively in all 3 boxkites in the ensemble hence either dyad containing one of them makes dmzs within each of the trios a d e and f d b sails filling all 12 24 2 minus 2 for diagonals fillable cells in each row or column tagged with these assessors label thus as s is incremented two parallel sets of perpendicular lines of et cells start off defining a square missing its corners then these parallels move in unit increments toward each other until they form a 2ply crossbar once s 7 s 15 24 cells each have row label r or column label c  s 24 reside in lines with label g and 24 more have their contents p s or g these last have an orderliness that is less obvious but by the last et in the flipbook they have arrayed themselves to form the edges of a diamond orthogonal to the long diagonals and meeting up with the crossbar at its four corners with s 7 values filling the upwardpointing edges and g 8s those sloping down the graphics for the flipbook first appeared in 6 p 15 they were recycled on p 13 of 8 larger easilyread versions of these ets were then included along with numerous other chingonbased flipbooks and other graphics well discuss later as

especially encouraged to explore the last whose 78 slides can be thought of as the visual accompaniment to this monograph henceforth references to numbered slides will be to those contained and indexed in it 6 64d spectrography 3 ingredients for recipe theory in a manner clearly related to bott periodicity strut constants fall into types demarcated by multiples of 8 but unlike the familiar modulo 8 categorization of types demonstrated perhaps most familiarly in the clifford algebras of various dimensions the situation with zerodivisors concerns not typology which keeps producing new patterns at all dimensions but granularity as we shall see emanation tables for s 8 and not a power of 2 aside from diagonally aligned cells in otherwise empty stretches display checkerboard layouts of parallel and perpendicular nearsolid lines nsls whose cells all have emanations save for a pair of longdiagonal crossings and whose visual rhythms are strictly governed by s and 8 or the latters higher multiples the rule we found in the 32d pathions for the sand mandalas indicates that the basic pattern and bk5 s for 8 s 16 is essentially the same for all of them we put the qualifying phrase in quotes as it is an open question at this point what features residing at what depth are indeed the same and which are different for the moment we will invoke the term spectrographic equivalence as a sort of promissory note hoping to stuff ever more elements into its grabbag of properties beginning with two first is something at once intuitively obvious but not readily proven we will include a corollary to a later theorem when we have done so since the first 8 possible strutconstant values all display maximallyfilled ets and since anomalies displayed by higher values are strictly sideeffects of bits to the left of the 8bit which are of course its multiples it is natural to assume that any recursive induction upon simpler forms will echo this octave structure that each time s passes a new multiple of 8 it participates in a new type as with the sand mandalas we will see this means that bkn s for the new 7 or 8element spectral band of new forms will differ from that found in its predecessor band this will lead in the most clearcut cases s 15 or a multiple of 8 not a power of 2 say to grids composed of 8 x 8 boxes some or all of whose borders are nsls how we determine which cases are clearcut meanwhile and why and how we might want or need to privilege them leads to our second property to include upfront in our grabbag in a manner reminiscent of the various tricks like minors and cofactors used in classical matrix theory to prove two matrices are equivalent we can transform members of a spectral band into each other by certain formal methods of handwaving with the sand mandalas for instance we could replace concrete indices in the row and column labels with abstract designations referencing the a b c values of each of their 3 boxkites listed in one of a number of predetermined orders by leastfirst cpo ordering of such a b c triplets in a sequence determined by the zigzag ltrip of the sedenion boxkite we can derive them from for instance which is equivalent to the 3 sandmandalic boxkites d values as weve seen since which cells are filled is strictly determined by s and g such designations eliminate all individuality among the ets in question hence if certain display features of one of them seem convenient we can convert its tone row of indices populating its row and column labels into an abstract layout governed by which index is associated with which assessor in the manner sketched last paragraph we could then use this layout as the template for rewrites of all other ets in the same spectral band knowing that results obtained using the specific instantiation of the band could thereby be converted into exactly analogous ones for the other bandmembers we will in fact implicitly adopt this tactic by using s 1 as an exemplary for instance in numerous arguments while employing the highestvalued s found among the sand mandalas 15 to simplify the visualizing and calculat24 ing of recursive pattern creation for fixeds growing n sequences s 15 is chosen because it has all its low bits filled hence all xors are derived by simple subtraction leaving carrybit overflow to show itself only in what matters most to us the turning off of 4 candidate boxkites in the pathions and as we will show two sections hence 16 in the chingons and 4n4 in all higher 2n ions where we termed for reasons already explained the fixedn growing s sequences flipbooks we designate these new displays for reasons well justify shortly balloonrides while there is but one abstract type for the sedenions with one boxkite for each of the 7 possible s values a second spectral band emerges in the pathions to include the sand mandalas and two more are added for the 64d chingons by induction from the universally shared first band for all n 3 where there are tripn2 boxkites in each et for each s 8 the first new spectrographic addition includes the upper multiple of 8 that bounds it since it is not a power of 2 16 s 24 the second new range though is bounded by g hence does not include it as it is tautologically a power of 2 which powers as we saw two sections ago comply with a type all their own with the same boxkitecount formula as for the lowest spectral band 24 s 32 each of these two new bands displays a distinctive feature which underwrites one of the three key ingredients for the recipe theory we are ultimately aiming for we call these for s ascending sgmodularity and hidefill involution respectively the third key ingredient meanwhile resides in the band that first emerges in the pathions and whose echo in the chingons has recapitulative features sufficiently rich as to merit the name of recursivity we will be devoting part iiis first postintroductory section to a thorough treatment of the simplest instance of this third ingredient showing how to ascend into the metafractal we call the whorfian sky named for the great theorist of linguistics benjamin lee whorf whose lastever lecture on language mind and reality described the layering of meaning in language in a manner strongly suggesting something akin to it among many visionary passages in his descriptions of a future crossdisciplinary science the following seems most apt to serve as the leadin quote for the third and final sweep of our argument 9 patterns form wholes akin to the gestalten of psychology which are embraced in larger wholes in continual progression thus the cosmic picture has a serial or hierarchical character that of a progression of planes or levels lacking recognition of such serial order different sciences chop segments as it were out of the world segments which perhaps cut across the direction of the natural levels or stop short when upon reaching a major change of level the phenomena become of quite different type or pass out of the ken of the older observational methods but the facts of the linguistic domain compel recognition of serial planes each explicitly given by an order of patterning observed it is as if looking at a wall covered with fine tracery of lacelike design we found that this tracery served as the ground for a bolder pattern yet still delicate of tiny flowers and that upon becoming aware of this floral expanse we saw that multitudes of gaps in it made another pattern like scrollwork and that groups of scrolls made letters the letters if followed in a proper sequence made words the words were aligned in columns which listed and classified entities and so on in continual crosspatterning until we found this wall to be a great book of wisdom 10 p 248 appendix a genealogy of s 1 boxkites

justlisted 35 zigzag lindex sets to psl27s with g 32 as rule 0 circles thereby generating the 155 s 1 zigzags found in the 27 ions or routions named for the site of the internet bubbles oncefamed massachusetts miracle route 128 and so on appendix b a brief intro to type ii boxkites the recursive generation of zigzag lsets just presented calls for some close attention when the boxkites involved are type ii since they then have the diagonals of their psl27 triangles oriented differently instead of all 3 leading from midpoints of the rule 2 sides to the corners only 1 of these will preserve orientation for a type ii with the other two having reversed vz1 rules in evidence we first give a construction for producing all the type ii boxkites in the pathions and then indicate the manner in which their workings are intimately connected with the phenomenology of twist products broached in part is theorem 6 the construction was presented with different framing in 8 where we deployed a stereo fano representation using sidebyside triangles the left being a proper psl27 within the pathions there are 7 distinct boxkites for each s except for the flipbook trios one for each s 8 and for s 8 exactly we saw in our discussion of the number hub theorem that we can build all 7 by placing 8 in the center of the standard fano what well call psl27 henceforth then taking the zigzag ltrip for each sedenion s and placing its units at the sides midpoints in the usual cpo order in left right and bottom sides respectively each of these 7 lines then generates a new boxkite in the pathions for the sedenion s in question if we reinscribe the starterkit ltrip but change g to the pathions 16 applying vz2 gives us new uindex terms but the lindex terms for all 6 assessors remain the same as for the sedenion boxkite we call this rule 0 instance the zeropadded boxkite or just zp for the s value in question if we take the 3 rule 1 triplets along the struts and place them not at the a b c positions of our new pathion boxkites but instead at a d e with 8 always winding up at d we generate 3 more standard type i boxkites for s 1 the sedenion zigzag ltrip is just 3 6 5 and each of its units becomes the lowindex a for a new pathion boxkite with lindices written in nested parentheses order that is a b c d e f as follows 3 10 9 8 11 2 6 15 9 8 14 7 5 12 9 8 13 4 but if we take the 3 rule 2 triplets along the edges mapping the zigzag unit at the center of each to the lowindex a of a new boxkite the 8 doesnt show at any assessor and two of the three struts will have orientations reversed these type ii boxkites again for s 1 written per the same convention just used for their 8bearing siblings read like this 3 13 14 15 12 2 6 11 13 12 10 7 5 14 11 10 15 4 since the a and f lowindex terms are the same as in the sames sedenion boxkite the strut they make obviously has the standard orientation but note that there is nothing essential about the af strut here the placing of the lowestindexed unit of the zigzag ltrip at a is a convenient convention and its employment in the pathions suffices to induce this effect however it no longer suffices in higher dimensions where s can exceed 8 yet still be less than that their being type ii is an immediate sideeffect of rule 2 in this method of deriving them should be obvious what is less obvious is their special relationship with twist products here we review some of the basics in the sedenions whenever two assessors bound an edge we can swap a pair of corresponding terms either l or u indices and then switch the sign joining the l and u indices in the resultant pairing and get an assessor in another boxkite as a result such twist products then reverse the edgesign of a given line of zds as we move between containing boxkites moreover such twists are naturally investigated in the context of the squares not the triangles of the octahedral vertex figure we write assessors on the three orthogonal catamarans then instead of the four touchingonlyatthevertices sails thats because opposite sides of a catamaran twist to assessors in the same boxkite so that each catamaran lets one twist to two different boxkites with the terminal catamaran in each case being further twistable into the boxkite you didnt twist to in the first instance as shown in the twisted sister and royal hunt diagrams of 4 these triple transforms can be represented in their own fano planes with the indices placed on their loci now corresponding to the strut constants of a septet of boxkites each catamaran comprises the pathways connecting 4 assessors meaning it doesnt connect up with either term of the third strut in its boxkite it is not hard to see that the strut constant of the boxkite one twists to is equal to the strutopposite of the term which completes the ltrip of the edge being twisted in the first place hence any lindex term on a sedenion boxkite corresponds to the strut constant of another such boxkite one can twist to this suggests expanding the meaning of twist product to embrace pairings which share a strut rather than an edge for if we allow this we can then treat the third strut orthogonal to the square hosting twists as the mast of the catamaran giving us an expanded sense of this latter term which allows us a major simplification instead of thinking of the sedenions zds as distributed among 7 distinct boxkites we can see them all included in one embroidered boxkite diagram which we call a brocade each of the 12 boxkite edges allows twists to a pair of different assessors lets say a b and b a in the boxkite with s copp d more the s x pair which we can think of as in the boxkites center can be twisted with all 6 assessors in the original boxkite to yield 12 more we therefore have 6 24 12 the total set of 42 assessors in the sedenions all representable on any one of the 7 component boxkites as a unitary brocade it would be nice to be able to generalize the brocade notion so as to reduce the number of basic structures in higherorder contexts in the pathions for instance there are 77 boxkites all but 21 of which are type i with 21 of those coming in sandmandala triples 7 forming the s 8 atlas plus 7 zps and 3 7 strongboxes so called because these lows boxkites contain pieces of 8 completing the collection but if we also count in the 4 7 28 missing boxkites for high s we can collapse our head count from 105 boxkitelike structures to 15 brocades miming the sedenion situation the 7 zps form the simplest the 7 sandmandala trios intermingle with the atlas septet and the 21 strongboxes to make 7 more brocades and the 21 type ii boxkites twist into each other to fill out one catamaran in each and into the hidden boxkites linked with high s filling out two more catamarans per type ii instance yielding up the final set of 7 brocades we note that the type ii situation is not as mysterious as it might appear once we recall the slipcover proof logic of part i section 5 with 2 of 3 strut triplets being reversed tugging on a type iis fano will tend to send a reversed arrow onto an edge 4 times out of 6 meaning that in all such cases the corollary to theorem 7 and hence the theorem itself will fail thereby explaining the why of missing boxkites we gain the generalized brocade simplification at a very small price relaxing the notion of twist product to embrace source and target l and u index pairs which arent necessarily zerodivisors within the context of the g at hand but this is an investment which pays dividends since it allows us to use type ii structures as middlemen to facilitate studying the hidden boxkite substructures of the metafractal white space in highs ets given the semiotic and semantic importance of zdfree structures recall that our transcription of petitots analysis of greimas semiotic square into zerodivisor theory is based on zdfree strut opposites we can expect a richness of results based on catamaran study that should at least equal that we are conducting based on sails for a coming attraction interested readers should see the online powerpoint slideshow linked with our nks 2007
