department of physics graduate school of science university of tokyo tokyo 1130033 we investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the f 1 spinor boseeinstein condensate bec based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear schrdinger equation with a selffocusing nonlineality we apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions the resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions onesoliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner according to the behaviors at the infinity they are classified into two kinds domainwall dw type and phaseshift ps type the dwtype implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the pstype implies the polar state where the total spin amounts to zero we also discuss twosoliton collisions in particular the spinmixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the dwtype the results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons as a result we establish the robustness and the usefulness of

2002 matterwave bright solitons in quasionedimensional 1d boseeinstein condensates becs were observed experimentally1 2 bright solitons propagate in most cases with much larger amplitudes than dark solitons3 4 and are expected to have the potential for various applications such as coherent transport and atom interferometry soliton propagation in bec can be described by the grosspitaevskii gp equation the gp equation called the nonlinear schrdinger nls equation in nonlinear science is integrable and has soliton solutions in a onedimensional and uniform system recent experimental and theoretical advances about matterwave bright solitons are reviewed for instance in ref 5 the experimental creation of matterwave solitons has been so far achieved only for singlecomponent bec it is nevertheless very interesting to consider soliton propagation in bec with internal degrees of freedom socalled spinor bec when bec of ultracold alkali atoms is trapped exclusively by optical means the hyperfine spin of atoms remains liberated the spinor bec was realized in such a way68 internal degrees of freedom endow solitons with a multiplicity the multiple solitons will show a rich variety of dynamics here we focus on the boson system in the f 1 hyperfine spin state exemplified by 23 na 39 k and 87 rb the multicomponent gp equation for f 1 spinor bec turns to an integrable model at special points which is mathematically equivalent to the matrix nls equation an integrable model with a selffocusing nonlineality enables one to perform exact analysis via the inverse scattering method ism for the matrix nls equation9 in particular bright soliton solutions under vanishing boundary conditions vbc are obtained whose properties are investigated in refs 10 and 11 recently the ism for the matrix nls equation under nonvanishing boundary conditions nvbc is formulated12 dark solitons in the f 1 spinor bec can be investigated by applying the ism under nvbc to an integrable model with a selfdefocusing nonlineality13 although the ism under nvbc is dedicated mainly to the selfdefocusing case we note that this technique is also applicable to an integrable model with a selffocusing nonlineality which makes us available to bright soliton solutions with a finite background in this paper the detail of matterwave bright solitons in the quasi1d f 1 spinor bec is further investigated based on an integrable model we consider matterwave spinor bright solitons traveling on a finite background of the condensate we write down explicitly new soliton solutions and verify that the obtained soliton solutions have the similar properties compared to those without a background in the usual experimental setups the condensates are confined in a finitesize regime and the matterwave bright solitons will accompany a finite background the study given in this paper is meaningful in such realistic circumstances the paper is organized as follows in 2 the gp equation for quasi1d f 1 spinor bec is introduced in particular the integrable model is presented there the interactions between two atoms are supposed to be interatomic attractive and ferromagnetic which lead to bright 218 j phys soc jpn full paper solitons in 3 the inverse scattering method under nonvanishing boundary conditions is applied to the integrable model this application leads to bright soliton solutions with a finite background several conserved quantities of the model are also provided onesoliton solutions are investigated in 4 the spin states of onesolitons are classified assuming that discrete eigenvalues are purely imaginary twosoliton solutions are discussed in 5 the last section  6 is devoted to the concluding remarks 2 gp equation for f 1 spinor boseeinstein condensates for bec of ultracold alkali atoms the meanfield theory works well because almost all atoms go into condensation and the condensate is dilute in this paper we deal with the quasionedimensional system atoms in the f 1 hyperfine spin state have three magnetic substates labeled by the magnetic quantum number mf 1 0 1 the system is charac terized by a vectorial field operator with the components corresponding to each substate  1 0 1 t satisfying equaltime commutation relations  x t x t x x where the subscripts take on 1 0 1 in the framework of the meanfield theory for bec the quantum field is replaced with the order parameter x t hx ti 1 x t 0 x t 1 x tt x t is often called the spinor condensate wavefunction which is normalized to the total number of atoms nt dx x tx t nt the spinor condensate wavefunction obeys a set of coupled evolution equations namely the multicomponent gp equation it 1 2 2 x 1 c0 c2 1 2 0 2 1 c0 c2 1 2 1 c2 1 20 it 0 2 2 x 0 c0 c2 1 2 1 2 0 c0 0 2 0 2c2 0 1 1 it 1 2 2

coupling constants f are given by14 42 af ma 1 caf a 318 j phys soc jpn full paper where af are the swave scattering lengths in the total hyperfine spin f channel a is the size of the transverse ground state m is the atomic mass and c 12 146 note that one may change the values of c0 and c2 by tuning a equation 4 is derived as follows the interaction between two atoms in the f 1 hyperfine spin state has a form15 16 v x1 x2 x1 x2 c0 c2 f 1 f 2 where f i is the spin operator the grosspitaevskii energy functional is thus given by c2 t c0 x x f f egp dx where repeated subscripts 1 0 1 should be summed up and f fx fy fz t with fi i x y z being 3 3 spin1 matrices then the variational principle it x t egp x t for 1 0 1 yields eq 4 an important fact is that eq 4 possesses a completely integrable point when c0 c2 c 0 equivalently 20 2 010 11 this condition is realized when a 3c a0 a2 2a0 a2 assuming that a0 a2 a2 a0 0 holds the situation corresponds to attractive c0 0 and fer romagnetic c2 0 interaction when we change the wavefunction by 1 20 1 t and measure time and length in units of t a c and x a 2mc respectively we can rewrite eq 4 with c0 c2 c 0 into the dimensionless form it 1 x2 1 21 2 20 2 1 21 20 it 0 x2 0 21 2 0 2 1 2 0 20 1 1 it 1 x2 1 21 2 20 2 1 21 20 then eq 9 is found to be equivalent to a 2 2 matrix version of the nls equation with a selffocusing nonlinearity it q x2 q 2qq q o with an identification 1 0 0 1 the matrix nls equation 10 is integrable in the sense that the initial value problem can be solved via the inverse scattering method9 12 the integrability of the reduced equations 9 is thus proved automatically thus we have derived the integrable spinor model another integrable point of eq 4 is c0 c2 c 0 ie the matrix nls equation with a self defocusing nonlineality13 special solutions for generic coupling constants c0 c2 are given in ref 17 418 j phys soc jpn full paper 3 bright solitons with a finite background we consider bright soliton solutions of the integrable model 9 under nvbc whereas those under vbc are studied in refs 10 and 11 we summarize briefly the results of the inverse scattering method for eq 9 with nvbc12 we define the nonvanishing boundary conditions as qx t q x q q q q 20 i where 0 is a positive real constant and i denotes a 2 2 unit matrix note that vanishing boundary conditions are recovered as 0 0 the analysis of the ism under nvbc yields the standard form of the multiple soliton solutions of the 2 2 matrix nls equation with a selffocusing nonlineality 10 as 1 e1 i 2ii z  is qx t 0 e n en here a 2 2 complex matrix j is called the polarization matrix s is a 2n 2n matrix defined by ij i sij  j j ii j  i i j j i ei 1 i j n where j is a complex discrete eigenvalue for the bound state and j 2j 20 12 with im j 0 for j 1 n it is required for the ism under nvbc that a twosheet riemann surface is introduced appropriately due to a doublevalued function j the phase of the carrier wave x t is given by x t kx k2 220 t and the coordinate function is given by j j x t 2ij x 2j kt the above solution is the m n2soliton solution the ism under nvbc for the selffocusing case results in pairs of discrete eigenvalues corresponding to each riemann sheet the constraint should be imposed on j and j j 1 n such that 2l1 2l and  for l 1 n2 at the same time must satisfy that 2l1 2l 2l1 2l for our reduction to the integrable model for f 1 spinor bec we must make the potential q symmetric noting eq 11 the symmetry of q is naturally reflected in j when we take every j to be symmetric in eq 13 soliton solutions of the integrable model 9 under nvbc are obtained 518 j phys soc jpn full paper the form 13 is the standard form of soliton solutions in the sense that the boundary value at x ej 0 is supposed to be fixed as qx t eixt 0 i x the spinor model however allows the su 2 transformation of the solutions if they are kept symmetric to be concrete let u be a 2 2 unitary matrix when q is a solution of eq 10 with eq 11 then q uqu t is also a solution assuming that q is the standard form 13 the limit x of q becomes q eixt 0 u u t 0 q x q u u t is the socalled cholesky decomposition the arbitrary boundary conditions q other than eq 17 are thus realized via the su 2 transformation on the other hand the behavior in the limit x varies depending on whether det 0 or not which will be discussed later for the onesoliton case there is another important concept about an integrable model due to the integrability the model has the infinite conservation laws which restrict the dynamics of the system in an essential way several conserved quantities related to the physical quantities of the system are listed below total number nt dx nx t nx t tr q q tr q q total spin f t dx f x t f x t tr q q total momentum pt dx px t px t itr q qx tr q qx total energy t dx x t x t ctr qx qx q qq q tr qx qx q q q q here x y z t are the pauli matrices to avoid the divergence of integrals we should subtract the contribution of the background from the physical quantities except the total spin to which the background does not contribute explicitly these subtractions are emphasized by the bars on the conserved densities and quantities the local spin density f fx fy fz t is covariant under the su 2 transformation 18 whereas the other densities such as nx t 618 j phys soc jpn full paper px t and x t are invariant the total macroscopic spin is directed to face to an arbitrary direction by the global spin rotation the su 2 symmetry of the system causes the energy degenerated states of solitons for this spin rotation 4 onesoliton solutions in this section onesoliton solutions of the integrable spinor model 9 are investigated in detail we can derive the explicit form of onesoliton solutions by setting n 2 m 1 in the formula 13 the calculation is complicated but straightforward the result is as follows ixt q 0 e i 2i det s where det s is given by det s 21 22 e1 1 1 22 tr ex2 2 21 2 tr  e1 2 1 2 1 2

2 2 det 12 tr i  e1 22 1 det 22 tr i  e21 22 1 2 det 2 i we explain physical meanings of notations the phase of the carrier wave is given by x t kx k2 220 t let j and j 2j 20 12 for j 1 2 be complex constants satisfying 1 2 and 1 2 without loss of generality we assume that 1 1 2 2 belongs to the upper lower riemann sheet which is characterized such that im im 0 im im 0 j x t is expressed in terms of them as 1 1 x t 2i1 x 21 kt 2 2 x t 2i2 x 22 kt note that 1 2 holds re thus denotes the coordinate of the envelope soliton whereas im implies the selfmodulation phase the polarization matrix is a 22 symmetric 718 j phys soc jpn full paper matrix here the normalization in a sense of the square norm is imposed on as a matter of convenience 22 2 2 1 the other parameters are expedient functions of 0 1 and 2 i0 j 1 2  i0  j  1 2 2 j j  j j 1 2 for j 1 2 we list the meaning of each parameter as follows k wave number of solitons carrier wave 0 amplitude of solitons carrier wave x t phase of

factor this consequence is natural but nontrivial because the formula of solitons under vbc9 is quite different from that under nvbc 13 in particular in the form of the matrix s actually the initial displacement can be arbitrarily changed regardless of eq 38 by the parallel shift of the position x we have shown that the soliton solutions 2426 can be regarded as a general form of bright soliton solutions including the case of vbc 818 j phys soc jpn full paper 41 classification by the boundary conditions we shall show that there are two kinds of onesoliton solutions depending on the boundary conditions det 0 or det 6 0 the similar classification about the boundary conditions also exists for dark solitons13 the examples of snapshots of onesoliton density profiles are shown in fig 1 the upper row is for det 0 and the lower row is for det 6 0 the shape of envelope solitons looks a locallyoscilating wave rather than literally a solitary wave because of the selfmodulation due to the complex velocity for det 0 the boundary conditions of the standard form 2426 are q ei 0 i 1 tr 2 tr tr 2 1i  0 i 2i  1 2 tr 2 1 x x the left and right boundary values differ in not only the global phase but also the population of each component in general that is those are the su 2 rotated boundary conditions in the upper row of fig 1 we see that the envelope soliton of each component forms the domainwall dw shape although it does not manifest in the total number density on the other hand for det 6 0 the boundary conditions are q ei 0 i 1 2  0 1 2i x x in contrast to the case that det 0 both boundary values are diagonal matrices and only the phaseshift ps occurs that is those are the u 1 rotated boundary conditions for the above reasons we call onesoliton solutions the dwtype for det 0 and the pstype for det 6 0 remark the following the spin density profile of dwtype suggests that the total spin is nonzero whereas that of pstype is dipoleshape implying that the total spin amounts to zero see the right panel of fig 1 this observation will be solidified in 43 42 case of purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues the ism performed on riemann sheets involves a doublevalued function of the spectral parameter and it usually renders a very complicated representation of n soliton solutions even for n 1 as is seen from eqs 2426 to simplify an explicit representation it is convenient to assume that j and j are purely imaginary18 the similar approach is employed for the analysis of n soliton solutions of the derivative nls equation under nvbc20 if we take a pair of discrete eigenvalues as 1 1 i0 i0 2 2 i0 i0 where and are positive real numbers such that  1 2 1 918 j phys soc jpn full paper fig 1 snapshots of onesoliton density profiles the upper row is plotted for det 0

modulation is embedded in the polarization matrix namely t e4i0 t when we take the limit 0 0 with 0 and 0 kept finite in eqs 4345 q converges to the form of eqs 3235 accompanying the parameters kr 20 ki k and  ln40 here kr and ki are independent free parameters apart from the trivial initial displacement in this sense in spite of the reduction we can still regard the form of onesoliton solutions 4345 as a general form of those under vbc we can also take another limit that is we consider the reduction to the singlecomponent case if we set k 0 ei 0 0 0 the 11component of q becomes q11 ei20 t 0 20  cos420 t i sin420 t  cosh20 x cos420 t where e the form 49 was given in ref 18 we thus verify that our soliton solutions are also generalization of those for the singlecomponent nls equation under nvbc19 43 spin states in this subsection we discuss the spin states of onesoliton solutions with a finite background by calculating the total spin the conservation law guarantees that we obtain the total spin f t from integrating at arbitrary time therefore we can select the time so that the calculation becomes easier we concentrate on the case of purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues as a result we see that the dwtype is associated with the ferromagnetic state whereas the pstype is associated with the polar state onesoliton solutions for purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues 4345 include those under vbc apart from an initial displacement and therefore the classification about the spin states presented below is wider than that performed before10 11 431 ferromagnetic state for det 0 dwtype we substitute eqs 4345 into eq 21 and calculate the total spin the time t such that tr t tr t 0 is suitable for the calculation the result is 1118 j phys soc jpn full paper as follows 2re   40 2im 2 2 1 2 2 with the modulus f t 2 40 2 the total number of the particles transformed into a soliton nt is calculated by eq 20 nt 40 and the range of the value taken by f t 2 is expressed in terms of nt nt2 f t 2 nt2 40 2 remark that in the vanishing limit 0 0 the modulus of the total spin is always equal to the total number of the particles namely f t nt with nonzero total spin the dwtype of solitons belongs to the ferromagnetic state since interatomic ferromagnetic interactions are supposed here solitons tend to take the ferromagnetic state or dwtype in various contexts of physics the domainwalls are topological solitons related with the symmetry breaking here resulting from the domainwalls the magnetic entity emerges as the spontaneously broken symmetry it is worthy to notice that the case nt f t may happen the background is spinless but its internal spin state appears to be affected on the ground that the ferromagnetic soliton runs over the background thereby the background contributes to the total spin 432 polar state if det 6 0 pstype the solitons show the other magnetic property the time t such that det t det t 0 is suitable for the analysis after lengthy calculations the local spin density at such time is derived as  820 e3 2 p  e2 p sinhp  e 2 2 tr t 2 2 tr t sinh2p  tr t tr t 4det t 2tr t 1 sinhp fy 3220 e3 im 2 p  2 e sinh2p trt tr t sinhp 1218 j

and fz share the same functional form each component of the above local spin density is an odd function of p and in particular it has the node at the same point x0 such that p x0 t 0 namely x0 2kt 20 1 consequently the total spin amounts to zero ft dxf p 0 0 0t for this reason the pstype of solitons on the average belongs to the polar state15 5 twosoliton collision we proceed to the discussion of twosoliton collisions in the integrable spinor model 9 twosoliton solutions are obtained by setting n 4 m 2 in the formula 13 there exist two independent discrete eigenvalues and symmetric polarization matrices respectively ie 1 2 and 1 2 for one of solitons 3 4 and 3 4 for the other each soliton is separated at t then a twosoliton is asymptotically two onesolitons the classification of onesoliton solutions based on the values of the determinants of polarization matrices discussed in the previous section is thus valid for twosoliton solutions the derivation of the explicit form is more complicated than that in the case for onesoliton solutions for the derivative nls equation under nvbc explicit twosoliton solutions and shifts of soliton positions due to collisions between solitons have been analytically obtained in the case of purely imaginary eigenvalues where complexity of calculation is considerably reduced20 this strategy however does not stand in our nls equation under nvbc the reason is understood from eq 46 in the spinor model purely imaginary eigenvalues give two solitons with the same velocity 2k and they do not collide with each other accordingly we can not investigate the properties of collisions for purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues no one has studied explicit multisoliton solutions of the nls equation under nvbc even in the singlecomponent case because of the computational complexity here we graphically show the characteristic behaviors of twosoliton collisions in the spinor model by use of the exact solutions given by the ism referring to them we carry out the qualitative discussions although the presented graphs are depicted for the specific parameters much the same behaviors are observed for arbitrarily selected parameters 1318 j phys soc jpn full paper figure 2 illustrates the behavior of a mutual collision between two pstypes where det 1 6 0 and det 3 6 0 one can see that in all three components both solitons retain their shapes before and after the collision which is the common property with solitons in the singlecomponent case in this sense psps soliton collision is essentially equivalent to twosoliton collision of the singlecomponent nls equation figure 3 illustrates the behavior of a mutual collision between dwtype and pstype where det 1 0 and det 3 6 0 the behavior of collisions between dwtype and pstype is qualitatively alien from that between two pstypes one observes that in pstype much of the population initially inhabiting the hyperfine substate f 1 mf 1i is transferred into the hyperfine substate f 1 mf 0i due to the collision in contrast in dwtype such spin transfer does not occur and the domainwall shape is preserved against the collision this phenomenon can be interpreted as follows dwtype with nonzero spin can affect the internal spin state of pstype whereas pstype which is expected to have zero spin in total does not affect the internal spin state of dwtype this kind of spintransfer phenomenon called the spinswitching has been first predicted for the case of vbc11 due to the conservation laws the total number the total spin and so on are invariant throughout the collision process populationmixing among internal degrees of freedom is permitted as far as the conservation laws are not violated the spinswitching is one of the dynamical processes which make the spinor solitons more interesting finally for a mutual collision between two dwtypes where det 1 det 3 0 the shapes of both solitons are expected to be deformed by the collision since each soliton carries nonzero total spin in fact drastic populationmixing is seen in fig 4 which shows an example of this kind of collisions one finds that domainwalls repel at the collision region rather than collide fig 2 density

properties of matterwave bright solitons with a finite background in the f 1 spinor boseeinstein condensate to perform our analysis concretely we have exploited an integrable spinor model with a selffocusing nonlinearity and the inverse scattering method under nonvanishing boundary conditions the situation 1518 j phys soc jpn full paper that matterwave solitons are located on a finite background fits to the experiments onesoliton solutions are derived explicitly and studied in detail from the point of the mathematical view they offer general forms of bright soliton solutions of the nls equation we have confirmed that our onesoliton solutions include those obtained in the previous works onesoliton solutions are classified into two kinds by the difference of boundary conditions dwtype and pstype the spin density profiles of onesolitons vary depending on the boundary conditions in the case of purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues we have analytically shown that dwtype is in the ferromagnetic state whereas pstype is in the polar state the existence of two distinct magnetic properties for onesoliton solutions also gives rise to fascinating phenomena in the case for twosoliton collisions for example the spinswitching the above results for bright solitons with a finite background agree with those for bright solitons under vbc10 11 and dark solitons13 several problems still remain it is desirable to extend our analysis to the case of general discrete eigenvalues the computations of the conserved quantities other than the total spin are also required one approach is given in appendix in addition we wish to investigate analytical properties of general n soliton solutions under nvbc in the spinor model needless to say too complicated calculations are inevitable for the above problems the remaining problems should be discussed elsewhere we conclude that the properties of the multiple matterwave solitons in the spinor becs are interesting and should be useful in various applications bright solitons are preferable to dark solitons for applications because of the advantage in the propagation distance we hope that our analysis contributes to illuminating dynamical properties of solitons in the spinor becs which should be demonstrated experimentally in near future acknowledgment one of the authors tk acknowledges dr j ieda and dr m uchiyama for valuable comments and discussions appendix several conserved quantities of onesoliton solutions the conserved quantities help us to understand the dynamics of the system in this appendix we calculate the total number the total spin the total momentum and the total energy of the spinor model we assume that in addition to purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues is a real symmetric 2 2 matrix the condition that is a real symmetric matrix is inherent in the selfdefocusing case ie dark solitons12 for onesoliton solutions of purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues 4345 become the

separated from the real one one can see clearly that the onesoliton solutions under vbc 32 are located on a finite background in the form a1 note that the domainwall shape is lost even for det 0 there several conserved quantities of the solitons a1 are calculated by use of eqs 2023 the results for det 0 are given by nt 40  nt 2 f t nt pt nt k 4 2 2 t nt c k 20 0 and those for det 6 0 are given by nt 80 f t 0 0 0t pt nt k 4 2 2 t nt c k 20 0 it is intriguing that for fixed amplitude and discrete eigenvalue nt pt and t of the pstype det 6 0 have just twice values as those of the dwtype det 0 respectively this enables us to interpret that the pstype of solitons is a bound state of the two dwtypes of solitons additionally for fixed amplitude and total number the total energy t of the dw ps n 3 c16 0 which suggests that dwtype is lower than that of the pstype t the dwtype is physically preferable this result is consistent with interatomic ferromagnetic interaction ie c2 0 1718 j phys soc
