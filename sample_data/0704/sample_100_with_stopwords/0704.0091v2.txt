arxiv07040091v2 mathgr 18 aug 2008 groups with finitely many conjugacy classes and their automorphisms ashot minasyan abstract we combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of small cancellation over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely generated torsionfree groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate elements moreover we present several results concerning embeddings into such groups as another application of these techniques we prove that every countable group c can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group n where n is a finitely generated group having kazhdans property t and containing exactly two conjugacy classes 1 introduction we shall start with definition suppose that n 2 is an integer we will say that a group m has the property ncc if there are exactly n conjugacy classes of elements in m note that a group m has 2cc if and only if any two nontrivial elements are conjugate in m for two elements x y of some group g we shall write x y if x and y are conjugate in g and x y if they are not for a group g denote by g the set of all finite orders of elements of g a classical theorem of g higman b neumann and h neumann 8 states that every countable group g can be embedded into a countable but infinitely generated group m where any two elements of the same order are conjugate and m g for any integer n 2 take g z2n2 z and embed g into a countable group m according to the theorem above then cardm cardg n 1 since in addition m will always contain an element of infinite order the theorem of higmanneumannneumann implies that g has ncc another way to construct infinite groups with finitely many conjugacy classes was suggested by s ivanov 15 thm 412 who showed for every sufficiently large prime p there is an infinite 2generated group mp of exponent p possessing exactly p conjugacy classes the group mp is constructed as a direct limit of word hyperbolic groups and as noted in 21 it is impossible to obtain an infinite group with 2cc in the same manner in the recent paper 21 d osin developed a theory of small cancellation over relatively hyperbolic groups and used it to obtain the following remarkable result 2000 mathematics subject classification 20f65 20e45 20f28 key words and phrases conjugacy classes relatively hyperbolic groups outer automorphism groups this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation grant pp00268627 ashot minasyan theorem 11 21 thm 11 any countable group g can be embedded into a 2generated group m such that any two elements of the same order are conjugate in m and m g applying this theorem to the group g z2n2 z one can show that for each integer n 2 there exists a 2generated group with ncc and when n 2 we get a 2generated torsionfree group that has exactly two conjugacy classes the presence of elements of finite orders in the above constructions was important because if two elements have different orders they can never be conjugate so naturally one can ask the following question 1 do there exist torsionfree finitely generated groups with ncc for any integer n 3 note that if g is the finitely generated group with 2cc constructed by osin then the mth direct power gm of g is also a finitely generated torsionfree group which satisfies 2m cc but what if we want to achieve a torsionfree group with 3cc with this purpose one could come up with question 2 suppose that g is a countable torsionfree group and x y g are nonconjugate is it possible to embed g into a group m which has 3cc so that x and y stay nonconjugate in m unfortunately the answer to question 2 is negative as the following example shows example 1 consider the group g1 ha t k tat1 a1 i which is isomorphic to the nontrivial semidirect product z z note that g1 is torsionfree and t is not conjugated to t1 in g1 because t t1 in the infinite cyclic group hti which is canonically isomorphic to the quotient of g1 by the normal closure of a however if g1 is embedded into a 3ccgroup m it is easy to see that every element of m will be conjugated to its inverse indeed if y m 1 and y y 1 then y a a1 for some 1 1 hence y y a contradiction in particular t t1 an analog of the above example can be given for each n 3 see section 3 this example shows that in order to get a positive result one would have to strengthen the assumptions of question 2 let g be a group two elements x y g are said to be commensurable if there exist k l z 0 such that xk is conjugate to y l we will use the notation x y if x and y are commensurable in g in the case when x is not commensurable with y we will write x 6 y observe that commensurability as well as conjugacy defines an equivalence relation on the set of elements of g it is somewhat surprising that if one replaces the words nonconjugate with the words noncommensurable in question 2 the answer becomes positive corollary 12 assume that g is a countable torsionfree group n n n 2 and x1 xn1 g 1 are pairwise noncommensurable then there exists a group m and an injective homomorphism g m such that 1 m is torsionfree and generated by two elements groups with finitely many conjugacy classes 2 m has ncc 3 m is 2boundedly simple 4 the elements x1 xn1 are pairwise noncommensurable in m recall that a group g is said to be kboundedly simple if for any x y g 1 there exist l k and g1 gl g such that x g1 yg11 gl ygl1 in g a group is called boundedly simple if it is kboundedly simple for some k n evidently every boundedly simple group is simple the converse is not true in general for example the infinite alternating group a is simple but not boundedly simple because conjugation preserves the type of the decomposition of a permutation into a product of cycles first examples of torsionfree finitely generated boundedly simple groups were constructed by a muranov see 12 thm 2 13 thm 1 corollary 12 is an immediate consequence of a more general theorem 35 that will be proved in section 3 applying corollary 12 to the group g f x1 xn1 which is free on the set x1 xn1 and its noncommensurable elements x1 xn1 we obtain a positive answer to question 1 corollary 13 for every integer n 3 there exists a torsionfree 2boundedly simple group satisfying ncc and generated by two elements in the case when n 2 the above statement was obtained by osin in 21 cor 13 in fact for any finitely generated torsionfree group h we can set g h f x1 xn1 and then use corollary 12 to embed g into a group m enjoying the properties 1 4 from its claim since there is a continuum of pairwise nonisomorphic 2generated torsionfree groups 4 and a finitely generated group can contain at most countably many of different 2generated subgroups this shows that there must be continually many pairwise nonisomorphic groups satisfying properties 1 3 from corollary 12 recall that the rank rankg of a group g is the minimal number of elements required to generate g in section 4 we show how classical theory of hnnextensions allows to construct different embeddings into infinitely generated groups that have finitely many classes of conjugate elements and in section 5 we use osins results from 21 regarding quotients of relatively hyperbolic groups to prove theorem 14 let h be a torsionfree countable group and let m h be a nontrivial normal subgroup then h can be isomorphically embedded into a torsionfree group q possessing a normal subgroup n q such that  q h n and h n m hence qn  hm  n has 2cc  x y q 1 x y if and only if x y where q qn is the natural homomorphism  rankn 2 and rankq rankhm 2  hm has exactly n 1 conjugacy classes this theorem implies that if qn eg if it is finite then the group q will have ncc and will not be simple if n 3 thus it may be used to build nccgroups in a recursive manner it also allows to obtain embeddings of countable torsionfree groups into nccgroups which we could not get by using corollary 12 for instance as we saw in example 1 the fundamental group of the klein bottle g1 given by 11 can not be embedded into a 3ccgroup m so that t t1 however with 4 conjugacy ashot minasyan classes this is already possible see corollary 55 in section 5 the idea is as follows the group g1 can be mapped onto z3z in such a way that the images of the elements t and t1 are distinct let m be the kernel of this homomorphism one can apply theorem 14 to the pair g1 m to obtain the required embedding of g1 into a group q and since z3z has exactly 3 conjugacy classes the group q will have 4cc an application of theorem 14 to the case when h z and m 2z h also provides an affirmative answer to a question of a izosov from 9 q 1142 asking whether there exists a torsionfree 3ccgroup q that contains a normal subgroup n of index 2 the goal of the second part of this article is to show that every countable group can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of some finitely generated 2ccgroup this problem has some historical background in 11 t matumoto proved that every group is a group of outer automorphisms of some group in contrast there are groups eg z that are not full automorphism groups of any group m droste m giraudet r gbel 7 showed that for every group c there exists a simple group s such that outs  c i bumagina and d wise in 3 proved that each countable group c is isomorphic to outn where n is a 2generated subgroup of a countable c 16group and if in addition c is finitely presented then one can choose n to be residually finite in section 6 we establish a few useful statements regarding paths in the cayley graph of a relatively hyperbolic group g and apply them in section 7 to obtain small cancellation quotients of g satisfying certain conditions finally in section 8 we prove the following theorem 15 let c be an arbitrary countable group then for every nonelementary torsionfree word hyperbolic group f1 there exists a torsionfree group n satisfying the following properties  n is a 2generated quotient of f1  n has 2cc  outn the principal difference between this theorem and the result of 3 is that our group n is torsionfree and simple moreover if one applies theorem 15 to the case when f1 is a torsionfree hyperbolic group with kazhdans property t and recalls that every quotient of a group with property t also has t one will get corollary 16 for any countable group c there is a 2generated group n such that n has 2cc and kazhdans property t and outn the reason why kazhdans property t is interesting in this context is the question from 6 p 134 which asked whether there exist groups that satisfy property t and have infinite outer automorphism groups it can be motivated by a theorem of f paulin 22 which claims that the outer automorphism group is finite for any word hyperbolic group with property t positive answers to this question were obtained using different methods by y ollivier and d wise 14 y de cornulier 5 and i belegradek and d osin 2 corollary 16 not only shows that the group of outer automorphisms of a group n with property t can be infinite but also demonstrates that there are no restrictions whatsoever on outn groups with finitely many conjugacy classes acknowledgements the author would like to thank d osin for fruitful discussions and encouragement 2 relatively hyperbolic groups assume that g is a group h is a fixed collection of subgroups of g called peripheral subgroups and x is a subset of g the subset x is called s a relative generating set of g with respect to h if g is generated by x h in this case g a quotient of the free product f h f x where f x is the free group with basis x let r be a subset of f such that the kernel of the natural epimorphism f g is the normal closure of r in the group f then we will say that g has relative presentation hx h k r 1 r ri if the sets xfand r are finite the relative presentation 21 is said to be finite set h h 1 a finite relative presentation 21 is said to satisfy a linear relative isoperimetric inequality if there exists c 0 such that for every word w in the alphabet x h for convenience we will further assume that x 1 x representing the identity in the group g one has fi1 ri1 fi with equality in the group f where ri r fi f for i 1 k and k ckwk where kwk is the length of the word w the next definition is due to osin see 20 definition the group g is called hyperbolic relative to the collection of peripheral subgroups h if g admits a finite relative presentation 21 satisfying a linear relative isoperimetric inequality this definition is independent of the choice of the finite generating set x and the finite set r in 21 see 20 we would also like to note that in general it does not require the group g to be finitely generated which will be important in this paper the definition immediately implies the following basic facts remark 21 20 a let h be an arbitrary family of groups then the free product g h will be hyperbolic relative to h b any word hyperbolic group in the sense of gromov is hyperbolic relative to the family 1 where 1 denotes the trivial subgroup recall that a group h is called elementary if it has a cyclic subgroup of finite index further in this section we will assume that g is a nonelementary group hyperbolic relative to a family of proper subgroups h an element g g is said to be parabolic if it is conjugated to an element of h for some otherwise g is said to be hyperbolic given a subgroup s g we denote by s 0 the set of all hyperbolic elements of s of infinite order lemma 22 17 thm 43 cor 17 for every g g0 the following conditions hold ashot minasyan 1 the element g is contained in a unique maximal elementary subgroup eg g of g where eg g f g f g n f 1 g n for some n n 2 the group g is hyperbolic relative to the collection h eg g recall that a nontrivial subgroup h g is called malnormal if for every g g h h ghg 1 1 the next lemma is a special case of theorem 14 from lemma 23 for any and any g  h the intersection h gh g 1 is finite if h g and 6 then the intersection h hh h1 is finite in particular if g is torsionfree then h is malnormal provided that h 6 1 lemma 24 20 thm 240 suppose that a group g is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups h s1 sm where s1 sm are word hyperbolic in the ordinary nonrelative sense then g is hyperbolic relative to h lemma 25 19 cor 14 let g be a group which is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups h k suppose that k is finitely generated and there is a monomorphism k h for some then the hnnextension hg t k txt1 x x ki is hyperbolic with respect to h in 21 osin introduced the following notion a subgroup s g is suitable if there exist two elements g1 g2 s 0 such that g1 6 g2 and eg g1 eg g2 1 for any s g with s 0 6 one sets eg g eg s gs 0 which is obviously a subgroup of g normalized by s note that eg s 1 if the subgroup s is suitable in g as shown in 1 lemma 33 if s is nonelementary and s 0 6 then eg s is the unique maximal finite subgroup of g normalized by lemma 26 let h be a family of groups and let f be a torsionfree nonelementary word hyperbolic group then the free product g h f is hyperbolic relative to h and f is a suitable subgroup of g proof indeed g is hyperbolic relative to h by remark 21 and lemma 24 since f is nonelementary there are elements of infinite order x y f such that x 6 y see for example 16 lemma 32 evidently x and y are hyperbolic elements of g that are not commensurable with each other and the subgroups eg x ef x f eg y ef y f are cyclic as elementary subgroups of a torsionfree group hence eg x eg y 1 and thus f is suitable in g lemma 27 21 lemma 23 suppose that g is a group hyperbolic relative to a family of subgroups h and s g is a suitable subgroup then one can find infinitely many pairwise noncommensurable in g elements g1 g2 s 0 such that eg gi eg gj 1 for all i 6 j the following theorem was proved by osin in 21 using the theory of small cancellation over relatively hyperbolic groups and represents our main tool for obtaining new quotients of such groups having a number of prescribed properties groups with finitely many conjugacy classes theorem 28 21 thm 24 let g be a torsionfree group hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups h let s be a suitable subgroup of g and let t u be arbitrary finite subsets of g then there exist a group g1 and an epimorphism  g g1 such that i the restriction of to h u is injective and the group g1 is hyperbolic relative to the collection h ii for every t t we have t s iii s is a suitable subgroup of g1 iv g1 is torsionfree v the kernel ker of is generated as a normal subgroup of g by a finite collection of elements belonging to t s we have slightly changed the originalsformulation of the above theorem s from 21 demanding the injectivity on v h u instead of just h and adding the last point concerning the generators of the kernel the latter follows from the explicit form of the relations imposed on g see the proof of thm 24 in 21 and the former from part 2 of lemma 51 in 21 and the fact that any element from v has length in the alphabet x h at most n where n maxhx h h u 1 3 groups with finitely many conjugacy classes lemma 31 let g be a group and let x1 x2 x3 x4 g be elements of infinite order such that x1 6 xi i 2 3 4 let h hg t k tx3 t1 x4 i be the hnnextension of g with associated cyclic subgroups generated by x3 and x4 then x1 6 x2 proof arguing by contradiction assume that hxl1 h1 xm 2 1 for some h h l m z 0 the element h has a reduced presentation of the form h g0 t1 g1 t2 tk gk where g0 gk g 1 k z 0 and gj  hx3 i if 1 j k 1 and j 0 j1 0 gj  hx4 i if 1 j k 1 and j 0 j1 0 by the assumptions x1 6 x2 hence k 1 and in the group h we have l 1 k  t2 g11 t1 g0 1 hxl1 h1 xm 2 g0 t g1 t t gk x1 gk t where g0 g01 xm 2 g by brittons lemma see 10 iv2 the left hand side in 31 can not be reduced and this can happen only if gk xl1 gk1 belongs to either hx3 i or hx4 i in g which would contradict the assumptions thus the lemma is proved definition suppose that g is a group and xi g i i is a family of subsets we shall say that xi i i are independent if no element of xi is commensurable with an element of xj whenever i 6 j i j i lemma 32 assume that g is a countable torsionfree group n n n 2 and nonempty subsets xi g 1 i 1 n 1 are independent in g then g can be isomorphically embedded into a countable torsionfree group m in such a way that m has ncc and the subsets xi i 1 n 1 remain independent in ashot minasyan proof for each i 1 n 1 fix an element xi xi first we embed g into a countable torsionfree group g1 such that for each nontrivial element g g there exist j 1 n 1 and t g1 satisfying tgt1 xj in g1 and the subsets xi i 1 n 1 stay independent in g1 let g1 g2 be an enumeration of all nontrivial elements of g set g0 g and suppose that we have already constructed the group gk containing g so that for each l 1 k there is j 1 n 1 such that the element gl is conjugated in gk to xj and xi i 1 n 1 are independent in gk suppose at first that gk1 is commensurable in gk with an element of xj xi define gk 1 to be the for some j then gk1 6 h for every h i1i6j hnnextension hgk tk1 k tk1 gk1 t1 k1 xj i by lemma 31 the subsets xi i 1 n 1 will remain independent in gk 1 thus we can assume that gk1 is not commensurable with any element from sn1 i1 xi in gk according to the induction hypotheses one can apply lemma 31 to the hnnextension gk 1 hgk tk1 k tk1 gk1 t1 k1 x1 i to see that the subsets xi g gk 1 i 1 n 1 are independent in gk 1 now set g1 k0 gk evidently g1 has the required properties in the same manner one can embed g1 into a countable torsionfree group g2 so that each nontrivial element of g1 will be conjugated to xi in g2 for some i 1 n 1 and the subsets xi i 1 n 1 continue to be independent in g2 proceeding like that we obtain the desired group m s1 gs by the construction m is a torsionfree countable group which has exactly n conjugacy classes 1 x1 xn1 the subsets xi i 1 n 1 are independent in m because they are independent in gs for each s n corollary 33 in lemma 32 one can add that the group m is 2boundedly simple proof let a torsionfree countable group g and its nonempty independent subsets xi i 1 n 1 be as in lemma 32 let f f a1 an1 b1 bn1 be the free group with the free generating set a1 an1 b1 bn1 and consider the group g f for each i 1 n 1 define xi xi ai a1 i aj bi j 1 n 1 j 6 i where aj bi aj bi a1 j bi using the universal properties of free groups and free products one can easily see that the subsets xi i 1 n 1 are independent in now we apply lemma 32 to find a countable torsionfree nccgroup m containing such that xi i 1 n 1 are independent in m observe that this implies that for any given i 1 n 1 any two elements of xi are conjugate in m for arbitrary x y m 1 there exist i j 1 n 1 such that x ai and x aj bi which and y aj if i j then x y otherwise y aj a1 is a product of two conjugates of aj and hence of y therefore the group m is 2boundedly simple and since g m the corollary is proved groups with finitely many conjugacy classes below is a particular torsionfree case of a theorem proved by osin in 21 thm lemma 34 any countable torsionfree group s can be embedded into a 2generated group m so that s is malnormal in m and every element of m is conjugated to an element of s in m proof following osins proof of theorem 26 from 21 we see that the required group m can be constructed as an inductive limit of relatively hyperbolic groups gi i n more precisely one sets g0 s f2 where f2 is a free group of rank 2 0 idg0 g0 g0 and for each i n one constructs a group gi and an epimorphism i g0 gi so that i is injective on s gi is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to i s and i factors through i1 the group m is defined to be the direct limit of gi i as i ie q g0n where n in keri by lemma 23 i s is malnormal in gi hence the image of s will also be malnormal in m theorem 35 let g be a torsionfree countable group n n n 2 and nonempty subsets xi g 1 i 1 n 1 be independent in g then g can be embedded into a 2generated torsionfree group m which has ncc so that the subsets xi i 1 n 1 stay independent in m moreover one can choose m to be 2boundedly simple proof first according to corollary 33 we can embed the group g into a countable torsionfree group s such that s has ncc and is 2boundedly simple and xi i 1 n 1 are independent in s second we apply lemma 34 to find the 2generated group m from its claim choose any i j 1 n 1 i 6 j and x xi y xj if x and y were commensurable in m the malnormality of s would imply that x and y must be commensurable in s contradicting the construction hence xi i 1 n 1 are independent in m since each element of m is conjugated to an element of s it is evident that m has ncc is torsionfree and 2boundedly simple remark 36 a more direct proof of theorem 35 not using lemma 34 can be extracted from the proof of theorem 51 see section 5 applied to the case when h m it is easy to see that theorem 35 immediately implies corollary 12 that was formulated in the introduction as promised we now give a counterexample to question 2 formulated in the introduction for any n 3 example 2 let g2 ha t k tat1 a2 i be the baumslagsolitar bs1 2group then g2 is torsionfree and the elements t2 t4 t2 are pairwise nonconjugate in g2 since this holds in the quotient of g2 by the normal closure of a suppose that g2 is embedded into a group m having ncc so that t2 t4 t2 are pairwise nonconjugate in m then t2 t2 is the list of representatives of all nontrivial conjugacy classes of m therefore there exist k l 1 n 1 such that t t2 and a t2 consequently t2 t2 and t2 a a2 t2 hence k l n 1 according to the assumptions but this yields t t2  a a 2 t2 ashot minasyan implying that t2 t4 which contradicts our assumptions thus g2 can not be embedded into a nccgroup m in such a way that t t2 remain pairwise nonconjugate in m 4 normal subgroups with ncc if m is a normal subgroup of a group h then h naturally acts on m by conjugation we shall say that this action preserves the conjugacy classes of m if for any h h and a m there exists b m such that hah1 bab1 lemma 41 let g be a torsionfree group n g and x1 xl n 1 be pairwise noncommensurable in g elements then there exists a partition n 1 k1 xk of n 1 into a disjoint union of gindependent subsets x1 xl such that xk xk for every k 1 l moreover each subset xk will be invariant under conjugation by elements of g proof since is an equivalence relation on g 1 one can find the corresponding decomposition g 1 jj yj where yj is an equivalence class for each j j for each k 1 l there exists jk j such that xk yjk note that jk 6 jm if k 6 m since xk 6 xm denote j j j1 jl 1 x1 yj1 n xl1 yjl1 n and xl yj n jj evidently n 1 lk1 xk x1 xl are independent subsets of g and xk xk for each k 1 l the final property follows from the construction since for any a g and j j we have ayj a1 yj and an a1 n lemma 42 for every countable group c and each n n n 2 there exists a countable torsionfree group h having a normal subgroup m h such that i m satisfies ncc ii m is 2boundedly simple iii the natural action of h on m preserves the conjugacy classes of m iv hm proof let h0 be the free group of infinite countable rank choose n0 h0 so that h0 n0  c let f f x1 xn1 denote the free group freely generated by x1 xn1 define h0 h0 f and let n0 be the normal closure of n0 f in h0 evidently h0 n0  c and the elements x1 xn1 n0 1 are  h0 n0 pairwise noncommensurable in h0 by lemma 41 one can choose a partition of n0 1 into the union of h0 independent subsets n0 1 x0k so that xk x0k for each k 1 n 1 by corollary 33 there exists a countable torsionfree 2boundedly simple group m1 with the property ncc containing a copy of n0 such that the subsets x0k k 1 2 n 1 are independent in m1 denote by h1 h0 n0 m1 the amalgamated product of h0 and m1 along n0 and let n1 be the normal closure groups with finitely many conjugacy classes of m1 in h1 note that h1 is torsionfree as an amalgamated product of two torsionfree groups 10 iv27 we need to verify that the elements x1 xn1 are pairwise noncommensurable in h1 indeed if a x0k and b x0l k 6 l are conjugate in h1 then there must exist y1 yt m1 n0 and z1 zt1 h0 n0 z0 zt h0 such that z0 y1 zt1 yt zt azt1 yt1 zt1  y11 z01 1 b suppose that t is minimal possible with this property as conjugation by elements of h0 preserves x0k and x0l we can assume that z0 zt 1 hence y1 z1 zt1 yt ayt1 zt1  z11 y11 b1 1 1 by the properties of amalgamated products see 10 ch iv the lefthand side fn1 in this equality can not be reduced consequently yt ayt1 n0 1 k1 x0k but then yt ayt1 x0k by the properties of m1 contradicting the minimality of t thus we have shown that xk 6 xl whenever k 6 l assume that the group hi hi1 ni1 mi i 1 has already been constructed so that 0 hi is countable and torsionfree 1 ni1 hi1 2 hi1 h0 ni1 and h0 ni1 n0 3 mi satisfies ncc 4 x1 xn1 are pairwise noncommensurable in hi let ni be the normal closure of mi in hi because of the condition 4 and lemma 41 one can find a partition of ni 1 into a union of hi independent subsets ni 1 xik so that xk xik for each k 1 n 1 by lemma 32 there is a countable group a mi1 with ncc containing a copy of ni in which the subsets xik i 1 n 1 remain independent set hi1 hi ni mi1 now it is easy to verify that the analogs of the conditions 03 hold for hi1 and ni1 mi ni mi1 the analog of the condition 4 is true in hi1 by the same considerations as before in the case of h1 define the group h i1 hi and its subgroup m i1 ni observe that the condition 0 implies that h is torsionfree condition 1 implies that m is normal in h and 2 implies that h h0 msand h0 m n0 hence hm h0 h0 m  c applying 41 we get m i1 mi and thus by the conditions 3 4 it enjoys the property ncc each element of m will be a conjugate of xk for some k 1 n 1 since x1 xn1 m1 m and m1 is 2boundedly simple then so will be m finally 4 implies that xk xl whenever k 6 l and consequently the natural action of h on m preserves its conjugacy classes qed lemma 43 suppose that g is a group n g a b g and a b is an isomorphism such that a an ie the canonical images of a and a in ashot minasyan gn coincide for each a a let l hg t k tat1 a a ai be the hnnextension of g with associated subgroups a and b and let k be the normal closure of hn ti in l then g k n proof this statement easily follows from the universal property of hnnextensions and is left as an exercise for the reader the next lemma will allow us to construct nccgroups that are not simple lemma 44 assume that h is a torsionfree countable group and m h is a nontrivial normal subgroup then h can be isomorphically embedded into a countable torsionfree group g possessing a normal subgroup k g such that 1 g hk and h k m 2 x y g 1 x y if and only if h k such that x hyh1 where g gk is the natural homomorphism in particular k will have 2cc 3 x y g 1 x y if and only if x y proof choose a set of representatives z h of cosets of h modulo m in such a way that each coset is represented by a unique element from z and 1 define g0h and k0 m enumerate the elements of g01 g1 g2 first we embed the group g0 into a countable torsionfree group g1 having a normal subgroup k1 g1 such that g1 hk1 h k1 m and for every i 0 there are ti k1 and zi z satisfying ti gi ti1 zi suppose that the countable torsionfree group gj j 0 and kj gj have already been constructed so that h gj gj hkj h kj m and if j 1 then tj gj t1 j zj for some tj kj and zj z the group gj 1 containing

in gj 1 evidently the group gj 1 is countable and torsionfree h gj gj 1 gj 1 hkj 1 and h kj 1 h skj m by lemma 43 now it is easy to verify that the group g1 j0 gj and its normal subgroup k1 j0 kj enjoy the required properties in the same way we can embed g1 into a countable torsionfree group g2 that has a normal subgroup k2 g2 so that g2 hk2 h k2 m and each element of g1 1 is conjugated in g2 to a corresponding element of z performing such a procedure infinitely many times achieve the group i1 gi and a normal subgroup k i1 ki g that satisfy the claims 1 and 2 of the lemma it is easy to see that the claim 2 implies 3 thus the proof is finished 5 adding finite generation theorem 51 assume that h is a countable torsionfree group and m is a nontrivial normal subgroup of h let f be an arbitrary nonelementary torsionfree word hyperbolic group then there exist a countable torsionfree group q containing h and a normal subgroup n q with the following properties 1 h is malnormal in q 2 q h n and n h m groups with finitely many conjugacy classes 3 n is a quotient of f 4 the centralizer cq n of n in q is trivial 5 for every q q there is z h such that q z proof the group q will be constructed as a direct limit of relatively hyperbolic groups step 0 set g0 h f and f 0 f then g0 is hyperbolic relative to its subgroup h and f 0 is a suitable subgroup of g0 by lemma 26 let n 0g0 be the normal closure of the subgroup hm f i in g0 evidently g0 h n 0 and h n 0 m enumerate all the elements of n 0 g0 g1 g2 and of g0 q0 q1 q2 in such a way that g0 q0 1 steps 0i assume the groups gj j 0 i i 0 have been already constructed so that 1 for each 1 j i there is an epimorphism j1 gj 1 gj which is injective on the image of h in gj 1 denote f j j1 f j 1 n j j1 n j 1 2 gj is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h and f j gj is a suitable subgroup j 0 i 3 gj h n j n j gj and h n j m j 0 i 4 the natural image j of gj in gj belongs to f j j 0 i 5 there exists zj h such that qj zj j 0 i where qj is the image of qj in gj step i1 let qi1 gi i1 n i be the images of qi1 and gi1 in gi first we construct the group gi 12 its normal subgroup ki1 and its element ti1 as follows if for some f gi f qi1 f 1 z h then set gi 12 gi ki1 n i gi 12 and ti1 1 otherwise qi1 is a hyperbolic element of infinite order in gi since gi is torsionfree the elementary subgroup egi qi1 is cyclic thus egi qi1 hhxi for some h h and x n i by 3 and qi1 hxm for some m z now by lemma 22 gi is hyperbolic relative to h hhxi choose y m so that hy 6 1 and let gi 12 be the following hnnextension of gi gi 12 hgi ti1 k ti1 hxt1 i1 hyi the group gi 12 is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to h by lemma 25 let us now verify that the subgroup f i is suitable in gi 12 indeed according to lemma 27 there are two hyperbolic elements f1 f2 f i of infinite order in gi such that fl 6 hx fl 6 hy l 1 2 and f1 6 f2 then gi12 f2 by lemma 31 it remains to check that fl is a hyperbolic element of gi 12 for each l 1 2 choose an arbitrary element w h and observe that fl 6 w since h is malnormal in gi by lemma 23 a nontrivial power of fl is conjugated to an element of h if and only if fl is conjugated to an element of h in gi but the latter is impossible because fl is hyperbolic in gi applying gi12 w for any w h hence f1 f2 f i are lemma 31 again we get that fl hyperbolic elements of infinite order in gi 12 the intersection egi12 f1 ashot minasyan egi12 f2 must be finite since these groups are virtually cyclic by lemma 22 and f1 is not commensurable with f2 in gi 12 but gi 12 is torsionfree therefore egi12 f1 egi12 f2 1 thus f i is a suitable subgroup of gi 12 lemma 43 assures that h ki1 m where ki1 gi 12 is the normal closure of hn i ti1 i in gi 12 finally note that m 1 ti1 qi1 t1 i1 ti1 hx ti1 hy z h in gi 12 now that the group gi 12 has been constructed set ti1 i1 ti1 ki1 and define gi 1 as follows since ti1 f i ki1 gi 12 we can apply theorem 28 to find a group gi 1 and an epimorphism i gi 12 gi 1 such that i is injective on h gi 1 is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h i i1 i ti1 i f i i f i is a suitable subgroup of gi 1 and keri ki1 denote by i the restriction of i on gi then i gi i gi gi 1 because gi 12 was generated by gi and ti1 and according to the construction ti1 i f i i gi now after defining f i 1 i f i n i 1 i n i i1 i i1 f i 1 and zi1 i z h we see that the conditions 1 2 4 and 5 hold in the case when j i 1 the properties gi 1 h n i 1 and n i 1 gi 1 are immediate consequences of their analogs for gi and n i finally observe that i h n i 1 h keri n i keri h n i keri keri  h ki1 keri m keri therefore h n i 1 m and the condition 3 holds for gi 1 let q g be the direct limit of the sequence gi i as i and let f and n n be the limits of the corresponding subgroups then q is torsionfree by 2 n q q h n and h n m by 3 n f by 4 and 5 implies the condition 5 from the claim since f 0 n 0 we get f n thus n f is a homomorphic image of f 0 f for any i j n i j we have a natural epimorphism ij gi gj such that if i j k then jk ij ik take any g g0 since f f 0 is finitely generated using the properties of direct limits one can show that if w 0 g cq f in q then 0j g cgj f j for some j n but cgj f j egj f j 1 by formulas 22  and 23 because f j is a suitable subgroup of gj hence w j 0j g 1 that is cq f cq n 1 this concludes the proof the next statement is wellknown lemma 52 assume g is a group and n g is a normal subgroup such that cg n n where cg n is the centralizer of n in g then the quotientgroup gn embeds into the outer automorphism group outn proof the action of g on n by conjugation induces a natural homomorphism  from g to the automorphism group autn of n since n is exactly the group of inner automorphisms innn of n one can define a new homomorphism  gn outn autn innn in the natural way gn ginnn for every gn gn it remains to check that is injective ie if g g n then gn 6 1 in outn or equivalently g  innn indeed otherwise there groups with finitely many conjugacy classes would exist a n such that ghg 1 aha1 for every h n thus n 6 a1 g cg n contradicting the assumptions qed note that for an arbitrary group n any subgroup c outn naturally acts on the set of conjugacy classes cn of the group n theorem 53 for any n n n 2 and an arbitrary countable group c c can be isomorphically embedded into the outer automorphism group outn of a group n satisfying the following conditions is torsionfree is generated by two elements has ncc and the natural action of c on cn is trivial is 2boundedly simple proof by lemma 42 we can find a countable torsionfree group h and its normal subgroup m enjoying the properties iiv from its claim now if f denotes the free group of rank 2 we can obtain a countable torsionfree group q together with its normal subgroup n that satisfy the conditions 15 from the statement of theorem 51 then n is torsionfree and generated by two elements as a quotient of f condition 2 implies that qn  c and by 4 and lemma 52 c embeds  hm into the group outn using property 5 for each g n we can find u q and z h such that ugu1 z n h m since q hn there are h h and x n such that u hx since z h1 zh m and the action of h on m preserves the conjugacy classes of m there is r m such that rh1 zhr1 z hence z rh1 ugu1 rh1 1 rxgx1 r1 where v rx n thus for every g n there is v n such that vgv 1 m evidently this implies that n is also 2boundedly simple since m has ncc the number of conjugacy classes in n will be at most n suppose x1 x2 m and x1 x2 then x1 x2 by the property iii from the claim of lemma 42 and since h is malnormal in q we get x1 x2 hence x1 x2 ie n also enjoys ncc the fact that the natural action of c on cn is trivial follows from the same property for the action of h on cm and the malnormality of h in q qed now let us proceed with the proof of theorem 14 first we apply lemma 44 to construct a group g and a normal subgroup k g according to its claim now by theorem 51 there is a group q having a normal subgroup n q such that g is malnormal in q q gn g n k rankn 2 if one takes the free group of rank 2 as f and every element q q is conjugated in q to an element of g by claim 2 of lemma 44 k has 2cc and an argument similar to the one used in the proof of theorem 53 shows that n will also have 2cc consequently rankn 1 because n is torsionfree hence rankn 2 since g hk and h k m we have q hkn hn and h n h k m since qn  hm and n can be generated by two elements we can conclude that rankq rankhm 2 ashot minasyan consider arbitrary x y q 1 and suppose that x y by theorem 51 there are w z g 1 such that x w and y z therefore w z hence the images of w and z in gk are also conjugate by claim 3 of lemma 44 w z implying x y theorem 14 provides an alternative way of obtaining torsionfree groups that have finitely many conjugacy classes for any countable group c we can choose a free group h of countable rank and a normal subgroup 1 6 m h so that hm  c and then apply theorem 14 to the pair h m to get corollary 54 assume that n n n 2 and c is a countable group that contains exactly n 1 distinct conjugacy classes then there exists a torsionfree group q and n q such that  qn  n has 2cc and q has ncc  rankn 2 and rankq rankc 2 corollary 55 the group g1 given by presentation 11 can be isomorphically embedded into a 2generated torsionfree group q satisfying 4cc in such a way that t t1 proof denote by k the kernel of the homomorphism g1 z3 for which a 0 and t 1 where z3 is the group of integers modulo 3 now apply theorem 14 to the pair g1 k to find the group q containing g1 and the normal subgroup n q from its claim since qn  g1 k  z3 has 3cc the group q will have 4cc we also have t t1 because the images of t and t1 are not conjugate in qn choose an element q1 q n then q2 q13 n 1 and since n is 2generated and has 2cc there is q3 n such that n hq2 q3 i in q as qn is generated by the image of q1 the group q will be generated by q1 q2 q3 and consequently by q1 q3 qed 6 combinatorics of paths in relatively hyperbolic groups let g be a group hyperbolic relative to a family of proper subgroups h and s let x be a finite symmetrized relative generating set of g denote h  h 1 for a combinatorial path p in the cayley graph g x h of g with respect to x h p p lp and labp will denote the initial point the ending point the length that is the number of edges and the label of p respectively p1 will be the path obtained from p by following it in the reverse direction further if is a subset of g and g hi g then g will be used to denote the length of a shortest word in 1 representing g we will be using the following terminology from 20 suppose q is a path in g x h a subpath p of q is called an h component for some or simply a component of q if the label of p is a word in the alphabet h 1 and p is not contained in a bigger subpath of q with this property two components p1 p2 of a path q in g x h are called connected if they are h components for the same and there exists a path c in g x h connecting a vertex of p1 to a vertex of p2 such that labc entirely consists of letters groups with finitely many conjugacy classes from h in algebraic terms this means that all vertices of p1 and p2 belong to the same coset gh for a certain g g we can always assume c to have length at most 1 as every nontrivial element of h is included in the set of generators an h component p of a path q is called isolated if no other h component of q is connected to p the next statement is a particular case of lemma 227 from 20 we shall formulate it in a slightly more general form as it appears in 18 lemma 27 lemma 61 suppose that a group g is hyperbolic relative to a family of subgroups h then there exists a finite subset g and a constant k n such that the following holds let q be a cycle in g x h p1 pk be a collection of isolated components of q and g1 gk be the elements of g represented by labp1 labpk respectively then g1 gk belong to the subgroup hi g and the word lengths of gi s with respect to satisfy gi k lq definition suppose that m n and is a finite subset of g define w m to be the set of all words w over the alphabet x h that have the following form w x0 h0 x1 h1 xl hl xl1 where l z l 2 if l 2 then w is the empty word if l 1 then w x0 hi and xi are considered as single letters and 1 xi x 1 i 0 l 1 and for each i 0 l there exists i such that hi hi 2 if i i 1 then xi1  hi for each i 0 l 1 3 hi  h hi h m i 0 l choose the finite subset g and the constant k 0 according to the claim of lemma 61 recall that a path q in g x h is said to be without backtracking if all of its components are isolated lemma 62 let q be a path in the cayley graph g x h with labq w m and m 5k then q is without backtracking proof assume the contrary to the claim then one can choose a path q providing a counterexample of the smallest possible length thus if p1 pl is the consecutive list of all components of q then l 2 p1 and pl must be connected h components for some the components p2 pl1 must be isolated and q starts with p1 and ends with pl since labq w m we have lq 2l 1 if l 2 then the x 1letter between p1 and p2 would belong to h contradicting the property 2 from the definition of w m therefore l 3 since p1 and pl are connected there exists a path v in g x h between pl and p1 with labv h thus we can assume that lv 1 denote by q the subpath of q starting with p1 and ending with pl note that lq lq 2 2l 3 and p2 pl1 is the list of components of q all of which are isolated if one of them were connected to v it would imply that it is connected to p1 contradicting with the minimality of q hence the cycle o qv possesses ashot minasyan k l 2 1 isolated components which represent elements h1 hk h consequently applying lemma 61 one obtains that hi hi i 1 k and hi k lo klq 1 k2l 2 by the condition 3 from the definition of w m one has hi m 5k for each i 1 k hence k 5k hi k2l 2 or 5 2l 2 which contradicts the inequality k l 2 qed definition consider an arbitrary cycle o rqr q in g x h where labq and labq belong to w m let p be a component of q or q we will say that p is regular if it is not an isolated component of o if m 5k and hence q and q are without backtracking by lemma 62 this means that p is either connected to some component of q respectively q or to a component of r or r lemma 63 in the above notations suppose that m 7k and denote c maxlr lr then a if c 1 then every component of q or q is regular b if c 2 then each of q and q can have at most 4c components which are not regular c if l is the number of components of q then at least l 6c of components of q are connected to components of q and two distinct components of q can not be connected to the same component of q similarly for q proof assume the contrary to a then one can choose a cycle o rqr q with lr lr 1 having at least one isolated component on q or q and such that lq lq is minimal clearly the latter condition implies that each component of q or q is an isolated component of o therefore q and q together contain k distinct isolated components of o representing elements h1 hk h where k 1 and k lq 12 lq 12 applying lemma 61 we obtain hi hi i 1 k and hi k lo klq lq 2 recall that hi m 7k by the property 3 from the definition of w m therefore i1 hi k 7k implying 2 lq lq 2 lq 1 lq 1  2 6 which yields a contradiction let us prove b suppose that c 2 and q contains more than 4c isolated components of o we shall consider two cases case 1 no component of q is connected to a component of q then a component of q or q can be regular only if it is connected to a component of r or r since by lemma 62 q and q are without backtracking two distinct components of q or q can not be connected to the same component of r or r hence q and groups with finitely many conjugacy classes q together can contain at most 2c regular components thus the cycle o has k isolated components representing elements h1 hk h where k 4c 4 and k lq 12 lq 12 2c by lemma 61 hi hi for each i 1 k and i1 hi klq lq 2c once again we can use the property 3 from the definition of w m to achieve 2 lq 1 lq 1 lq lq 2c  2c 1 3c 2 lq 1 lq 1 2 6c 1 3  2c  2 4 2 2 yielding a contradiction case 2 the path q has at least one component which is connected to a component of q let p1 pl denote the sequence of all components of q by part a if ps and pt 1 s t l are connected to components of q then for any j s j t pj is connected to some component of q because q is without backtracking by lemma 62 we can take s respectively t to be minimal respectively maximal possible consequently p1 ps1 pt1 pl will contain the set of all isolated components of o that belong to q and none of these components will be connected to a component of q without loss of generality we may assume that s 1 4c2 2c since ps is connected to some component p of q there exists a path v in g x h satisfying v ps v p labv h 1 lv 1 let q respectively q denote the subpath of q respectively q from q to ps respectively from p to q consider a new cycle rqv q reasoning as before one can show that has k isolated components where k 2c 4 and k lq12lq 12c 1 now an application of lemma 61 to the cycle together with the property 3 from the definition of w m will lead to a contradiction as before by the symmetry the statement b of the lemma also holds for q the claim c follows from b and the estimate lr lr 2c because if two different components p and p of q were connected to the same component of some path in g x h then p and p would also be connected with each other which would contradict lemma 62 lemma 64 in the previous notations let m 7k c maxlr lr and let p1 pl p1 pl be the consecutive lists of the components of q and q 1 respectively if l 12 maxc 1 2 then there are indices s t s n such that 1 s 6c 1 l 6 maxc 1 t l and for every i 0 1 t s the component psi of q is connected to the component ps i of q proof by part c of lemma 63 there exists s 6c 1 such that the component ps is connected to a component ps for some s 1 l thus there is a path r1 between ps and ps with lr1 1 consider a new cycle o1 r1 q1 r q1 where q1 is the segment of q from ps to q r and q1 is the segment of q from q r to ps observe that ps1 pl is the list of all components of q1 and ls l6c 1 6 max1 c 1 hence according to part c of lemma 63 applied to o1 there is t l 6 max1 c s such that pt is connected to pt by means of a path r1 where s 1 t l r1 pt r1 pt and lr1 1 consider ashot minasyan psi ps i q 1 figure 1 the cycle o2 r1 q2 r1 q2 in which q2 and q2 are the segments of q1 and q1 from ps r1 to pt and from pt to ps r1 respectively fig 1 note that ps1 pt is the list of all components of q2 and ps 1 pt is the list of all components of q2 the cycle o2 satisfies the assumptions of part a of lemma 63 therefore for every i 1 t s there exists i 1 t s such that psi is connected to ps i psi can not be connected to r1 r1 because in this case it would be connected to ps pt but q is without backtracking by lemma it remains to show that i i for every such i indeed if i i for some i 1 t s then one can consider the cycle o3 r1 q3 r3 q3 where q3 and q3 are segments of q2 and q2 from q2 r1 to psi and from ps i to q2 r1 respectively and r3 q3 r3 q3 lr3 1 according to part a of lemma 63 each of the components ps1 psi of q3 must be connected to one of ps 1 ps i hence since i i two distinct components of q3 will be connected to the same component of q3 which is impossible by part c of lemma 63 the inequality i i would lead to a contradiction after an application of a symmetric argument to q3 therefore i i and the lemma is proved lemma 65 in the above notations let m 7k and c maxlr lr for any positive integer d there exists a constant l lc d n such that if lq l then there are d consecutive components ps psd1 of q and ps ps d1 of q 1 so that psi is connected to ps i for each i 0 d 1 proof choose the constant l so that l 12 12 maxc 1 2 d let p1 pl be the consecutive list all components of q since labq w m we have l l 12 due to the form of any word from w m thus we can apply lemma 64 to find indices s t from its claim by the choice of s and t and the estimate on l we have t s d 1 yielding the statement of the lemma corollary 66 let g be a group hyperbolic relative to a family of proper subgroups h suppose that a h0 for some 0 is an element of infinite order and x1 x2 g h0 then there exists k n such that g ak1 x1 ak2 x2 is a hyperbolic element of infinite order in g whenever k1 k2 k groups with finitely many conjugacy classes proof without loss of generality we can assume that x1 x2 x since relative hyperbolicity does not depend on the choice of the finite relative generating set 20 thm 234 choose the finite subset g and the constant k n according to the claim of lemma 61 and set m 7k as the order of a is infinite there is k n such that ak  h hi h m whenever k k assume that k1 k2 k suppose first that g l 1 for some l n consider the cycle o rqr q in g x h where q q 1 labq ak1 x1 ak2 x2 l w m akj are considered as single letters from the alphabet x h and r r q are trivial paths consisting of a single point then by part a of lemma 63 every component of q must be regular in o which is impossible since q is without backtracking according to lemma 62 hence g has infinite order in g suppose now that there exists u h and y g such that ygy 1 u denote c yx h since element u g has infinite order there exists l n such that 2l 6c 2 and ul  h hi h m the equality yg l y 1 ul 1 gives rise to the cycle o rqr q in g x h where r and r are paths of length c whose labels represent y in g r 1 q r y labq ak1 x1 ak2 x2 l w m  q q  yak1 x1 ak2 x2 l y 1 and labq ul w m lq 1 by part c of lemma 63 at least 2l 6c 2 distinct components of q must be connected to distinct components of q which is impossible as q has only one component the contradiction shows that g must be a hyperbolic element of g lemma 67 let g be a torsionfree group hyperbolic relative to a family of proper subgroups h a h0 1 for some 0 and t u g h0 suppose that there exists k n such that for every k k the element g1 ak tak t1 is commensurable with g2 ak uak u1 in g then there are h0 and  1 1 such that u t a 1 a 1 a a proof changing the finite relative generating set x of g if necessary we can assume that t u t1 u1 x let the finite subset g and the constant k n be chosen according to lemma 61 define m 7k and suppose that k is large enough to satisfy ak  h hi h m since g1 and g2 are commensurable there exist l l z0 and y g such that yg2l y 1 g1l let c yx h d 8 and l lc d be the constant from lemma 65 without loss of generality assume that 4l l consider the cycle o rqr q in g x h such that r and r are paths of length c whose labels represent y  q in g r 1 q r y labq ak uak u1 l w m lq 4l r l 1 k k 1 l q r yg2 y labq a ta t w m lq 4l now by lemma 65 there are subpaths q p1 s1 p2 s2 p3 s3 p4 of q and q  p1 s1 p2 s2 p3 s3 p4 of q 1 such that labpi ak labpi ak i 1 2 3 4 for some 1 1 which depends on the sign of l labs1 labs3 u labs2 u1 labs1 labs3 t labs2 t for some 1 1 and pi is connected in g x h to pi for each i 1 2 3 4 therefore there exist paths p1 p2 p3 p4 whose labels represent the elements h0 respectively such that p1 p1 p1 p1 p2 p2 p2 p2 p3 p3 p3 p3 p4 p4 p4 p4 see fig 2 the cycles s1 p2 and s31 p1 1 p1 s1 p2 p2 p2 s2 p3 s2 3 p3 p3 s3 p4 give rise to the following equalities in the group g u t ak ak u t and u ak ak t ashot minasyan  p2 p3 t ak p1  p4 q 1 figure 2  h0 we consequently recalling that h0 is malnormal lemma 23 and that t get ak 1 ak t 1 t

the formulas 61 and 62 together yield a 1 a and 1 a a qed 7 small cancellation over relatively hyperbolic groups let g be a group generated by a subset a g and let o be the set of all words in the alphabet a1 that are trivial in g then g has a presentation of the following form g ha k oi given a symmetrized set of words r over the alphabet a consider the group g1 defined by g1 ha k o ri hg k ri during the proof of the main result of this section we use presentations 72 or equivalently the sets of additional relators r that satisfy the generalized small cancellation condition c1 c in the case of word hyperbolic groups this condition was suggested by olshanskii in 16 and was afterwards generalized to relatively hyperbolic groups by osin in 21 for the definition and detailed theory we refer the reader to the paper 21 as we will only use the properties that were groups with finitely many conjugacy classes already established there the following observation is an immediate consequence of the definition remark 71 let the constants j j c j j 1 2 satisfy 0 1 0 1 2 c 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 if the presentation 72 enjoys the condition c1 2 2 c 2 then it also enjoys the condition c1 1 1 c 1 we will also assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of a van kampen diagram over the group presentation 72 see 10 ch v or 15 ch 4 let be such a diagram a cell of is called an rcell if the label of its boundary contour  ie the word written on it starting with some vertex in the counterclockwise direction belongs to r consider a simple closed path o rqr q in a diagram over the presentation 72 such that q is a subpath of the boundary cycle of an rcell and q is a subpath of let denote the subdiagram of bounded by o assuming that  has no holes no rcells and lr lr it will be called an contiguity subdiagram of to the ratio lql will be called the contiguity degree of to and denoted a diagram is said to be reduced if it has a minimal number of rcells among all the diagrams with the same boundary label if g is a group hyperbolic relative to a family of proper subgroups hi sii with a finite relative generating set x then g is generated by the set a x ii hi 1 and the cayley graph g a is a hyperbolic metric space 20 cor 254 as for every condition of small cancellation the main statement of the theory is the following analogue of greendlingers lemma claiming the existence of a cell large part of whose contour lies on the boundary of the van kampen diagram lemma 72 21 cor 44 suppose that the group g is generated by a subset a such that the cayley graph g a is hyperbolic then for any 0 1 there is 0 0 such that for any 0 0 and c 0 there are 0 0 and 0 0 with the following property let the symmetrized presentation 72 satisfy the c1 0 c 0 condition further let be a reduced van kampen diagram over g1 whose boundary contour is cquasigeodesic in g then provided has an rcell there exists an rcell  in and an 0 contiguity subdiagram of to such that  1 23 the main application of this particular small cancellation condition is lemma 73 21 lemmas 51 and 63 for any 0 1 c 0 and n 0 there exist 1 0 1 0 and 1 0 such that for any symmetrized set of words r satisfying c1 1 1 c 1 condition the following hold 1 the group g1 defined by 72 is hyperbolic relative to the collection of images hi ii under the natural homomorphism g g1 2 the restriction of to the subset of elements

be the set of all cyclic shifts of w a v2 and their inverses by lemma 23 hi0 eg v2 1 because g is torsionfree hence by 21 thm 75 the presentation 72 satisfies the condition c1 13 2 2n and therefore by remark 71 it satisfies the conditions c1 0 13 2 0 and c1 1 1 13 2 1 observe that w1 6 1 in g because otherwise there would have existed a closed path q in g a labelled by the word w a v1 and by part a of lemma 63 all components of q would have been regular in the cycle o rqr q where r r q are trivial paths which is obviously impossible denote g1 ghhw2 ii and let g g1 be the natural epimorphism then according to slemma 73 the group g1 is is torsionfrees hyperbolic s4 relative to hi ii j1 eg vj and is injective on the set ii hi j1 eg vj groups with finitely many conjugacy classes u because the length in a of any element from this set is at most n since any elementary group is word hyperbolic g1 is also hyperbolic relative to hi ii by lemma 24 and v3 v4 s become hyperbolic elements of infinite order in g1 that are not commensurable with each other by lemma 23 therefore eg1 v3 eg2 v4 1 recall that these subgroups are cyclic by lemma 22 and because g1 is torsionfree and consequently s is a suitable subgroup of g1 suppose that w1 1 by van kampens lemma there exists a reduced planar diagram over the presentation 72 with the word w a v1 written on its boundary since w a v1 6 1 possesses at least one rcell it was proved in 21 lemma 71 that any path in g a labelled by w a v1 is 13 2quasigeodesic hence we can apply lemma 72 to find an rcell of and an 0 contiguity subdiagram containing no rcells between and such that 1 23 thus there exists a cycle o rqr q in g a such that q is labelled by a subword of a cyclic shift of w a v2 q is labelled by a subword of a cyclic shift of w a v1 1 lr lr 0 c and lq 1 23 l 1 23 2n l in particular labq labq w m therefore we can apply lemma 65 to find two consecutive components of q that are connected to some components of q due to the form of the word w a v2 one of the formers will have to be an eg v2 component but q can have only eg v1 or hi0 components this yields a contradiction because eg v2 6 eg v1 and eg v2 6 hi0 hence w1 6 1 in g1 and the proof is complete 8 every group is a group of outer automorphisms of a 2ccgroup lemma 81 there exists a word rx y over the twoletter alphabet x y such that every nonelementary torsionfree word hyperbolic group f1 has a nonelementary torsionfree word hyperbolic quotient f that is generated by two elements a b f satisfying ra b 6 1 ra1 b1 1 rb a 1 rb1 a1 1 proof consider the word rx y xy 101 x2 y 102 x100 y 200 denote by f a b the free group with the free generators a b let r1 ra b ra1 b1 rb a rb1 a1 and r2 be the set of all cyclic permutations of words from r11 it is easy to see that the set r2 satisfies the classical small cancellation condition c 18 see 10 ch v denote by the normal closure of the set r3 ra1 b1 rb a rb1 a1 in f a b since the symmetrization of r3 also satisfies c 18 the group f f a b is a torsionfree 10 thm v101 word hyperbolic group because it has a finite presentation for which the dehn function is linear by 10 thm v44 such that ra b 6 1 but ra1 b1 rb a rb1 a1 1 ashot minasyan indeed if the word ra b were trivial in f then by greendlingers lemma 10 thm v44 it would contain more than a half of a relator from the symmetrization of r3 as a subword which would contradict the fact that r2 enjoys c 18 the group f is nonelementary because every torsionfree elementary group is cyclic hence abelian but in any abelian group the relation ra1 b1 1 implies ra b 1 now the free product g f f1 is a torsionfree hyperbolic group its subgroups f and f1 are nonelementary hence according to a theorem of olshanskii 16 thm 2 there exists a nonelementary torsionfree word hyperbolic group f and a homomorphism g f such that f f1 f and ra b 6 1 in f therefore f is a quotient of f1 the images of the elements a b generate f and enjoy the required relations we are now ready to prove theorem 15 proof of theorem 15 the argument will be similar to the one used to prove theorem 51 first set n 2 and apply lemma 42 to find a countable torsionfree group h and a normal subgroup m h where hm  c and m has 2cc alternatively one could start with a free group h and m h such that h m  c and then apply lemma 44 to the pair h m to obtain h and m with these properties consider the word rx y and the torsionfree hyperbolic group f generated by the elements a b f which satisfy 81 given by lemma 81 denote g2 h f and let n 2 be the normal closure of hm f i in g2 f 2 f r2 ra b a finite subset of f 2 by lemma 26 g2 will be hyperbolic relative to the subgroup h g2 h n 2 h n 2 m and f 2 will be a suitable subgroup of g2 the element a f 2 will be hyperbolic in g2 and since the group g2 is torsionfree the maximal elementary subgroup eg2 a will be cyclic generated by some element h2 x2 where h2 h x2 n 2 choose y2 m so that h2 y2 6 1 by lemmas 22 and 25 the hnnextension g32 hg2 t1 k t1 h2 x2 t1  h2 y2 i is hyperbolic relative to h as in proof of theorem 51 one can verify that f 3 is a suitable subgroup of g32 and apply theorem 28 to find an epimorphism 2 g32 g1 such that g1 is a torsionfree group hyperbolic relative to 2 h 2 is injective on h r2 and 2 t1 f 1 where f 1 2 f 2 is a suitable subgroup of g1 hence 2 g2 g1 as g32 was generated by g2 and t1 denote n 1 2 n 2 r1 2 r2 and 2 2 g2 g2 g1 one can show that g1 hn 1 and hn 1 m using the same arguments as in the proof of theorem 51 according to the construction we have 2 t1 2 a2 t1 1 t1 at1 n 1 h m in g1 therefore since the conjugation by 2 t1 is an inner automorphism of f 1 we can assume that f 1 is generated by a1 and b1 where a1 m and ra1 b1 6 1 in f 1 because 2 ra b 6 1 in f 1 groups with finitely many conjugacy classes now if b1 is not a hyperbolic element of g1 ie if b1 c for some c h then c n 1 h m and since m has 2cc we can find s1 g1 such that b1 s1 a1 s1 1 in this case we define g0 g1 n 0 n 1 f 0 f 1 r0 r1 a0 a1 s0 s1 and 1 idg1 otherwise if b1 is hyperbolic in g1 then we construct the group g0 and an epimorphism 1 g1 g0 in an analogous way to make sure that 1 is injective on h r1 g0 torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h f 0 1 f 1 is a suitable subgroup of g0 g0 h n 0 and h n 0 m where n 0 1 n 1 and b0 s0 a0 s1 0 in g0 where b0 1 b1 a0 1 a1 for some s0 g0 enumerate all elements of n 0 g0 g1 g2 and of g0 q0 q1 q2 so that g0 q0 1 the groups gj together with n j gj f j gj finite subsets rj gj and elements aj sj gj j 1 2 that we will construct shall satisfy the following properties 1 for each j n there is an epimorphism j1 gj 1 gj which is injective on h rj 1 f j j1 f j 1 n j j1 n j 1 aj j1 aj1 m sj j1 sj1 gj 2 gj is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h and f j gj is a suitable subgroup generated by aj and sj aj s1 3 gj h n j n j gj and h n j m 4 the natural image j of gj in gj belongs to f j 5 there exists zj h such that qj zj where qj is the image of qj in gj 6 if j 1 qj1 gj 1 h and for each k n there is k k such that gj1 6 akj1 qj1 akj1 qj1  then there is a word rj1 x y akj1 sj1 akj1 s1 over the twoletter alphabet x y which satisfies  6 1 and rj j1 rj1 aj1 sj1 aj1 sj1  1 in gj j1 rj1 aj1 qj1 aj1 qj1 suppose that the groups g0 gi have already been defined the group gi 1 will be constructed in three steps first assume that qi gi h and for each k n there is k k such that 6 aki qi aki qi1 observe that si  h because otherwise one would aki si aki s1 have f i h which is impossible as f i is suitable in gi therefore by corollary 66 we can suppose that k is so large that the elements v1 aki si aki s1 and v2 aki qi aki qi1 are hyperbolic in gi applying lemma 74 we can find a word w x y over x y such that the group gi 13 gihhw ai v2 ii and the natural epimorphism gi gi 13 satisfy the following is injective on h ri gi 13 is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h f i gi 13 is a suitable subgroup and w ai v1 6 1 define the word ri x y w x xk y k then ri ai si ai s1 i w ai v1 ri ai qi ai qi w ai v2 in gi hence  ri ai si ai s1 i 6 1 and ri ai qi ai qi 1 in gi 13 ashot minasyan if on the other hand qi h or there is k n such that for every k k one has aki si aki s1 aki qi aki qi1 then we define gi 13 gi gi gi 13 to be the identical homomorphism and ri x y to be the empty word let i1 and qi1 denote the images of gi1 and qi1 in gi  13 n i n i f i f i and ri ri ri ai si ai si then using 3 we get gi 13 h n i and h n i m because ker n i as ai qi ai qi1 n i now we construct the group gi 23 in exactly the same way as the group gi 12 was constructed in during the proof of theorem 51 if for some f gi 13 f qi1 f 1 z h then set gi 23 gi ki1 n i gi 23 and ti1 1 otherwise qi1 is a hyperbolic element of infinite order in gi 13 since gi 13 is torsionfree one has egi13 qi1 hhxi for some h h and x n i and there is m z such that qi1 hxm now by lemma 22 gi 13 is hyperbolic relative to h hhxi choose y m so that hy 6 1 and let gi 23 be the following hnnextension of gi 13 gi 23 hgi 13 ti1 k ti1 hxt1 i1 hyi the group gi 23 is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to h by lemma 25 one can show that f i is a suitable subgroup of gi 23 in the same way as during the proof of theorem 51 lemma 43 assures that h ki1 m where ki1 gi 23 is the normal closure of hn i ti1 i in gi 23 finally note that m 1 ti1 qi1 t1 i1 ti1 hx ti1 hy z h in gi 23 define ti1 i1 ti1 ki1 the group gi 1 is constructed from gi 23 as follows since ti1 f i ki1 gi 23 we can apply theorem 28 to find a group gi 1 and an epimorphism i gi 23 gi 1 such that i is injective on h ri gi 1 is torsionfree and hyperbolic relative to the image of h i i1 i ti1 i f i i f i is a suitable subgroup of gi 1 and keri ki1 denote by i gi gi 1 the composition i then i gi i gi gi 1 because gi 23 was generated by gi and ti1 and according to the construction ti1 i f i i gi now after defining f i 1 i f i n i 1 i n i ri 1 i ri i1 i i1 f i 1 and zi1 i z h we see that the conditions 1 5 hold in the case when j i 1 as in the proof of theorem 51 the last property 6 follows from the way we constructed the group gi 13 let q g be the direct limit of the sequence gi i as i and let f and n n be the limits of the corresponding subgroups let a b and s be the images of a0 b0 and s0 in q respectively then b s a s1 is torsionfree by 2 n q q h n and h n m by 3 n f by 4 hence qn  hm since f 0 n 0 we get f n thus n f is a homomorphic image of f 0 f and consequently it is a quotient of f1 by 5 for any q n there are z h and p q such that pqp1 z consequently z h n m choose x n and h h so that p hx since m has 2cc and h1 zh m there is y m such that yh1 zhy 1 z therefore yxqyx1 z m and groups with finitely many conjugacy classes yx m n n hence each element q of n will be conjugated in n to an element of m and since m has 2cc therefore the group n will also have 2cc the property that cq n 1 can be established in the same way as in theorem 51 therefore the natural homomorphism q autn is injective it remains to show that it is surjective that is for every autn there is g q such that x gxg 1 for every x n since all nontrivial elements of n are conjugated after composing with an inner automorphism of n we can assume that a a on the other hand there exist q n and i n such that b q a q and q is the image of qi in q note that s  h because si gi h for every i n this implies that h is a proper subgroup of n thus q  h since n f ha q a q i q and a h hence qi gi h now we have to consider two possibilities case 1 for each k n there is k k such that 6 aki qi aki qi1 aki si aki s1 then there is a word ri x y such that the property 6 holds for j i 1 and since each j is injective on 1 rj by 2 we conclude that ri a s a s1  6 1 and ri a q a q 1 in q which contradicts the injectivity of hence case 1 is impossible case 2 the assumptions of case 1 fail then we can use lemma 67 to find  h and 1 1 such that qi si ai 1 ai and 1 ai ai in gi denote by the image in q and for any y q let cy be the automorphism of n defined by cy x yxy 1 for all x n if 1 then a a and b q a q  s1  a s hence a 7 s a s 1 autn cs b s a s 7 a but n has no such automorphisms because ra b 6 1 and rb a 1 in n since n is a quotient of f and 1 6 ra0 b0 r0 in g0 therefore 1 similarly 1 as otherwise we would obtain a contradiction with the fact that ra1  b 1 in n thus a 7 a 1 autn c b s a s 7 s a s and since a and b generate n we conclude that for all x n x gxg 1 where g q thus the natural homomorphism from q to autn is bijective implying that outn autn
