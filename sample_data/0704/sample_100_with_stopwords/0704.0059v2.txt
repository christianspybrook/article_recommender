eclipsing binary hattr205013 which consists of a f7v primary and a late mdwarf secondary the systems period is short p 2230736 0000010 days with an orbit indistinguishable from circular e 0012 0021 we demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a singlelined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit this constrains the secondary to a unique line in the massradius diagram with mr2 constant for hattr205013 we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized and that the primarys rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis our observed line broadening vrot sin irot 289 10 km s1 gives a primary radius of ra 128 004 r our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary rb 0167 0006 r and the semimajor axis of the orbit a 754 030 r 00351 00014 au our singlelined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses mb 0124 0010 m and

doublelined eclipsing binaries the method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar massradius relation subject headings binaries eclipsing binaries spectroscopic stars fundamental parameters stars lowmass stars rotation introduction solving for the masses and radii of stars has traditionally been accomplished through the analysis of doublelined eclipsing binaries where the light of both components is detected masses and radii determined this way are fundamental and can be very accurate because they rely only on newtons laws and geometry for the analysis of the spectroscopic orbit and light curve and not on models of stellar structure and evolution in particular analysis of the eclipse light curve yields the orbital inclination and when combined with the doublelined spectroscopic orbit this yields individual masses for both stars there are dozens of doublelined eclipsing binaries with very accurate mass and radius determinations eg see andersen 1991 for a review but only 10 m dwarfs in 5 systems with accuracies better than 3 percent in order of increasing mass the 5 systems are cm draconis lacy 1977 metcalfe et al 1996 cu cancri ribas 2003 nsvs01031772 lpezmorales et al 2006 yy geminorum torres ribas 2002 and gu botis lpezmorales ribas 2005 figure 1 shows the observational results for these 10 m dwarfs on the massradius diagram along with the predicted theoretical models from baraffe et al 1998 all of the observed radii are larger than the theoretical predictions typically by 5 to 10 percent another striking feature of figure 1 is the lack of accurate massradius determinations in the lower half of the mdwarf mass range from cm dra b 0214 m all the way down to the substellar limit near 0075 m recently however the growing number of shortperiod singlelined eclipsing binaries with f and gstar primaries and mdwarf secondaries identified by wideangle photometric surveys for transiting planet promises to provide a way to fill in this gap in the massradius diagram bouchy et al 2005 pont et al 2005ab 2006 one approach to using a singlelined eclipsing binary to solve for the mass and radius of the unseen companion is to use stellar models together with spectroscopic and photometric observations of the primary to estimate its mass and radius then the radius ratio from the light curve yields the radius of the secondary and the mass function from the spectroscopic orbit with the orbital inclination from the light curve can be combined to yield the mass of the secondary however this approach is not fundamental because it relies on stellar models to characterize the primary tests of the massradius relation with the lowmass secondaries in such systems are no better than the validity of the models for the primaries in particular the theoretical isochrones depend on metallicity and significant errors can result if the wrong metallicity is adopted an alternative and more fundamental approach relies on the expectation that shortperiod binaries whose orbits have been circularized by tidal mechanisms must also have the axial rotation of both stars synchronized to the orbital period and both rotational axes aligned with the normal to the orbit so that the two inclinations are equal irot iorb eg see hut 1981 zahn 1989 in this case a measurement of the spectral line broadening due to rotation vrot sin irot combined with a value for iorb from an analysis of the light curve yields the actual equatorial rotational velocity vrot if the rotation is synchronized with the orbit then prot porb and the radius of the primary can be solved the key to this approach is the ability to derive accurate values for the rotational broadening of the spectral lines because the primary radius can be no more accurate than the value derived for vrot the radius of the primary then sets the scale for the rest of the system yielding the radius of the secondary and the semimajor axis of the orbit in actual length units as well as the orbital inclination then newtons revised version of keplers third law can be used to derive the sum of the masses and the mass function from the singlelined spectroscopic orbit allows the individual masses to be determined this approach depends on the predictions from stellar models only in minor ways limb darkening coefficients are needed for the detailed analysis of the eclipse light curve and the rotational broadening that is derived from the observed spectra can depend weakly on the metallicity that is adopted the advantage of using singlelined eclipsing binaries is that it dramatically increases the number of lowmass stars whose masses and radii can be determined indeed over the past 30 years only seven doublelined eclipsing systems composed of lowmass stars have been identified the aforementioned cm dra cu cnc nsvs01031772 yy gem and gu boo plus oglebw3v38 maceroni montalbn 2004 and tresher007621 creevey et al 2005 meanwhile more than 75 singlelined eclipsing binaries with mdwarf secondaries have been discovered by wideangle photometric transiting planet surveys such as vulcan tres and hat in just the last five years latham 2007 increasing the number of lowmass stars with fundamental determinations of masses and radii is worthwhile because of the insights these systems can yield into stellar structure lowmass stars near the hydrogenburning limit are cool enough that their interior temperatures are on the order of the electron fermi temperature chabrier baraffe 1997 causing parts of the stellar interior to be in the state of a partially degenerate electron gas which means a classical maxwellboltzmann description of the interior does not apply furthermore the electron number density is such that the mean interionic distance is itself on the order of the thomasfermi screening length meaning that the electron gas is polarized by the externalionic field chabrier baraffe 1997 add to this the further complexity that magnetic fields may play a role in the inner workings of low mass stars mullan macdonald 2001 and it becomes clear that any attempt to describe the interior of low mass stars must take into account the physics of both magnetic fields and partially degenerate polarized plasmas not only is it difficult to model the interiors of lowmass stars but the usual grey model atmospheres are no longer applicable the relatively low temperatures of the stellar atmospheres allow for the recombination of molecular hydrogen and other molecules such as tio therefore accurate nongrey model atmospheres that take into account the effects of molecules must be derived and matched to the interior models baraffe et al 2002 thus stars near the bottom of the main sequence pose a challenge to dense matter physicists and stellar astronomers one of the few methods of testing models for lowmass stars is by confronting theoretical predictions of the massradius relation with observations up until now there has been little data with which to constrain the possible theories measuring the masses and radii of mdwarfs in singlelined eclipsing binaries therefore provides a new opportunity to test the massradius relation near the bottom of the main sequence in this paper we determine masses and radii for the components of hattr205013 an eclipsing singlelined binary identified by the hatnet hungarianmade automated telescope network see bakos et al 2004 the unseen mdwarf secondary has a mass and radius of 0124 m and 0167 r with 1 errors of 9 and 4 percent respectively this result places the m dwarf about 10 percent above the radius predicted by the baraffe et al 1998 models in this first paper we describe our analysis techniques in detail in future papers we will present the results for additional m dwarf secondaries observations and data reduction hat photometry the hatnet project1 initiated in 2003 by g b is a widefield survey that aims for the discovery of transiting planets around bright stars it currently comprises 6 small widefield automated telescopes each of which monitors 8 8 of sky typically containing 5000 wwwhatnethu stars bright enough to permit detection of planetary transits via the typical 1 photometric dips they induce on their parent stars the instruments are deployed in a twostation longitudedistributed network with four telescopes at the fred l whipple observatory in arizona and two telescopes at the submillimeter array at hawaii for a more detailed description of hats instrumentation observations and data flow see bakos et al 2002 2004 the hattr205013 system lies in hatnet survey field g205 centered at 22h 55m and 37 30 3357 observations were made of this field by the hatnet telescopes between 5 october 2003 and 30 january 2004 exposure times were 5 min at a cadence of 55 min light curves were derived by aperture photometry for the 6400 stars in g205 bright enough to yield photometric precision of better than 2 reaching 03 in some cases in deriving the light curves we made use of the trend filtering algorithm kovcs bakos noyes 2005 to correct for spurious trends in the data we then searched all the light curves for characteristic transit signals using the boxfitting least squares kovcs zucker mazeh 2002 algorithm which searches for boxshaped dips in the parameter space of frequency transit duration and phase of ingress candidate transit signals with the highest detection significance were then examined individually to isolate those with the best combination of stellar type preferably mainsequence stars of spectral type midf or later and depth shape and duration of transit one of these was hattr205013 for which we identified a prominent periodicity with period 22307 days and transit depth of 002 mag figure 2 shows the phasefolded and fluxnormalized data for hattr205013 following our determination of hattr205013 as a potential planetary system we identified the star in the 2mass catalog as 2mass 230808343338039 which yielded j and k magnitudes of j 9691 and k 9408 we also found hattr205013 in the tycho catalog as tyc 2755361 with magnitudes bt 11355 and vt 10729 we then scheduled hattr205013 for followup spectroscopic observations to determine if the photometric dip was caused by a stellar companion followup spectroscopy our usual strategy for following up transitingplanet candidates identified by widefield photometric surveys is to start with an initial spectroscopic reconnaissance to see if there is evidence for a stellar companion that is responsible for the observed light curve we have used the cfa digital speedometers latham 1992 on the 15m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory in the town of harvard massachusetts and on the 15m tillinghast reflector at the fred l whipple observatory on mount hopkins arizona to obtain single order echelle spectra in a wavelength window of 45 centered at 5187 with a resolution of 85 km s1 and a typical signaltonoise ratio per resolution element of 15 to 20 for slowly rotating solartype stars these spectra deliver radial velocities accurate to about 05 km s1 which is sufficient to detect orbital motion due to companions with masses down to about 5 or 10 mj for orbital periods of a few days spectroscopic followup observations of transitingplanet candidates are easier to schedule than photometric observations because the radial velocity varies throughout the entire orbital phase while the transit light curve has a duty cycle of only a few percent eg 3 hours out of 3 days spectroscopy has the additional advantage over photometry that we can use our spectra to classify the parent star deriving effective temperature rotational velocity and surface gravity by correlating the observed spectra with a library of synthetic spectra this information is often useful in rejecting host stars that are too hot or are rotating too rapidly or are evolved in which case we assume the giant must be the bright star in a blended triple thus at cfa we usually start with a spectroscopic reconnaissance before attempting followup photometry or very precise radialvelocity observations eg see odonovan et al 2007 starting in 1999 with transitingplanet candidates provided by the vulcan team borucki et al 2001 we quickly learned that the vast majority of the planet candidates were actually eclipsing binaries masquerading as transiting planets latham 2003 one of the most common imposters was an f or gstar primary eclipsed by a late mdwarf secondary such systems produce light curves similar to planets transiting solartype dwarfs because m dwarfs near the bottom of the main sequence have roughly the same size as giant planets nevertheless they are easy to distinguish from planets because their masses are two orders of magnitude larger and the reflex orbital motion they induce in their parent stars has an amplitude of at least several km s1 we determined the rotational and radial velocities of hattr205013 by cross correlation of the observed spectra against templates drawn from a library of synthetic spectra calculated by jon morse for a grid of kurucz 1992 stellar atmospheres the library grid has a spacing of 250 k in effective temperature teff 05 in log surface gravity log g and 05 in log metallicity relative to the sun feh for the final radialvelocity determinations we adopted the template with the teff log g and vrot values that gave the highest value for the peak of the correlation coefficient averaged over all the observed spectra assuming solar metallicity for the correlation analysis we used xcsao kurtz mink 1998 running inside the iraf2 environment iraf image reduction and analysis facility is distributed by the national optical astronomy ob our very first spectrum of hattr205013 revealed that the spectral lines of the primary were broadened by about 30 km s1 of rotation in our experience this is a strong suggestion that the companion is a star with enough mass to synchronize the rotation of the primary with the orbital period the second exposure showed that the velocity varied by several km s1 additional spectra soon revealed a spectroscopic orbit with a period that matched the photometric period and an orbital semiamplitude k of about 20 km s1 implying that the secondary was a small m dwarf altogether we accumulated 23 spectra yielding the radial velocities reported in table 1 which were calculated using a template with teff 6250 k log g 40 feh00 and vrot 30 km s1 the parameters of our orbital solution for hattr205013 are reported in table 2 and the corresponding velocity curve and observed velocities are plotted in figure 3 because the value of the rotational velocity is critical for our determination of the radius of the primary star we evaluated both the internal precision of our determinations and possible systematic errors resulting from uncertainties in the surface gravity and metallicity of the primary star our final results for the mass and radius of the primary star imply a surface gravity log g 424 halfway between the nearest templates in our library of synthetic spectra therefore we evaluated the rotational velocity at both log g 40 and 45 and also at two metallicities feh 00 and 05 at each of the four combinations of log g and feh we ran correlations over a wide range of temperatures 5500 to 7250 k and rotational velocities 10 to 50 km s1 at each gravity and metallicity we interpolated to find the temperature and rotation that gave the highest value of the correlation coefficient averaged over all the observed spectra weighted by the photon statistics for these experiments we did not use two of our observed spectra that had much lower exposure levels than the other 21 observations the results are reported in table 3 they show that the accuracy of our rotationalvelocity determination at a given log g and feh is not seriously limited by the scatter from the individual exposures despite the relatively low signaltonoise ratio of our observed spectra the uncertainty in the mean rotational velocity at each log g and feh due to internal scatter is less than 03 km s1 the results reported in table 3 also show that the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the gravity and metallicity are not serious for example the dependence of rotational velocity on metallicity is rather weak only 02 km s1 for a change of 05 in feh on the other hand the dependence on gravity is rather strong about 10 km s1 for a change of 05 in log g fortunately the uncertainty in the actual gravity of the primary star is quite small less than 02 in log g so the rotational velocity interpolated between the two gravities should servatories which are operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy inc under contract with the national science foundation be good to perhaps 02 km s1 unfortunately we do not yet have a direct measure of the metallicity of hattr205013 but the fact that the templates with feh 00 give a better match to the observed spectra than the templates with feh 05 suggests that the metallicity is probably within 05 dex of solar in the absence of an accurate metallicity we adopt a value of feh 02 which is typical of the solar neighborhood nordstrm et al 2004 the temperature corresponding to this metallicity that we derive from our spectra is teff 6295 k but with a systematic error that could exceed 200 k because of the degeneracy between temperature and metallicity in the analysis of our spectra the alternative approach of deriving a temperature from photometric indices is hampered by the lack of accurate photometry and the possibility that there may be significant reddening the distance that we derive from the stefanboltzmann law using r 127 004 r teff 6295 200 k vt 10729 0048 which corresponds to v 1067 005 and bolometric correction  0011 flower 1996 is 232 18 pc from our spectroscopic temperature and log g we estimate the spectral type of the primary to be f7v cox 2000 thus our experiments with different gravities and metallicities suggest that the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the template parameters may be less than 04 km s1 when combined in quadrature with the internal precision estimate of 03 km s1 this suggests that the total error in our final interpolated rotational velocity could be as small as 05 km s1 previous experience however would indicate that the actual uncertainty is higher than this internal estimate therefore to be conservative we adopt an uncertainty of 10 km s1 and use vrot sin irot 289 10 km s1 for our determination of the radius of the primary and subsequent analysis one could also determine the value of vrot sin irot by spectroscopically measuring the amplitude of the rossitermclaughlin effect during eclipse gaudi winn 2007 in the case of hattr205013 the amplitude of this effect would be about 05 km s1 too small to be measured with the cfa digital speedometers but potentially observable with an accuracy of a few percent by instruments such as hires on keck 1 our approach relies on the assumption that the stellar rotation has been synchronized to the orbital period one way to test this assumption might be to use very precise photometry to derive a rotational period for the star we did look for sinusoidal variations in the hat photometry but did not find anything significant near the orbital period we did detect a marginally significant variation with half the orbital period and amplitude of about 1 mmag which is consistent with the the expected ellipsoidal deformation of the primary star a second more global test would be to use stellar models to estimate the mass and radius of the primary but a prerequisite for such an analysis would be accurate determinations of the temperature and metallicity presumably from highquality spectra and such results are not yet available followup keplercam photometry to provide a highquality light curve for the analysis of the primary eclipse of hattr205013 we used keplercam on the 12m telescope at the fred l whipple observatory on mount hopkins arizona keplercam utilizes a monolithic 4k4k fairchild 486 ccd that provides a 23 field and a pixel size of 034 we used the predicted eclipse times from our spectroscopic orbit to schedule observations on the night of 2223 october 2005 we successfully observed a full eclipse alternating between the sloan g and i bands the seeing was approximately 2 fwhm throughout the night but we deliberately defocused the telescope to get images with 3 fwhm in order to keep the peak counts in the images well below saturation over the course of the observations the focus of the telescope which depends weakly on temperature was adjusted three times to keep the image size near 3 fwhm because we used automatic guiding the centroid of the images moved less than 3 pixels over the duration of the observations for readout we binned the pixels 2 2 which gave a total readout time including overhead of 12 seconds exposure times were 30 seconds for the g band and 10 seconds for the i band the images were obtained in sequences of 3 gband exposures followed by 6 iband exposures all told we were able to collect a total of 297 images in the g band and 588 in the i band some thin cirrus clouds were present at the beginning of the night with no noticeable degradation of the light curves a quarter moon rose during the observations after the end of egress and this contributed to a slight increase in photometric scatter after egress all the images were reduced by applying an overscan correction and then subtracting the twodimensional residual bias pattern after correcting for shutter effects we flattened each image using a normalized set of combined twilight images to produce the light curve we used the first image from each filter in an observing sequence as our astrometric reference for identifying the same stars in subsequent images we then determined the relative shift between images to relocate each star in the following images we measured the flux of each star in a 67 circular aperture around the position derived from the astrometric fit using daophotphot within iraf tody 1986 1993 we estimated the sky in an annulus around each star with inner and outer radii of 94 and 134 using the sigmarejection mode we iteratively selected comparison stars by removing any that showed unusual noise or variability in their differential light curves obtaining 21 comparison stars for the g band and 37 for the i band based on a weighted mean flux from the comparison stars we calculated  10 an extinction correction and then applied this to each comparison star the typical rms residual for both bands was 15 mmag a value that increased slightly toward the end of the night due to the increased sky brightness from the rising moon the main contributor of noise to the photometry from individual images was atmospheric scintillation which accounted for over 65 of our calculated rms young 1967 the individual photometric measurements in the g and i bands are reported in tables 4 and 5 respectively lightcurve analysis our keplercam light curves for hattr205013 give good coverage of the eclipse centered at hjd 2453666747 0001 with more than two hours of coverage both before the start of ingress and after the end of egress the eclipse itself lasts about 3 hours between first and fourth contact and is about 2 percent deep in agreement with the discovery light curve from hat our keplercam light curves clearly show the effects of limb darkening on eclipse shape as a function of wavelength the iband light curve is slightly shallower and possesses a flatter bottom than the gband curve the portions of the light curves before and after eclipse showed a slight drift which we removed with a linear fit the resulting light curves are plotted in figure 4 from our fits to the keplercam light curves we derive transit centers of 24536667465 00005 and 24536667473 00005 in the g and i bands respectively when we combine these transit times with the results from the hat photometry we get the ephemeris 245366674748 000018 n 2230736 0000010 knowing the duration and depth of the eclipse together with the orbital period we were able to derive rough values for the ratio of semimajor axis and radius of the secondary to the radius of the primary star using the relations  ttr rb where a is the orbital semimajor axis ra and rb are the primary and secondary stars radii p is the orbital period ttr is the transit length and is the transit depth in relative flux for our values of p 223 days ttr 25 hours and 002 we obtained ara 593 and rb ra 0133 from this first approximation we then built a two dimensional grid of lightcurve fits in ara and rb ra centered on the rough values obtained above the impact parameter b was introduced as a third  11 dimension in the grid varying from b 0 central transit to b 1 rb ra grazing transit the grid steps were 0002 in ara 000001 in rb ra and 0001 in b we generated synthetic lightcurves for each combination of parameters using the routines provided by mandel agol 2002 together with the quadratic limbdarkening coefficients derived by claret 2004 using the temperature and surface gravity for the primary we had derived spectroscopically we adopted solar values for the metallicity and surface turbulence of the primary star the exact coefficients we used were u1 04238 and u2 03250 in the g and u1 01814 and u2 03723 in the i band uncertainties in our values of the limbdarkening coefficients largely a result of the uncertainty in the spectroscopic temperature measurement had a negligible effect on our final results to identify the synthetic light curve that gave the best fit to the actual data we looked for the fit with the smallest value of 2 inspecting the 2 contours to ensure that we had found the global minimum we also inspected plots of the fits to the data as a qualitative check we applied this procedure to both the g and i light curves the results are summarized in table 6 to calculate the uncertainties for our values of ara rb ra and b we performed additional fits wherein we fixed one of the parameters at a value differing slightly from the bestfit value and fit for the other two parameters we changed this fixed parameter until the eventual fit achieved a 2 that was 1 away from our best fit parameters 2 we then used the difference between this 1 value and our best fit value as the uncertainty for that particular parameter we examined the correlation between the three different parameters by making a final fit to the data using the levenbergmarquardt method a combination of the inversehessian and steepest descent methods press et al 1992 this allowed us to compute the covariance matrix for the three fit parameters and thus the correlation coefficients for the parameters for all three the correlation with any of the other two was always smaller than 05 in both bands while this is not negligible we found that the contribution to the total estimated error was minor of course the levenbergmarquardt method can also be used to calculate the uncertainties in ara rb ra and b however the uncertainties that we derived from our grid analysis were substantially larger to be conservative we adopted the grid uncertainties instead of the levenbergmarquardt uncertainties figure 5 shows contour plots of 2 for our fits table 6 reports the final fitting results and errors and table 7 lists the correlation coefficients the keplercam data and bestfit light curves are shown in figure 4 simultaneous fitting of the light curves in both bands produced fits with inferior 2 statistics a result of the slight difference in rb ra in the two bands we therefore use a simple average of the light curve results as our adopted values for the parameters in table 6  12 masses and radii for hattr205013 using the values that we have measured from the eclipse light curves as well as the observed spectroscopic orbit parameters we may restrict the location of hattr205013 a and b on the massradius diagram to unique curves described completely by these observables to emphasize this we have written the observable values in brackets in the following derivation to begin we use newtons revised version of keplers third law and the spectroscopic mass function from the orbital solution 4 2 p g ma mb ka mb ma mb 23 1 e2 sin iorb where ka is the semiamplitude of the spectroscopic orbit for the primary in km s1 e the eccentricity of the orbit and g is the gravitational constant with these two equations the two unknowns ma and mb may be found p ka 1 e2 4 2 a3 ma g p 2 2a sin iorb 2 a2 ka p mb 1 e2 g p sin iorb both the orbital inclination and the semimajor axis can be expressed in terms of the observables ara rb ra and b and the unknown stellar radii ra and rb by taking our value for the impact parameter b which measures the projected separation of the primary and secondary stars at the midpoint of the eclipse the orbital inclination can be expressed in terms of the observables ara and b b ara cos iorb sin iorb 1 ara 2 similarly the semimajor axis may be written in terms of the observables ara rb ra and b and the unknown stellar radii ra and rb ara a ara ra rb ra  13 substituting these values into eq5 and 6 gives expressions for the mass of each component as functions of only the observables and the respective stellar radii 4 2 ma ara 3 1 gp 2 21 b ara ara ra ka 1 e2 ara mb rb2 gp rb ra 1 b ara therefore solely from what we are able to measure using the eclipse light curves and spectroscopy we may confine hattr205013 b to a single curve on the massradius diagram that goes as mb rb2 constant this constant is directly proportional to the surface gravity of the object which has been noted previously by southworth et al 2004 in our case the quality of our photometry allows us to measure this constant extremely accurately the uncertainty region around this surface gravity line is on the order of the line width itself when it is plotted through the assumed synchronization of the primarys rotation to the orbital period we may locate hattr205013 b on this gravity determination curve but it is important to note that the line itself is defined without having made any assumptions about the system indeed it is possible to calculate a similar gravity curve for any eclipsing system or for a system containing a transiting planet all that is required is a goodquality light curve and spectroscopic orbit this has previously been done for the case of a transiting planet by winn et al 2006 to place hattr205013 on the massradius diagram more specifically we note that that the measured eccentricity of our spectroscopic orbit for hattr205013 is indistinguishable from circular and therefore for the reasons described in the introduction we assume that the spin axes of both stars have been aligned with the orbital normal and that the rotation of both stars has been synchronized to the orbital period this allows us to use the observed rotational line broadening of the primary to solve for the radius of the primary in linear units which in turn allows us to convert the orbital size and secondary radius into linear units from the values of ara and rb ra derived from the light curves using the assumption of synchronization and that iorb irot we see by inspection that p vrot sin irot sin iorb p vrot sin irot rb rb ra sin iorb where vrot sin irot is the projected rotational broadening of the primary derived from its observed spectra we may now substitute in eq8 for sin iorb to get both radii in terms of ra  14 our observables ra rb 2 1 b2 ara 2 12 2 1 b2 ara 2 12 vrot sin irot rb ra vrot sin irot by combining these two statements with eq9 and 10 we arrive at expressions for the masses of each component in terms of just the observable quantities ka 1 e2 ara 3 vrot sin irot 3 ma 2g 1 b ara ara vrot sin irot ara 2 mb 1 e2 vrot sin irot 2 2g 1 b ara the results for the masses and radii for both components of hattr205013 are presented in table 8 the errors were estimated using montecarlo simulations and were compared with the results of formal error propagation including the correlation coefficients derived from the lightcurve fits both approaches delivered similar results the mass and radius obtained for the primary star are essentially the same for both the g and i light curves but the mass and radius for the secondary differ by 08 and 3 percent respectively this radius difference between the two light curves is close to 1 and may be due to uncertainties in the limbdarkening coefficients our adopted values are based on the average values of the light curve parameters discussion in figure 6 we plot our mass and radius for the mdwarf secondary hattr205013 b on a massradius diagram together with isochrones for ages of 05 and 5 gyr from baraffe et al 1998 we also plot the results for 11 m dwarf secondaries from the sample of ogle planetary candidates analyzed by bouchy et al 2005 pont et al 2005ab 2006 and listed in table 9 for the systems ogletr34 bouchy et al 2005 ogletr120 pont et al 2005b and the low mass systems ogletr122 pont et al 2005a and ogletr123 pont et al 2006 the authors had to use stellar models to to estimate the masses and radii of the primaries without the assumption of synchronization as synchronization implied masses and radii that were inconsistent with the spectroscopic observations for the other seven systems they were able to assume synchronization and to derive the radius of the primary from the observed rotational line broadening in general the agreement between the  15 ogle results and the baraffe et al 1998 isochrones looks promising but the observational uncertainties are still too large to allow a critical test of the theoretical models the ogle systems are all much fainter than hattr205013 which presents significant challenges for both the spectroscopic and photometric followup observations spectroscopy with the resolution and signaltonoise ratio suitable for determining accurate values for rotational broadening requires time on large telescopes and photometry for highquality light curves also requires large telescopes to achieve the needed photon statistics eclipsing binaries identified by wideangle surveys are much brighter and therefore less challenging on both counts our value for the radius of the mdwarf secondary in hattr205013 lies 11 percent about 3 above the theoretical isochrones this divergence is further reinforced by eq11 which as has been previously noted restricts the position of hattr205013 b to lie on a single line that is determined by the surface gravity of the object this gravity curve does not rely on any prior assumptions about the hattr205013 system nor does it depend upon our measured value of vrot sin irot which is the biggest contributor of uncertainty to our final results we use the assumption of synchronization and the spectroscopically measured vrot sin irot to place hattr205013 b at a specific location along the curve but it is important to note that in the region that we find hattr205013 b the curve of allowable locations runs nearly parallel to the theoretical models this is illustrated in figure 6 by the red line that passes through our point for hattr205013 b thus the conclusion that the theoretical models predict a radius for hattr205013 b that is too small by about 10 percent is on much firmer ground than the error bar in the observed radius might suggest indeed it would require a 6 difference in vrot sin irot to place hattr205013 b onto the baraffe models our result for hattr205013 b supports the suggestion from the results for doublelined eclipsing binaries plotted in figure 1 that the models predict radii for m dwarfs that are too small by up to 10 percent this discrepancy has been noted before for example by torres ribas 2002 in the case of yy gem torres et al 2006 raised the issue of whether shortperiod eclipsing binaries are representative of isolated field stars and wide binaries where tidal forces are negligible they suggested that the rapid rotation of the stars in these systems caused by tidal synchronization might give rise to enhanced magnetic activity thus decreasing the efficiency of energy transport in the convective envelopes and leading to inflated stellar radii for low mass stars this effect is examined in more detail by lopezmorales 2007 in the case of hattr205013 we see no evidence in the photometry of star spots on the primary star which would be telltale indicators of enhanced stellar magnetic activity  16 though hattr205013 a is rapidly rotating the lack of magnetic ativity is not suprising given its spectral type f7 the stars outer convective layer is relatively shallow and it is not unusual for rapidly rotating stars of this type to lack strong magnetic activity torres et al 2006 in some instances it may be possible to independently determine the rotational period of the primary through highquality light curves used to definitively identify photometric variation outside of eclipse this would serve as a check to the assumption of tidal synchronization in the system in future
