these inequalities and we formulate conje ture 15 another hafnian inequality in se tion 2 we apply the hafnian inequality of theorem 14 to our main goal improving the lower bound of rvsz and

of the paper this is a hieved in theorem 23 we point out that conje ture 15 would be suffi ient to ompletely settle the real linear polarization onstant problem  partially supported by otka grants t

is the symmetri group on n elements throughout this se tion we assume that a is a positive semidefinite hermitian n n matrix we write a 0 for su h a hadamard proved that det a aii with equality if and

matrix mar us mar1 mar2 proved that aii per a with equality if and only if a has a zero row or is a diagonal matrix lieb l generalized this to per a per a per a for a as in 1 with equality if and only if a has a zero row or b 0 moreover he proved that in the polynomial p of degree n size of a defined by p per ct t all oeffi ients ct are real and nonnegative this is indeed a stronger theorem sin e it implies per a p 1 ct cn per a per a fiokovi d mi gave a simple proof of liebs inequalities and showed also that if a and a are positive definite then cn t 0 if and only if all subpermanents of b of order t vanish lieb l also states an analogous and analogously provable theorem for determinants for a as in 1 let d det dt t if det a det a 0 then d 0 if a and a are positive definite then 1t dn t is positive for t rk b and is zero for t rk b remark in all of liebs inequalities mentioned above the ondition that the matrix a is positive semidefinite an be repla ed by the weaker ondition that the diagonal blo ks a and a are positive semidefinite the proof goes through virtually un hanged alternatively this stronger form of the inequalities an be easily dedu ed from the seemingly weaker form

the matrix b 12 ab 12 being real and antisymmetri there exists a unitary that d u 1b 12 ab 12 u is diagonal with purely imaginary matrix u su h eigenvalues a1 1 an 1 the real multiset a1 an is

arrive at ase p 1 of if a aij is a positive semidefinite symmetri real n n matrix then the hafnian q of the 2pn 2pn matrix onsisting of 2p 2p blo ks a is at least 2p 1n apii with equality if and only if a has a zero row or is a diagonal matrix conje ture 15 2 produ ts of real linear fun tionals in this se tion we apply theorem 14 to produ ts of jointly normal random variables and then to produ ts of real linear fun tionals whi h was the main motivation for this work the ideas in this se tion are analogous to those that ariasdereyna a used in the omplex ase let 1 d denote independent random variables with standard gaussian distribution ie with joint density fun tion 2d2 exp2 2 where 2 p 2 k we write ef for the expe tation of a fun tion f f f 1 d re all that ek2p 2p 1 2p 12p 3 3 1 for k 1 d easy indu tive proof via integration by parts and thus k2pk 2pk 1 on rd we write for the standard eu lidean inner produ t we re all the wellknown b2 g s z wi k formula xi xj then let x1 xn be ve tors in rd with gram matrix a xi haf a for odd n we define haf a 0 proof both sides are multilinear in the xi so we may assume that ea h xi is an element of the standard orthonormal basis e1 ed if there is an ek that o urs an odd number of times among the xi then qdboth sides are zero if ea h ek o urs 2pk times then the left hand side is e k1 k2pk and the right hand side is dk1 2pk 1 whi h are equal the following theorems are easy orollaries of theorem 14 together with the wi k formula 4 and mar uss theorem 2 if x1 xn are jointly normal random variables with zero expe tation then theorem 21 e x1 xn ex1 exn equality holds if and only if they are independent or at least one of them is almost surely zero proof the variables an be written as xi xi with of standard normal distribution and the xi onstant ve tors with a positive semidefinite gram matrix a aij xi xj then xi2 e xi 2 a a aii  haf  per a a a exi 2 exi2 with equality if and only if a is a diagonal matrix or has a zero row ie the xi are pairwise orthogonal or at least one of them is zero the generalization of theorem 21 to an arbitrary even exponent 2p is equivalent to conje ture 15 theorem 22 for any x1 xn r xi 1 the average of xi 2 on the unit sphere r 1 is at least d 2 2n d2 n d 2n 2 dd 2d 4 d 2n 2 with equality if and only if the ve tors xi are pairwise orthogonal proof the average on the unit sphere is the onstant in the theorem times the expe tation wrt the standard gaussian measure see eg b1 by theorem 21 the latter expe tation is minimal if and only if the xi are pairwise orthogonal in whi h ase it is 1 theorem 23 for real linear fun tionals fi on a real eu lidean spa e f1 fn f1 fn p nn 2n 4 3n 2 here means supremum of the absolute value on the unit sphere in the infinitedimensional ase fun tionals with infinite norm may be allowed then the onvention 0 0 should be used on the right hand side proof we may assume that the spa e is rd with d n and the fun tionals are given by fiq  xi i xi 1 then f1 fn is at least the q with f average of fi xi on the unit sphere whi h by theorem 22 and d n is at least 1nn 2n 4 3n 2 it is an unsolved problem raised by bentez sarantopoulos and tonge bst 1998 whether theorem 23 is true with nn under the square root sign in the denominator on the right hand side this is alled the real linear polarization onstant problem in the omplex ase the affirmative answer was proved by ariasdereyna a in 1998 based on the omplex analog of the wi k formula a b2 g and on liebs inequality 31 keith ball ball gave another proof of the affirmative answer in the omplex ase by solving the omplex plank problem in the real ase the affirmative answer for n 5 was proved by pappas and rvsz pr in 2004 for general n the best estimate known before the present paper was that of rvsz and sarantopoulos rs 2004 based on results of mst with 2nn 4 under the square root sign see mat1 mat2 mm r for a ounts on this and related questions note that nn 2n 4 3n 2  exp log n logn 2 logn 4
