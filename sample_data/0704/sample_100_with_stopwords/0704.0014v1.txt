arxiv07040014v1 mathca 1 apr 2007 iterated integrals and the loop product koichi fujii introduction the purpose of this paper is to describe string topology from the viewpoint of chens iterated integrals let m be a compact closed oriented dmanifold and lm be the free loop space of m the set of unbased smooth maps from s 1 to m let h lm be the homology of the free loop space shifted by the dimension of the manifold ie h lm hd lm chas and sullivan found the product on h lm which they called loop product 1 hp lm hq lm hpq lm they showed that this product makes h lm an associative commutative algebra merkulov constructed a model for this product based on the theory of iterated integrals especially of the formal power series connection 10 he showed that there is an isomorphism of algebras h lm  h m r hxi where m is the de rham differential graded algebra of m and r hxi is the formal completion of the free graded associative algebra generated by some noncommutative indeterminates on the other hand chen showed that the cohomology of the free loop space of the simplyconnected manifold is isomorphic to the cohomology of the cyclic bar complex of differential forms via chens iterated integrals see 5 or 8 h lm  h cm in this paper we construct a model for the loop product based on the theory of the cyclic bar complex we define a complex hombm m and its subcomplex hombm m so that the poincar duality induces the isomorphism of vector spaces h homcm r  hd hombm m we can define a product on hombm m which realizes the loop product theorem 11 let m be a compact closed oriented simplyconnected manifold assume that h m is of finite type let a be a differential graded subalgebra of m such that h a  h m by the inclusion then there is an isomorphism of associative commutative algebras h lm  h homba a the product defined on h homba a corresponds to the loop product under the isomorphism the paper is organized in the following way in section 2 we briefly review chens iterated integrals in section 3 we give a construction of a complex homba a and discuss its properties in section 4 we give a proof of theorem 11 in section 5 we study the iterated integrals on the free loop space of the nonsimplyconnected manifolds in section 6 we describe a relation between the product on homba a and the goldman bracket in this paper all the homologies have their coefficients in the field of real numbers acknowledgement the author would like to thank professor toshitake kohno much for helpful comments and gentle support chens iterated integrals we briefly review chens iterated integrals see 5 or 8 let m be a finite dimensional smooth manifold and let lm be the free loop space of m that is the space of all smooth maps from s 1 to m let k be the ksimplex t1 tk rk 0 t1 tk 1 we have an evaluation map k k lm m k defined by k t1 tk t1 tk then define pk to be the composition  m k m k k k lm k lm where p is the integration along the fiber of the projection p k lm lm given 1 k m the iterated integral 1 k is a differential form on lm of total degree 1 k k defined by the formula 1 k 1k11 k22 k1 kk12 pk 1 k preliminaries in this section we give a construction of some complexes let a be an arbitrary differential graded algebra in this section let a denote the dual of a the bar complex of a ba db is defined by ba r0 r sa db 1 r

chen proved the following theorem theorem 31 chen 5 let m be a simplyconnected manifold and h m be of finite type let a be a differential graded algebra of m such that a0 r and h a  h m by the inclusion then there is an isomorphism of coalgebras h ba  h m given by 1 n 7 1 n let f p ba be a filtration of ba such that f p ba 0rp r sa let p homba a n pqn hombap a and homba a n homba a n its boundary is defined by 1 r  1 r d 1 db 1 r  1 2 r 1 1r1 r 1 1 r1 r let us define the subcomplex of homba a homba a according to the chens normalization of the cyclic bar complex see 4 or 8 we define homba a to be the set of elements in homba a which satisfy the following equations for any i a0 and f a0  i2 f i1 i i1 f i i1  i1 df i 0 1 i r 1  f 1 r df 1 r 0 1 f wr 1 r f 1 r df 0 it can be easily seen that it is isomorphic to the dual of the normalized cyclic bar complex of a homba a  ca similarly let homba an pqn hombap aq and homba a  n homba an its boundary is defined by 1 r  1r d1 r 1r db 1 r 1r 1 2 r 1r 11 1 r1 r we define homba a to be the set of elements in homba a which satisfy the following equations for any i a0 and f a0  i2 f i1 i i1 f i i1  i1 df i 0 1 i r 1 r f 1 r df 1 r 0 1 f wr 1 r f 1 r df 0 the cup product on homba a is defined by 1 2 1 r 11 2 r i 1 1 i 2 i1 r 0ir since 1 2 1 2 11 1 2 h homba a becomes an algebra this product can be induced on h homba a the e1 term of their spectral sequences associated with the filtration f p ba can be calculated from the cohomology of a proposition 32 there is an isomorphism of vector spaces h homf p baf p1 ba a  homp sha ha proof let a be a differential graded subalgebra of a such that a ap for p  1 a r and a1 da0 a there is an isomorphism of vector spaces homf q baf q1 ba a  homf q baf q1 ba a since a r there is an isomorphism h0 homf q baf q1 ba a  homsha ha therefore we obtain the proposition proof of theorem 11 we give the proof of theorem 11 in this section there is a differential graded subalgebra of a a such that a r and ha  ha by the inclusion then we obtain the isomorphism of algebras h homba a  h homba a by proposition 32 therefore it suffices to verify the theorem in the case a0 r the following result is due to chen theorem 41 chen 5 h lm  h homba a proof we define c lm homba a by  1 n 1 n let fp c lm be a filtration of c lm such that fp cr lm r lm for some cq m q p r q let epq  be the associated spectral sequence define a filtration of homba a fp homba a f homba a f 1 n 0 ap1 it can be easily shown that preserves the filtrations of c lm and homba a on e2 level the map  hp m hq m hp a hq ba is given by 1 2 7  1 n 7 1 n theorem 31 asserts that this is an isomorphism therefore we obtain the theorem lemma 42 h homba a  hd homba a proof we define a chain map p homba a homba a by  1 n p 1 n define a filtration of homba a by fp homba a homba a 1 n adp the map p preserves those filtrations on e2 level the map p h dp a hq ba hp a hq ba is given by  7 7  this is isomorphic and we obtain the lemma proof of theorem 11 we can verify that h lm is isomorphic to h homba a as vector spaces by composing the maps in theorem 41 and lemma 42 we can also verify that there is an isomorphism of associative commutative algebras indeed the cup product of homba a on e2 level h dp a hq ba h ds a ht ba h 2dps a hqt ba is given by a g b h 7 1dpqds a b g h where g h satisfies g h1 n g1 i hi1 n then the following theorem asserts that the loop product and the cup product coincide on e2 level theorem 43 cohenjonesyan 6 let m be a simplyconnected manifold then epq  becomes an algebra and converges to h lm as algebras on e2 level the product  hp m hq lm hs m ht lm hpqd m hst lm is given by a g b h 1dspqd a b gh where a hp m b hs m g hq m h ht m a b is the intersection product and gh is the pontryagin product therefore we obtain the theorem the conjugacy classes of fundamental groups let denote a fundamental group of a smooth manifold m and j denote an augmentation ideal of the group ring of r chen showed that the completion of the fundamental group with respect to the powers of its augmentation ideal is isomorphic to the dual of the 0th cohomology of the bar complex of differential forms via iterated integrals 3 lim rj p  h 0 ba where a is a differential graded subalgebra of m such that a0 r and h a  h m based on this work we study iterated integrals on the free loop space of the nonsimplyconnected manifold let denote the set of conjugacy classes of and j p denote prj p where pr is the projection of r onto r theorem 51 let m be a smooth manifold and h m is of finite type let a be a differential graded subalgebra of m such that the map h q a h q m induced by the inclusion is isomorphic if q 0 1 and injective if q 2 then there is an isomorphism of vector spaces lim rj p  h0 homba a we give the proof of this theorem in this section let be a fixed point in s 1 in this section let lm be a set of smooth maps from s 1 to m which are constant maps near let x m be a subspace of lm whose elements send to x m let diffs 1 denote diffeomorphisms of s 1 which coincide with identity map near we define q lm to be equivalent by a reparameterization iff there is a smooth map q diffs 1 such that t t t s 1 q let c lm be a chain complex having as a basis the totality of equivalence classes of smooth simplexes of lm let c x m be a chain complex having as a basis the totality of equivalence classes of smooth simplexes of x m c x m becomes a noncommutative associative algebra as follows the product of 1 and 2 in c x m is defined to be the path product or 0 according as deg1 deg2 1 or 1 the augmentation c x m r is given by  1 or 0 according as deg 0 or 0 let be a smooth simplex of m define for each cq lm ni i cq lm i cq lm becomes a noncommutative associative algebra let denote the augmentation of cq lm given by ni i 7 ni define a filtration of cq lm by fp cq lm kerp q m kerp proposition 52 the map p fp cq lm homf p1 ba a given by  1 p  7 1 p 7 7 is welldefined chain map and fp cq lm kerp proof the welldefinedness can be verified by the following lemma which can be verified as in proposition 15 proposition 411 2 and in proposition 153 lemma 53 chen 1 if and c lm are equivalent by a reparameterization then  1 n 1 n 2 if 1 2 cq lm then x z 1 2 1 n 1 i 2 i1 n 3 if f 0 m then for any i  1 f i1 n 1 f i n 1 i1 df i n 0 to verify fp cq lm kerp it suffices to show kerp kerp let s denote the section of which sends points of m to the constant map take 1 s 2 s p s kerp where cq m and i cq lm then 1 s 2 s p s p z  1 s 1 p1 1 k s 1 p s therefore we obtain the proposition let c m x denote a set of smooth simplexes of m neighborhood of whose vertices are at x in m we define c sc p c m x sc m xp here sc m xq cq1 m x or 0 according as q 0 or q 0 its boundary is given by the sum of the boundary on each complex let us construct a chain map c sc p fp c lm fp1 c lm considering the following three cases case 1 if 1 p scm xp then  1 p 7 1 x 2 x p x where x is regarded as a constant map case 2 if 1 p scm xp then  1 p 7 1 x 2 x i p x where i 1 7 i t x m is i t i 1 1 tv0 tv2 1 2tv0 2tv1 if 0 t 12 i 1 1 tv0 tv2 2 2tv1 2t 1v2 if 12 t 1 here v0 v1 v2 are the vertices of the standard simplex case 3 if 1 p c1 m x scm xp then  1 p 7 t1 1 xt t1 p xt where t 0 1 s 7 st m t 1 lemma 54 the following diagram commutes  fp c1 lm fp1 c1 lm c sc p c sc p  fp

proposition 52 gives the map hq fp clm fp1 clm hq homf p baf p1 ba a lemma 55 for q 0 the following map is isomorphic h0 fp clm fp1 clm  h0 homf p baf p1 ba a proof we obtain the following surjection by lemma 54  h0 c sc p h0 fp clm fp1 clm composing with the isomorphism p h1 m  h0 c sc p the map p h1 m h0 fp clm fp1 clm homp h 1 a r is given by 1 n 7 1 p 7 1 this is isomorphic and we obtain the lemma lemma 56 for q 1 the following map surjective h1 fp clm fp1 clm h1 homf p baf p1 ba a proof it suffices to show that the following map obtained by lemma 54 is surjective ker h1 fp clm fp1 clm homp sha ha 1  then if 1 p ker c0 m x scm xp  1 1 p p  1 p 7 1 p 7 if deg 0 otherwise through the above map if 1 p ker c1 m x scm x  then  1 p 7 1 p 7 1 when deg 1 then we can verify the surjectivity and obtain the lemma proof of theorem 11 consider the spectral sequences of clm fp clm and homf p1 ba a associated with fq clm and homf q ba a respectively lemma 55 asserts that p is isomorphic on e1 level at degree 0 h0 fq clm fq1 clm  h0 homf q baf q1 ba a lemma 56 asserts that p is surjective on e1 level at degree 1 h1 fq clm fq1 clm h1 homf q baf q1 ba a then there is an isomorphism on er level at degree 0 for r 1 we have rj p  h0 clm fp clm  h0 homf p ba a therefore we obtain the theorem the goldman bracket this section is devoted to the proof of the following theorem theorem 61 let m be a compact closed oriented surface with genus g then the goldman bracket induces a lie algebra structure on limp rj p and there is an isomorphism of lie algebras lim rj p  h0 hombh m h m goldman showed that the vector space spanned by the free homotopy classes of closed curves on a closed oriented surface has a lie algebra structure 9 this work led chas and sullivan to the string topology we would verify that this structure makes limp rj p a lie algebra on the other hand we can construct a bracket on h0 hombh m h m by the cup product defined in section 3 and the conness operator here we regard h m as a differential graded algebra with a trivial differential theorem 61 asserts that those two lie algebras are isomorphic first we describe a relation between this bracket and the augmentation ideal of the group ring of the surface group to induce a lie algebra structure on limp rj p then we construct a bracket on h0 homba a and verify the isomorphism of lie algebras lim rj p  h0 homba a finally we verify the isomorphism h0 homba a  h0 hombh m h m the following proposition makes limp rj p a lie algebra proposition 62 1 if p 1 and q 2 then j p j q j pq2 2 if p 2 then j p r j p1 proof we give a proof of 1 take 1 x p x j p 1 y q y  j q where i x m and i y m assume that all curves are immersions and i j intersect transversally for any i j let i j denote the set of intersection points of i and j also assume that all the intersection points are distinct ie i j k l if i 6 k or j 6 l then x x s i j sx i x p x1 x  ij si j i1 x sx  sy j y q y1 y j1 y sy sx i1 x p x1 x i1 x sx sy j1 y q y1 y j1 y sy  j pq2 here sx is a path from s to x along i and sy is a path from s to y along j the proof of 2 can be verified in the same way let a be a differential graded subalgebra of m such that h a  h m by the inclusion proposition 63 there is an isomorphism of vector spaces h homf p ba a  h2 homf p ba a proof we define p h2 homf p ba a h homf p ba a by  1 p p 1 p this map preserves the filtrations on e 1 level the map homq ha ha homq ha ha is isomorphic therefore we obtain the proposition now we construct a bracket on h0 homba a first we define the conness operator b h homf p ba a h1 homf p1 ba a b1 p1 1k 1p1 k k1 p1 1 k 1 0kp1 composing these maps and the cup product we can define a bracket on h0 homf p ba a by 1 2 p p 1 b1 p 1 b2 h0 homf p1 ba a take

intersect transversally for any i j k also assume that j and ak or bk intersect transversally for any j k assume that all the intersection points are distinct then for any i j k we can take each tubular neighborhoods of ai and bi so that it does not include some neighborhoods of intersection points of j and k we fix such neighborhoods of intersection points and denote them by up for each p we can also take a tubular neighborhood of the diagonal map from m to m m outside those neighborhoods of intersection points of i and j for any i j ie n i s 1 p i1 up j s 1 p j1 up i j here n denotes the tubular neighborhood of the diagonal map thom class of this tubular neighborhood satisfies  p i j i 1 u j 1 u where p i j is the intersecion number of i and j at p fig 1 define e c0 lm c1 lm by e t t let k 1 k n be differential forms on m which has its support inside the tubular neighborhoods of ai and bi then 1 n i j p i j pi j k pi j k i p 1 k i 1 u j 1 u e i e j j p i p 1 k k1 n 1 k j p k1 n k1

finally we obtain the equality 1 pq2 z z xz z k1 p1 j 1 k l1 pq2 j p l jkl z z k1 p1 j 1 k z z l1 pq2 j p l since we can take i h 1 m 1 i p q 2 so that their support are inside the tubular neighborhoods of aj and bj we obtain the proposition proof of theorem 61 we obtain the following isomorphism of lie algebras by proposition 64 lim rj p  h0 homba a to obtain the isomorphism of lie algebras h0 homba a  h0 hombh m h m we introduce the following lemma which asserts the formality of the compact khler manifolds lemma 68 ddc lemma delignegriffithsmorgansullivan 7 let x be a compact khler manifold and dc j 1 dj where j gives the complex structure in the cotangent bundle if is a differential form on x such that d 0 and dc 0 and such that d then ddc for some cor there are quasiisomorphisms of differential graded algebras x d kerdc d hdc x 0 notice that a closed oriented surface endowed with a complex structure become a khler manifolds for the dimensional reason therefore the following lemma completes the proof of the theorem lemma 69 if f a1 a2 is a quasiisomorphism of differential graded algebras then the map induced by f h0 homba1 a 1 h0 homba2 a2 is an isomorphism proof it suffices to verify that the map induced by f f h0 homf p ba1 a 1 h0 homf ba2 a2 is an isomorphism for any p on e 1 level the map induced by f homsha1 ha1 homsha2 ha2 is an isomorphism because f is quasiisomorphism therefore we obtain the lemma therefore we obtain the theorem references 1 m chas and d sullivan string topology preprint 1999 httparxivorg absmathgt9911159 2
