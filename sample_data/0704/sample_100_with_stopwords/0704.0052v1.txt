arxiv07040052v1 hepth 31 mar 2007 quantum field theory on curved backgrounds ii spacetime symmetries arthur jaffe and gordon ritter abstract we study spacetime symmetries in scalar quantum field theory including interacting theories on static spacetimes we first consider euclidean quantum field theory on a static riemannian manifold and show that the isometry group is generated by oneparameter subgroups which have either selfadjoint or unitary quantizations we analytically continue the selfadjoint semigroups to oneparameter unitary groups and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated lorentzian manifold the method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space whose lorentzian continuation is antide sitter space 1 introduction the extension of quantum field theory to curved spacetimes has led to the discovery of many qualitatively new phenomena which do not occur in the simpler theory on minkowski space such as hawking radiation for background and historical references see 2 6 18 the reconstruction of quantum field theory on a lorentzsignature spacetime from the corresponding euclidean quantum field theory makes use of osterwalderschrader os positivity 15 16 and analytic continuation on a curved background there may be no proper definition of timetranslation and no hamiltonian thus the mathematical framework of euclidean quantum field theory may break down however on static spacetimes there is a hamiltonian and it makes sense to define euclidean qft this approach was recently taken by the authors 11 in which the fundamental properties of osterwalderschrader quantization and some of the fundamental estimates of constructive quantum field theory1 were generalized to static spacetimes the previous work 11 however did not address the analytic continuation which leads from a euclidean theory to a realtime theory in the present article we initiate a treatment of the analytic continuation by constructing unitary operators which form a representation of the isometry group of the lorentzsignature spacetime associated to a static riemannian spacetime our approach is similar in spirit to that of frhlich 4 and of klein and date february 22 2007 for background on constructive field theory in flat spacetimes see 8 9 arthur jaffe and gordon ritter landau 13 who showed how to go from the euclidean group to the poincar group without using the field operators on flat spacetime this work also has applications to representation theory as it provides a natural functorial quantization procedure which constructs nontrivial unitary representations of those lie groups which arise as isometry groups of static lorentzsignature spacetimes these groups are typically noncompact for example when applied to adsd1 our procedure gives a unitary representation of the identity component of sod 2 moreover our procedure makes use of the cartan decomposition a standard tool in representation theory 2 classical spacetime 21 structure of static spacetimes definition 21 a quantizable static spacetime is a complete connected orientable riemannian manifold m gab with a globallydefined smooth killing field which is orthogonal to a codimensionone hypersurface m such that the orbits of are complete and each orbit intersects exactly once throughout this paper we assume that m is a quantizable static spacetime definition 21 implies that there is a global time function t defined up to a constant by the requirement that t thus m is foliated by timeslices mt and m where the unions are disjoint m0 and are open sets corresponding to t 0 and t 0 respectively we infer existence of an isometry which reverses the sign of t  such that 2 1 id fix a selfadjoint extension of the laplacian and let c m2 1 be the resolvent of the laplacian also called the free covariance where m2 0 then c is a bounded selfadjoint operator on l2 m for each s r the sobolev space hs m is a real hilbert space defined as completion of cc m in the norm kf k2s hf c s f i the sk for k 0 is hilbertschmidt define s t inclusion hs and s0 s s0 hs m then  h1 m s form a gelfand triple and s is a nuclear space recall that s has a natural algebra of measurable sets see for instance 7 8 17 there is a unique gaussian probability measure with mean zero and covariance c defined on the cylinder sets in s see 7 quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries more generally one may consider a nongaussian countablyadditive measure on s and the space e l2 s we are interested in the case that the monomials of the form a f1 fn for fi s are all elements of e and for which their span is dense in e this is of course true if is the gaussian measure with covariance c for an open set q m let e denote the closure in e of the set of monomials a i fi where suppfi for all i of particular importance for euclidean quantum field theory is the positivetime subspace e e 22 the operator induced by an isometry isometries of the underlying spacetime manifold act on a hilbert space of classical fields arising in the study of a classical field theory for f c m and m m an isometry define f 1 f f 1 since detd 1 the operation f f extends to a bounded operator on h1 m or on l2 m a treatment of isometries for static spacetimes appears in 11 definition 22 let be an isometry and a f1 fn e a monomial define the induced operator a f1 fn and extend by linearity to the domain of polynomials in the fields which is dense in e 3 osterwalderschrader quantization 31 quantization of vectors the hilbert space h of quantum theory in this section we define the quantization map e h where h is the hilbert space of quantum theory the existence of the quantization map relies on a condition known as osterwalderschrader or reflection positivity a probability measure on s is said to be reflection positive if f f d 0 for all f in the positivetime subspace e e let be the reflection on e induced by define the sesquilinear form a b on e e as a b ha bie so 31 states that f f 0 assumption 1 os positivity any measure d that we consider is reflection positive with respect to the timereflection arthur jaffe and gordon ritter definition 31 osquantization given a reflectionpositive measure d the hilbert space h of quantum theory is the completion of e n with respect to the inner product given by the sesquilinear form a b denote the quantization map for vectors e h by a and write h bih a b ha bie for a b e 32 quantization of operators the basic quantization theorem gives a sufficient condition to map a possibly unbounded linear operator t on e to its quantization a linear operator t on h consider a denselydefined operator t on e the unitary timereflection and the adjoint t t a preliminary version of the following was also given in 10 definition 32 quantization condition i the operator t satisfies qci i the operator t has a domain dt dense in e ii there is a subdomain d0 e dt dt for which db0 h is dense iii the transformations t and t both map d0 into e theorem 33 quantization i if t satisfies qci then i the operators t d0 and t d0 have quantizations t and tc with domain d0 ii the operators t t d0 and tc agree on d0 iii the operator t d0 has a closure namely t proof we wish to define the quantization t with the putative domain d0 t t for any vector a d0 and for any b d0 n it is the case that  a  b the transformation t is defined by 33 iff t a t a  b b hence one needs to verify that t d0 n n which we now the assumption d0 dt along with the fact that is unitary ensures that d0 dt therefore for any f d0  f bi hf t bie ht f bie h t f bie ht f bie ht in the last step we use the fact assumed in part iii of qci that t d0 e yielding the inner product of two vectors in h we infer from the schwarz inequality in h that f k hf t bie kt h kbkh 0 as hf t bie hf t bih this means that t b d0 as d0 is dense in h by qciii we infer t b 0 in other words t b n as required to define t quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries in order show that d0 dt perform a similar calculation to 34 with arbitrary a d0 replacing b namely  f i hf t ih hf t aie h t f aie ht f aie ht the right side is continuous in h and therefore f dt further f this identity shows that if f n then t  f 0 more t f t hence t d0 has a quantization tc and we may write 35 as in particular proof t f tc f for all f d0 is densely defined so t has a closure this completes the definition 34 quantization condition ii the operator t satisfies qcii i both the operator t and its adjoint t have dense domains dt dt ii there is a domain d0 e in the common domain of t t t t and t t iii each operator t t t t and t t maps d0 into e theorem 35 quantization ii if t satisfies qcii then i the operators t d0 and t d0 have quantizations t and tc with domain d0 ii if a b d0 one has hb t ih htc b ih remarks i in theorem 35 we drop the assumption that the domain d0 is dense obtaining quantizations t and tc whose domains are not necessarily dense in order to compensate for this we assume more properties concerning the domain and the range of t on e ii as d0 need not be dense in h the adjoint of t need not be defined nevertheless one calls the operator t symmetric in case one has hb t ih ht b ih for all a b d0 iii if t is a denselydefined extension of t then tc on the domain d0 proof we define the quantization t with the putative domain d0 as in the proof of theorem 33 this quantization t is welldefined iff it is the case that t d0 n n for any f d0 n by definition kf kh 0 also ht f t f ih t f t f ht f t f ie hf t t f ie where one uses the fact that d0 dt t thus ht f t f ih f t t f  hf t t f ih arthur jaffe and gordon ritter here we use the fact that t t maps d0 to e thus one can use the schwarz inequality on h to obtain t f k ht f t f ih kf kh kt h 0 hence t d0 n n and t has a quantization t with domain d0 in order verify that t d0 has a quantization one needs to show that t d0 n n repeat the argument above with t replacing t the assumption t t d0 e yields for f d0 n ht f t f ih ht f t f ie hf t t f ie hf t t f ih use the schwarz inequality in h to obtain the desired result that ht f t f ih kf kh kt t f kh 0 hence t has a quantization tc with domain d0 and for b d0 one has c b in order to establish ii assume that a b d0 then b t hb t ih  hb t aie h t b aie ht b aie  b i  ht h ht b ih this completes the proof 4 structure and representation of the lie algebra of killing fields for the remainder of this paper we assume the following which is clearly true in the gaussian case as the laplacian commutes with the isometry group g a further explanation was given in 11 assumption 2 the isometry groups g that we consider leave the measure d invariant in the sense that defined above is a unitary representation of g on e 41 the representation of g on e lemma 41 let gi be an analytic group with lie algebra gi i 1 2 and let g1 g2 be a homomorphism there cannot exist more than one analytic homomorphism g1 g2 for which d if g1 is simply connected then there is always one such let d ddt denote the canonical unit vector field on r let g be a real lie group with algebra g and let x g the map td txt r is a homomorphism of lier g so by the lemma there is a unique analytic homomorphism x r g such that dx d x conversely if is an analytic homomorphism of r g and if we let x dd it is obvious that x thus x 7 x is a bijection of g onto the set of analytic homomorphisms r g the exponential map is defined by quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries expx x 1 for complex lie groups the same argument applies replacing r with c throughout since g is connected so is expg hence expg g0 where g0 denotes the connected component of the identity in g it need not be the case for a general lie group that expg g0 but for a large class of examples the socalled exponential groups this does hold for any lie group expg contains an open neighborhood of the identity so the subgroup generated by expg always coincides with g0 we will apply the above results with g isom the isometry group of m and g lieg the algebra of global killing fields thus we have a bijective correspondence between killing fields and 1parameter groups of isometries this correspondence has a geometric realization the 1parameter group of isometries s x s expsx corresponding to x g is the flow generated by x consider the two different 1parameter groups of unitary operators 1 the unitary group s on l2 m and 2 the unitary group s on e stones theorem applies to both of these unitary groups to yield denselydefined selfadjoint operators on the respective hilbert spaces in the first case the relevant selfadjoint operator is simply an extension of ix viewed as a differential operator on cc m this is because for f cc m and p m we have xp f lx f p f s ps0 thus ix is a denselydefined symmetric operator on l2 m and stones theorem implies that ix has selfadjoint extensions in the second case the unitary group s on e also has a selfadjoint generator x which can be calculated explicitly by definition eisx i y fi s fi now replace s s and calculate ddss0 applied to both sides of the last equation to see that i x f1 ixfj fj1 fn fi one may check that is a lie algebra representation of g ie x y x y 42 the cartan decomposition of g for each g there exists some dense domain in e on which is selfadjoint as discussed previously arthur jaffe and gordon ritter however the quantizations acting on h may be hermitian antihermitian or neither depending on whether there holds a relation of the form with one of the two possible signs or whether no such relation holds even if 41 holds to complete the construction of a unitary representab tion one must prove that there exists a dense domain in h on which selfadjoint or skewadjoint this nontrivial problem will be dealt with in a later section using theorems 33 and 35 and the theory of symmetric local semigroups 12 4 presently we determine which elements within g satisfy relations of the form 41 let as an operator on c m and consider a killing field x g also as an operator on c m define t g g by t x x from 42 it is not obvious that the range of t is contained in g to prove this we recall some geometric constructions let m n be manifolds let m n be a diffeomorphism and x vectm then  1 x x 1 defines an operator on c n one may check that this operator is a derivation thus 43 defines a vector field on n the vector field 43 is usually denoted  x dx1 p and referred to as the pushforward of x we now wish to show that g g g where g are the 1eigenspaces of t this is proven by introducing an inner product x y g on g with respect to which t is selfadjoint theorem 42 consider g as a hilbert space with inner product x y g the operator t g g is selfadjoint with t 2 i hence g g g as an orthogonal direct sum of hilbert spaces where g are the 1eigenspaces of t further t g hence dimg 1 elements of g have hermitian quantizations while elements of g have antihermitian quantizations2 proof write 42 as t x 1 x x thus t is the operator of pushforward by the pushforward of a killing field by an isometry is another killing field hence the range of t is contained 2it is not the case that g consists only of in particular dimg 2 for m h it can occur that dim g 0 quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries in g also t must have a trivial kernel since t 2 i and this implies that t is surjective it follows from 45 that t is a hermitian operator on g hence t is diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues which are square roots of 1 this establishes the decomposition 44 that elements of g have hermitian quantizations while elements of g have antihermitian quantizations follows from theorem 33 a cartan involution is a lie algebra homomorphism g g which squares to the identity it follows from 42 that t is a lie algebra homomorphism thus theorem 42 implies that t is a cartan involution of g this implies that the eigenspaces g g form a cartan pair meaning that g g g g g g and g g g clearly g is a subalgebra while g is not and any subalgebra contained in g is abelian 5 reflectioninvariant and reflected isometries let g isom denote the isometry group of m as above then g has a z2 subgroup containing 1 this subgroup acts on g by conjugation which is just the action conjugation is an inner automorphism of the group so   1 1 definition 51 we say that g is reflectioninvariant if  and that is reflected if  1 let gri denote the subgroup of g consisting of reflectioninvariant elements and let gr denote the subset of reflected elements note that gri is the stabilizer of the z2 action hence a subgroup an alternate proof of this proceeds using gri expg although gr is closed under the taking of inverses and does contain the identity the product of two reflected isometries is no longer reflected unless they commute generally the product of an element of gr with an element of gri is neither an element of gr nor of gri the only isometry that is both reflectioninvariant and reflected is itself thus we have gr gri 1 gr gri g theorem 52 let g0 denote the connected component of the identity in g then g0 is generated by gr gri this is a form of the cartan decomposition for g arthur jaffe and gordon ritter proof since g g g as a direct sum of vector spaces though not of lie algebras we have g0 expg expg expg choose bases i i1n for g respectively then we have g0 expsi 1 i n s r expsj 1 j n s r furthermore expsi is reflected while expsi is reflectioninvariant completing the proof corollary 53 the lie algebra of the subgroup gri is g to summarize the isometry group of a static spacetime can always be generated by a collection of n dim g oneparameter subgroups each of which consists either of reflected isometries or reflectioninvariant isometries 6 construction of unitary representations 61 selfadjointness of semigroups in this section we recall several known results on selfadjointness of semigroups roughly speaking these results imply that if a oneparameter family s of unbounded symmetric operators satisfies a semigroup condition of the form s s s then under suitable conditions one may conclude essential selfadjointness a theorem of this type appeared in a 1970 paper of nussbaum 14 who assumed that the semigroup operators have a common dense domain the result was rediscovered independently by frhlich who applied it to quantum field theory in several important papers 5 3 for our intended application to quantum field theory it turns out to be very convenient to drop the assumption that a such that the s all have ascommon dense domain for a in favor of the weaker assumption that 0 ds is dense a generalization of nussbaums theorem which allows the domains of the semigroup operators to vary with the parameter and which only requires the union of the domains to be dense was later formulated and two independent proofs were given one by frhlich 4 and another by klein and landau 12 the latter also used this theorem in their construction of representations of the euclidean group and the corresponding analytic continuation to the lorentz group 13 in order to keep the present article selfcontained we first define symmetric local semigroups and then recall the refined selfadjointness theorem of frhlich and klein and landau definition 61 let h be a hilbert space let t 0 and for each 0 t let s be a symmetric linear operator on the domain d h such that i d d if and d 0t d is dense in h ii s is weakly continuous iii s0 i s d d for 0 t and quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries iv s s s on d for 0 t in this situation we say that s d t is a symmetric local semigroup it is important that d is not required to be dense in h for each the only density requirement is i theorem 62 12 4 for each symmetric local semigroup s d t there exists a unique selfadjoint operator a such that3 d dea and s ea d for all 0 t also a c if and only if ks f k ec kf k for all f d and 0 t 62 reflectioninvariant isometries lemma 63 let be a reflectioninvariant isometry and assume p such that p then preserves the positivetime subspace ie  proof we first prove that suppose not then p with p 6  assume p without loss of generality we could repeat the same argument with p then contains p p a contradiction since we used the fact that id so p p hence restricts to an isometry of it follows that the restriction of to m m is also an isometry however m where denotes the disjoint union therefore is wholly contained in either or since is a homeomorphism and so is connected the possibility that is ruled out by our assumption so lemma 63 has the immediate consequence that if g then the oneparameter group associated to is positivetimeinvariant this result plays a key role in the proof of theorem 64 63 construction of unitary representations the rest of this section is devoted to proving that the theory of symmetric local semigroups can be applied to the quantized operators on h corresponding to each of a set of 1parameter subgroups of g isom the proof relies upon lemma 63 and theorems 33 35 and 62 theorem 64 let m gab be a quantizable static spacetime let be a killing field which lies in g or g with associated oneparameter group of isometries r then there exists a denselydefined selfadjoint operator a on h such that if g b e if g 3the authors of 4 12 also showed that  h s d where b is essentially selfadjoint is a core for a ie a d 0 s t arthur jaffe and gordon ritter proof first suppose that g which implies that the isometries are reflected and so define  1 for all in some neighborhood of zero is a nonempty open subset of  and moreover as 0 increases to fill with 0 these statements follow immediately from the fact that for each p  p is continuous with respect to and 0 is the identity map since we infer that e e by theorem 35  has a quantization which is a symmetric operator on the domain d e note that d is not necessarily dense in h 4 we now show that theorem 62 can be applied fix some positive constant a with a nonempty note that  e e it follows that is dense in h this establishes condition i of definition 61 and the other conditions are routine verifications theorem 62 implies existence of a denselydefined selfadjoint operator a on h such that b expa for all 0 a this proves the theorem in case g now suppose that g implying that the isometries are reflectioninvariant and  1 on e lemma 63 implies that e e by theorem 33 has a b which is defined and satisfies quantization b b 1 on the domain e which is dense in h by definition in this case we b extends by continuity to a onedo not need theorem 62 for each parameter unitary group defined on all of h not only for a dense subspace by stones theorem b expia for a selfadjoint and for all r the proof is complete 4density of d  would be implied by a reehschlieder theorem which we do not prove except in the free case theorem 62 removes the need for a reehschlieder theorem in this argument quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries 7 analytic continuation each riemannian static spacetime m gab has a lorentzian continuation mlor which we construct as follows in adapted coordinates the metric gab on m takes the form ds2 f xdt2 g xdx dx the analytic continuation t it of 71 is standard and gives a metric of lorentz signature ds2 lor f dt2 g dx2 by which we define the lorentzian spacetime mlor einsteins equation ricg k g is preserved by the analytic continuation but we do not use this fact anywhere in the present paper let i 1 i n be bases of g respectively let ai a be the denselydefined selfadjoint operators on h constructed by theorem 64 let  expiai  for 1 i n be the associated oneparameter unitary groups on h we claim that the group generated by the n n n oneparameter unitary groups 72 is isomorphic to the identity component of glor isomlor the group of lorentzian isometries since locally the group structure is determined by its lie algebra it suffices to check that the generators satisfy the defining relations of glor lieglor since quantization of operators preserves multiplication we have x y z g x y z b z in what follows we will use the notation b g for x  x g quantization converts the elements of g from skew operators into hermitian operators ie elements of b g are hermitian on h and hence elements of i b g are skewsymmetric on h thus b g i b g is a lie algebra represented by skewsymmetric operators on h theorem 71 we have an isomorphism of lie algebras glor g i b proof let mc be the manifold obtained by allowing the t coordinate to take values in c define mc mc by t 7 it then glor is generated by where j i j i 1in j 1jn it is possible to define a set of real structure constants fijk such that  j fijk k arthur jaffe and gordon ritter applying to both sides of 75 the commutation relations of glor are seen to be i j fijk k together with the same relations for g as before now 73 implies that 76 are the precisely the commutation relations of b g i b g completing the proof of 74 corollary 72 let m gab be a quantizable static spacetime the unitary groups 72 determine a unitary representation of g0 lor on h 71 conclusions we have obtained the following conclusions there is a unitary representation of the group g0 lor on the physical hilbert space h of quantum field theory on the static spacetime m this representation maps the timetranslation subgroup into the unitary group expith where the energy h 0 is a positive denselydefined selfadjoint operator corresponding to the hamiltonian of the theory the hilbert space h contains a ground state 0 1 which is such that h0 0 and 0 is invariant under the action of all spacetime symmetries we obtain these results via analytic continuation from the euclidean path integral under mild assumptions on the measure which should include all physically interesting examples this is done without introducing the field operators nonetheless theorems 33 and 35 do suffice to construct field operators in the special case m rd with g so4 we obtain a unitary representation of the proper orthochronous lorentz group g0 lor l so0 3 1 8 hyperbolic space and antide sitter space consider euclidean quantum field theory on m h d the metric is ds2 r 2 dx2i where we define r xd for convenience the laplacian is h d 2 dr  r 2 rd the d 1 coordinate vector fields xi i 6 d are all static killing fields and any one of the coordinates xi i 6 d is a satisfactory representation of time in this spacetime it is convenient to define t x1 as before and to identify t with time the timezero slice is m0 h d1 from h d v rd1 hv vi 1 v0 0 it follows that isomh d o d 1 and the orientationpreserving isometry group is so d 1 quantum field theory on curved backgrounds iispacetime symmetries figure 1 flow lines of the killing field t2 r 2 t 2tr r on h

a convenient basis for g any ddimensional manifold satisfies dim g dd 12 manifolds saturating the bound are said to be maximally symmetric and h d is maximally symmetric now t f t f t so t t hence t g similar calculations show 0 and thus spans g while t span g the commutation relations5 for g are   t t  t 2 these calculations verify that g g forms a cartan pair as defined in the flows associated to 82 are easily visualized is a righttranslation and flowlines are radially outward from the euclidean origin the flows of are euclidean circles indicated by the darker lines in figure 1 hence the flows of are defined on all of e while the flows of are analogous to spacetime rotations in r2 and hence must be defined on a wedge of the form w t r t r 0 tan1 rt the simple geometric idea of section 62 is nicely confirmed in this case the flows of the generator of g preserve the t 0 plane and are separately isometries of and corollary 72 implies that the procedure outlined above defines a unitary representation of the identity component of isoads2 on the physical hilbert space h for quantum field theory on this background including theories with interactions that preserve the symmetry since isoadsd1 5note that quite generally g g g so its automatic that is proportional to arthur jaffe and gordon ritter sod 2 we have a unitary representation of so0 1 2 the latter is a noncompact semisimple real lie group and thus it has no finitedimensional unitary representations but a host of interesting infinitedimensional ones appendix a euclidean reehschlieder theorem we prove the euclidean reehschlieder property for free theories on curved backgrounds it is reasonable to expect this property to extend to interacting theories on curved backgrounds but it would have to be established for each such model since it depends explicitly on the twopoint function the reehschlieder theorem guarantees the existence of a dense quantization domain based on any open subset of for this reason one could use the reehschlieder rs theorem with nussbaums theorem 14 to construct a second proof of theorem 64 under the additional assumption that m is realanalytic fortunately our proof of theorem 64 is completely independent of the reehschlieder property this has two advantages we do not have to assume m is a realanalytic manifold and more importantly our proof of theorem 64 generalizes immediately and transparently to interacting theories as long as the hilbert space h is not modified by the interaction we state and prove this using the oneparticle space however the result clearly extends to the quantumfield hilbert space theorem a1 let m be a quantizable static spacetime endowed with a realanalytic structure and assume that gab is realanalytic let o and d c o l2 then db 0 proof let f l2 with f d for x define x hf x ih hf cx il2 realanalyticity of x follows from the realanalyticity of the integral kernel of c which in turn follows from the elliptic regularity theorem in the realanalytic category see for instance 1 sec ii13 now by assumption for any g cc o we have 0 h fih hf cgil2 m let g x for x o then 0 hf cx il2 x since o 0 by realanalyticity we infer
