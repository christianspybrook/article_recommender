cb3 0wa uk email pmukhopadhyaydamtpcamacuk abstract we discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in spacetime expanded around ppwave backgrounds according to this property the spacetime lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations called universal sector turns out to be same around all the ppwaves even offshell with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars in this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only in the context of bosonic string theory we consider onshell ppwaves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of worldsheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the ppwave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux such results can also be reproduced using the worldsheet conformal field theory we also study such ppwaves in nonpolynomial closed string field theory csft in particular we argue that for an offshell ppwave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and csft with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields because of this simplification it is expected that the offshell ppwaves can be identified on the two sides furthermore given the massless ppwave field configurations an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the csft equations of motion has been discussed all our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common neveuschwarz

maximally supersymmetric type iib plane wave background with constant fiveform ramondramond rr flux rr plane wave 2 possesses a universality property according to this property there exists a universal sector of string configurations for which the classical spacetime action evaluated around the rr plane wave takes the same value as in flat space the argument leading to this property involved showing that the relevant lightcone worldsheet theory 3 4 has certain properties that are required to hold in order for the universal sector to exist by looking at the other examples of ppwaves where string theory has been studied in lightcone gauge this universality property was then generalised to all the exact string solutions of ppwave type hereafter called exact ppwaves with the same profile for the dilaton the original motivation for this work was to study open string tachyon condensation 5 in rr backgrounds in fact it was argued that the above universality property applied to the dbrane worldvolume actions has the following indication for every dbrane configuration extending along the lightcone directions x in flat space there exists a corresponding dbrane configuration in each of the relevant ppwaves moreover for unstable configurations the tachyon potential is universal the aforementioned correspondence is in the sense that the tachyon solutions representing such dbranes in the worldvolume theory on an unstable dbrane configuration are universal this also implies the same dbrane descent relations of flat space 6 in case of the relevant dbranes in ppwaves the above argument is based on the classical theory in spacetime and therefore understanding of the systematics of the string loop expansion in rr backgrounds seems important in this case1 assuming this reliability if correct the above results are nontrivial at least for the following reasons the universality of tachyon potential is a new result for an rr background which does not follow from the analysis of 7 once we know how to formulate open string field theory in an rr ppwave we have a prediction for the tachyon potential moreover the universal sector of dbranes contain nonbps dbranes which are difficult to study using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism 8 9 10 11 the open string boundary condition for the worldsheet fields that are spacetime spinors were found in 10 to be bilocal in flat background this boundary condition should have proper generalisations to other relevant ppwaves2 although the arguments of 1 which was designed to relate the spacetime theory and the lightcone worldsheet theory showed the existence of a universal sector of string configurations its precise description was not found it was also not clear whether string theory plays any special role as long as the universality is concerned the purpose of the present paper is to go beyond the lightcone argument of 1 and study the universality property further with a fully covariant treatment the results of this paper are summarised below 1 we consider an arbitrary covariant field theory of tensorial fields in spacetime and define the universal sector of field configurations we argue that the spacetime lagrangian density evaluated around a ppwave background even offshell with the fluctuations restricted to the universal sector is insensitive to the ppwave nature i thank ashoke sen for emphasising this point this question wa studied in 1 for the case of type iib rr plane wave of the background metric and background fluxes 2 using the construction of bosonic nonpolynomial closed string field theory csft 12 13 in an exact ppwave given in terms of the relevant worldsheet conformal field theory cft we argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of worldsheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the background gauge flux and the ppwave nature of the background metric such requirements can indeed be verified explicitly using the worldsheet cft 3 using the equivalence between the low energy effective field theory eft and csft with all the higher massive modes integrated out as formulated by ghoshal and sen in 14 we describe a general method of identifying between the two sides the offshell ppwave configurations with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of the transverse coordinates this method also includes an iterative procedure to compute all the massive field configurations using their equations of motion below we shall discuss these results in more detail following the same order a ppwave 15 16 17 admits a covariantly constant null killing vector corresponding to translation of a particular coordinate v or x generically an n 2dimensional ppwave can be obtained by attaching an ndimensional euclidean space called the transverse space parameterised by xi i 1 2 n with a twodimensional space parame terised by u or x and v such that the only nonzero component of the covariant metric tensor with a v index is uv which is constant in brinkmann coordinates 15 the ppwave nature of the metric is manifested in the fact that the components uu u x and ui u x are generically nonzero but independent of v as required by the null killing symmetry the background can also contain null gauge fluxes and scalars all independent of v the universal sector of field configurations is obtained by restricting the number of covariant v indices with respect to the number of covariant u indices of a generic tensorial fluctuation in a certain way and not letting the fluctuation vary along v by considering an arbitrary covariant field theory in spacetime we argue that the effects of the background fluxes and the metric components uu and ui are erased inside the universal sector so that the effective metric becomes ds2ef f 2dudv g ij u xdx dx where ij g ij u x is the transverse space metric which is also independent of v this however is not true for the background scalar fields since the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field can be thought to determine the effective couplings of a theory the universal sector should be sensitive to that value this gives the complete covariant description of universality for tensorial fields as observed in 1 in the context of lightcone gauge given the above discussion which directly concerns the spacetime theory we then proceed to study its relevance to string theory from the worldsheet point of view our discussion in the context of string theory will be restricted to bosonic strings which can be generalised to the common neveuschwarz ns sectors of superstring theories in this framework we deal with the worldsheet sigma model cft corresponding to an exact ppwave with dilaton independent of transverse coordinates 18 19 20 21 a natural framework where the above discussion of universality can be related to the worldsheet theory appears to be the closed string field theory csft using the connection between cft and csft3 we identify a set of operators in the cft called the universal sector of operators which correspond to the universal sector of field configurations we then argue that universality requires the correlation functions involving only such operators to be insensitive to the background gauge flux and the ppwave nature of the background metric more precisely such correlation functions are expressed in terms of those in the effective background 11 with both the gauge flux and dilaton switched off we verify these relations explicitly using the worldsheet theory finally we study ppwaves with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse directions in csft it was argued by horowitz and steif in 19 that certain more restricted ppwaves which are solutions of the low energy effective field theory eft are also exact solutions in string theory to all orders in expansion by exploiting certain special geometrical properties of the backgrounds it was argued that all the corrections to the eft equations of motion drop off for these restricted ppwaves this however is not true for the generic ppwave ansatz of our consideration as described at the beginning of this paragraph in this case one expects to receive corrections to all orders4 certainly computing these corrections to arbitrarily high order seems impossible from the point of view of sigma model perturbation theory nevertheless an encouraging feature is that all a csft is usually constructed with reference to a worldsheet cft and it describes the spacetime theory expanded around the corresponding background it was argued in 20 that such corrections can give rise to new exact stringy solutions such corrections to the equation of motion are quadratic in fields since in the context of csft does not play the role of a small expansion parameter one may wonder if such corrections can be computed using this framework this however requires us to find the precise relation between eft and csft this problem was formulated by ghoshal and sen in 14 which we refer the reader to for the details the basic idea behind this relationship is that after integrating out all the massive modes of csft by using their equations of motion one arrives at an effective field theory with the same massless dynamical degrees of freedom as in eft such that it is related to eft through suitable field redefinition although this field redefinition is quite complicated in general once known it provides us with a map between the offshell configurations of eft and csft with all the massive fields integrated out we point out that a horowitzsteif type argument implies that for a generic offshell ppwave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates such field redefinitions simplify enormously to become at most quadratic in fields given this expectation we then proceed to formulate a csft computation that will enable us to find this field redefinition and therefore the offshell map relating such ppwaves in eft and csft moreover it turns out that all the aforementioned corrections to the equation of motion are invariant under this field redefinition and therefore can be directly obtained from the relevant csft computation this computation however by itself does not enable us to find the massive modes on the csft side given the profiles of the massless modes of eft to this end we discuss an iterative method of computing the massive modes of csft using their equations of motion therefore the whole construction enables us to find the csft solution for any exact ppwave given its form on the eft side or equivalently given the worldsheet sigma model cft5 it would be interesting to perform the relevant csft computations to realise the above procedure explicitly and find the desired corrections to the equation of motion it would also be interesting to study the universality property by including the spacetime spinors although we do not have a formulation of string field theory in rr backgrounds the worldsheet counterpart of universality can perhaps still be studied using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism such as pure spinor formalism 23 the rest of the paper is organised as follows the general discussion of the universality property of an arbitrary spacetime theory has been given in sec2 its worldsheet coun5 see 22 for an earlier discussion on this topic terpart in the context of string theory is discussed in sec3 our discussion of ppwaves in csft has been given in sec4 several appendices contain various technical details a universality in ppwaves in this section we shall elaborate on the universality property of a spacetime theory and give its precise statement we begin by discussing the generic form of the relevant backgrounds these are ppwaves which admit a covariantly constant null killing symmetry the generic ansatz for an n 2dimensional ppwave metric is given by 15 16 17 ds2 2dudv ku xdu2 2ai u xdudxi g ij u xdx dx we shall use 0 1 n 1 for the n 2dimensional vector indices with i 1 2 n being the transverse space vector indices the lightcone coordinates are u x 12 xn 1 x0 and v x 12 xn 1 x0 ku x ai u x and g ij u x are certain arbitrary smooth functions as mentioned earlier all these functions are  in independent of v as a requirement of the null killing symmetry generated by v addition to the metric the background may contain gauge field fluxes which are null and scalars all independent of v for example if the second rank antisymmetric tensor6 b and the dilaton d are switched on then the nonzero components are given as follows uij hij u x i bj u x j bi u x d u x where b b b b is the gauge invariant flux hij u x bi u x and u x are certain arbitrary functions independent of v b can therefore be chosen to have the following nonzero components bui bi u x notice that for arbitrary values of the functions appearing in eqs21 and 22 the background is in general offshell we shall now describe what we mean by a universal sector of field configurations with a simple example let us consider a scalar field propagating in the background ppwave we shall denote the metric the second rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field its threeform field strength and the dilaton of the low energy effective field theory of string theory by b and d respectively metric 21 with flat transverse space g ij u x ij the lagrangian density is taken to be where det it takes the value 1 whenever is given by 21 with flat transverse space and the laplacian computed for such a metric is   2u v ai ai kv2 i ai v 2ai i v where the transverse laplacian is  i i notice that all the terms in the lagrangian density containing the functions ku x and ai u x which make the background non trivially different from flat space also contain derivatives with respect to v it is therefore immediately clear that the configurations u x independent of v effectively see the background to be flat in other words for all backgrounds in 21 with g ij ij lu x is same and is equal to that computed in flat background therefore in the present example the universal sector of field configurations is given by the set of all u x notice that by restricting field configurations to this sector we are mimicking the limit k 0 ai 0 and therefore universality holds even for offshell backgrounds we shall now proceed to generalise the above discussion to any covariant spacetime field theory which includes fields of arbitrarily high integer spins and where all the spacetime fields are allowed to fluctuate let v u x be a tensor field of arbitrary rank in a given theory denoting its background value for an offshell ppwave configuration by u x we define the fluctuations v u x  v u x u x v u x we shall now use notations v u x u x and v u x for the sets of all possible fields v u x their ppwave background profiles and the corresponding fluctuations respectively if lv u x denotes the covariant lagrangian density for the present theory then the lagrangian density for fluctuations l v u x lu x v u x will generically depend on the background configuration u x but according to the universality property there exists a restricted set of fluctuations u s u x independent of v such that any covariant lagrangian density evaluated on u s u x takes the same value around all the ppwaves even offshell with the same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars ie if u x and u x are two arbitrary ppwave backgrounds with same transverse space metric g ij u x and background scalars then l u s u x l u s u x in particular if corresponds to a flat transverse space with all the background scalars set to zero or a nonzero constant for the dilaton then l u s u x will take the same value as in flat space lf lat u s u x we shall now specify what the universal sector u s u x is first tensorially reduce a generic element v u x of the set v u x to the transverse space it will be mv mu decomposed into a set of fields ijk v u x where mv and mu are the numbers of covariant v and u indices respectively then u s u x is given by the set of all possible mv mu fields ijk u x independent of v such that mu mv m m u s u x ijk u xmu mv 210 notice that the deformations of flat background that correspond to ppwave backgrounds 21 22 themselves are contained in the universal sector we prove the universality theorem 28 or eq29 for the tensorial fields in appendix a notice that while defining u s in 210 we did not commit to any specific form of the spacetime action this automatically raises the question whether the universal sector is invariant under field redefinition or not if we have two sets of spacetime fields v u x and v u x related by a field redefinition then a generic element in v u x can be written as  v u x f v u x 211 where the right hand side represents a generic field redefinition involving fields inside v u x and their derivatives the question is if we restrict the fields on the right hand side to be inside the universal sector u s u x then whether the field on the left hand side is necessarily inside u s u x or not we have argued in appendix b that the answer is indeed yes we shall end this section with some comments about the symmetries certainly the isometries of the transverse space are preserved by the universal sector but the lorentz transformation generated by luv which is not a symmetry of any of the ppwave backgrounds appears to be a symmetry of the universal sector see also 1 when the transverse space metric is independent of u this transformation scales u and v equally in the opposite way and therefore scales the functions ku x and ai u x while preserving the ppwave structure of the background but since the universal sector is insensitive to such components of the metric the transformation remains a symmetry within this sector7 the lorentz transformation generated by lvi does not preserve the ppwave structure though it takes the universal sector to itself the transformation generated by lui preserves the ppwave structure but it takes the universal sector to outside universality on worldsheet our discussion in the previous section has been general and applicable to any covariant field theory in spacetime expanded around a ppwave background in this section we shall study the universality property in the context of string theory from the worldsheet point of view in order to do so we shall consider exact ppwaves that are given by the ansatz in 21 22 with the further restriction that the transverse space is flat and the background dilaton is independent of transverse directions ij u x ij  u for the analysis in this section the transverse space will play the role of a spectator and therefore any g ij u x which corresponds to an onshell background can be incorporated we restrict it to flat space merely to simplify our presentation since the statement in 28 concerns a spacetime field theory a natural framework to study its relevance to the worldsheet theory is string field theory indeed a string field theory is usually constructed for an onshell background given by the corresponding to see this more explicitly one notices that any term in the spacetime lagrangian density evaluated on the universal sector has equal number of u and v indices this is simply because the effective metric for such terms is on the u vplane this term therefore must be invariant under equal and opposite scaling along u and v directions worldsheet sigma model cft using this connection here we shall derive certain worldsheet properties that are required to hold in order for the universality theorem 28 to be valid in particular we shall find that the correlation functions of a specific set of worldsheet operators should be given in terms of those in flat background with both the gauge flux and dilaton switched off we shall verify these results explicitly using worldsheet techniques in appendices c and d we begin by considering the bosonic nonpolynomial csft action s pp 12 13 around an onshell ppwave background 21 22 31 s pp 1 x 1 n pp  n2 n where is the closed string coupling constant which is related to the constant part of the background dilaton8 n pp is a certain sphere correlation function in cftpp cftgh which involves n string fields here cftpp and cftgh denote the matter conformal field theory corresponding to the ppwave background and the background independent b c ghost cft respectively among the n s 2 is special in the following sense it is given by a particular inner product h qpp i as defined in 13 where qpp is the brst charge corresponding to the ppwave background therefore the matter part of the relevant correlator involves the matter stress tensor t ppz t pp z the matter part of any other n for n 2 involves only the matter part of the string field according to 28 the string field theory action spp u s evaluated at a string field configuration u s that is restricted to the universal sector must be same for all ppwaves with the same dilaton profile in 31 having the transverse space already been chosen to be flat9 below we shall derive the relevant sigma model correlators from this condition for the cases of constant and nonconstant dilaton separately we follow the notations of 13 except for the following few differences 1 we use the notation for the string field instead of 2 we have absorbed a factor of inside the string field so that the coupling constant appears only as a prefactor in the action 3 we are using an additional superscript pp or f lat on various notations to explicitly indicate the background we have also removed the subscript 0 from the notation 0 in 13 notice that both the statement 28 and its proof in appendix a consider the spacetime lagrangian density while here in the discussion of csft we are considering the spacetime action this could make a difference in case of the nonconstant dilaton but it will be explained in section 32 see footnote 11 that this does not happen when the background dilaton depends only on u as we are considering here and therefore our analysis with the action goes through i thank ashoke sen for emphasising this point constant dilaton since the dilaton is constant and is taken to be same for all the backgrounds under consideration the overall coupling dependent factor in eq32 is same therefore in order for 28 to be true we must have nu s pp nu s f lat in order to derive the relevant cft correlators as discussed above let us first see what it means to have the string field restricted to the universal sector in terms of cft the string field can be thought of as a first quantised state in cftpp cftgh satisfying certain conditions see 13 for the complete definition of the string field this first quantised state is expanded in terms of the basis in the relevant subspace of the matterghost hilbert space therefore every such basis state has a matter and a ghost operator associated with it the coefficients in this expansion turn out to play the role of the spacetime fields since the ghosts are background independent the tensorial properties of these fields are determined by the corresponding matter operators therefore the universal sector of field configurations defined in eq210 corresponds to restricting the matter operators to a certain subsector which we call universal sector of matter operators10 below we shall specify this sector explicitly satisfaction of eq33 for n 2 will then imply that all possible matter correlators involving operators only from the universal sector are universal and same as that evaluated in flat background as discussed above for n 2 there is an extra source of background dependence through the stress tensor however we shall see that eq33 is automatically satisfied for n 2 once the aforementioned universality of the relevant cft correlators holds the worldsheet lagrangian density for the matter part takes the following form for the relevant backgrounds  v u  ku xu u  a u xu x  i a u xx i u lpp u v  i xi x where a i ai bi and i 1 2 24 for an exact background this is a conformal field theory with central charge 26 the universal sector of matter operators ou s which notice that all the ghost operators are universal anyway as the ghost sector is background independent corresponds to the universal sector of field configurations given in eq210 is given by ou s  mi u  m u  nj v  nj v oxeipu z zmu m mv mv where ox is an arbitrary operator in the transverse part of the cft in flat space these operators are well defined whose correlators can be computed easily although it is difficult to solve the relevant cft for an arbitrary exact ppwave as has already been explained the correlation functions of the operators inside ou s are universal and should be same as that evaluated in flat background oi zi zi ipp h oi zi zi if lat for oi ou s i where h ipp and h if lat denote matter correlators in ppwave and flat background with out any flux respectively we have derived eq36 using the worldsheet theory in appendix c we shall now show that the condition 36 is enough to guarantee the relation 33 for n 2 we first write lpp lf lat lpp  v u  xi x  i is the lagrangian density corresponding to the where lf lat u v flat background therefore the stress tensor and the brst charge also take the similar structure t z t f lat z t pp z t z t f lat z t pp z qpp qf lat qpp 38 where t f lat z t f lat z and qf lat denote the stress tensor components and the brst charge in the flat background notice that t f lat z and t f lat z are contained in ou s this means hu s qf lat u s ipp is universal therefore in order for eq33 to be true for n 2 we need to have hu s qpp u s ipp 0 to see why this is right first notice that the only matter operators that appear in qpp are t pp z and t pp z as the brst charge is linear in the energymomentum tensor the next step is to argue that the operators t pp z and t pp z are contained in ou s this can be easily seen by fourier expanding the functions k and ai appearing in t  0 1 referring to the standard coordinates on the cylinder  u u u u dku d24 k kku keiku u ikx dku d24 k i ku keiku u ikx  u x x u u x 310 where kku k and i ku k are the fourier transforms of ku x and ai u x respectively finally notice that any given term in these operators has no dependence on v and at least one first order derivative of u then using the flat space result that a correlator involving the elements of ou s is nonzero only when the total numbers of us and v s we mean derivatives of them are same we arrive at eq39 nonconstant dilaton the situation is more complicated when the dilaton varies in spacetime in this case using the general argument of appendix a one has the following form of the spacetime action evaluated on the universal sector s u s 2 dud24 x e2u uu x 311 where vv is the infinite volume resulting from the integration over v u denotes the background dilaton in 31 that appears in the worldsheet sigma model such that it does not include any constant part this constant part is absorbed into so that the effective string coupling is ef f u eu uu x is the universal contribution implying that11 s f lat u s dud24 x uu x 312 we shall now translate the requirement of universality as given by eqs311 312 into condition on the cft correlators this will be done by an induction method and therefore we begin by considering an example below referring the reader to the issue raised in footnote 9 we notice that considering the spacetime action instead of the lagrangian density could make a difference in the present case only if there were a term in u which is a total derivative with respect to u such terms however are not allowed due to general covariance in fact according to the general argument of appendix a uu x can involve only transverse derivatives see footnote 14 this is also responsible for the fact that in the present case uu x does not have any dependence on the background dilaton let us consider the graviton h in the string field expansion d26 k h kc1 c1 1 ki 313 where ki eikx 0 00i 0i being the sl2c vacuum12 this contributes to 2 f lat a term of the following form see for example 14 d26 kd26 p p2 k ph kh p d26 x h x 2 h x 226 314 where h x and h k are fourier transform of each other restricting this term to the universal sector one gets 226 dud24x h u x h u x 315 where u s represents the quantity with the field components restricted according to 210 fourier transforming this universal term back to the momentum space one gets dpu d24 p dku d24 k k 2 pu ku 24 p k h pu ph ku k 316 in an arbitrary ppwave background with background dilaton u the universal term in 315 is supposed to be replaced by 226 h u x dud24 x e2u h u x 317 fourier transformation of this expression gives dpu d24 p dku d24 k k 2 n 0 h pu ph ku p dla la pu ku la p k 318 where l is the fourier transform of u comparing the factors kept in the curly brackets in the expressions 316 and 318 we conclude that in presence of the nontrivial dilaton the particular two point vertex changes in the following way k 2 pu ku 24 p k k 2 n 0 dla la pu ku la p k the cft states 0i and ki have been denoted by 1i and 1 ki respectively in 13 319 generalising this to an n 2point vertex one gets f p k k pu ku kui 24 p  k 2n z  f p k k i n 0 pu ku kui dla la la 24 p k k i  i1 k i 320 where it is understood that each of the momenta appearing in the argument of the factor f p k k i has zero covariant v component notice also that the above equation is schematic in the sense that depending on the vertex f can carry spacetime indices for the twopoint vertex considered above f is a scalar as the gravitons are contracted between each other but there are terms where the gravitons are contracted with momenta in such cases f will carry the necessary indices since the vertex is computed from a cft correlator we conclude from the expression 320 that a generic matter correlator that appears in the computation of s pp u s with a nonconstant dilaton is given by iku u ikx hi oout e n 0 iku hi oout e 0 0 iku u ik i x oi e zi zi oin eipu u ipx 0 0ipp dla la l u ikx a1 a 0 0 for oout oin oi ou s i iku u ik i x oi e lat zi zi oin eipu u ipx 0 0if0 321 where i is the inversion map iz 1z the correlator on the left side is computed in cftpp where the background contains a nonconstant dilaton u the correlators on the right side are computed in cftf lat with the dilaton set to zero notice that the right hand side can be computed in any other relevant background with 0 as the computation is done in the universal sector to check a simple consistency condition if the left hand side is computed in a background with constant dilaton u c then one sets k ck on the right side the result turns out to be e2c times the same correlator computed with u 0 which is expected notice also that eq321 is claimed only for the universal sector generically the result will be complicated if we sprinkle around nonuniversal operators inside the correlator the derivation of the result 321 using path integral has been presented in appendix d notice that the above argument is based on the universality of uu x in the sense of eqs311 312 and we have not explicitly addressed the potential background dependence of the csft quadratic term through the energymomentum tensor as we did in the case of constant dilaton in presence of a nontrivial dilaton u the energymomentum tensor receives a correction 24 of the following form in addition to that in eq310 over its flatspace expression  u 2 u  2 u u dl l2 leilu 322 this operator belongs to ou s and is independent of v therefore by the same argument as given below eq310 a matter correlator involving t and an arbitrary number of operators inside ou s is zero in flat space with constant dilaton then using eq321 we conclude hu s qpp u s ipp u 0 323 where qpp is the dilaton contribution to the brst operator qpp which is linear in  this shows that there is no dependence of the csft action on the background dilaton inside the universal sector that might be introduced through the brst operator this is consistent with the fact that uu x is independent of the background dilaton as claimed in footnote 11 generalisation to nsr superstrings the above discussion in bosonic string theory can be generalised to the common ns sector of the neveuschwarzramond nsr superstrings here we demonstrate this by considering type ii string theory we have already discussed the bosonic sector of the worldsheet theory the fermionic sector of the worldsheet lagrangian density for an exact nsns ppwave takes the following form in conformal gauge f lat lpp ii lii lii 324 where the lagrangian density for flat background is  v v  u i  i ah lfiilat u 325 and lpp ii  u ai u x u  i i  u ku x u  u i dij u xu  i j eij u xx  i u j ah ci u xu pij u x u i u j qijk u x u i j k j k u i 326 where ci u x dij u x eij u x pij u x qijk u x are certain functions constructed out of hij u x and derivatives of ku x and ai u x ah in eqs325 326 are obtained by replacing and hij hij in this case we consider the spacetime tensors coming from the nsns sector states the spacetime indices on these fields come from both worldsheet bosons and fermions in the matter sector following eq210 one finds that the universal sector of matter operators is given by ouiis ob mub mb mvb mvb of muf mf mvf mvf m m  327 where the bosonic part ob mub mb mvb mvb is given by the same operator as that appears inside the curly bracket in eq35 the only differences being that the dimensionality of the transverse space is now 8 instead of 24 and a change in notation where we have added a superscript b to various numbers mu etc appearing in eq35 the fermionic part is given by muf muf mf mvf mvf mvf mvf  nj v of z z 328 where of is an arbitrary operator constructed out of the transverse i and i the numbers m appearing in eq327 are defined as follows m mb mf m mb mf mb mub mb mb mvb mvb mf muf mf mf mvf mvf 329 the general arguments leading to the conditions on the correlation functions in the bosonic case namely eq36 for constant dilaton and eq321 for nonconstant background dilaton remain the same therefore the analogues of those those conditions are given by the same equations ie 36 and 321 with the universal sector of operators now given as in eq327 for constant dilaton the worldsheet derivation of this condition has been given in appendix c for nonconstant dilaton it goes through in the same way as discussed in appendix d for the bosonic case as any nontriviality of this analysis involves only the bosonic sector of the worldsheet theory ppwaves in closed string field theory it was shown in 19 that there is a large class of ppwaves that are exact solutions in string theory to all orders in corrections for such solutions hij in eq22 and fij u x i aj u x j ai u x are taken to be functions of only u and therefore are more restricted than what we have considered in 21 22 31 with this restricted ansatz all the corrections to the low energy effective field theory eft equations of motion are zero as we shall briefly review below this is not true for our more general ansatz in fact in our case such unknown corrections are in principle nonzero at arbitrary higher orders in this section we shall discuss a general method of identifying an offshell ppwave background of eft in csft with all the massive modes integrated out by their equations of motion the offshell ansatz that we consider is given on the eft side by eqs21 22 and 31 in general such an exact identification certainly up to field redefinition of offshell field configurations is difficult to do in practice this is because the field redefinition between eft and csft with all the massive modes integrated out is in general complicated we shall argue that for the offshell ppwave ansatz that we are considering here this field redefinition is at most quadratic in fields and therefore can be found with limited computations in this work we shall not perform any explicit csft computation rather we shall formulate the problem in principle and indicate how the explicit construction can be done by computing a set of cubic terms in the action 32 our analysis will indicate that all the corrections to the equations of motion discussed above which will be shown to be invariant under the relevant field redefinition can be computed using csft we shall also outline an iterative method of computing the massive modes using the csft equations of motion in terms of the functions ku x ai u x bi u x and u characterising the background on the eft side whenever these functions correspond to an exact cft on the worldsheet our iterative procedure gives the corresponding csft solution for definiteness we shall consider the nonpolynomial bosonic csft action 32 constructed around the flat space but it should be possible to generalise the basic method to incorporate the common ns sectors of superstrings since we shall not perform any explicit csft computation our construction as indicated above will be based on the expectation that eft and csft with all the massive modes integrated out are physically equivalent the connection between these two theories is as follows integrating out all the massive fields in csft by satisfying their equations of motion one arrives at an effective field theory involving the same massless field content as in eft there could be certain additional unphysical fields which can be eliminated away algebraically the dynamical fields of the two theories and their offshell gauge transformations should be related by suitable field redefinitions once this field redefinition is completely known any offshell field configuration in one of the two theories can be identified in the other this field redefinition was found at the linearised level in 14 which we refer the reader to for the detailed formulation of the above connection below we first briefly review the offshell ppwave ansatz and the relevant equations of motion on the eft side and then discuss our construction in csft in section 42 effective field theory the field content of the eft includes the metric the dilaton d and the second rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field b whose threeform field strength is  b the action is given by dudvd24x l  e2d r 4 d d  o where the proportionality constant in the action is left arbitrary as a freedom of adding a constant piece to d the action receives corrections at arbitrary higher order in the nonzero components of the offshell background that we are interested in are given by uu ku x ui ai u x bui bi u x d u the theory possesses gauge symmetries under general coordinate transformations and antisymmetric tensor gauge transformations the offshell ansatz in 43 is not gauge invariant and therefore has been written by fixing some of the gauge symmetries some amount of residual gauge symmetry is still present which preserve the above ansatz this has been discussed in appendix e all the corrections in 42 are not identically zero for the generic ansatz 43 the equations of motion reduce to the following form 1 2  k u i ai fij f ij  i fij 0  i hij 0  hij h ij 2u2 c2  f h 0 where fij and hij have been defined in eqs41 and 22 respectively the last equation generically receives corrections to all orders all such corrections collectively given by the term c2  f h are quadratic in fij andor hij but contain arbitrary higher powers of transverse derivatives 20 17 in a special case where both fij and hij are independent of the transverse coordinates 19 fij fij u hij hij u all such corrections drop off notice that the last equation in 44 is invariant under adding a purely u dependent function to ku x ku x ku x f u the fact that the equations 44 are at most quadratic in fields will be crucial in our following discussion on csft closed string field theory as mentioned earlier here we shall formulate the problem of identifying the offshell ppwave configuration 43 in csft we denote the set of dynamical fields of csft by g h b d massive where massive is the set of infinite number of massive fields after integrating out the full set massive one arrives at a low energy effective field theory containing only g b d and certain additional nondynamical fields that can be eliminated away algebraically see 14 for the details of the procedure the field redefinition that relates these dynamical fields and that of eft takes the following form h v u x v u x f  b d b v u x b v u x f  b d  dv u x dv u x f b d where in the last equation derivative of the dilaton has been considered in order to make the equation insensitive to a constant shift which was also left unfixed while writing down the eft action in 42 it was shown in 14 that at the linearised level the field redefinition takes the form of the above equations with all the f fields set to zero therefore all such fields are necessarily at higher orders in the hatted fields notice that we have also used the wellknown fact that the dilaton always appears with derivatives in these fields we have argued in appendix e that for a generic offshell ppwave background 43 the only nonvanishing f function is the component fuu  b d which takes the following form fuu uu k ui ai bui bi u d u k2 ai bi u where k2 ai bi u is an undetermined scalar on the transverse space which is second order in the fields ai bi and but may contain transverse derivatives of arbitrarily high order notice that such transverse derivatives can not act on therefore by the similar argument as in appendix e the dilaton dependence is restricted only to the following type of additive terms u u u i ai and u i bi where arbitrarily high powers of transverse laplacian are allowed to act on i ai andor i bi this implies huu k k2 hui ai bui bi where the dilaton is identified up to an additive constant given these equations we shall now onwards work with the variables huu ai bi and on the csft side one would therefore expect the csft equations of motion to include the first two equations in 44 in the same form and the last equation in the following form e1 huu ai u e2 ai bi u 0 where 1 2  huu u i ai 2u2 1 2 k2 ai bi u fij f ij hij h ij e2 ai bi u  c2 f h e1 huu ai u are the terms which are linear and quadratic in fields respectively 410 we shall now try to understand how the first two equations in 44 and eq49 are realised in csft the csft equation of motion is given by qi 1 n  i 0 n 2 n 411 where q qf lat the string field i is expanded in terms of ghost number two states with certain properties in the combined matterghost conformal field theory the fields huu hui bui and d as given by eqs48 appear in the coefficients of these states in such an expansion in particular following 14 we may write for the massless component imassless dku dk huu ku k1  i ku k ibi ku k 1  i ku k ibi ku k 1 c1 c1 ku ki dku dk k i i ku k ibi ku k c 0 c1 1 ku ki 2 z dku dk k i i ku k ibi ku k c 0 c1 1 ku ki  dku 2ku c1 c1 c1 c1 ku ku c 0 c1 1 c1 1 ku i 412 where huu ku k i ku k bi ku k and ku are the fourier transforms of huu u x ai u x bi u x and u respectively c 0 2 c0 c0 the first two equations in 44 and the linear part in 49 should therefore be obtained from the first term in eq411 indeed these parts can be shown to be obtained from the massless quadratic part of the action 32 which was computed in 14 in particular e1 huu ai u in eq49 is contributed by the following term computed in 14 in the quadratic lagrangian density up to a constant prefactor 1 2 1 2  h h h d hvv huu u i ai u2 413 where in the second step we have restricted the fields inside square brackets according to our ansatz in 43 notice that the term computed is outside the universal sector as it contains the component hvv generically a higher rank equation of motion e universal sector 0 414 where the subscript indicates that the expression has covariant tensor indices for the fields inside universal sector can not carry covariant v indices if includes covariant u indices then there exists a nonuniversal field varying which the equation of motion 414 is supposed to be obtained therefore to get such an equation of motion one needs to compute all the terms in the action that are linear in the relevant nonuniversal field13 in the context of 413 the relevant nonuniversal field is hvv and therefore to get the full form of the relevant equation of motion one needs to compute all the terms in the action 32 for flat background that are linear in hvv fortunately from 49 410 it is clear that such terms must be at most cubic in order since the quadratic terms have already been computed in 14 to complete the task one needs to compute only the cubic terms in the lagrangian density which should be given by up to a constant prefactor hvv u xe2 ai u x bi u x u u 415 from this computation one should be able to obtain all the corrections to the eft equation of motion given by c2 f h also notice that the presence of an additive term u u in k2 ai bi u can not be concluded from this computation since it is a purely u dependent term the equation of motion is insensitive to adding such a term as explained below eq45 with this we conclude our discussion of formulating the problem of identifying the offshell massless ppwave configurations of eft in csft we shall now discuss how to compute the massive fields in csft once the massless components are given in terms of the functions ku x ai u x bi u x and u following eqs48 from the above discussion we have concluded n imassless 0 n 2 416 this however is not true if the expression on the left hand side of 414 is a scalar in fact for any scalar field solution t x that depends entirely on the transverse directions the relevant equation of motion can be obtained without computing any nonuniversal term in the action this is why such solutions are universal in the context of the worldvolume theory on an unstable dbrane configuration in a ppwave background with constant dilaton this argument was applied in 1 to certain tachyon solutions representing lower dimensional dbranes gravity solutions on the other hand are not generically universal because of the requirement of computing nonuniversal terms in the action ppwaves themselves are examples of this although these solutions belong to the universal sector the solutions themselves are not generically universal universality of a given ppwave solution p implies that it can be realised as a solution in all the ppwave backgrounds in a given universality class a universality class is the set of all ppwaves for which the universality theorem 28 holds and therefore can be characterised by the transverse space and the profiles for the background scalars this in turn implies that p can be superposed with any solution representing a ppwave belonging to this universality class this is not true in general as the last equation in 44 is not linear whenever the quadratic piece drops off for a given ppwave the solution is universal and can be superposed with any other ppwave solution nevertheless it is generically true that given two arbitrary ppwaves a third one can always be found but the sum rule is not simple superposition rather more complicated when the quadratic terms are nonzero and qimassless 2 imassless 0  i fij 0 i hij 0 e1 huu ai e2 ai bi u 0 417 where n imassless denotes the massless component of n i for reasons to be clarified shortly let us denote the massless component in 412 by 1 i then notice that the massive part of 21 i can still be nonzero this switches on higher massive modes through the equation of motion 411 therefore the coefficients of all such higher massive states in i must be higher order in the functions appearing in eqs48 to compute such coefficients we first expand it according to the degree of order at which those functions appear n i 418 where n i is the component of the string field whose expansion involves coefficients that are only nth order in these functions for example 1 i imassless in eq412 is linear subtracting the string field equation in 417 from 411 we get 1 x 1 x n n i 2 i 0 419 n m i qn i 1 n i 2 m2 n 3 n n1 where 2 i 21 i 21 imassless 420 to solve eq419 iteratively we introduce a parameter to count the order of fields 1 x  qn i 1 n i  nm n m i 2 m2 1 x  n n n i 2 2 i 0 n 3 n n1 421 we shall now show that equating the coefficient of each power of to zero gives us a well defined iterative procedure to construct the full solution equating the coefficient of 2 to zero one gets q2 i 2 i 0 422 at the third order one finds q3 i 1 2 i 1 3  i 0 3 1 423 at the nth order n 4 the equation turns out to be qn i 1 n 1 i 1 nx n n n i 2 n2 r0 n1 n2 nr 2 pr ni rn n nr n1 nr i 0 424 rn r 1 where the summations in the parenthesis in the second line are constrained the constraint is also shown in the subscript to that parenthesis since 1 i is known one can use eq420 to compute 2 i which can in turn be used in eq422 to compute 2 i the standard way is to fix a gauge for the massive fields so that q can be inverted to solve eq422 once 2 i is known it can be used along with 1 i in eq423 to solve 3 i in order to establish that this iterative method continues to hold one needs to show that to find the solution at the nth order namely n i using eq424 the knowledge for n 1 i is not required this can be easily verified by investigating eq424 for example at n 4 one gets q4 i 1 3 i 22 i 21 2 i 41 i 0 425 notice that this iterative method is different from a small parameter expansion in the latter case at every stage of the iteration an equation is solved approximately by neglecting terms of higher order in our method an equation at a given stage of the iteration is solved exactly acknowledgement i am thankful to justin r david cesar gomez michael b green alok kumar and nicholas p warner for useful discussion and juan maldacena for

for their interest this work was financially supported by pparc a proof of universality here we shall explain our argument for why the universality theorem in 28 holds in the ppwave backgrounds as described in eqs 21 and 22 in this argument we shall be concerned only with the tensor fields in spacetime for which the universal sector is given in eq210 in order to proceed with the argument we shall first demonstrate this with a particular form of the spacetime action namely the low energy effective field theory action for massless fields in bosonic string theory which has all the essential features relevant to our discussion later we shall generalise the argument to an arbitrary covariant action therefore we start with the action in 42 for the metric the second rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field and dilaton we first expand the fields around the background 21 22  g b b d where g b and are the background fields in eqs21 23 and 22 respectively therefore u x and v u x as defined below eq26 are the sets of these background fields and the hatted fields that appear as fluctuations in the above equations in the present context the universal sector defined in eq210 is therefore given by u s u x uu u x uv u x ui u x ij u x uv u x ui u x ij u x u x the lagrangian density in 42 once computed by restricting the fluctuations to the universal sector takes the following form l eux uu x where uu x is a sum of terms of the following generic form uu x gu x g1 1 g2 2 gn n 1 1 2 2 n n g u x g1 1 g2 2 gn n 1 1 2 2 n n where gu x det g and g u x det g ij in general the quantity inside the square bracket contains the following three types of objects 1 derivatives some of which may act on the background inverse metric prefactors 2 background fields in 21 22 23 and 3 fluctuations in a2 to establish 28 or eq29 we shall now argue that uu x is universal among all the ppwave backgrounds with the same transverse space metric g ij u x and background dilaton u x it is clear from equations a4 that this will be true if the following quantity is universal uu x g1 1 g2 2 gn n 1 1 2 2 n n in order to establish universality of uu x we first tensorially reduce to the transverse space to get a set of tensors in the transverse space v mu  m ijk where mv and mu are the number of covariant v and u indices in respectively v mu since none of the fields appearing in the expression of m ijk depends on v all the mv number of v indices are coming purely from fields and not from derivatives moreover since all the fields both the backgrounds and fluctuations are in the universal sector 210 v mu we must have mu mv on the right hand side of a6 but m ijk with mu mv can not appear in uu x in eqa5 simply because the only nonzero components of the background inverse metric are g guv gvv gvi gij mv mu therefore we must have in all terms on the right hand side of eqa5 this is precisely the kind of contraction that erases the ppwave structure of the metric background so that effectively it becomes gef  dx dx 2dudv gij u xdx dx which is simply the flat minkowski space when g ij u x ij the above argument shows that the functions ku x and ai u x in the background metric 21 do not appear in uu x we shall now show that the functions bi u x in the background flux 22 also do not appear in uu x in order to do so we first notice that the facts that does not contain any derivative with respect to v contains fields only in the universal sector together with eqa8 imply that every individual field appearing in contains equal number of covariant u and v indices for any gauge invariant background flux which is null such as the one in 22 such components are zero therefore the functions bi u x do not appear in uu x notice that the transverse derivatives14 of the background dilaton u x do appear in because of this and the exponential prefactor in eqa3 we need to have the same dilaton profile for all those ppwave backgrounds for which the universality of the spacetime action is supposed to hold we can now generalise the above argument to incorporate an arbitrary covariant action in spacetime in this case any generic term in the lagrangian density once computed on the universal sector after expanding around a generic ppwave background will take the following form larbit v u x uu x a10 where u x is the set of all the scalar fields in the theory at their background values and v is a multiscalar potential depending on the term chosen and the theory uu x takes the same form as in eqa4 except that now it contains tensor fields with arbitrarily high spins which doe not have any effect on our argument above therefore the conclusion will be that the above term is computed to be same in all the backgrounds with the same transverse space and the same profiles u x for the background scalars this establishes the universality theorem in 28 for the tensor fields equation a8 and the restriction of field configurations to the universal sector imply that all the mu number of covariant u indices are also purely field indices so that all the derivatives that appear in u u x are along the transverse directions closure of universal sector under field redefinition here we shall argue that an arbitrary field redefinition takes the universal sector to itself referring the reader to the discussion around eq211 we would therefore like to show that  u x f u s u x u s u x where u s u x is defined in 210 after tensorially reducing to the transverse space a generic term in f u s u x takes the following form n n mu mv f u s u x fijk u x where nu nv is the number of covariant u v indices that are free while mu mv is the same that are contracted notice that all the nv mv number of covariant v indices irrespective of whether they are contracted or not should be purely field indices since all the fields that appear are in the universal sector the total number of u indices coming from such fields and possibly additional derivatives must satisfy nu mu nv mv on the other hand the total number of contracted covariant u and v indices namely mu mv should be same as the total number of contravariant u and v indices coming from the factors of the background inversemetric since the only nonzero components of background inversemetric are as given in a7 we must have mv mu nu nv equations b3 and b4 imply which in tern implies b1 correlators in constant dilaton here we shall argue that the matter correlation functions involving only the operators defined in eq35 are universal in all the exact ppwave backgrounds with constant dilaton in particular we shall show that eq36 is correct the correlator on the left hand side of eq36 can be obtained from a correlator of the following form  mi uzi  m uz  nj v zj  nj v zj such that mu m mv mv eipk u wk wk xipp where x is an arbitrary operator in the flat transverse part of the cft below we shall argue that the correlator in c1 is computed to be same as in flat background in order to do so we first separate the worldsheet lagrangian density in 34 into lf lat and lpp as indicated in eq37 then we treat lf lat exactly and lpp as interaction this gives the following relation between the correlators in ppwave and flat background h ipp h if lat h ifc lat where the second term on the right hand side is a correction term given by h ifc lat h s pp u xn if lat n 1 s pp u x being the part of the worldsheet action in ppwave corresponding to the lagrangian density lpp in eq37 this contains integrated operators involving ku x f lat and a we fourier expand such functions and finally i u x in order to compute h ic compute the correlators on the right hand side of c3 in flat background for example the first term of the infinite expansion is proportional to dku dk  iku u ikx z zif lat d2 z kku kh u ue  i iku u ikx z zif lat ku kh x i ue  iku u ikx z zif lat i ku kh u x e where kku k and i ku k are the fourier transforms of ku x and ai u x respectively since all the correlators are computed in flat background an u can only be contracted with a v the fact that none of the operators in c1 and in s pp u x involve momenta along v implies in turn that all the uderivatives15 have to be contracted with v derivatives in order to produce a nonzero result since the total number of uderivatives appearing in c1 is always greater than or equal to that of v derivatives by u v derivative we mean an operator of the form m u z m v z or m u z m v z and the higher nrems in c3 introduce increasing number of uderivatives and no v derivatives all the correction terms given in c3 are zero for the correlators in c1 therefore such correlators are computed to be same as in flat background an equivalent path integral argument which is more cumbersome can also be constructed leading to the same conclusion this establishes eq36 we shall now generalise the above argument for the nsns sector of type ii superstrings as considered in section 33 in particular we shall argue that the same condition as in eq36 holds for the operators given in eq327 in this case the relevant correlators can be obtained from a correlator of the following form hdum dv m d u m d v m b xf such that mb mf mb mf eipk u ipp where we use schematic notations dum represents a product of mb number of opf erators of the form n uz or m uw d u m represents a product of mf number of operators of the form n u z or m u w and similarly for dv m and d v m respectively f is a fermionic analogue of f x appearing in eqc1 namely an arbitrary operator constructed out of the transverse i and i just like in c1 all the operators in c5 are understood to be inserted at different points on the complex plane in order to see why the correlator in c5 should be same as that computed in flat background when the condition on the numbers mb and mf as shown in eqc5 is satisfied we first notice that the interaction terms in the worldsheet lagrangian density now includes the fermionic sector given in eq326 in addition to the bosonic one in eq37 the features of the fermionic interaction terms in 326 that are relevant to our argument are as follows 1 v and v do not appear 2 all the terms except  i j and its counterpart in ah involve u andor u and 3 all the bosonic dij u xu operators that appear in 326 are from the universal sector since we treat the flat part in 325 exactly a v v appearing in the correlator c5 can only be contracted with a u u either appearing in c5 as an external operator or coming from the interaction terms in 326 therefore when mf mf none of the fermionic interaction terms  i j and its counterpart in contribute with the possible exceptions being dij u xu ah but even these terms do not contribute as can be argued in the following way the bosonic sector in c5 satisfies the condition mb mb therefore whenever a term like  i j appears in the correlation function it always increases the number of dij u xu uderivatives than that of v derivatives the result is zero due to the fact that in flat space this numbers should match in order to get a nonzero result let us now discuss the cases when mf 6 mf we begin with mf mf in this case the result is zero matching with the flat space result simply because there are not enough number of v v operators to contract with all the u u operators when mf mf the fermionic interaction terms could become important as the extra number of v u operators can now be contracted with these terms but since in this case we must have mb mb and all the bosonic operators in the fermionic interaction terms are in the universal sector the result is zero again matching with the flat space result as there are not enough number of v derivatives to contract all the existing uderivatives this establishes that the correlators in c5 are same as that evaluated in flat background correlators in nonconstant dilaton the analysis in the previous section does not go through when the cft background contains nonconstant dilaton as in this case one needs to be more careful about how to treat the fradkintseytlin term 25 that couples the dilaton through the worldsheet curvature in this appendix we shall discuss this issue and establish eq321 we start with the pregaugefixed path integral dx dg s vdif f w eyl where the sigma model action is d g g g x b x x x s f t d2 g rx sf t where 01 1 and r appearing in the fradkintseytlin term s f t is the worldsheet curvature choosing the conformal gauge gab e2 ab and introducing the diffeomorphism ghosts one arrives at w w wgh where wgh dbdcesgh is the b c ghost path integral and w dx es is the matter part of our interest the matter action in conformal gauge turns out to be s s pp s f t where s pp corresponds to the lagrangian density in 34 once the condition of weyl invariance is satisfied by choosing the background to be onshell the conformal factor  can in principle be eliminated from the path integral relevant to the computation of any correlation function however the effect of the fradkintseytlin term16 d2 a a x d2 z x has to be computed with an appropriate choice of nevertheless the final result should be independent of this choice here our goal is to study the effect of this term on a correlation function involving operators inside the universal sector in an exact ppsf t wave background with nontrivial dilaton u below we first recall what happens for the constant dilaton and then we generalise the method to incorporate nonconstant dilaton profile of our interest as it is well known for constant dilaton c d5 can be computed explicitly by choosing a particular coordinate system on the sphere for example dzdz dwdw 1 zz 1 w w where a is a constant determining the radius of the sphere and z z is the local coordinate ds2 system around the instate at whereas w w w 1z patches around the outstate at these coordinate systems correspond to choosing w w  ln a ln1 zz ln a ln 1 w w converting the integration in eqd5 into a line integral in w wsystem one gets sf t ic i w1 w w where c is a circle around the point w 0 this gives sf t 2c which is the correct result as expected the result does not depend on the choice of this can be checked in the following way first add a variation z z on the right hand side of eqd7 finiteness of the metric at z requires lim constant in the second line of d5 we have moved to the complex coordinate system z e i therefore it does not contribute to the residue in eqd8 leaving the result unchanged let us now consider the case of nonconstant dilaton u in an exact ppwave background in this case partially integrating the right hand side of d5 and fourier transforming u to k one can write s f t s1  s2  s3 d10 where  iku z z dk k k dzz zue  iku z z d2 z z zu ue dk k 2 k 1z 2  iku z z i dk k k d z z z ue i eiku w w dz u dk k w1 w w d11 where i is the conformal transformation of under inversion iz 1z r is the boundary of the coordinate patch z z we are interested in computing the following correlation function h ipp dx es n 0 pp s f t dx es  s2  s3 d12 where includes operators inside the universal sector notice that all the operators appearing in d11 are themselves inside the universal sector therefore using the result of the previous appendix we conclude h ipp f t n f lat h s1  s2  s3 i0 n 0 d13 the operators in s1 and s2 necessarily involve uderivatives since such operators can contract only with v derivatives which are not available in sufficient number the contribution of such terms drop off from the above correlator this implies h ipp f t n f lat h s3 i0 n 0 d14 to compute this we first notice that s3 involves a line integral along r which is a collection of circles ci s around the insertions included in which are at finite values of z z and a circle c around the point z w 0 which can also support an insertion from since eiku can not be contracted with any operators in contributions will come only from c it is then straightforward to establish the result 321 by evaluating the necessary residues the fact that the final result does not depend on the choice of follows from the same reasoning as in the case of constant dilaton this however is not as straightforward as presented here in case of a correlation functions with nonuniversal operators in that case the contributions from s1 and s2 are not necessarily zero out of these two s2 is sensitive to the local variation of the weyl factor the second term in its expression  0 this holds in the full ppwave in d11 is zero by the equation of motion u cft because of which one can always fix the lightcone gauge for such backgrounds  does not contract with eiku this is true in flat background and does not moreover u get spoiled in presence of the interactions given by lpp in eq37 from the structure of the worldsheet operator appearing in the first term in s2 we infer that it contributes to the uu component of the metric beta function in fact it corresponds to the u2 term in the equation of motion in 44 in the above analysis we have considered the weyl dependence of only s f t and therefore this is the only contribution expected considering the complete weyl dependence one expects this contribution to go away due to the spaceft time equation of motion s1  on the other hand receives contributions only from the boundaries of the punctured sphere such effects need to be handled with more care in a generic situation by considering the complete weyl dependence including that of the insertions at the punctures however such issues can be neglected for correlation functions involving only the universal sector operators field redefinition and gauge transformation here we shall first find the higher order terms in the field redefinition 46 given by the secb  b d and fd b d ond rank tensor and vector fields f  b d f when the offshell field configurations are restricted to the ppwave ansatz in eq43 in particular by using arguments similar to that in 19 we shall show that the only nonzero component is as given in eq47 later we shall also discuss the gauge symmetries of eft and csft and how they are related to this field redefinition in order to find the f fields appearing in eqs46 we first notice that all such fields should necessarily be expressible in terms of the nonzero components in the background ppwave ansatz in 43 christoffel connection and derivatives the only nonzero components of the christoffel connection are 17  vuu vui vij iuu iuj it turns out that a covariant u index can not be contracted 19 this is because the background inverse metric a7 allows contraction only with a covariant v index and a nonzero field with a covariant v index can not be constructed in this case it is also not possible to construct a field without a covariant u index because of this and the fact that all the f fields are necessarily higher order in the functions appearing in 43 we conclude that any nonzero f field 1 should have at least one covariant u index 2 should have no covariant v index 3 can not have a nonzero covariant u index if it is a vector therefore the only nonzero f fields are fuu  fui and fui  let us first consider fuu  because of the same reasons mentioned above it must be quadratic in fields any higher order term necessarily has more than two covariant u indices therefore the allowed expression for fuu is precisely given by k2 ai bi delu as described below eq47 using similar reasoning one can argue that fui and fui can at most be linear in fields and therefore must be zero we shall now discuss the gauge symmetries of the eft and csft although the gauge transformations are understood on the eft side they are not fully known on the csft side after integrating out all the massive modes the csft gauge transformations for the massless fields take complicated form in general but in our case since we know the form of the complete field redefinition we shall find the relevant csft gauge transformations fully once the expression for k2 ai bi u is computed through the csft computation as indicated in sec 42 such gauge transformations will be completely known and it should be possible to verify them explicitly in csft we begin by discussing the gauge symmetries on the eft side this theory possesses gauge invariance under the antisymmetric tensor gauge transformation tgt and general coordinate transformation gct the infinitesimal form of tgt parameterised by  u v x is given by  b  0  d 0 since the only nonzero gauge invariant background flux components are uij ij u x see eqs22 the components buv bvi and bij should at most be pure gauge with the only remaining nontrivial components being bui u x the pure gauge components are set to zero by using the gauge freedom corresponding to the components v and i therefore the nontrivial component of the residual gauge transformation parameterised by res u u x v 0 i 0 is given by res biu i u the infinitesimal form of gct parameterised by u v x is given by  2  b b b b  d d a part of this gauge invariance is broken by the ansatz in 43 the nontrivial components of the residual transformations are parameterised by res u u x v 0 i u and can be shown to take the following form res uu 2u u i k 2u ai i  res ui i u u i f j j res bui  bi j the residual gauge transformations in e3 e5 should leave the equations of motion 44 invariant it is straightforward to see this for e3 the transformation in e5 implies res k 2 i u ai k k 2 i u ai k res fij k fij k res hij k hij k using these transformations one can show that as expected the variation of the equations of motion in 44 is zero it is straightforward to see this for the first two equations the variation of the left hand side of the last equation in 44 gives 1 2 1  f h  e7 k k k u i ai fij f ij hij h ij c2 by the same equation of motion the expression inside the square bracket is dependent only on u and therefore the result is zero the residual gauge invariance in e3 e5 and the field redefinition 46 47 determine the form of the gauge transformations on the csft side we shall now discuss this systematically and finally come up with certain results that need to be verified with explicit csft computations which we leave for future work the infinitesimal gauge transformation of the full csft is given by i qi n 2 i n 3 n 2 where i is the ghost number one infinitesimal gauge transformation parameter and we have absorbed a factor of in it with respect to 13 the above equation encodes the gauge transformation of all the higher massive fields we are however interested in the transformations of the dynamical massless components only once all the massive ones have been integrate out by using their equations of motion generically this procedure leads to a complicated form of the gauge transformation for the massless fields on the csft side it was shown in 14 that taking i d26 k i kc1 1  c1 1 k c0 kc1 1  c1 1  ki e9 and interpreting and to be the fourier transforms of and respectively the gauge transformation in e8 reproduces the gauge transformations in e2 e4 at the linearised level it means that as expected the complications come from the higher order terms in e8 therefore the general form of the relevant gauge transformations can be written as  b b  b b  g  d d  g  d d e10 where all the higher order terms given by s and s are linear in and respectively but can depend on the massless fields h b and d to arbitrarily high order the gauge transformation parameters and are same as and in e2 e4 respectively at the linearised level   e11 where and contain all the higher order terms these contributions are also linear in the gauge transformation parameters appearing in the superscripts but can depend on the massless fields to arbitrarily high order however as we shall see below for our offshell ppwave ansatz the s and s in eqse10 are at most quadratic and those in eqse11 are at most linear in the massless fields let us begin with tgt the residual gauge transformation is parameterised by res res res res where res has been given above eqe3 since has to be linear in res and at least linear in the massless fields there is no way to construct this also the field redefinition relating bui and bui is trivial in this case therefore the first equation in e10 reduces to res biu i u u u e12 res however for gct the residual transformation parameter res res u v i where res is given above eqe5 can take the following form u u x u u x lui u xi u v 0 i i e13 where lui is linear in ai andor bi but may contain arbitrarily high powers of transverse laplacian this and the field redefinition 46 47 determines the residual gauge transformation completely res huu 2u u i k 2u ai i kai i u u i fi j j kbi j bi j res hui 2u luj j kai i luj j  i u u i fi j j i luj j res bui j bi j e14 where kai and kbi are defined to be a k2 kai ai b k2 kbi bi e15 and therefore are linear in massless fields this shows that the transformations in e14 are at most quadratic in massless fields therefore to verify this in csft one needs to compute the right hand side of e8 up to at most n 4 however it was pointed out in 14 that a certain trivial symmetry of the csft action needs to be considered in addition to the pure gauge transformation in e8 in order to realise tgt and gct of the eft completely at higher order therefore the transformations in e14 may not be obtained entirely from e8 it would be interesting to understand this explicitly through csft computations references 1 p mukhopadhyay tachyon condensation and nonbps dbranes in a ramondramond plane wave background arxivhepth0611138 2 m blau j
