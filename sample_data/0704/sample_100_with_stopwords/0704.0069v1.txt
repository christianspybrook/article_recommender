3169783979 fax 3169783748 robertsonmathwichitaedu abstract the goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a not necessarily invertible smooth self map of a compact manifold we prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term this allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type including unique measures of a given type that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback a dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important it means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient marching orders to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant research partially supported by a wichita state university arcs grant current of the same type say from some local dynamical subsystem because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the derham cohomology groups our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting msc 37c05 32h50 18f20 55n30 introduction our purpose is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a self map f x x of a compact topological space we make use of sheaf cohomology and differences in rates of expansion in different terms of a long exact sequence to construct invariant sections of a sheaf we will show that there are invariant degree 1 currents or eigencurrents corresponding to each expanding eigenvector of h 1 x r we also show that successive preimages of sufficiently regular degree one currents converge to one of these eigencurrents we show that if most of the expansion f x x is along an invariant cohomological class v h k x r then there is an invariant current c in that cohomology class and other sufficiently regular currents in the same class converge to c under successive pullback the group cohomology of z acting on a space of functions on x via pullback has been studied in the context of dynamical systems kat03 this work seems related to ours but to be pursued in an essentially different direction our map f is not assumed to be invertible so there is not necessarily a z action only an n action also we use sheaves rather than functions and make substantial use of cohomological tools most importantly we are particularly interested in the construction of invariant currents especially when the current is some sense unique our results are actually motivated by results in higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics showing the existence of a unique closed positive 1 1 current under a variety of circumstances just about any recent paper on higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics either proves such results or makes essential use of such results see eg fs92 hov94 hov95 bs91a bs91b bs92 bls93 bs98a bs98b bs99 can01 mcm02 fs94a fs94b fs95b fs01 fs95a jw00 fj03 ued94 ued98 ued97 and ds05 while invariant measures have been a focal point in dynamics it seems that invariant currents also have an imporant role to play we will show under mild conditions that if some degree one cohomological class of a smooth self map f of a compact manifold is invariant and expanded there is necessarily a invariant degree one current of a certain type representing that class we obtain analogous results for higher degree currents given bounds on the local growth rates of f the uniqueness of these classes is significant it seems clear that one could modify a map locally near a fixed point to obtain other invariant currents of the same type without affecting the topology thus our results also say that any local modification that created an invariant current of the given type must violate the local growth conditions in other words as long as things do not grow too fast compared to the growth rate of the cohomology class the expansion of the cohomology class gives sufficient marching orders to points that no other invariant cohomological class of the given type can be created by purely local dynamical behavior our results give explicit conditions under which uniqueness is guaranteed for degree one currents no restriction on local growth rates is necessary for our results cohomomorphisms we will make use of sheaves in this paper there are two standard definitions of sheaves on a topological space x one as a topological space bre97gr84 and one as a functor on the category topx satisfying various axioms har77wei97 since we will often want to make use of a topology on sections of a sheaf a that differs from the topology these inherit using the topological definition of a sheaf we will instead use the functor definition of a sheaf our sheaves will always be sheaves of k modules over some fixed field k we will require that k have an absolute value for which k is complete given a continuous map f x y and sheaves a and b on x and y respectively an f cohomomorphism is a generalized notion of a pullback from b to a through f different types of geometric objects pull back differently and this allows us to handle all cases at once we take the following facts from from bre97 page 1415 definition 1 if a and b are sheaves on x and y then an fcohomomorphism k b a is a collection of homomorphisms ku bu a f 1 u for u open in y compatible with restrictions note that if a is a sheaf on x and f x y is continuous then there is a canonical cohomomorphism f a a where f a is the direct image of a ie given an open u y f a u a f 1 u remark given a continuous map f x y of topological spaces x and y and sheaves a and b on x and y respectively all f cohomomorphisms f b a are given by a composition of the form b f a a where j b f a is a sheaf homomorphism and each such composition is seen to given an f cohomomorphism the usual notion of a morphism of sheaves on x is the same as an idx cohomomorphism of sheaves on x cohomomorphisms and the functor returns the global sections of that sheaf given a morphism  a a 0 of sheaves on x is just the homomorphism a x a 0 x given sheaves a and b on x and y and given f x y continuous then for a sheaf cohomomorphism f b a one defines f to be the homomorphism by a x this extends to be a functor on the category of topological spaces with an associated sheaf where morphisms are given by cohomomorphisms invariant global sections fix a continuous self map f x x of a be interested in f self cohomomorphisms of typically have several sheaves of interest on f self cohomomorphism we let fa a a f cohomomorphism of a assume that x is a manifold and that a bc topological space x we will sheaves a on x as we will x each with a corresponding be the default notation for an is a short exact sequence of sheaves on x let f x x be a continuous self map of x and assume further that we are given f self cohomomorphisms of each of these sheaves and that commutes we will say that a commutative diagram as in 1 is an f selfcohomomorphism of the sequence a b c applying the functor to this diagram the rows can be extended in the usual long exact sequence the resulting diagram is commutative bre97 page 62  a x  a x c x h 1 x a h1p c x h 1 fa h 1 x a h1p one can think of b as providing local potentials for members of c and of a as being those potentials which give rise to the zero member of c it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with interpreting h 1 x a as classifying equivalence classes of bundles with transition functions in a we will frequently refer to members of h 1 x a as bundles sections of such bundles will be assumed to be given locally by local sections of b so that every member c of c is given locally by potentials in b and these potentials taken together are a section of the corresponding bundle c h 1 x a convention 1 we will frequently refer to a member v of h 1 x a as a bundle to a member c c as a divisor and if c v we will call c a divisor of the bundle v we think this substantially adds to the readability of the paper definition 2 the support of a divisor c c is defined to be the complement of the union of all open sets u such that cu 0 lemma 3 if an open set u lies outside the support of some c c then f 1 u lies outside the support of fc c proof we note that by the definition of an f cohomomorphism fc c c since the cohomomorphism fc on c u is a homomorphism from c u to c f 1 u and the induced action of fc on c restricted to u must agree with its action c u c f 1 u then if an open set u is outside the support of c then f 1 u is outside the support of of fc c the following conditions for a given v h 1 x a will be of interest definition 4 we will refer to a bundle v h 1 x a for which h 1 pv 0 as being closed note that this notion depends upon the exact sequence a b c and not just on v if b is acyclic then every member of h 1 x a is closed definition 5 we will call a bundle v h 1 x a base point free if for every x x there is some divisor c c associated to v whose support does not contain x lemma 6 if b is soft x is a regular topological space and a h 1 x a is a closed bundle then a is base point free proof from the long exact sequence there is some c0 c with c0 a and given any point x x from the fact that b c the germ c0x of c0 at x is the image under qx of some germ b00x of b at x choose an open neighborhood u of x on which there is some b0 bu with b0x b00x the topological assumption on x implies that there is a neighborhood v b u of x the  fact that b 0 is soft implies there is some b b such that b v b v then c c b c has c a and x 6 suppc definition 7 we will refer to a bundle a h 1 x a such that fa a a for some c as a eigenbundle we also find it useful to introduce a relevant notion of expansiveness of a map f x x relative to a base point free closed eigenbundle v h 1 x a definition 8 given a base point free closed eigenbundle v h 1 x a then we say that f is cohomologically expansive at x for v if for any open neighborhood u of x and any divisor c c of v the set u intersects the support of fck c for all sufficiently large k remark it is a corollary of the definition that the set of points at which f is cohomologically expansive for v is closed and forward invariant if supp fck c f k suppc for each c c then the set of cohomologically expansive points is totally invariant the notion of being cohomologically expansive at x for v means roughly that under iteration by f small neighborhoods u of x always grow to cover enough of x that the pullback of the bundle v to the set f k u is a nontrivial bundle on f k u whenever k is large we show that if b is soft and x is a compact metric space then some minimal expansion takes place at points where f is cohomologically expansive for a closed eigenbundle a h 1 x a we use b x to denote the ball of radius about x lemma 9 let x be a compact metric space if b is soft and v is a closed eigenbundle then there exists 0 such that for every 0 there exists some k 0 such that if f is cohomologically expanding at x then for every k k diam f k b x proof the bundle v is base point free by lemma 6 using compactness we can conclude that there is a finite open cover u1 u of x such that for each j uj is disjoint from supp cj for some cj c with cj v we will prove the lemma by contradiction let be the lebesgue number of the cover u1 u if the lemma is false there is some 0 and some increasing sequence kn and points xn at which f is cohomologically expansive such that diam f kn b xn for each n by going to a subsequence if necessary we can assume xn converges to a point x letting u b 1 x we see that u b xn for all large n and thus there is some one cj of c1 c such that f kn u is disjoint from supp cj for infinitely many values of n consequently u is disjoint from supp fckn cj for infinitely many n contrary to x being a point at which f is cohomologically expansive for v we included lemma 9 to show that our notion of cohomological expansion is genuinely expansive however depending on the nature of a being cohomologically expansive can imply that neighborhoods grow a great deal under iteration indeed in lemma 10 we show that given any closed set k such that the pullback of a fixed point free closed eigenbundle a h 1 x a to k is a trivial bundle then any neighborhood u of a point at which f is cohomologically expanding for a is so expanded under iteration that f k u 6 int k for all sufficiently large k the collection of such sets k typically contains very large sets about every point so no matter where f k x is the conclusion that f k u does not lie in any int k implies some points of f k u must lie far away from f k x the point is roughly that large iterates of any neighborhood of x can not be homotopically contracted to a point in x lemma 10 if b is soft then  for any closed set k x such that the image of h x a h k a k is zero given any divisor c c there is another divisor c0 c associated to the same bundle and c0 is supported outside the interior of k consequently if f is cohomologically expansive at x x for some base point free closed eigenbundle a h 1 x a then necessarily for any neighborhood u of x f k u 6 int k for all large k where int k is the interior of k proof we use the commutative diagram h 0 x b h 0 k b k h 0 x c h 0 k c k h 1 x a which we have written using h 0 instead of so it is clear what the ambi ent space is in eachcase from exactness there exists some h 0 k b k such that ck then since b is soft the map h 0 x b  h 0 k b k is surjective so there is some b b h 0 x b such that bk then c0 c qb has c0 c and c0 k 0 so suppc0 is disjoint from the interior of k it is easy to see that if f is cohomologically expansive at x x for some fixed point free closed eigenbundle a h 1 x a then necessarily for any neighborhood u of x f k u supp c6 for all large k for any c c such that c a hence f k u can not lie in the interior of k for any large convention 2 we let k be either r or c although our central theorems only require k to be a complete field with an absolute value the following theorem takes advantage of the fact that in an exact sequence the eigenvalues of members of nonadjacent members of the sequence do not have to agree to give conditions under which one can uniquely lift fixed members of one term of the exact sequence to a fixed member of the preceding term interpreted as a statement in the context of sheaf cohomology we will be able to use this theorem to make dynamical conclusions the theorem shows that each closed eigenbundle of the induced map fa h 1 x a h 1 x a with sufficiently large eigenvalue has a unique associated invariant divisor c c definition 11 given any finite dimensional k vector space v along with a linear map g v v and any positive real number r we let the r chronically expanding subspace of v be the span of the subspaces associated2 to eigenvalues of absolute value greater than r we refer to the 1 chronically expanding subspace simply as the chronically expanding subspace theorem 12 unique invariant subspace theorem we will assume the following  f x x is a continuous self map of a topological space x  we are given an f self cohomomorphism of a short exact sequence of sheaves on x a bc  b is a banach space over k and there exists some d r0 such that kfb k bk d k kbk for k n b b  c is a topological vector space over k  if a sequence ci c of divisors converges to another divisor c then the support of c is contained in the closure of the union of the supports of ci  the maps fc and q are continuous  we are given a finite dimensional h 1 fa invariant subspace w of the  chronically expanding subspace of h 1 x a we also require w to be comprised only of closed bundles meaning for each eigenvector we include not just the eigenspace but also every v v such that g idv n v 0 for some positive integer n then given any k linear map s w c such that s idw there is a k linear map w b satisfying  lim fc k sg k s q where g w w is the inverse of h 1 fa w under iterated pullback the rescaled pullbacks of any divisor c c of a bundle w w converge toward the invariant plane of divisors w c the map w c is the unique map making the diagram w mmm mm m  c  h 1 x a h 1 fa o w mmm mmm  c  h 1 x a commute finally for any basepoint free eigenbundle v w the support of the corresponding invariant divisor v c is contained in the set of points on which f is cohomologically expansive for v proof we note that fc sg s 0 and so there is a map w b such that q fc sg s define homw b homw b by fb g 1 we will show that the sequence of maps k is exponentially contracting on homw b fix a norm k k on w the assumption that w lies in the chronically expanding subspace of h 1 x a implies that there exists some and some c 0 such that kg k wk c k kwk for k n w w this with the assumption on the rate of expansion of fb easily implies that  k kk kwk kk wk kfb k g k wk cd thus is an operator of norm no more than cd where letting k 2 k then limk k converges to some map it is easily confirmed that qk fc k sg k s equation 3 then follows by continuity of q the conclusions about the map are easy consequences of its definition for the final conclusion note that if we just let w be the span of v then we have already shown that if c is the unique invariant member of c associated to v then for any divisor c0 c satisfying c0 v letting  be the eigenvalue of v we can write c0 v qb and equation 3 becomes fc k c0 k v qfb k bk where the final term goes to zero as k by our assumptions on growth rates of g 1 and fb hence fc k c0 k converges to c v if u is any open subset of x and if the support of c0 is disjoint from f n u for arbitrarily large values of n then the support of fc n c0 must be disjoint from u for arbitrarily large values of n since rescaled these converge to c then u must lie outside the support of c remark while we have not formally required x to be compact the requirement that b be a banach space makes this the main case in which theorem 12 is apt to have interesting applications theorem 12 shows that among all members of c representing a cohomology class in w there is a unique invariant linear subspace which can be identified with w and all other such members of c are contracted to this invariant copy of w in c under rescaled pullback corollary 13 assume that the hypothesis of theorem 12 are satisfied and that g w w is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue r 0 with eigenvector v let c v be the unique invariant divisor of v then given a divisor c0 c of any w w the successive rescaled pullbacks fck c0 rk converge to a multiple possibly zero of c proof this is a direct consequence of equation 3 the assumption that g w w is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue is meant to handle the most typical situation and is not an essential restriction remark given that for a fixed f x x the category of sc sheaves a on x endowed with an f self cohomomorphism f is an abelian category with enough injectives then the functor fixed which gives the fixed global sections of a under f will be left exact and its right derived functors should be of dynamical interest in the case where a is a sheaf of functions and f is invertible this is just group cohomology with the group z acting on a and has been an object of study for some time see eg kat03 we anticipate studying the case of more general sheaves a and the right derived functors of the composition fixed in a future paper including the case of endomorphisms regularity and positivity typically our regularity results for the members invariant plane w will be most easily described in terms of b rather than c we therefore make the following definition definition 14 given a subsheaf b 0 b we will say a divisor c c has local b 0 potentials if c qb 0 this is equivalent to requiring that about each point x x there is an open neighborhood u and some b0 b 0 u such that qb cu the proof of theorem 12 implicitly provides a method to prove regularity results for members of the invariant plane w we make this explicit as a corollary of the proof corollary 15 assume we are given f x x and a short exact sequence of sheaves a b c satisfying the hypothesis of theorem 12 assume that b 0 is a subsheaf of b and that fb b 0 b 0 let c 0 be the image of b 0 under q b c let a 0 a be the kernel of q b c 0 assume that the canonical map h 1 x a 0 h 1 x a is injective assume that there are basis members w1 wk of w with divisors each of which has local potentials in b 0 let r be the the inverse of the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of g 1 so for all j 0 g j is an operator of norm no more than crj for some c 0 finally assume that for any sequence of numbers aj j 0 1 2 such that aj is no more than a constant times rj as j then for b b 0 the exponentially decaying sequence a0 b a1 fb b a2 fb 2 b converges in the banach space structure on b to a member of b 0 then the map w c lands in c 0 proof since w lies in the chronically expanding subspace of w then necessarily r 1 thus the terms of equation 4 have exponentially decreasing norms and the series is exponentially decaying by the assumption of a divisor in c 0 for each member wj of a basis then the map s w c in theorem 12 can be assumed to land in c 0 then fc sg 1 s lands in c 0 and satisfies fc sg 1 s 0 since h 1 x a 0 h 1 x a injects it easily follows that for each wj one can choose wj to be a member bj of b0 using the basis w1 wk to write g 1 as a matrix a and letting aij be the ij entry of a so for each ij aij is bounded by a constant times r we see that wj bj fb a1j1 b1  akj1 bk fb 2 a1j2 b2 akj2 bk fb a1j b1 akj bk gathering all the b1 terms b2 terms etc from the right hand side we see that limk k is a member of b 0 and thus that lands in c 0 by equation 3 the following trivial observation will suffice for our needed positivity conclusions observation assume we have an f self cohomomorphism of a short exact sequence of sheaves a b c satisfying the hypothesis of theorem 12 and also a subsheaf c 0 c such that 1 c 0 is closed under multiplication by r0 note that c 0 is not necessarily a sheaf of k modules or even of groups 2 fc c 0 c 0 3 c 0 is closed in c then for any closed eigenbundle v h 1 x a with eigenvalue in k0 and at least one divisor c0 c 0 the unique invariant divisor c c of v also lies in c 0 proof the proof is trivial since c limk fc k c0 k where r0 is the eigenvalue of v subsheaf cohomology in applications of theorem 12 it is common that there is a well understood exact sequence of sheaves s0 0 s1 1 s2 2 and that b is a subsheaf of sk for some k a is the kernel of dk b b sk1 and c is the image of b in sk1 moreover in these cases the self cohomomorphism f on a b c is induced by an f self cohomomorphism of the sequence 5 in order to apply theorem 12 to these cases we need to understand the r module h 1 x a and its induced self map there does not seem to be a computationally useful way to extract an injective resolution of a using subsheaves of s0 0 s1 1 even if this last sequence is acyclic consider for example the case where for each n sn is the sheaf of currents of degree n and b sk is a subsheaf of mildly regular currents it is not clear one could make the regularization method of dr84 work to compare h 1 x a to derham cohomology groups because his chain homotopy operator a does not restrict well to b since da does not preserve regularity we use a standard sheaf cohomological trick which we include here as a proposition which we will need and which we expect to be commonly used in conjuction with theorem 12 because of the requirement that b be a banach space theorem 16 subsheaf cohomology assume we are given an exact sed quence of sheaves s0 0 s1  s2 0 and that b is a subsheaf of sk for some k 1 let a ker dk b and b be the preimage of b under dk1 further assume that for each j 1 we have h j x b 0 0 h j x b 0 and for any m satisfying 0 m k 1 we have h j x sm 0 for j 1 then for each n 1 there is a canonical isomorphism h n x a  h nk x ker d0 proof while this result is essential for us  its proof is a standard cohomological trick first one notes that ker dk1 b0 ker dk1 by the definition of b 0 one has the short exact sequences of sheaves ker dk1 b 0 dk b 0 a and ker dj sj ker dj1 j 0 k 2 considering the long exact sequences for these shows that the induced maps h n x a h n1 x ker dk1 and h nj x ker dkj h nj1 x ker dkj1 are isomorphisms for j 1 k 1 composing each of these canonical isomorphisms gives a canonical isomorphism from h n x a h nk x ker d0 remark we take it as clear from the functorality of the map in the long exact sequence that given an f self cohomomorphism of s0 0 s1 1 s2 2  which maps b to itself that the induced map of h 1 x a is identified with the induced map of h k1 x ker d0 via the above isomorphism we will need one more tool be able to make effective use of theorem 16 for calculating sheaf cohomology of subsheaves of sheaves of currents definition 17 by an interval flow h on a bounded open interval i r we will mean the flow obtained by integrating a vector field of the form t t where is positive exactly on i and zero elsewhere we use hx t to denote the location of x r after following the flow for time t definition 18 by an nbox in rn we will mean an open subset which is a product of n bounded open intervals i1 in by an nbox in an n dimensional manifold we will mean an nbox which is compactly supported in some coordinate patch by an nsubbox of an n box u i1 in we will mean an n box of the form i10 in0 where ik0 is a subinterval of ik for each k 1 n definition 19 by an nbox flow we will mean the rn action h on rn which is the product of n interval flows h1 t1 hn tn on rn that is hx t h1 x1 t1 hn xn tn where x x1 xn t t1 tn and h1 hn are interval flows on i1 in respectively we refer to the nbox i1 in as the open support of the nbox flow we will often ht to denote the diffeomorphism h t rn rn definition 20 let h be an nbox flow on an nbox b let be a compactly supported smooth volume form on rn with this data we define an operator sh on smooth k forms on any n box u containing b by sh ht t we say sh defines a box smear on u or smears u we will omit the subscript from sh when the meaning is clear from context it is clear s is compactly supported in u if is it is clear from the definition of s that if is an n k form on u then sh  sh where h is the family ht with the parameter negated from this motivation we define a smear of a current definition 21 given h defining a smear on an n box u we define the smear sh on currents on u via  sh c c sh lemma 22 given h defining a smear s on an n box u then d sc sdc for currents c on any open subset of u containing the open support of the smear also restricted to the open support of the smear sc is a smooth form on v proof we remark that it is clear that d s sd for forms and consequently for currents via the definition because on the open support of the smear a smear is just convolution with a smooth function then we see that if v is an open subset  of the open support of smear s on u then for any current c on u scv is a smooth form on v proposition 23 let b be a sheaf of degree k currents assume that b contains the sheaf of smooth k forms on x and that bu is closed under smears on any nbox u x let b 0 be the preimage under d of b in the sheaf of degree k 1 currents then b 0 is soft and therefore acyclic proof to show that b 0 is soft it is sufficient to show that b 0 is locally soft bre97 page 69 given an nbox u in x we therefore only need to show that if k is a closed subset of x in u and if w is an open neighborhood of k then given any member b00 of b 0 w there is an  open neighborhood w0 w of k and a member b0 b 0 u such that b0 w0 b00 w0 choose any pair of open sets v1 v2 such that k b v1 b v2 b w then v2 v1 is compact and can therefore be covered by finitely many open nsubboxes y1 yn of u moreover these subboxes can all be chosen to be disjoint from k and to lie inside w letting s1 sn be smears on u with open support y1 yn respectively then let b s1 s 2 s0 n b0 then on each yj b is given by a smooth k form also bw b0 w finally we choose a smooth function u 0 1 which is one on a neighborhood of v1 and zero on a neighborhood of u v2 then the current b0 b extends by zero to a current on all of u then for each yj b0 yj is a smooth function times a smooth form thus db0 is a smooth form and figure 1 a current comprised of parallel submanifolds smeared and cropped lies in byj the boxes yj cover v2 v1 outside v2 b0 is identically zero we know that db bw by lemma 22 we also know  that 1 on an open neighborhood w1 of v1 thus db w1 dbw1 bw1 we thus conclude that b0 b 0 u since its restriction to each yj to w1 and to u v2 is a section of b 0 letting w0 v2 y1 y2 yn then w0 is an open neighborhood of k then w0 w1 so b0 w0 bw0 b00 since w0 is disjoint from the open support of each of the smears s1 sn this completes the proof that b 0 is soft the following gives a broad generalization of the equalivalence of the cohomology of currents with the derham cohomology groups to the authors knowledge this result is new corollary 24 let b be a sheaf of degree k currents assume that b contains the sheaf of smooth k forms on x and that bu is closed under smears on any nbox u x letting a be the subsheaf of d closed members of b then h m x a h mk x k where k is r or c depending on whether or not we allow complex valued currents and forms proof this is an immediate consequence of proposition 23 and theorem 16 invariant currents notation 1 if g is some sheaf of functions on a smooth orientable manifold x we will use f k g to denote the sheaf of k forms on x with coefficients in g we will let fck g be the subsheaf of closed in the sense of currents members of f k g it will be convenient to use either degree or dimension of a current depending on the context just as dimension and codimension are useful for discussing manifolds so we will not stick to just one of these terms we will let c k denote the sheaf of degree k currents with the index written above as is typical for cohomology since d increases the degree we will similarly write ck for the sheaf of dimension k currents with the index written below since d decreases dimension as is common for homology we use the following convention to realize a form as a current so that if is c 1 then d is the same whether computed as a current or a form definition 25 given an k form with l1 coefficients on an n manifold x we realize as a degree k current via  7 1 2 definition 26 given a possibly complex nonzero derham cohomology class c hderham x with f c c for some scalar c we will refer to a current c in the same cohomology class as as an eigencurrent for f if f c c currents naturally pushforward rather than pullback because we are considering maps which are not necessarily invertible we need to address how this pullback is performed if f has critical points it is impossible to define a continuous pullback operation f on all currents in a way that agrees with expected cases for instance consider f x x2 and let ca be the dimension one current on r with ca hxdx ha ie ca is a unit mass vector then the pullback f ca should be the sum of weighted unit masses at the two preimages of this vector just like the pullback of a point mass is a sum of point  masses each weighted by multiplicity that is f ca  ca ca however these pullbacks do not converge to a current as 2 a a 0 so f c0 is not defined since we want f to be continuous we are forced to work with currents that have some extremely mild regularity we address this in the next section nimble forms and lenient currents finding a good set of currents to use to study smooth finite self maps not necessarily invertible of compact manifolds turns out to be rather delicate our solution is to first expand our class of forms to include pushforwards in the sense of currents of forms through an appropriate class of smooth maps then we restrict our attention to currents which act on this extended class of forms this solution has the very nice property that it can potentially be adapted directly to study the dynamics of other various other categories of smooth maps by simply changing which forms are considered nimble according to the class of maps used it will convenient to first define the natural pushforward operator on forms definition 27 given a compact orientable manifold x we let sx be the category of smooth maps f x x of nonzero degree and having the property that the critical set has measure zero we use critical set here to mean the points at which df is not invertible it follows from our definition that the image of any set of positive measure under some f sx has positive measure definition 28 given a compact orientable manifold x we define n k to be those currents which are a finite sum of currents of the form p where p x x is a map in sx and is a form of degree k the pushforward p is computed in the sense of currents we will later show that nimble forms are also in fact bona fide forms definition 29 we topologize n k by saying j in n k if for sufficiently large j there are maps p f1 fk and k forms p 1j kj as well as forms 1 k such that i fi ij j and i fi i where pushforwards are taken in the sense of currents and for each i 1 k the forms ij converge to i in the strong sense ie all derivatives converge uniformly lemma 30 given a compact orientable manifold y n k y is a topological vector space proof this follows easily from our definition of the topology we now define the corresponding space of currents definition 31 we define the dimension k lenient currents lk y to be the topological dual of n k y every member of lk y is a dimension k current but with the added structure of its action on all nimble k forms we give lk the weak topology ie ci c in lk iff ci c for every n k we write l k for the lenient currents of degree k we define operations of wedge products with smooth forms as is usual for currents it is clear that the lenient dimension k currents give a sheaf on x the following properties of nimble forms are also immediately clear lemma 32 let f x x be a member of sx the pushforward as a current of a nimble k form by f is again a nimble form moreover f n k x n k x is continuous in the topology of nimble forms also the exterior derivative of a nimble form as a current is a nimble form and d n k x n k1 x is continuous the basic necessary facts about pulling back lenient currents are then immediate we state them here lemma 33 given f x x a member of sx the induced map f on the sheaf of lenient degree k currents is an f cohomomorphism of sheaves both f l k x l k x and d l k x l k1 x are continuous lastly f d df l k y l k1 x proposition 34 assume that f x x is a member of sx let r be the regular set of f by sards theorem r has full measure since the critical set is compact then r is an open subset of x since the preimage of a measure zero set has measure zero for sx maps then f 1 r is also a full measure open set in x there is a well defined operation f which maps k forms on f 1 r to k forms on r given a k form on x f is defined on any open subset v r such that each component u1 um of f 1 v maps diffeomorphically onto v by the formula 1 x f ui 1 i f v deg f i where i 1 is the oriented degree of f ui ui v the pushforward f satisfies  f d df keeping in mind that f returns a current on r  f 1 1  f f f  f n f n  the formula f  f holds for any k form with l loc coefficients on y and any smooth nk form on x this justifies using f to pullback currents part of the conclusion is that both sides are integrable proof each statement is a consequence of formula 7 except the integrability conclusion for equation 8 local charts can be given which are bounded subsets of rn and for which df remains uniformly bounded over each of the charts and thus f will be a form with l loc coefficients in these charts thus the left hand side of 8 is the integral of a bounded function over a finite union of bounded charts and is therefore absolutely integrable since f f f it is sufficient to show that if is an n form with loc coefficients then f 1 r typicaly f is unbounded so we need to show that the right hand side of 9 is integrable about any point x r we can find an open v such that each of the preimages u1 uk of v is mapped diffeomorphically onto v since x is orientable and n dimensional there is a well defined notion of the absolute value of an n form then  1 1 x f  f ui deg f i v 1 v now r is covered by countably many such sets v and listing them as v0 v1 v2 we can let v00 v0 v10 v1 v0 v20 v2 v0 v1 then r is the union of the countable collection of disjoint measurable sets vj0 and f f f 1 vj f 1 r since f 1 r is finite then f is an l1 form using precisely the same argument but with the absolute values rremoved and the inequalities replaced with equalities then shows r f f 1 r since r and f 1 r are open and full measure then f is an operator which takes in forms on x and returns forms defined almost everywhere on we now show that nimble forms are bona fide forms lemma 35 if g x x is a map in sx and is a smooth k form on x then the current g is the current of integration against the form g proof if is a smooth n k form then by definition g k1 r k1 r  g 1 2 x g 1 2 x g g by formula 8 of proposition 34 as described in fed69 an inner product on a vector space v can be viewed as an isomorphism v v satisfying certain properties the inverse of gives the induced inner product on v the fact that v w kvk kwk with equality iff v and w are scalar multiples implies that the inner product norm on v isvthe same norm of v acting onvv vk operator vk as the v v gives an inner product on k v the induced map we call this the canonical inner product on k v induced by the inner product on v hence given a riemannian there are canonical vk metric onvx smoothly varying inner products on and x x for each x x at any point x v x we v define k dx f k to be the operatorvnorm of the linear function dx f tx x k tf x x we define k k df k to be the l dx f k also given a k form we define loc norm of the map x 7 k the comass kkl the norm the function x k it loc loc is clear that the k forms with the comass norm is a banach space we now show that the k forms with l loc coefficients are naturally lenient currents we start by defining the action on nimble forms definition 36 given an n k form c with l loc coefficients we define nk1  c p 1 c p lemma 37 the space f nk l loc of nk forms with lloc coefficients under the comass norm includes p continuously into lk x where the action of c lloc on some i fi i n k x with each fi sx and each i f k c is given by  c fi c i proof the assumption that x is compact means that any two riemannian metrics on x are comparable choose one so the notion of the comass norm makes sense the result is then a straightforward consequence of equation 8 lemma 35 and our definitions remark it follows that a current with local f k l loc potentials is also a lenient current remark given a member c of f k l loc then f c is the same whether done as a lenient current or as a form this along with the fact that df f d justifies the ad hoc pullback of closed positive 1 1 currents used so successfully in holomorphic dynamics similarly dc gives the same result whether calculated as a lenient current or a form if c f k c 1 hlder lemmas we will want to apply corollary 15 to show that each eigencurrent we construct has local d potentials or ddc potentials in the holomorphic case which are forms with hlder continuous coefficients in order to do this we will need a few facts which we include here in order to avoid having to include regularization results as afterthoughts to our main theorems observation let h be the functions with coefficients that are hlder of exponent at least equal to some fixed 0 since diffeomorphisms preserve hlder exponents and averages of hlder functions are hlder then we take it as clear that corollary 24 applies to show that h 1 x a 0 h 1 x a where a 0 is the closed members of f k h and a is the closed degree k currents lemma 38 let x be a compact manifold real or complex with a riemannian metric and of real dimension n let f x x be a smooth map then local coordinate charts ui can be chosen on x each representing a convex open subset of rn so that there is a positive constant 1 m so that for any k form there exist constants c c 0 such that writing each f k in any of the charts ui as f k aki dxi then each function aki satisfies sup aki c kf k kcomass xui and for each j 1 n  a  ki sup  c m k xui proof equation 10 is a basic fact the rest is a straightforward consequence of realizing a self map of a manifold as being made up of a bunch of maps between different coordinate patches in rn that is one chooses an open cover of patches ui of x each patch is realized in rn as a round ball thinking of each patch as lying in rn then we can find explicit maps from between open subsets of rn of the form pij ui f 1 uj uj by shrinking each open ball ui a small amount the resulting patches still cover x but the derivatives of the maps pij are all now bounded since we are working on relatively compact subsets of the previous maps pij then given any x we can keep track of which patch f k x is in at each time and can then realize the map f k x as a composition pi1 i2 pi2 i3 pik1 ik since each partial derivative of each pij is uniformly bounded then any partial derivative of the composition grows at most exponentially with k and we are done the following observation will also be useful lemma 39 if there are positive constants c c m m with m 1 m such that a sequence of smooth functions hk on an open convex set u rn satisfies khk ksup c mk and w h w w kw w c mk xj sup for all k 0 1 2 then h1 h2 h3 converges to a bounded continuous logm function which is hlder of any exponent logmm proof the proof is elementary eigencurrents for cohomologically expanding smooth maps to be we will call a section v of k t x a kvector field we define kv kl loc the lloc norm of the function x 7 kvx k whether theorem 12 applies to a map will depend the size of k k df k replacing f with an iterate does not affect the needed estimate so we make the following definition definition 40 we define k to be the limit supremum as j of k k df j k j it follows that 1 e for any lyapunov exponent and that k k1 fed69 page 33 we let b be the sheaf f k1 l loc the norm k k clearly makes b into avbanach space given a member b b since vkthe operator norm on each tx x is equal to the norm already defined on tx x for each x x then kbk is equal to supremum of the lloc norm of the function x 7 bvx as v varies over all l loc kvector fields of norm no more than one theorem 41 given f x x an a map in sx for the compact orientable manifold x assume that c hderham x is a cohomology class using either real or complex derham cohomology which is an eigenvector for f with eigenvalue assume also that k1 then there exists a unique eigencurrent c with local f k1 l loc potentials representing the class c moreover c has local f k1 h potentials also given any neighborhood u x of any point in the support of c then for every lenient current c0 with local f k1 l loc potentials and which represents the cohomology class c then f k u supp c0 6 for all large k assume that the linear map f hderham x hderham x is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue r given c any current which has local f k1 l loc potentials and which represents a cohomology class in the chronically expanding subspace of hderham x then the successive rescaled pullbacks f k c0 rk of c0 converge to a multiple of c in the sense of lenient currents and thus also in the sense of currents proof we let b f k1 l loc a and c be the kernel and image respecd tively of b l by theorem 24 h 1 x a can be canonically identified with h k x k since b is acyclic then every member of h 1 x a is a closed bundle with respect to the short exact sequence a b c from lemma 33 there is an induced f cohomorphism of the short ex act sequence a b c also c is a space of lenient currents by lemma 33 and thus has a natural structure as a topological vector r space if ar sequence bi b converges to b b then dbi x bi d b d db so the map d b c is continuous the cohomomorphism fb is pullback f of differential forms fixing any real satisfying k1 it isvclear from the definition of k1 that one can choose a real d 0 such that k k1 df k d for all vk n the pullback f b of b b satisfies kf bk supv kb df v k where thevsupremum is taken over all kcovector fields v with kv vkk 1 however df v isva kcovector field of norm no more than k df k so kf bk kbk k df k d kbk given any w in the k1 chronically expanding subspace of h k x k we can alter our choice of k1 so that w also lies in the chronically expanding subspace of h k x k we can therefore apply theorem 12 to conclude that there is a unique map w c such that f f where the first f is pullback of currents and the second is pullback on h k x k in fact w lies in the space of currents with locally hlder potentials meaning f k1 h potentials by applying corollary 15 in conjunction with observation 52 lemma 38 and lemma 39 the second half of the theorem is a consequence of equation 3 remark theorem 41 gives regular degree one eigencurrents for every eigenvalue of f h 1 x k h 1 x k of norm greater one without requiring any constraints on the local behavior of f the degree one eigencurrents seem to be in some sense more robust than currents of lower dimension including invariant measures moreover since codimension one closed submanifolds are closed currents with local f 0 l loc potentials then successive rescaled preimages of such manifolds in the right cohomological class will converge to the eigencurrent remark the fact that eigencurrents constructed via theorem 41 have local potentials which are forms does not imply their support has positive lebesgue measure as the classical example of a monotonic nonconstant function which is constant on a set of full measure shows remark the assumption that f hderham x hderham x is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue r is not essential but just meant to handle the simplest case in fact the proof actually shows that if w lies in the k1 chronically expanding subspace of h k x k then every current in the invariant plane w c of currents has local f k1 h potentials and any current with cohomological class in w with local f k1 l loc potentials is attracted to w under successive rescaled pullback since measures are of particular interest in dynamics we note that h 1 x f n1 l loc h x k k by corollary 24 so there is a unique f eigenvalue and it is precisely the topological degree of f we thus obtain corollary 42 given that n1 deg f then there is a unique dimension zero eigencurrent c with f k1 l loc potentials and in fact it has f potentials and the successive rescaled preimages of any c with f l loc potentials converge to c if additionally there is no point x x about which f is locally an orientation reversing diffeomorphism then c and every other member of w is a positive distribution and is therefore a radon measure proof since f pulls back dimension zero currents ie distributions which are positive to distributions which are positive then by corollary 31 the distribution c is positive it is therefore a radon measure see eg hl99 page 270 remark in the case where f is orientation reversing on some parts of x but not on all of x some special remarks apply if it happens that successive rescaled images of some point converge to a dimension zero eigencurrent then since preimages of points are counted with multiplicity then when pulled back through a portion of x on which f reverses orientation the sign of a point is flipped thus in this case the eigencurrent may not describe so much the distribution of preimages as the relative density of preimages counted negatively as compared to those counted positively the number of actual preimages of a point may grow exponentially faster than the degree of the map in such cases so that dividing by the degree does not yield a measure in the limit unless some such cancellation takes place in the limit one would expect that the corresponding eigencurrents have local potentials which are not of bounded variation in such a case eigencurrents for smooth covering maps we will call a covering map which is locally a diffeomorphism a smooth covering map we now consider the special case of smooth self covering maps f x x of a compact smooth orientable manifold x we show that in this case we have a substantially broader collection of currents whose successive pullbacks converge to an eigencurrent albeit we need different estimates for theorem 12 to apply we will pull back currents by pushing forward forms with f since the regular set of f is all of x then f is a well defined operator from smooth forms to smooth forms definition 43 for a map satisfying the hypothesis of proposition 34 we define the operation f from currents on x to currents on y by  f c c f clearly f preserves the dimension of a current let mk1 be the sheaf for which mk1 u is the banach space of bounded linear operations on the topological vector space comprised of f k1 c u with the k k norm equivalently mk1 is the sheaf of dimension k 1 currents of finite mass choose a riemannian metric on x if f x x is a smooth cover then for each x x and each n dx f tx x tf x x is invertible tx x let the operator norm the inverse tf x x we define k supxx k x we define k lim sup k the iterated pushforward operation f f k1 c x f k1 c x satisfies kf k k kk as is straightforward to verify if f is invertible then k is a bound on the growth of the k th wedge product of the derivative under f 1 for noninvertible f k represents a bound on the growth of the k th wedge product of the derivative under any sequence of successive branches of f 1 theorem 44 given f x x a smooth self covering map and that c hderham x is a cohomology class using either real or complex derham cohomology which is an eigenvector for f with eigenvalue assume also that k1 then there exists a unique eigencurrent c with local mk1 potentials representing the class c moreover c has local f k1 c 0 potentials consequently c is a current of order one also given any neighborhood u x of any point in the support of c then for every lenient current c0 with local mk1 potentials and which represents the cohomology class c then f k u supp c0 6 for all large k assume that the linear map f hderham x hderham x is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue r given c any current which has local mk1 potentials and which represents a cohomology class in the k1 chronik x then the successive rescaled pullbacks cally expanding subspace of hderham f c r of c converge a multiple of c proof we let a and c be the kernel and image respectively of d mk1 c k since df f d then pullback of currents gives an f cohomomorphism of the short exact sequence of sheaves a mk1 c since mk1 is the continuous linear operators on a normed vector space then it is a banach space from the observations previous to the statement of theorem 44 one concludes that for any k1 there is a constant d 0 such that kf bk d k kbk for all n since c is a space of currents it is naturally a topological vector space over k the map f c c is continuous since if ci c in c then  f ci ci f c f f c if pi p in mk1 using the banach space structure then kpi pk 0 by assumption then kpd pi dk kp pi k kdk 0 hence  dpi pi d pd dp and so we conclude that the map d mk1 c is continuous given any w in the k1 chronically expanding subspace of h k x k we can alter our choice of k1 so that w also lies in the chronically expanding subspace of h k x k we can therefore apply theorem 12 to conclude that there is a unique map w c such that f f where the first f is pullback of currents and the second is pullback on h k x k in fact w in the currents with locally continuous potentials by applying applying corollary 15 in conjunction with observation 52 lemma 38 and lemma 39 the second half of the theorem is a consequence of equation 3 proposition 45 let y be an oriented codimension k submanifold of x if the cohomological class of y as a current lies in the k1 chronically expanding subspace of h k x k then the successive rescaled preimages of y converge to the invariant plane of currents w if f h k x k h k x k is dominated by a single real eigenvalue r k1 then the successive rescaled preimages of y converge to a multiple possibly zero of the r eigencurrent in particular if n1 deg f then the successive rescaled preimages of any point converge to the unique invariant measure with mn1 potentials proof this follows immediately from theorem 44 if we show that y has local potentials in mk1 this is equivalent to showing that locally y dp where p a kk for some a 0 let b be a ball in rn and y0 a kplane in rn then there is a k 1 half plane p such that as currents in u p y0 moreover it is clear that p akk for some real a 0 there are also local potentials for y which are given by forms with l1loc coefficients these can be constructed by choosing a projection from u y0 to a codimension one cylinder c with axis y0 and choosing a volume form on c the local potential is the pullback remark as with theorem 41 theorem 44 gives regular degree one eigencurrents for every eigenvalue of f h 1 x k h 1 x k of norm greater one without requiring any constraints on the local behavior of f in holomorphic dynamics much progress has been made in constructing degree one eigencurrents and then constructing dynamically important invariant measures via a generalized wedge product see the references cited at the beginning of section 6 remark the proof of proposition 45 could clearly be modified to apply to many singular manifolds as well holomorphic endomorphisms we now restrict our interest to holomorphic dynamics thus all manifolds are assumed to be complex manifolds and all maps are assumed to be holomorphic unless stated otherwise holomorphic endomorphisms of the riemann sphere have been studied in great detail for endomorphisms much of the theory is still in its beginnings much attention has been paid to holomorphic automorphisms of c2 fm89 fs92 hov94 hov95 bs91a bs91b bs92 bls93 bs98a bs98b bs99 or k3 surfaces can01 mcm02 the major developments for endomorphisms have been on pn fs94a fs94b fs95b fs01 fs95a jw00 fj03 ued94 ued98 ued97 recent significant developments have been made for endomorphisms of kahler manifolds in ds05 the paper ds05 shows existence of eigencurrents or greens currents for endomorphisms of kahler manifolds under a simple condition on the comparative rates of growth of volume in two different dimensions they also show that a specific weighted sum of an arbitrary closed positive smooth current will converge to the greens current and that the greens current has a hlder continuous potential in this setting our theorem shows that arbitrary rescaled preimages of a broader class of currents will converge to the greens current a wide variety of results have been proven in these various circumstances either showing the existence of invariant currents showing convergence of currents to invariant currents or studying the properties of these invariant currents we include here results that follow from the method of this paper which we are sure substantially overlap with existing results presumably our cohomologicaly lifting theorem could be used in conjuction with theorem 12 to show existence of higher degree k k currents given certain bounds on local growth rates ddc cohomology let z be a complex manifold and let f z z be a holomorphic self map of z let h be the sheaf of pluriharmonic functions let l loc be the sheaf of locally bounded functions and let c be the sheaf of currents with local potentials in l loc ie currents locally of the form dd b for b a locally bounded function the members of c are closed 1 1 currents on z using the usual pullback on functions and the induced pullback on currents with function potentials ie pullback the current by pulling back its local potentials then we get a self cohomomorphism of the exact sequence of sheaves ddc h l loc c we note that h 1 z h is a finite dimensional r vector space as can be seen from the long exact sequence for the short exact sequence r o h where the first map is inclusion and the second takes the imaginary part the terms h 1 z o h 1 z h h 2 z r give the finite dimensionality since o is a coherent analytic sheaf see eg tay02 page 302 then from theorem 12 we obtain corollary 46 given v any closed eigenbundle of h 1 z h for f with eigenvalue r 1 there is a unique closed 1 1 current c such that limk f k c0 rk converges to c for any divisor c0 of v remark we note that the terms closed eigenbundle and divisor in corollary 46 are understood using the long exact sequence for 11 we can apply corollary 15 to show that corollary 47 any such invariant current c so obtained has hlder continuous local potentials proof the result follows from lemma 52 lemma 38 the fact that the ddc closed hlder continuous functions are the same as the ddc closed l loc functions and from corollary 15 also from observation 31 corollary 48 if v has a plurisubharmonic section the current c is positive result via invariant sections we stated early on that our construction of invariant members of h 0 c for a self cohomomorphism of a short exact sequence a b c of sheaves could be done in terms of finding invariant sections of bundles we illustrate this here in a specific case where we can take advantage of geometry to make further conclusions finding an invariant section of a bundle is equivalent to finding an invariant trivialization of the bundle and we will make our initial statement in terms of a trivialization let z be a compact complex manifold let f z z be a holomorphic endomorphism let p h 1 z h be an eigenvector for f with real eigenvalue of norm greater than one if f were to have complex eigenvalues of interest an analogous construction can be made to the one that follows we note that there is a canonical bundle map f f p p which gives the map f on the base space it is easy to show that there is a map p p which is the identity on the base space and takes the form r 7 r b on the fibers where b is a constant what is more the map is easily seen to be unique up to the addition of a constant then define the map f p p to be the composition of p f p p then f is the map f on the base space and takes the form r 7 r b on the fibers since every pluriharmonic bundle is trivial as a smooth bundle then we can choose a smooth trivialization t p r ie ta r a r for any a p r r where a r is computed in the fiber containing a theorem 49 there is a unique continuous trivialization g p r such that ga r ga r for a p and r r gfa ga for a p moreover g lim k t fk and the limit converges uniformly finally the zero set of g is the image of a section g z p and is exactly the set of points whose forward image under f remains bounded proof define a function t p r by t a t fa ta note that t descends to a well defined continuous function  t z r since for an arbitrary r r one has t a r t fa r ta r tfa r ta r t a one notes that since the function t is necessarily bounded if z is compact then defining ga ta 1 t a 2 t fa 3 t f2 a gives a continuous function g p r satisfying the above two properties assume g1 and g2 are two such functions then g1 g2 p r is a function satisfying a r a for a p and r r so descends to a continuous function p r satisfying fa a however since  1 one concludes that this is only possible if 0 since m is compact so m has compact image in r it is easy to check using the definition of t that k t fk a is exactly a partial sum of the first k terms of the above series and this gives the convergence result the conclusion about the section g is trivial the above construction can be carried through almost without modification for any subspace of h 1 z h on which f is expanding this gives an alternate way of understanding the convergence of preimages of sections the point is that if s is any section of p ie the potential of a current c then 1 f c is a current with potential which is the setwise preimage of s under f this is easy to confirm from the construction of f the greens trivialization g shows that f is uniformly repelling away from the image of the invariant section g thus as long as s is bounded in p not even necessarily continuous then the successive preimages of s will converge uniformly to the section g since uniform convergence of potentials implies convergence of currents then the rescaled pullbacks of a current c converge to the current with potential g we already have this as a theorem so we have not restated it as such here this is just an alternative approach note that in the case where z p2 fj03 has given far more precise control of when the successive rescaled preimages of a current will converge to the eigencurrent sections version with an invariant ample bundle it is also interesting to consider the special case where there is an invariant ample bundle with eigenvalue 2 an integer without loss of generality we assume is very ample the morphism of sheaves log o h induces a map from holomorphic line bundles to pluriharmonic bundles we let p log be the corresponding pluriharmonic bundle it is easy to see that there is a holomorphic map which is of the form z 7 az a c on each fiber and is the identity on the base space there is also a canonical holomorphic map f f which is a line bundle map and is f on the base space one then defines the holomorphic map f which is the composition  k k f this map is of the form z 7 az k on each fiber and is equal to the map f z z on the base space let denote with its zero section removed so that log p is a well defined continuous map since the preimage of the zero section of under f is the zero section then f is a holomorphic self map of it is easy to confirm that f can be rescaled so that the diagram  log log commutes our greens trivialization g p r can be pulled back to give a greens function g r on the punctured bundle it satisfies gf w  gw and gw gw log for w and c since g is a trivialization of an r bundle over a compact space g is proper since log p is proper then g is proper thus in this setting one can construct a greens function that is exactly analogous to the greens function constructed on cn1 for a holomorphic endomorphism of pn potentially one could take advantage of the special geometry of very ample bundles to get information about the dynamics in this situation bibliography references bls93 eric bedford mikhail lyubich and john smillie polynomial diffeomorphisms of c2 iv the measure of maximal
