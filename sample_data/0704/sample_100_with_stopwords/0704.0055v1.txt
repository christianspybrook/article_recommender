applied physics chalmers university of technology se412 96 gteborg sweden microtechnology and nanoscience mc2 chalmers university of technology se412 96 gteborg sweden dated april 1 2007 potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by firstprinciples theory the bonding in the potassiumgraphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory dft calculations however to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions this is included seamlessly with ordinary dft by a van der waals density functional vdwdf approach phys rev lett 92 246401 2004 the use of the vdwdf is found to stabilize the graphite crystal with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments for graphite and potassiumintercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation layer binding energy formation energy and bulk modulus are reported also the adsorption and subsurface potassium absorption energies are reported the vdwdf description compared with the traditional semilocal approach is found to weakly soften the elastic response introduction graphite with its layered structure is easily intercalated by alkali metals am already at room temperature the intercalated compound has twodimensional layers of am between graphite layers12345 giving rise to interesting properties such as superconductivity67 the formation of an amgraphite intercalate proceeds with adsorption of am atoms on graphite and absorption of am atoms below the top graphite layer after which further exposure to am atoms leads the am intercalate compound recent experiments89 on the structure and electronic properties of amgraphite systems use samples of graphite that are prepared by heating sic crystals to temperatures around 1400 c10 this heatinduced graphitization is of great value for spectroscopic studies of graphitic systems since the resulting graphite overlayers are of excellent quality11 the nature of the bonding between the sic surfaces and graphite has been explored experimentally with photoemission spectroscopy12 and theoretically13 with a van der waals density functional vdwdf theory approach that accounts for the van der waals vdw forces14151617 here we investigate with density functional theory dft the effects on the graphite structure and the energetics and the elastic response when potassium is intercalated the final intercalate compound is c8 k the am intercalate system is interesting in itself and has been the focus of numerous experimental investigations1819202122 graphitic systems are also ideal test materials in ongoing theory development that aims at improving the description of the nonlocal interlayer bonds in sparse systems142324 standard dft approaches are based on local local density approximation lda and semilocal approximations generalized gradient approximation gga25262728 for the electron exchange and correlation such regular dft tools do not treat correctly the weak vdw binding eg the cohe sion between adjacent graphite layers the failure of traditional dft for graphite makes it impossible to obtain a meaningful comparison of the energetics in onsurface am adsorption and subsurface am absorption conversely investigations of graphitic systems like c8 k permit us to test the accuracy of our vdwdf development work we explore the nature of the bonding of graphite the process leading to intercalation via adsorption and absorption of potassium and the nature of potassiumintercalated graphite c8 k using a recently developed vdwdf density functional16 this choice of functional is essential for a comparison of graphite and c8 k properties because of the inability of traditional ggabased dft to describe graphite we calculate the structure and elastic response bulk modulus b0 of pristine graphite and potassium intercalated graphite and we present results for the formation energies of the c8 k system the intercalation of potassium in graphite is preceded by the adsorption of potassium on top of a graphite surface and potassium absorption underneath the top graphite layer of the surface in this work we study how potassium bonds to graphite in these two parts of the process towards intercalation our vdwdf investigations of the binding of potassium in or on graphite supplements corresponding vdwdf studies of the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dimers of the polyethylene crystal of benzene dimers and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and phenol molecules on graphite293031323334 the outline of the paper is as follows section ii contains a short description of the materials of interest here graphite c8 k and graphite with an adsorbed or absorbed k atom layer the vdwdf scheme is described in sec iii section iv presents our results sec v the discussion and conclusions are drawn in sec vi fig 1 color online simple hexagonal graphite aa stacking and natural hexagonal graphite ab stacking the two structures differ by that each second carbon layer in abstacked graphite is shifted whereas in aastacked graphite all planes are directly above each other the experimentally obtained inplane lattice constant and sheet separation of natural graphite is ref 40 a 2459 and dcc 3336 respectively material structure graphite is a semimetallic solid with strong intraplane bonds and weakly coupled layers the presence of these two types of bonding results in a material with different properties along the various crystallographic directions35 for example the thermal and electrical conductivity along the carbon sheets is two orders of magnitude higher than that perpendicular to the sheets this specific property allows heat to move directionally which makes it possible to control the heat transfer the relatively weak vdw forces between the sheets contribute to another industrially important property graphite is an ideal lubricant in addition the anisotropic properties of graphite make the material suitable as a substrate in electronic studies of ultrathin metal films36373839 the natural structure of graphite is an ab stacking with the graphite layers shifted relative to each other as illustrated in fig 1 the figure also shows hexagonal graphite consisting of aastacked graphite layers the inplane lattice constant a and the layer separation dcc is also illustrated in natural graphite the primitive unit cell is hexagonal includes four carbon atoms in two layers and has unit cell side lengths a and height c 2dcc the physical properties of graphite have been studied in a variety of experimental404142 and theoretical4344 work some of the dft work has been performed in lda which does not provide a physically meaningful account of binding in layered systems1545 at the same time using gga is not an option because it does not bind the graphite layers for a good description of the fig 2 color online crystalline structure of c8 k showing the aastacking of the carbon layers small balls and the stacking of the potassium layers large balls perpendicular to the graphene sheets the potassium layers are arranged in a p2 2 structure with the k atoms occupying the sites over the hollows of every fourth carbon hexagon graphite structure and nature the vdw interactions must be included45 alkali metals am except na easily penetrate the gallery of the graphite forming alkali metal graphite intercalation compounds these intercalation compounds are formed through electron exchange between the intercalated layer and the host carbon layers resulting in a different nature of the interlayer bonding type than that of pristine graphite the intercalate also affects the conductive properties of graphite which becomes superconductive in the direction parallel to the planes at critical temperatures below 1 k67 the structure of am graphite intercalation compounds is characterized by its stage n where n is the number of graphite sheets located between the am layers in this work we consider only stage1 intercalated graphite c8 k in which the layers of graphite and potassium alternate throughout the crystal the primitive unit cell of c8 k is orthorhombic and contains sixteen c atoms and two k atoms in the c8 k crystal the k atoms are ordered in a p2 2 registry with kk separation 2a where a is the inplane lattice constant of graphite this separation of the potassium atoms is about 8 larger than that in the natural k bcc crystal based on experimental values the carbon sheet stacking in c8 k is of aa type with the k atoms occupying the sites over the hollows of every fourth carbon hexagon each position denoted by  or and the stacking of the k atoms perpendicular to the planes being described by the sequence as illustrated in fig 2 iii computational methods the firstprinciple totalenergy and electronic structure calculations are performed within the framework of dft the semilocal perdewburkeernzerhof pbe flavor26 of gga is chosen for the exchangecorrelation functional for the traditional selfconsistent calculations underlying the vdwdf calculations for all gga calculations we use the open source dft code dacapo46 which employs vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials47 periodic boundary conditions and a planewave basis set an energy cutoff of 500 ev is used for the expansion of the wave functions and the brillouin zone bz of the unit cells is sampled according to the monkhorstpack scheme48 the selfconsistently determined gga valence electron density nr as well as components of the energy from these calculations are passed on to the subsequent vdwdf calculation of the total energy for the adsorption and absorption studies a graphite surface slab consisting of 4 layers is used with a surface unit cell of side lengths twice those in the graphite bulk unit cell ie side lengths 2a the surface calculations are performed with a 441 kpoint sampling of the bz the pure graphite bulk gga calculations are performed with a 884 kpoint sampling of the bz whereas for the c8 k bulk structure in a unit cell at least double the size in any direction 442 kpoints are used consistent also with the choice of kpoint sampling of the surface slabs we choose to describe c8 k by using a hexagonal unit cell with four formula units lateral side lengths approximately twice those of graphite and with four graphite and four klayers in the direction perpendicular to the layers c8 k can also be described by the previously mentioned primitive orthorhombic unit cell containing two formula units of atoms but we retain the orthorhombic cell for ease of description and for simple implementation of numerically robust vdwdf calculations in all our studies except test cases the fast fourier transform fft grids are chosen such that the separation of neighboring points is maximum 013 in any direction in any calculation the weakly inhomogeneous electron gas ec dr nrr r nr 2 v0 the nonlocal kernel r r can be tabulated in terms of the separation r r between the two fragments at positions r and r through the parameters d q0 q0 r r 2 and q0 q0 q0 q0 here q0 is a local parameter that depends on the electron density and its gradient at position r the analytic expression for the kernel in terms of d and can be found in ref 16 for periodic systems such as bulk graphite c8 k and the graphite surface with adsorbed or absorbed katoms the nonlocal correlation per unit cell is simply evaluated from the interaction of the points in the unit cell v0 with points everywhere in space v in the three for bulk graphite and c8 k or two for the graphite surface dimensions of periodicity thus the v integral in eq 2 in principle requires a representation of the electron density infinitely repeated in space in practice the nonlocal correlation rapidly converges31 and it suffices with repetitions of the unit cell a few times in each spatial direction for graphite bulk the v integral is converged when we use a v that extends 9 7 times the original unit cell in directions parallel perpendicular to the sheets for the potassium investigation a significantly larger original unit cell is adopted see fig 2 here a fully converged v corresponds to a cell extending five three times the original cell in the direction parallel perpendicular to the sheets for c8 k bulk to describe the nonlocal correlations 2 for the graphite surface a sufficient v extends five times the original unit cell along the carbon sheets for the exchange energy ex we follow the choice of ref 16 of using revpbe27 exchange among the functionals that we have easy access to the revpbe has proved to be the best candidate for minimizing the tendency of artificial exchange binding in graphite15 using the scheme described above to evaluate ecnl the total energy finally reads vdw density function calculations e vdwdf e gga ecgga eclda ecnl in graphite the carbon layers bind by vdw interactions only in the intercalated compound a major part of the attraction is ionic but also here the vdw interactions cannot be ignored in order to include the vdw interactions systematically in all of our calculations we use the vdwdf of ref 16 there the correlation energy functional is divided into a local and a nonlocal part ec eclda ecnl where e gga is the gga total energy with the revpbe choice for the exchange description and ecgga eclda the gga lda correlation energy as our gga calculations in this specific application of vdwdf are carried out in pbe not revpbe we further need to explicitly replace the pbe exchange in e gga by that of revpbe for the same electron charge density distribution where the local part is approximated in the lda and the nonlocal part ecnl is consistently constructed to vanish for a homogeneous system the nonlocal correlation ecnl is calculated from the ggabased nr and its gradients by using information about the manybody response of convergence of the local and nonlocal energy variation dft calculations provide physically meaningful results for energy differences between total energies 3 to understand materials and processes we must compare total energy differences between a system with all constituents at relatively close distance and a system of two or more fragments at infinite separation the reference system since the total energy 3 consists both of a longrange term and shorterranged gga and lda terms it is natural to choose different ways to represent the separated fragments for these different long or shortrange energy terms for the shorterrange energy parts lda and gga terms the reference system is a full system with vacuum between the fragments for lda and gga calculations it normally suffices to make sure that the charge density tails of the fragments do not overlap but here we find that the surface dipoles cause a slower convergence with layer separation we use a system with the layer separation between the potassium layer and the nearest graphite layers dck 12 8 as reference for the adsorption absorption study the evaluation of the nonlocal correlations ecnl requires additional care this is due to technical reasons pertaining to numerically stability in basing the ecnl evaluation on the fft grid used to converge the underlying traditionaldft calculations the evaluation of the nonlocal correlation energy eq 2 involves a weighted double integral of a kernel with a significant shortrange variation16 the shape of the kernel makes the ecnl evaluation sensitive to the particulars of ffttype griding49 for example to the relative position of fft grid points relative to the nuclei position for a finite gridpoint spacing however robust evaluation of binding or cohesiveenergy contributions by nonlocal correlations can generally be secured by a further splitting of energy differences into steps that minimize the abovementioned grid sensitivity the problem of fft sensitivity of the ecnl evaluation is accentuated because the binding in the ecnl channel arises as a smaller energy difference between sizable ecnl contributions of the system and of the fragments conversely convergence in vdwdf calculations of binding and cohesive energies can be obtained even at a moderate fft grid accuracy 013 used here by devising a calculational scheme that always maintains identical position of the nuclei relative to grid points in the combined systems as well as in the fragment reference system thus we obtain a numerically robust evaluation of the ecnl energy differences by choosing steps for which we can explicitly control the fft griding for adsorption and absorption cases we calculate the reference systems as a sum of ecnl contributions for each fragment and we make sure to always position the fragment at the exact same position in the system as in the interacting system for bulk systems we choose steps in which we exclusively adjust the interplane or inplane lattice constant here the reference system is then simply defined as a system with either double or in some cases quadruple lattice constant and with a corresponding doubling of the fft griding along the relevant unitcell vector the cost of full convergence is that in practice we of ten do three or more gga calculations and subsequent ecnl calculations for each point on the absorption absorption or formationenergy curve in addition to the calculations for the full system we have to do one for each of the isolated fragments at identical position in the adsorptionabsorption cases and one or more for fragments in the doubled unitcell and doubled griding reference we have explicitly tested that using a fft grid spacing of  013 but not larger for such reference calculations is sufficient to ensure full convergence in the reported ecnl and e vdwdf total energy variation for graphitic systems material formation and sorption energies the cohesive energy of graphite g is the energy gain per carbon atom of creating graphite at inplane lattice constant a and layer separation dcc from isolated spinpolarized carbon atoms egcoh a dcc egtot a dcc ecatomtot where egtot and ecatomtot are total energies per carbon atom the graphite structure is stable at the minimum of the cohesive energy at lattice constants a ag and 2dcc cg the adsorption absorption energy for a p2 2 klayer over under the top layer of a graphite surface is the difference in total energy from eq 3 for the system at hand minus the total energy of the initial system ie a clean graphite surface and isolated gasphase potassium atoms however due to the above mentioned technical issues in using the vdwdf we calculate the adsorption and absorption energy as a sum of artificial stages leading to the desired system first the initially isolated spinpolarized potassium atoms are gathered into a free floating potassium layer with the structure corresponding to a full cover of potassium atoms by this the total system gains the energy eklayer ag with eklayer a ektot a ekatomtot in adsorption the potassium layer is then simply placed on top of the fourlayer 2 2 graphite surface with the k atoms above graphite hollows at distance dck the system thereby gains a further energy contribution ekg dck this leads to an adsorption energy per katom eads dck eklayer ag ekg dck in absorption the top graphite layer is peeled off the 2 2 graphite surface and moved to a distance far from the remains of the graphite surface this process costs the system an exfoliation energy ecg etotcg dcc cg 2 etotcg dcc at the far distance the isolated graphite layer is moved into aa stacking with the surface at no extra energy cost then the potassium layer is placed midway between the faraway graphite layer and the remains of the graphite surface finally the two layers are gradually moved towards the surface at distance 2dck between the two topmost graphite layers sandwiching the klayer the system has further gained an energy eckg dck the absorption energy per katom is thus eabs dck ecg eklayer ag eckg dck similarly the c8 k intercalate compound is formed from graphite by first moving the graphite layers far apart accordionlike and there shift the graphite stacking from aba to aaa at no energy cost then changing the inplane lattice constant of the isolated graphene layers from ag to a then intercalating klayers in stacking between the graphite layers and finally moving all the k and graphite layers back like an accordion with inplane lattice constant a which has the value ac8 k at equilibrium in practice a unit cell of four periodically repeated graphite layers is used in order to accommodate the potassium stacking the energy gain of creating a 2 2 graphene sheet from 8 isolated carbon atoms is defined similarly to that of the klayer eclayer a eclayertot a 8ecatomtot the formation energy for the c8 k intercalate compound per k atom or formula unit eform is thus found from the energy cost of moving four graphite layers apart by expanding the 2 2 unit cell to large height egacc the cost of changing the inplane lattice constant from ag to a in each of the four isolated graphene layers 4eclayer aeclayer ag the gain of creating four klayers from isolated katoms 4eklayer a plus the gain of bringing four klayers and four graphite layers together in the c8 k structure ec8 kacc a dck yielding eform a dck  14 egacc 4eclayer a 4eclayer ag  4eklayer a ec8 kacc a dck the relevant energies to use for comparing the three different mechanisms of including potassium adsorption absorption and intercalation are thus eads dck eabs dck and eform a dck at their respective minimum values results experimental observations indicate that the intercalation of potassium into graphite starts with the absorption of evaporated potassium into an initially clean graphite surface50 this subsurface absorption is preceded by initial sparse potassium ad sorption onto the surface and proceeds with further absorption into deeper graphite voids the general view is that the k atoms enter graphite at the graphite step edges20 the amount and position of intercalated k atoms is controlled by the temperature and time of evaporation below we first describe the initial clean graphite system and the energy gain in artificially creating freefloating klayers from isolated katoms then we present and discuss our results on potassium adsorption and subsurface absorption followed by a characterization of bulk c8 k for the adsorption absorption system we calculate the adsorption absorption energy curve including the equilibrium structure as a demonstration of the need for a relatively fine fft griding in the vdwdf calculations we also calculate and compare the absorption curve for a more sparse fft grid for the bulk systems graphite and c8 k we determine the lattice parameters and the bulk modulus we also calculate the formation energy of c8 k and the energy needed to peel off one graphite layer from the graphite surface and compare with experiment51 graphite bulk structure the present calculations on pure graphite are for the natural abstacked graphite lower panel of fig 1 the cohesive energy is calculated at a total of 232 structure values a dcc and the equilibrium structure and bulk modulus b0 are then evaluated using the method described in ref 52 figure 3 shows a contour plot of the graphite cohesive energy variation egcoh as a function of the layer separation dcc and the inplane lattice constant a calculated within the vdwdf scheme the contour spacing is 5 mev per carbon atom shown relative to the energy minimum located at a dcc ag cg 2 2476 359 these values are summarized in table i together with the results obtained from a semilocal pbe calculation as expected and discussed in ref 14 the semilocal pbe calculation yields unrealistic results for the layer separation the table also presents the corresponding experimental values our calculated lattice values obtained using vdwdft are in good agreement with experiment40 and close to those found from the older vdwdf of refs 14 and 15 in which we for ecnl assume translational invariance of nr along the graphite planes at 247 376 consistent with experimental reports18 and our previous calculations141545 we find graphite to be rather soft indicated by the bulk modulus b0 value since inplane compression is very hard in graphite most of the softness suggested by the isotropic b0 comes from compression perpendicular to the graphite layers and the value of b0 is expected to be almost identical to the c33 elastic 254 252 248 246 244 242 dcc to form a graphene sheet at lattice constant a from isolated spinpolarized atoms is given by eclayer a we find that changing the lattice constant a from ag to the equilibrium value ac8 k of c8 k causes this energy to change a mere 30 mev per 2 2 sheet the contribution egacc is the energy of moving bulk graphite layers in this case four periodically repeated layers far away from each other by expanding the unit cell along the direction perpendicular to the layers thus egacc 32egcoh ag cg 2 4eclayer ag taking the number of atoms and layers per unit cell into account we find the value egacc 1600 mev per 2 2 fourlayer unit cell this corresponds to 50

graphite layer from the graphite surface the exfoliation energy to be ecg 435 mev per 2 2 unit cell ie 55 mev per surface carbon atom table ii a recent experiment51 measured the desorption energy of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons basically flakes of graphite sheets off a graphite surface from this experiment the energy cost of peeling off a graphite layer from the graphite surface was deduced to 52 5 mevatom our value 55 mevcatom is also consistent with a separate vdwdf determination29 of the binding 47 mev per inplane atom between two otherwise isolated graphene sheets for the energies of the absorbate system and of the c8 k intercalate a few other graphiterelated energy contributions are needed the energy of collecting c atoms creating a layer of katoms the artificial step of creating a layer of potassium atoms from isolated atoms releases a significant energy eklayer this energy contains the energy variation with inplane lattice constant and the energy cost of changing from a spinpolarized to a spinbalanced electron configuration for the isolated atom54 the creation of the klayer provides an energy gain which is about half an ev per potassium atom depending on the final lattice constant with the graphite lattice constant ag the energy change including the spinchange cost is eklayer ag 476 mev per k atom in vdwdf 624 mev when calculated within pbe whereas eklayer ac8 k 473 mev in vdwdf graphiteonsurface adsorption of potassium the potassium atoms are adsorbed on a usual aba stacked graphite surface we consider here full one monolayer coverage which is one potassium atom per 2 2 graphite surface unit cell this orders the potassium atoms in a honeycomb structure with lattice constant 2ag and a nearestneighbor distance within the klayer of ag the unit cell used in the standard dft calculations for adsorption and absorption has a height of 40 and includes a vacuum region sufficiently big that no interactions within gga can occur between the top graphene sheet and the slab bottom in the periodically repeated image of the slab the vacuum region is also large in order to guarantee that the separation from any atom to the dipole layer55 always remains larger than 4 in the top panel of fig 4 we show the adsorption energy per potassium atom the adsorption energy at equilibrium is 937 mev per k atom at distance dck 302  from the graphite

shortrange component to it even gga calculations such as the pbe curve show significant binding 900 mevkatom at dck 296 this is in contrast to the pure vdw binding between the layers in clean graphite1415 note that the asymptote of the pbe curve is different from that of the vdwdf curve this is due to the different energy gains eklayer in collecting a potassium layer from isolated atoms when calculated in pbe or in vdwdf for kadsorption the vdwdf and pbe curves agree reasonably well and the use of vdwdf for this specific calculation is not urgently necessary however in order to compare the adsorption results consistently to absorption intercalation and clean graphite it is necessary to include the longrange interactions through vdw the first subsurface adsorption of k takes place in the void under the topmost graphite layer the surface absorption of the first klayer causes a lateral shift of the top graphite sheet resulting in a akabab stacking of the graphite we have studied the bonding nature of this absorption process by considering a full p2 2intercalated potassium layer in the subsurface of a four layer thick graphite slab following the receipt of section iii for the absorption energy 7 the energies eckg are approximated by those from a fourlayer intercalated graphite slab with the stacking akaba and the values are shown in the inset of fig 4 the absorption energy eabs is given by the curve in the bottom panel of fig 4 and its minimum is 952 mev per k atom at dck 290 to investigate what grid spacing is sufficiently dense to obtain converged totalenergy values in vdwdf we do additional calculations in the binding distance region with a more sparse grid specifically the inset of fig 4 compares the vdwdf calculated at full griding with one that uses only every other fft grid point in each direction implying a grid spacing for ecnl but not for the local terms which is maximum 026 we note that using the full grid yields smaller absolute values of the absorption energy we also notice that the effect is more pronounced for small separations than for larger distances thus given resources the dense fft grid calculations are preferred but even the less dense fft grid calculations yield reasonably wellconverged results in all calculations except tests of our graphitic systems we use a spacing with maximum 013 between grid points this is a grid spacing for which we have explicitly tested convergence of the vdwdf for graphitic systems given the computational strategy described and discussed in sec iii potassiumintercalated graphite when potassium atoms penetrate the gallery of the graphite they form planes that are ordered in a p2 2 fashion along the planes the k intercalation causes a shift of every second carbon layer resulting into an aa stacking of the graphite sheets the k atoms then simply occupy the sites over the hollows of every fourth carbon hexagon the order of the k atoms perpendicular to the planes is described by the stacking illustrated in fig 2 for the potassium intercalated compound c8 k we calculate in standard dft using pbe the total energy at 132 different combinations of the structural

discussion table i presents an overview of our structural results obtained with the vdwdf for graphite and c8 k the table also contrasts the results with the corresponding values calculated with pbe where available the vdwdf value dcc 553 for the c8 k c c layer sep aration is 3 larger than the experimentally observed value whereas the pbe value corresponds to less than a 1 expansion our vdwdf result for the c8 k bulk modulus 26 gpa is also softer than the pbe result 37 gpa and further away from the experimental estimates 47 gpa based on measurements of the c33 elastic response18 a small overestimation of atomic separation is consistent with the vdwdf behavior that has been documented in a wide range of both finite and extended systems1415161729303334 this overestimation results at least in part from our choice of parametrization of the exchange behavior an aspect that lies beyond the present vdwdf implementation which focuses on improving the account of the nonlocal correlations per se it is likely that systematic investigations of the exchange effects can further refine the accuracy of vdwdf implementations56 in any case vdwdf theory calculations represent in contrast to pbe the only approach to obtain a full ab initio characterization of the am intercalation process the c8 k system is more compact than graphite and this explains why pbe alone can here provide a good description of the materials structure and at least some materials properties whereas it fails completely for graphite the distance between the graphene sheets upon intercalation of potassium atoms is stretched compared to that of pure graphite but the klayer to graphitelayer separation dck dcc 2 277 is significantly less than the layerlayer separation in pure graphite this indicates that c8 k is likely held together at least in part by shorterranged interactions table ii documents that the vdw binding nevertheless plays an important role in the binding and formation of c8 k the table summarizes and contrasts our vdwdf and pbe results for graphite exfoliation and layer binding energies as well as c8 k interlayer binding and formation energies the vdwdf result for the c8 k formation energy is smaller than experimental measurements by 31 but it nevertheless represent a physically motivated ab initio calculation in contrast the c8 k formation energy is simply unavailable in pbe because pbe as indicated fails to describe the layer binding in graphite moreover for the vdwdfpbe comparisons that we can make for example of the c8 k layer interaction ec8 kacc the vdwdf is found to significantly strengthen the bonding compared with pbe it is also interesting to note that the combination of shorterranged and vdw bonding components in c8 k yields a layer binding energy that is close to that of the graphite case in spite of the difference in nature of interactions we find almost identical binding energies per layer for the case of the exfoliation and accordion in graphite and for the accordion in c8 k this observation testifies to a perhaps surprising strength of the socalled softmatter vdw interactions in a wider perspective our vdwdf permits a first comparison of the range of amgraphite systems from adsorption over absorption to full intercalation and thus insight on the intercalation progress assuming a dense 22 configuration we find that the energy for potassium adsorption and absorption is nearly degenerate with an indication that absorption is slightly preferred consistent with experimental behavior we also find that the potassium absorption may eventually proceeds towards full intercalation thanks to a significant release of formation energy conclusions the potassium intercalation process in graphite has been investigated by means of the vdwdf density functional method this method includes the dispersive interactions needed for a consistent investigation of the intercalation process for clean graphite the vdwdf predicts contrary to standard semilocal dft implementations a stabilized bulk system with equilibrium crystal parameters in close agreement with experiments two limits of the absorption process have been investigated by the vdwdf namely single layer subsurface absorption and the fully potassium intercalated stage1 crystal c8 k here the vdwdf is shown to enhance the semilocal type of bonding described by traditional approaches the significant impact on the materials behavior indicates that the vdwdf is needed not only for a consistent description of sparse matter systems that are solely stabilized by dispersion forces but also for their intercalates electronic address hyldgaarchalmersse s aronson fj salzano and d ballafiore j chem phys 49 434 1968 de nixon and gs parry j phys d 1 291 1968 r

calculations for those systems however it is far from certain and even unlikely that the conclusions drawn for noblegas systems carry over to bonding separations smaller than 3
