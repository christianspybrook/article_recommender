arxiv07040018v2 hepth 21 apr 2007 in quest of a generalized callias index theorem andreas gustavsson1 frstamajgatan 24 s415 10 gteborg sweden abstract we give a prescription for how to compute the callias index using as regulator an exponential function we find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions we show that the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of selfdual strings can be formulated as an index problem in evendimensional loopspace we think that the regulator used in this letter can be applied to this index problem 1 argustavssonswipnetse introduction we do not know what sixdimensional 2 0 theory really is it is believed that it can sustain solitonic selfdual strings 1 although no one today knows what a nonabelian selfdual string really is but if we break the gauge group maximally to u 1r then we should be able to define the charges of these mysterious selfdual strings by the asymptotic behaviour of the u 1 gauge fields one should expect these asymptotic u 1 fields to be at least isomorphic with a copy of the familiar abelian twoform gauge potentials with selfdual field strengths it now seems to make sense to ask a question like what is the dimension of the moduli space of selfdual strings of a given charge if the gauge group is su 2 and is broken to u 1 by the higgs vacuum expectation value that should also determine the tension of the string then the intuitive answer to this question is 4n where n is the u 1 charge in a suitable normalization such that n 1 corresponds to one selfdual string one may argue that half the supersymmetry is broken by the string therefore one string should sustain 4 fermionic zero modes since some half of the supersymmety is unbroken there should also be 4 corresponding bosonic zero modes these are naturally identified with the translational zero modes associated with the four transverse directions to the string furthermore the strings being bps should be possible to separate at no cost of energy thus staying in the moduli space approximation if we take them far from each other one may suspect that we can just add 4 bosonic zero modes from each string to get 4n bosonic zero modes in total in a configuration of n strings 2 it would of course be nice to have a proof of this conjecture could it be proven if one had some index theorem we will not provide a full solution to this problem in this letter but we will make it plausible that the problem can indeed be solved by computing the index of a certain dirac operator in loop space to address our index problem we think that one can lend the methods that callias 3 used to prove his index theorem in odddimensional spaces in our case we have an even number of dimensions namely the four transverse direction so it is apparent that we would have to construct a new type of index this we do in section 3 in section 2 we recall the callias method 3 to address index problems in open spaces though we will modify callias regularization using the more convergent exponential function to obtain the index as the limit lim tr esd here d2 0 and diag 1 1 rather than lim tr 2 d m2 which is the regularization that callias used we think that using the more convergent regularization of an exponential function is interesting in itself as it could possibly extend the callias index theorem to a wider class of index problems therefore we will devote the first part of this letter on this subject but let us at once say that our regulator probably has no advantages when attacking these old problems it does not provide us with a solution for how to count the number of zero modes in a multimonopole configuration with a nonmaximally broken gauge group where the index can not be reliable computed due to a contribution from the continuum portion of the spectrum what we hope though is that our regulatization can be useful when attacking our new index problem associated with the moduli space of selfdual strings in section 2 we obtain the index in one and three dimensions in three dimensions we apply this on the multimonopole moduli space and rederive the result in 4 a recent review article on monopoles and supersymmetry is 5 the one and threedimensional index problems have also been studied in 6 we then indicate how our method manages to reproduce the correct results in any odd dimensions in section 3 we show how one at least in principle should be able to compute the dimension of the moduli space of n selfdual strings by computing a certain index computing the callias index in odddimensional spaces for dirac operators on open n 1dimensional space where n 1 is odd there is an index theorem by callias 3 this applies to dirac equations of the form d 0 where the dirac operator d is of the form d i idi n here i 1 n 1 and i n denote the dirac gamma matrices  2 we define the gauge covariant derivative as idis iis ais and all our fields are hermitian if n 1 is odd the gamma matrices can be represented as 0 i i 0 0 i i 0 one may use the ndimesional notation a ai d id but one must then remember that space is really n 1 dimensional if n 1 is even there is no weyl representation of the gamma matrices because of the inclusion of the gammafive and no index theorem of this form exists we define the gammafive for even n as  i 2 1n which then is hermitian and we define the projectors 1 in odd dimensions n 1 the dirac operator splits into two weyl operators p dp p dp because p and d are all hermitian it follows that d is the hermitian conjugate of d also because d is already of an offblock diagonal form it suffices to include just one of the projectors so we can just as well write this as d p d dp d p d dp the index can now be defined as dim ker d dim ker d since ker d ker d d and ker d ker dd we can express this as2 dim ker d d dim ker dd dim ker d2 where we have noted that p p callias weinberg and others used the regulator im tr 2 d m2 to obtain the index as the limit m 2 0 in this letter we will be slightly more general we define ji x y tr hx i f d yi for any function f and of course d is not dimensionless so d has to be accompanied by m in a suitable way then we notice that w x y where manifestly ii xi a x m hx f d yi hx f d yi ii yi a y m w x y hx d m f d yi from this we obtain the following identity i xi yi ji x y 2tr hx df d yi tr a y a x hx f d yi in odd dimensions the second term in the right hand side vanishes as x approaches y this can be seen as being equivalent to the statement that there is no chiral anomaly in odd dimensions by using pointsplitting and inserting a wilson line so we get ii ji x x 2 to 2tr hx df d xi ker d d see this that ker d we apply the definition of hermitian conjugate with respect to the inner product dx and the property of the norm to 0 d d d d if we wish to compute the index as in eq 13 then we can take f d d d m2 however there is no unique choice of ji we then get ji x y tr x i d d2 m 2 d2 d2 m 2  tr x i d2 m 2  tr x i d 2 d m2 provided tr x i y 0 we will see in the next few paragraphs how one can achieve this by using a principal value prescription the virtue of expressing eq 13 as a total divergence is that we then can compute the index as a boundary integral over an n 2sphere at infinity as im dn2 rn2 xi ji x x 2 s where r is the radius of the sphere and dn2 denotes the volume element of the unit sphere if instead we wish to compute the index as the limit of is tr esd as s then we get ji x y 1 sd2 tr x i e it might seem confusing that we can have a plus sign here when we have a minus sign in eq 20 these peculiar signs seem to be correct though why we can have opposite signs should be a reflection of the fact that these expressions can not be continuously connected with each other at least not in any obvious way like taking m to zero and s to zero in fact s should be taken to plus infinity as m goes to zero we will now illustrate how one can use this ji to compute the index in odd dimensions one dimension we choose our gamma matrices as 0 1 0 i  2 1 0 i 0 and we have  i1 2 the dirac operator reads d i1 2 we need the square of the dirac operator d2 2 2 we make the choice j1 x y tr x 1 d d m2 we assume that x converges towards some constant values at x and x that means that we may ignore x for sufficiently large x where we then get  ip j1 x x tr 1 2 2 2 m 2  m2 the index is now given by lim j1 j1 1 if flips the sign an odd number of times when going from to and 0 otherwise if instead we choose jx y tr x 1 d 2 esd y then we get jx x tr 1 2 esk 2 k 2 2 if we compute the integral over k in the most natural way then we get a result that vanishes in the limit s could there be another way of defining this integral such that we do not get zero as the result we notice that the integral as esk 1 k2 1 for s 0 is convergent only if we integrate k along a line in the complex plane which is such that it asymptotically is such that 2 2 where k kei integrating along any such line in the complex plane we get the same value of this integral if on the other hand we integrate over a line that asymptotically lies outside this cone then we get a divergent integral for s 0 but we get a convergent integral for s 0 we then define the value of the integral for s 0 as the analytic continuation of the same integral for s 0 it remains to compute this convergent integral replacing k by ik and s by s we get the integral esk 1 as i dk 2 k 1 we can compute its derivative a s i dke sk2 1 the righthand side can obviously be analytically continued to s and that is how we will define as where the integral representation does not converge we can then integrate up a s z r a a0  a0 e a0 and we then need to compute a0 k2 1 we define this as the principal value this is ad hoc we have no argument why one should define it like this but if we accept this then we get a0 0 we conclude that we could just as well define the integral that we had as esk 1 lim dk 2 k 1 but this requires us to perform the integration of k in the cone where it diverges for s 0 and then define this integral by analytic continuation this seem to be rather ad hoc we have three rather week arguments why one should wick rotate first if we keep x y as a small number then we get the factor eikxy and this can act as a convergence factor only if we wick rotate we illustrate this in the appendix where we compute the corresponding integral in any complex number of dimensions second it seems to be the only way that we could produce a nontrivial answer third with this prescription we will manage to reproduce the right answer in any odd number of dimensions where we can check our result against the safer regularization used by callias if we compute the integral by this prescription then we get esk i p jx x tr 1 2 lim 2 k 2 2 and we see that we indeed get the right answer three dimensions and magnetic monopoles the physics problem that we will consider in three dimensions is to compute number of zero modes of the bogomolnyi equation fij ijk dk we choose the convention that our fields are hermitian it is convenient to group the fields into gauge potential a ai we define d di such that id i a and we let g id d be the associated field strength then the bogomolnyi equation reads  g  d a linearizing this we get d a contracting with we get 1 d a 0 and if we impose the background gauge condition d a 0 which is to say that zero modes are orthogonal to gauge variations with respect to the moduli space metric then we can write this linearized equation as a dirac equation d d 0  1 a d2 di2 2 i g where we compute inserting the bogomolnyi configuration we can write this thus using the fact that g is selfdual d2 di2 2 1 i g and get a vanishing theorem namely dim ker dd 0 as dd 0 is strictly postive hence we can compute the dimension of the moduli space dim ker d dim ker d d just by computing the index of d to compute the index we now wish to compute ji x x tr x i k dk 2 esd x we assume that asymptotically approaches a constant value at infinity this corresponds to a gauge choice where we have a dirac string singularity some further examination reveals that we get a nonnegligible contribution to ji for a sufficiently large twosphere only from the term d3 k sk2 2 12 i g ji x x tr i 4 23 k 2 2 12 i g we thus need to perform an integral of the form esk 1 as dk 2 k 1 if we choose the same prescription as we did in one dimension then we get the result a for details of such a computation we refer to appendix a if we apply this result to the integral that we had we get ji x x tr i 4 2 i g we expand the square root 2 i g p i g 4 2 in the far distance in a charge q monopole configuration we find that  g 2k 4 1 and so when we trace over the gamma matrices we get ixi ji x x tr p 2r2 if we now for instance assume su 2 gauge group broken to u 1 then if we integrate 2i ji over s 2 we get the index 2q the number of bosonic zero modes is twice the index ie 4q in our conventions 4 5 2m 1 dimensions in 2m 1 dimensions we get the integral k 2m sk2 2 a lim dk 2 k 2 if we use our regulator here 2 v 2 g and g is an abbreviation for integral 2 i g b lim 1m this should be compared to the k 2m m1 g k 2 v 2 m 2 that we get using the callias regulator we rewrite them as in order to compare these integrals  2m1 a  v 1 bgm where lim  2m s2 1 z 1  lim 1m  2m m 2 we compute a according the prescription introduced above in one and three dimensions that is by wick rotating and continue analytically in s details are in appendix a we can compute b using residue calculus introducing a regulator so that we can close the contour on a semicircle at infinity the result is we next expand  1m m 1 m 2  1  21 m 12  v v2 g  m 21  agm  v a  21  bgm and we find that the coefficient of gm becomes equal to m m 2  12 if one uses our regularization and equal to  m 21 2 21 3 this integral comes from expanding k 2 v2 g m 2 k v2 m 2 in powers of g as a geometric series 4 if one uses the callias regularization we see that the two expressions coincide for all m we have now showed that if we use our prescription of wick rotating k to compute the integrals over the exponential then we get the right answer for all cases that can be safely computed using a regulator that is less convergent we are inclined to think that our prescription for how to compute the integral will also work for index problems where the callias regulator diverges but we have no proof it is perhaps not so obvious that more general index problems can be formulated in the next section we will give one example of a more general type of index problem four dimensions and selfdual strings to introduce the notation we first consider the free abelian tensor multiplet theory in 1 5 dimensions the onshell field content is a twoform gauge potential b five scalar fields a and corresponding weyl fermions the field strength h b b b is selfdual the supersymmetry variation of the weyl fermions is  h a where we use elevendimensional gamma matrices splitted into so1 5so5 so that in particular  a in a static and x5 independent field configuration in which only 5 is nonzero we find the susy variation  0i5 h0i5 i a5 i if we assume that the classical bosonic field configuration is such that i h0i5 then the susy variation reduces to  i i 05 a5 and we find the condition for unbroken susy as 1 05 a5 0 if we use the weyl condition of the 2 0 supersymmetry parameter then we can also write this as 1 1234 a5 0 we may represent the gamma matrices as 0 i 5 1 i 2 1 i 1 1 1 1 1 i 2 a where 123 are the pauli sigma matrices 1234 then the condition for unbroken susy is 1 0 hijk ijkl l where 1234 a5 we have found that if then half susy is unbroken this equation is the bogomolnyi equation for selfdual strings 1 we are interested in finding the number of parameters needed to describe solutions of this equation we can linearize it and get the equation i i 0 for the bosonic zero modes that we have gathered into a matrix  ij bij for this to work we must also assume the background gauge condition i bij 0 now this linearized equation eq 80 does not make any reference to the gauge field so there is no way that we could count the number of parameters of a multistring configuration just using this equation this should of course not be a surprise the strings that we have in the abelian theory are not solutions of the field equations they have to be inserted by hand that is we need to insert delta function sources by hand in the same spirit as for dirac monopoles to be able to count the number of zero modes we must consider some interacting theory which at the classical level has solitonic string solutions to pass to nonabelian theory we begin by rewriting the abelian theory in loop space loop space consists of parametrized loops c s 7 c s we introduce the abelian loop fields 7  b cs s  cs s  cs s with these definitions a short computation reveals that as transforms as a vector and s a contravariant vector under diffeomorphisms in loop space induced by diffeomorphisms in spacetime one may then extend these transformation properties to any diffeomorphism in loop space spacetime diffeomorphism and reparametrizations of the loops then get unified and are both diffemorphisms in loop space the only thing to remember is what is kept fixed under the variation if it is the parameter of the loop or the loop itself the field strength becomes fst h cs ss t in terms of these fields the bogomolnyi equation will read4 fisjt ijkl ks lt we pass to the nonabelian theory by letting these loop fields become nonabelian in the sense that as aas a s where a s are generators of a loop algebra associated to the gauge group 7 we introduce a covariant derivative  s as  ds  s local gauge transformations act as  as given a loop c we automatically get a tangent vector s that makes no reference to spacetime we can therefore impose the loop space constraints  sas 0 s ss c for each s and also for some subtle field s c on loop space as a consequence we find that as s 0 these constraints are covariant under diffeomorphisms of spacetime and reparametrizations of loops they are invariant also under local gauge transformations provided that the gauge parameter is subject to the condition  ss 0 which is the condition of reparametrization invariance with the assumption made that a s are generators of a loop algebra we find that the constraint can also be written as as t 0 a local gauge variation of this constraint is ds t as t s t as t as t s t t as the last term vanishes by the constraint the first term gives us the constraint eq 92 that we must impose on the gauge parameter  dsa s ca s 4 we denote by is the usual functional derivative with respect to c s we have now introduced nonlocal nonabelian fields with infinitely many components it is also likely that consisteny of the theory requires an infinite set of constraints on these fields maybe then it could be that we may in the end descend to a finite degrees of freedom but this is just a speculation the problem appears to be difficult and illdefined how should one define a degree of freedom in a strongly coupled nonlocal theory the nonabelian generalization of the bogomolnyi equation should be given by 7 fisjt ijkl dks lt this equation is gauge invariant and invariant under the residual so4 lorentz group that is preserved by the strings we can not think of any reasonable modification of this equation that would preserve these symmetries so on this grounds alone one could suspect this equation to be correct of course this is not the only requirement that the bps condition imposes we also get conditions on the 0s and the 5s components but these bps equations will be of no interest to us right now we will show below that the linearized bogomolnyi equation can be written i dis is t 0 we will also see below that we presumably can actually drop the symmetrization in s and t in this equation the fields transform in the adjoint representation of the loop algebra by which we mean that is t is t we define the dirac operator ds i dis is and the projectors 1 we can now formulate an index problem in an evendimensional loopspace the evendimensional space in this case is given by the 4dimensional transverse space to the strings and the index is given by dim ker ds dim ker ds ds p ds ds p ds p ds ds p 100 where since ds and p are hermitian it is manifest that ds defined this way will be the hermitian conjugate of ds thus justifying the notation computing the index alone is not sufficient in order to obtain the dimension of the moduli space of selfdual strings we also need a vanishing theorem that says that dim ker ds 0 linearizing the bogomolnyi equation we get 2dis ajt ijkl dks lt ks alt 101 contracting by ij we get  ij dis jt 0 102 where we have defined dis dis is ais is 103 to see that the linearized bps equation can be written like this one must use the constraint  ij is jt 0 104 we can avoid having explicit signs by introducing the other chiraly matrix at our disposal namely that lives in a different vector space than we can then hide the signs in the tensor product  1 105 which amounts to dis  dis is  ais is 106 without any 5 if we define s i is 108 then we can write the zero mode equation as  i dis t dsi it 0 109 let us analyze the second term in this equation it is given by dsi ait is it  is ait dsi it 110  ais ait is jt 0 111 we should not count variations that are gauge variations as bosonic zero modes we can insure this by demanding the zero modes to be orthogonal to gauge variations with respect to the metric on the moduli space this leads to the background gauge condition dsi ait is it 0 112 5 to really understand what is going on one should apply 1 on everything on and on ds then one notices that  1 1 107 that is we can trade for once we apply 1 on everything this is what we really should do but to keep the notation simple we do not spell this out this condition implies that the gauge variation of the zero modes vanishes  ais 0 is 113 to see this we make a gauge variation ais dis is is and ask which gauge parameters will respect the background gauge condition inserting this gauge variation into the background gauge condition we get dsi dit is it 0 114 for this to work nicely it seems that we must constrain the nonlocality of our loop field such that s it 0 then the only solution to this equation is 0 in other words all gauge variations of the zero modes have to vanish furthermore we want the variation to preserve the orthogonality between ais and is ais it ais it 0 115 if we make a gauge variation of this then we get the condition  ais it ais it 0 116 is ait dsi it 0 117 which amounts to we conclude that the zero mode equation can be written as d s t 0 118 ds i dis is 119 where we are interested in counting the number of such modes in a background of k bps strings we compute 120 dis 2 is 2 ij fisjs ijkl dks ls r ds here d2 ds ds 2 ds ds and analogously for the other fields or operators in a bps configuration we get is dis 2 is 2 ij 1 fisjs 121 furthermore in the subspace where 1 0 we find that dis 2 is 2 122 is a strictly negative operator hence has no zero modes this means that we have a vanishing theorem dim ker d 0 a small comment the zero mode equation was really ds t 0 123 where we should symmetrize in s and t that means that we should rather consider ds ds t ds ds t ds dt s ds ds t dt ds s ds dt s 124 if now ds dt 0 and ds s 0 then we get d s d s t 0 125 the latter condition ds s 0 is of course a consequence of ds t 0 with s t the former condition reads  ds dt  dis dit is it dis it 126 which we would like to impose as a constraint restricting to the abelian case this is condition is of course true as 0 is it if we can impose this as a constraint on the nonabelian fields then we have now seen that the zero mode equation eq 123 implies that 127 dsds ds t 0 because ds is antiselfadjoint with respect to the inner product s t dctr s ct c 128 on loop space we can also go in the opposite direction assuming that eq 127 holds we get 129 0 t ds ds t ds t ds t and we conclude that 123 implies d s t 0 130 with no symmetrization in s t how to compute the index we should now be able to compute an index associated to selfdual strings as the limit 131 is tr esd when s we define the quantity jis c c tr c i k dks ks 2 esd c 132 it should be clear that the two ss involved in this formula are totally unrelated and find that is dcis j is c c 133 we can separate the functional integral over parametrized loops c into several pieces we can keep a point on the loops cs x fixed and separate it as dc d x dx c 134 then we can write is as an integral over a large threesphere at spatial infinity jis c d4 x dx c dx cjis c c 135 c i s 2 s 3 where thus x cs if we assume that the gauge group is maximally broken to a product of u 1s by the higgs vacuum expectation values then we should have u 1 loop fields at spatial infinity if we assume that the gauge group is su 2 and that it is broken to u 1 then we need only the asymptotic form of the u 1 fields at spatial infinity  hijl x l ss t  v k s fisjt 136 without doing any computations we can guess what the outcome of the index calculation should be a term like ijkl dx ctr fisjt cfksjt c 137 could certainly arise somewhere in odd dimensions a corresponding term vanished since there is no chiral anomaly in odd dimensions in our case this term vanishes identically by the bogomolnyi equation and the constraint6 fisjt dis jt 0 139 then there can be a term ijkl 6 for dx ctr fisjt ks 140 u 1 fields this would read fisjt is jt hijk csi cs k s j ss t2 0 138 that should arise in a very similar way as the corresponding term arose for monopoles if we insert the asymptotic u 1 fields this term becomes proportional to ijkl hijk x 141 that means that the index should be given by some numerical constant times the magnetic charge 142 integrals over the exponential the integral we will analyze here is k 2 sk2 1 ik as dk 2 k 1 143 for any complex number the 0 say will be taken towards zero it arose from x y and we keep it here just as a convergence factor we first compute k 2 ik a0 dk 2 144 k 1 in order to make this integral converge for any we should wick rotate k to ik and henceforth we will always mean by i the branch ei2 and by 1 we mean ei then we get k 2 k 145 a0 i21 dk 2 k 1 and this integral we evaluate as a principal value that means to evaluate the residues along the real axis and multiply them not by 2i but by half of it that is by i we get a0 1 1 12 146 next we turn to our integral as it is easier to first compute the derivative we should still work with the wick rotated integral making the substitution  k 2 we can put it on the form of two gamma functions the result is that 1 1 1 21 s a s ei 2 1 12 147 which we can trivially continue analytically to s and then integrate up the result is a 1 12 1 12 cos 148 references 1 p s howe n d lambert and p c west the selfdual string soliton nucl phys b 515 203 1998 arxivhepth9709014
