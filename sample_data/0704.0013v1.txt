Abstract. In [18] Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient
of modular forms on SL2 (Z) for p = 2, 3, 5, 7. In this paper, we extend the result of
Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on Γ0 (4N ) for N =
1, 2, 4. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms
of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents,
congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of L-functions at a
certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients
of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting ([16] and [15]).

1. Introduction and Statement of Main Results
In [18] Serre obtained the p-adic limits of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular
forms on SL2 (Z) for p = 2, 3, 5, 7. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly
holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on Γ0 (4N) for N = 1, 2, 4. A proof
is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral
weight. As applications congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of values of Lfunctions at a certain point and congruences of quotient of Eisentein series are obtained.
Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass
Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting ([16] and [15]).
First we need some notations to state the main theorems. Let, for odd d, by

the genus of Γ0 (4N) is zero if and only if 1 ≤ N ≤ 4. Let Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) be the space of

weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight λ + 21 on Γ0 (4N) and M0λ+ 1 (Γ0 (N)) denote

2. Applications: More Congruences of Modular Forms of Half Integral
Weight
In this section, we study several results related to p-adic limit of Borcherds exponents,
congruence relations of values of L-functions and congruences of quotients of Eisenstein
series, which are derived from Theorem 1 and 2.

for every integer b > C0 .
2.5. Maass Space. Next we deal with congruences of the Fourier coefficients of a Siegel
modular form in Maass space. To define Maass space, we follow notations given in [15].
Let T ∈ M2g (Q) be a rational, half-integral, symmetric, non-degenerate matrix of size
2n and
DT := (−1)g det(2T )
be the discriminant of T . Then DT ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4)
DT,0 is the corresponding fundamental discriminant.

space of weight g + k and genus 2g, which is realized as the image of Ikeda lifting.

(see (6.2) for more detailed notations). This space is called as a Maass space of genus 2g

Recently it was proved in [15] that Maass space is the same as the image of Ikeda

This paper is organized as follows: Section 3 gives a linear relation among the Fourier
coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. Using this result, in Section 4 we
prove Theorem 1 and 2. In Section 5 we give a proof of Theorem 3. We prove Theorem
4, 5 6 and 7 in Section 5.
3. Linear Relation among the Fourier Coefficients of modular forms of Half
Integral Weight
Let V (N; k, n) be the subspace of Cn generated by the first n coefficients of q-expansion
of f at ∞ for f ∈ Sk (Γ0 (N)), where Sk (Γ0 (N)) denotes the space of cusp forms of weight
k ∈ Z on Γ0 (N). Let L(N; k, n) be the orthogonal complement of V (N; k, n) in Cn
with the usual inner product of Cn . The vector space L(1; k, d(k) + 1) was studied by
Siegel when the value of Dedekind zeta function at a certain point was computed, where
d(k) = dim(Sk (Γ(1))). The vector space L(1; k, n) is explicitly obtained by the principal
part of negative weight modular forms in [8]. These results were extend in [7] to groups

Note that R4N (z) ∈ M2 (Γ0 (4N)) has its only zero at ∞. So, the valence formula (see
[17]) implies that

Proof of Theorem 3.1. Suppose that G(z) is a meromorphic modular form of weight 2 on
Γ0 (4N). For τ ∈ H∪C4N , let Dτ be the image of τ under the canonical map from H∪C4N
to a compact Riemann surface X0 (4N). Here, H is the usual complex upper half plane,
and C4N denotes the set of all inequivalent cusps of Γ0 (4N). The residue ResDτ Gdz of
G(z) at Dτ ∈ X0 (4N) is well-defined since we have a canonical correspondence between a
meromorphic modular form of weight 2 on Γ0 (4N) and a meromorphic 1-form of X0 (4N).
If Resτ G denotes the residue of G at τ on H, then
ResDτ Gdz =

by the Residue Theorem and (3.3). This implies that Φr,e (4N) is well-defined. The
linearity of the map Φr,e (4N) is clear.
It remains to show that Φr,e (4N) is an isomorphism. Since there exists no holomorphic modular form of negative weight except the constantly zero function, we obtain the
injectivity of Φr,e (4N). Note that for e ≥ λ−1

Recall that ∆4N,λ is the unique normalized modular form of weight λ + 21 on Γ0 (4N)
with the zero of the maximum order at ∞. Denote the order of zero of ∆4N,λ at ∞ by
δλ (4N). Then the basis of Mλ+ 1 (Γ0 (4N)) can be chosen as

(4.1)

{∆4N,λ (z)j4N (z)e | 0 ≤ e ≤ δλ (4N)} .

If ∆4N,λ (z) is p-integral, then {∆4N,λ (z)j4N (z)e | 0 ≤ e ≤ δλ (4N)} forms also a basis of
f 1 (Γ0 (4N)). Note that δλ (4N) = dim M 1 (Γ0 (4N)) − 1. So, we have, from Table

If g is in the kernel of ψr,e (4N), then R4N
*R4N (z)e ≡ 0 (mod p) by the Sturm's formula

Remark 4.5. In the proof of Theorem 4.4 the case when p ≥ 3 can be also treated as the
same as the case of p = 2. However, one gets more structure information about f (z)|Up

To apply Theorem 4.4, we need the following two propositions.
Proposition 4.6 ([20]). Suppose that p is an odd prime, k and N are integers with
(N, p) = 1, and χ is a Dirichlet character modulo 4N. Let

Remark 4.8. In [1], Proposition 4.7 is proved for p ≥ 5. But, one can check, by following
the method given in [1], that Proposition 4.7 holds when p = 3.

Proof of Theorem 6. Note that E10 (z) = E4 (z)E6 (z). So, the functions E10 (z)F (z),
E10 (z)G(z) and E10 (z)W (z) are a modular form of weight 8 * 12 , 7 * 21 and 8 * 21 respectively.
Moreover, the Fourier coefficients of those are 11-integral, since the Fourier coefficients of
H 5 (z), H 7 (z) and H 9 (z) are 11-integral by Theorem 6.2. We have

6.3. Proofs of Theorem 7. We begin by introducing some notations. Let V := (F2n
p , Q)
be the quadratic space over Fp , where Q is a quadratic form obtained from a quadratic
form x 7→ T [x](x ∈ Z2n
p ) by reducing modulo p. We denote by < x, y >:= Q(x, y) −
Q(x) − Q(y)(x, y ∈ F2n
p ) the associated bilinear form and let
R(V ) := {x ∈ F2n
: < x, y >= 0, ∀y ∈ F2n
p
p , Q(x) = 0}
be the radical of R(V ). Following [12], define a polynomial

Remark 6.4. The proof of Theorem 6.3 in [15] implies that if A(T ) ∈ Z for all T , then
c(m) ∈ Z for all m ∈ N.
