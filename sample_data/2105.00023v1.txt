Abstract
A finite-dimensional quantum system is coupled to a bath of oscillators in thermal equilibrium at temperature T > 0. We show that for fixed, small values of the
coupling constant λ, the true reduced dynamics of the system is approximated by the
completely positive, trace preserving Markovian semigroup generated by the DaviesLindblad generator. The difference between the true and the Markovian dynamics
is O(|λ|1/4 ) for all times, meaning that the solution of the Gorini-KossakowskiSudarshan-Lindblad master equation is approximating the true dynamics to accuracy O(|λ|1/4 ) for all times. Our method is based on a recently obtained expansion
of the full system-bath propagator. It applies to reservoirs with correlation functions
decaying in time as 1/t4 or faster.

Introduction

Consider an N-level system with Hilbert space CN coupled to a reservoir of oscillators in
equilibrium at temperature T > 0. The Hamiltonian is given by
Hλ = HS + HR + λG ⊗ φ(g),

(1.1)

where HS is an N × N hermitian matrix with (possibly degenerate) eigenvalues Ej and
eigenvectors φj ,

describing modes of a collection of harmonic oscillators, labelled by k, with frequencies are
ωk > 0 (put ~ = 1). The creation and annihilation operators a∗k , ak satisfy the canonical
commutation relations [ak , a∗l ] = δk,l (Kronecker symbol). The interaction term contains
a coupling constant λ ∈ R, an interaction operator G (hermitian N × N matrix), and it
is linear in the field operator

φ(g) = √

where h.c. denotes the hermitian conjugate. The collection of the numbers gk ∈ C constitutes the form factor g. The size of gk determines how strongly the oscillator k is coupled
to the system. This model is ubiquitous, for N = 2 it is called the spin-Boson model.
In the limit of continuous modes (thermodynamic limit, infinite volume limit...), the
values of frequencies ωk becomes a continuum, as do the values of the parameter k. For
definiteness, we consider a reservoir modeling a (scalar) quantized field in three dimensions. This corresponds to momenta k ∈ R3 , and ωk , gk , a∗k and ak become functions ω(k),
g(k), a∗ (k), a(k) with [a(k), a∗ (l)] = δ(k −l) (Dirac distribution). In the continuous mode
limit, the reservoir Hamiltonian (1.3) and field operator (1.4) are

The Hilbert space on which the operators (1.5) act is the customary Bosonic Fock space
over the single particle wave function space L2 (R3 , d3 k) (momentum representation),
F = ⊕n≥0 L2sym (R3n , d3n k),

(1.6)

where the subscript sym refers to symmetric functions (Bosons) and the summand with
n = 0 is interpreted to be C.
In this paper, we understand that the continuous mode limit is performed to begin
with, that is, we consider the Hamiltonian (1.1) with HS given in (1.2) and HR , φ(g)
given in (1.5). The Hilbert space of pure states of the coupled system is
h = CN ⊗ F

(1.7)

with F given by (1.6).
We consider an initially disentangled system-servoir state of the form
ρSR,0 = ρS ⊗ ωR,β ,
2

(1.8)

where ρS is an arbitrary system (N × N) density matrix and ωR,β is the equilibrium state
of the reservoir at temperature T = 1/β > 0. Since the Hamiltonian HR has continuous
spectrum, the operator e−βHR is not trace class and so we cannot define the reservoir
Gibbs density matrix directly. By constraining the reservoir particles to move in a finite
volume Λ ⊂ R3 in (typically a box in direct, position) space, the momenta of particles
are quantized and discrete and one can define the usual equilibrium Gibbs density matrix

for any f, g ∈ L2 (R3 , d3 k). The associated state is quasi-free, or Gaussian, meaning that
averages of general field observables P, which are polynomials of creation and annihilation
operators and limits thereof, are found using Wick's theorem [6]. This state is the infinite
volume, or continuous mode limit of the reservoir in thermal equilibrium, and it is the
initial state for the reservoir, see (1.8).
The state ωR,β is a linear functional on the observable algebra P of polynomials in
creation and annihilation operators, or the Weyl algebra, and it can also be represented
by a density matrix ρR,β (having actually rank one), albeit in a Hilbert space different
from F . This is called a purification and we explain it in Section 2.1 below. The reduced
system density matrix ρS (t) is then defined by the relation


trCN ρS (t)A = ρS ⊗ ωR,β eitHλ (A ⊗ 1lR )e−itHλ
(1.10)
valid for all system observables A ∈ B(CN ) (operators on CN ). On the right side of (1.10),
we use the convenient notation ρS ⊗ ωR,β (A ⊗ B) = trCN (ρS A)ωR,β (B), which extends by
linearity to all non-product system-reservoir observables. The mapping ρS 7→ ρS (t) is
linear and defines the so-called dynamical map
Vt : ρS 7→ Vt ρS = ρS (t).

(1.11)

Vt maps the initial system state to the state at time t, evolved according to the interacting
dynamics.
A central question in the theory of open quantum systems is when one can approximate
Vt by a completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) semi-group etL . A classical result is
that this can be done under some conditions: [10, 11, 32] show that

for any a > 0.

(1.12)

Here, LS = −i[HS , *] is the free system dynamics and K describes the influence of the
bath to second order in perturbation, consisting of a Hamiltonian as well as a dissipative
term (see also [1, 7, 33]). Often, the superoperator K is called the Davies generator and
LS + λ2 K is the generator of a CPTP semigroup [8, 14, 27]. The Davies generator can be
calculated by perturbation theory (and corresponds to the so-called level shift operator,
see Section 2.3 and also the Appendix of [27]). As follows from (1.12), it can also be
constructed from the relation

(1.13)

In differential form, the approximate Markovian dynamics, defined as
2 K)

(1.14)

takes the form of the ubiquitous Markovian master equation
d
ρM (t) = LρM (t),

L = LS + λ2 K.

(1.15)

An inconvenience of (1.12) is that the accuracy of the Markovian approximation is only
guaranteed for times that are not too large, satisfying λ2 t < a. This holds for arbitrary
fixed a, but the deviation of the true dynamics Vt from its Markovian approximation
2
et(LS +λ K) cannot be bounded uniformly in a – in other words, the speed of the convergence
to zero, as λ → 0 in (1.12), depends on a. Said differently, (1.12) shows that the Markovian
approximation is guaranteed to hold for t → ∞ only if at the same time, one takes λ → 0
with a bounded value for λ2 t. For this reason, (1.12) is sometimes called the weak-coupling
(or van Hove) limit. Recently, in [21, 27], the result (1.12) was improved to
2 K)

(1.16)

provided |λ| ≤ λ0 for some λ0 . As (1.16) shows, the Markovian approximation is now
guaranteed to be accurate to O(λ2 ) uniformly in time t ≥ 0, for fixed λ. The proof
of (1.16) is given using the so-called dynamical resonance theory. In [21, 27], an analyticity condition on the form factor g(k) (see (1.1)) is imposed, which implies that the
symmetrized reservoir correlation function
Cβ (t) = Re cβ (t),
where
cβ (t) = ωR,β φ(g)eitHR φ(g)e−itHR

(1.17)


(1.18)

is the correlation function, decays exponentially quickly in time, for large times. It is well
known that decay of reservoir correlations is necessary for a Markovian description of the
system dynamics to be accurate, but demanding exponential decay is not necessary. The
reason for the analyticity condition, and hence the assumption of exponential decay of
4

correlations made in [21, 27], is that the analysis is based on so-called spectral deformation
methods (pioneered in [4, 18] in this setting). However, a technically more demanding
approach, based on Mourre theory, was introduced in the current context in [25, 15]
and further developed in [19, 20]. It can be viewed as an infinitesimal version of the
deformation method and only requires the existence of a few derivatives (up to order
four for us here), rather than analyticity of the form factor g(k). Consequently, the
Mourre theory approach allows us to deal with polynomially decaying reservoir correlation
functions. In the present work, the decay has to be at least as quick as
Cβ (t) ∼ t−4 ,

t → ∞,

(1.19)

as we explain below, after (3.4).
The main achievement of the present work is a proof of the accuracy of the Markovian approximation uniformly in time, assuming the above-mentioned weak regularity
condition. Our main result is Theorem 1.1, which gives (1.16) but, alas, with an inferior
error estmate of O(|λ|1/4 ). Prior to the current work, Mourre theory was not used to
show the validity of the Markovian approximation. In [19] it was used to show that the
spin-Boson model has the property of return to equilibrium even in the strong coupling
regime (in which one is forced to use Mourre theory as the analytic deformation cannot be
applied). In [20], that approach was further developed to examine the reduced dynamics
of the spin-Boson model (large coupling), giving an expansion of the spin dynamics into
the sum of a main term plus a remainder. The remainder was shown to decay to zero as
t → ∞ but not to be small in λ, nor was it shown that the main term is a CPTP dynamics. In [28] an expansion of the system-reservoir dynamics was derived with an explicitly
identified main term (in terms of resonance data) and a remainder which is small in λ
for all times t ≥ 0. Our current work uses the results of [28] to prove the validity of the
Markovian approximation.
Deriving a markovian effective evolution equation for open systems is an important
task for theoretical and practical reasons [1, 7, 22, 33]. The literature on the topic is huge
and growing, and it encompasses research in mathematics, physics, chemistry, quantum
information and biology [2, 5, 8, 9, 16, 23, 24, 30, 31, 34, 35].

Main result

Our main result is Theorem 1.1 below. We first present the assumptions.
Assumptions
(1) Smoothness of the form factor g(k) ∈ L2 (R3 , d3 k).
We assume

g(k) =

j
such that h and its derivatives are bounded on (0, ∞) and lim|k|→0 ∂|k|
h(k) 6= 0,
j = 0, . . . , 4.
(2) Effective coupling:
(a) Fermi Golden Rule Condition. We assume that

where the minimum is over all distinct eigenvalue pairs of HS , see (1.2).
(b) Simplicity of resonance energies. We assume that the so-called level shift operators Λe , e ∈ E0 = {Em − En : m, n = 1, . . . , N}, have simple eigenvalues.
The Λe are explicit matrices describing the second order (λ2 ) corrections to the
energy differences e ∈ E0 , given in Section 3.3.
Remarks.
(i) Another way of expressing assumption (1) is that that g should be four times differentiable in the radial variable |k| and that it should have the infrared and ultraviolet
behaviours g(k) ∼ |k|p for |k| → 0 and g(k) ∼ |k|−q or |k| → ∞, respectively, with
p and q satisfying (1.21).
(ii) Assumptions (1) together with (2a) guarantee that the coupled system-reservoir
complex has a unique stationary state (the coupled equilibrium state) for small
nonzero λ, see [25] (and also Section 3.3). Assumption (2b) is a simplification that
can be quite easily removed by a slightly more cumbersome analysis. We do not
present it here.
(iii) Sometimes the reservoir spectral density is introduced as

The norm in (1.25) is that of superoperators, i.e., operators acting on density matrices.
In particular, we have kVt ρS − etL ρS k1 ≤ C|λ|1/4 (trace norm) with C independent of ρS .1

The next result gives an estimate of c0 in terms of the temperature, for low temperatures.

T0 . Then the constant c0 in Theorem 1.1 satisfies

explicitly calculable in concrete models (see Proposition 1.3 below).
The bound (1.26) is not optimal. Finding the smallest possible c0 for which our method
still works is an arduous task which we do not take on at this stage.

Proof of Theorem 1.1

The dynamics of an open quantum systems is usually presented in form of the evolution
t 7→ ρ(t) of the density matrix. The link to our result Corollary 2.2 of [28] is obtained
by passing to a purification of the system, that is, representing the density matrix ρ(t)
by a vector in a new Hilbert space. (After all, a density matrix is an operator, which is
an element – or vector – of the space of all linear operators.) We present the purification
in Section 2.1 and in Section 2.2 we explain how the dynamics is expressed in the new
Hilbert space. We show in Section 2.3 how the setup is that of [28] and we how we can
borrow the result of Corollary 2.2 there to prove Theorem 1.1 here.

2.1

Purification of the initial state

We now describe the purification of the system-reservoir complex. Take
P any system density matrix ρS acting on hS and write it in its diagonal form, ρS = j pj |ψj ihψj |. Then
P √
associate to ρS the vector ψS = j pj ψj ⊗ Cψj ∈ CN ⊗ CN . Here, C is the anti-linear
operator taking complex conjugates of the components of a vector in CN in the energy
basis {φj }, (1.2) (the choice of this basis is a convention). The map C is introduced so
that ρS 7→ ΨS is linear. Also, define the linear map πS (∗-representation) taking matrices
on CN to matrices on CN ⊗ CN determined by
A 7→ πS (A) = A ⊗ 1lS .

(2.1)

It is then immediately verified that

trCN ρS A = hΨS , πS (A)ΨS iHS ,
HS = CN ⊗ CN .

(2.2)
(2.3)

Relation (2.3) is the purification of the state ρS ; it is also called the Gelfand-NaimarkSegal (GNS) representation. As an example, the equilibrium (Gibbs) state is represented
by

where ZS,β = trCN e−βHS =

−βEj
j=1 e

is the partition function.

The purification of the reservoir equilibrium state is known as the Araki-Woods representation of the canonical commtation relations [3, 29]. The starting point is the reservoir
equilibrium state ρR,β ∝ e−βHR for HR given in (1.3). In the contiuous mode limit e−βHR
is not trace class since HR has continuous spectrum, so the 'density matrix' ∝ e−βHR
is ill defined. Rather, the state is defined to be the continuous (thermodynamic) limit
of a sequence of discrete modes equilibrium states. The limiting state is described by
the normalized linear functional determined by the two-point function (1.9). The state is
quasi-free, or Gaussian, meaning that averages of general field observables P (polynomials
9

of creation and annihilation operators and limits thereof) are found using Wick's theorem.
Let P be a field observable. Similarly to (2.3), we have a representation (which we verify
to be correct in (2.13) below)
ωR,β (P) = hΩR , πβ (P)ΩR iHR

(2.5)

where
HR =



(2.6)

is the (symmetric) Fock space over the one-particle space
L2 (R × S 2 , du × dΣ) ≡ L2 (R × S 2 ).

(2.7)

Here, dΣ is the uniform measure over the unit sphere S 2 ⊂ R3 . The vector ΩR is the
vacuum vector of the Fock space HR , i.e., ΩR = (1, 0, 0, . . .) when written according to
the sum decomposition (2.6). As in any Fock space, we have creation and annihilation
operators which we denote by a∗β (f ), aβ (f ) where f ∈ L2 (R × S 2 ) is a single-particle
function over which the Fock space HR is built. The canonical commutation relations
[aβ (f ), a∗β (g)] = hf, giL2(R×S 2 ) are satisfied. The field operators acting on HR are defined
by

1
φβ (f ) = √ a∗β (f ) + aβ (f ) .
(2.8)
2
As in any Fock space the annihilators map the vacuum vector to zero, aβ (f )ΩR = 0 for
all f .
The representation map πβ maps operators on F , (1.6), to operators on HR . πβ is linear
and satsifies πβ (A∗ ) = [πβ (A)]∗ . Its action on field operators φ(g) = √12 (a∗ (g) + a(g)),
where g ∈ L2 (R3 , d3k) is a one-particle state associated to the Fock space (1.6), then
determines πβ uniquely.2 We have
πβ (φ(g)) = φβ (τβ g),

Upshot of the purification procedure. Let us consider initial states of the disentangled form
ρS ⊗ ωR,β ,
(2.14)
where ρS is an arbitrary density matrix acting on CN and ωR,β is the reservoir equilibrium
state defined by (1.9). In the Hilbert space
H = HS ⊗ HR ,

(2.15)

where HS and HR are given in (2.3) and (2.6), respectively, the state (2.14) is represented
by the normalized vector
Ψ0 = ΨS ⊗ ΩR ∈ H.
(2.16)
Here, ΨS ∈ HS is the purification of ρS . Moreover,
π = πS ⊗ πβ

(2.17)

(see (2.1) and (2.9)) maps observables O acting on CN ⊗ F (before purification) to operators on H (after purification), and we have

ρS ⊗ ωR,β (O) = hΨ0 , π(O)Ψ0 iH .

2.2

Liouville operator

The next task is to find out how the dynamics generated by the Hamiltonian Hλ , (1.1),
acting on CN , is represented in the Hilbert space H. The answer is that

π eitHλ Oe−itHλ = eitLλ π(O)e−itLλ ,
(2.19)
for a self-adjoint operator

Lλ = L0 + λI

(2.20)

acting on H, called the Liouville operator. It is the generator of dynamics in the purification Hilbert space, akin to the Hamiltonian Hλ without purification. Given Hλ ,
the operator Lλ satisfying (2.19) is not unique. This is a general fact explained by the
Tomita-Takesaki theory of von Neumann algebras [6], which tells that the image of the
map π does not constitute all operators on H but only 'half' of them in the following
sense. There is an anti-unitary map J on H (called the modular conjugation) having the
following property. Given any A in the image of π (i.e., A = π(a) for some operator
a on CN ⊗ F ) the operator JAJ commutes with all operators in the image of π.3 We
say that JAJ is in the commutant of the algebra of observables. Now suppose a specific
operator Lλ satisfies (2.19). Then take any X in the commutant and set K = Lλ + X.
This is again an operator on H and it also satisfies4 π(eitHλ Oe−itHλ ) = eitK π(O)e−itK .
The non-uniqueness of the Liouville operator can be used to one's advantage by choosing
a suitable operator X.
Using the perturbation theory of equilibrium (KMS) states [13, 6] it is known that
the interacting system-reservoir complex has a unique equilibrium state, represented by
a normalized vector ΩSR,β,λ ∈ H. This vector has an explicit Taylor expansion in λ at
λ = 0, and
ΩSR,β,λ = ΩS,β ⊗ ΩR + O(βλ),
(2.21)
where ΩS,β is given in (2.4). In other words, ΩSR,β,0 = ΩS,β ⊗ ΩR is the non-interacting
equilibrium state. We then use the above freedom (choice of X) to impose the condition
Lλ ΩSR,β,λ = 0.

(2.22)

The resulting Liouville operator has the form [18, 4, 13, 27]
Lλ = L0 + λI

(2.23)

L0 = LS + LR
LS = HS ⊗ 1lS − 1lS ⊗ HS
LR = dΓ(u)

(2.24)
(2.25)
(2.26)

where

3

More precisely, if we denote by M the weak closure of the image of π and by M′ its commutant, then
JMJ = M′ .
4
This can be checked for instance by using the Kato-Trotter formula [36] – note however that Lλ is
not in general an operator in the image of π, so X does not commute with Lλ .

12

The system part LS acts on CN ⊗CN and LR is the second quantization of multiplication by
the radial variable u ∈ R, acting on the Fock space HR . In particular, eitLR aβ (f )e−itLR =
aβ (eitu f ) (Bogoliubov
transformation).
The interaction operator I in (2.23) is given by I =


π G ⊗ φ(g) − Jπ G ⊗ φ(g) J (compare with (1.1)), where J is the modular conjugation.
The explicit form of J is well known, see e.g. (1.21) of [19]. One then gets the expression
[19, 27]
I = G ⊗ 1lS ⊗ φβ (τβ g) − 1lS ⊗ CGC ⊗ φβ (e−βu/2 τβ g).
(2.27)

2.3

Resonance expansion and proof of Theorem 1.1

Let O be a system-reservoir observable. According to (2.16), (2.18) and (2.19), its average
at time t in the state ρS ⊗ ωR,β is given by
ρS ⊗ ωR,β (O) = hΨS ⊗ ΩR , eitLλ π(O)e−itLλ (ΨS ⊗ ΩR )i.

(2.28)

Given any vector ΨS ∈ CN ⊗ CN , there exists a unique operator B on CN such that
ΨS = (1lS ⊗ B)ΩS,β ∈ CN ⊗ CN ,

(2.29)

where ΩS,β is the purification vector (2.4) representing the system Gibbs equilibrium state.
The operator B can be found explicitly and easily as follows (see also [27]). Since the
−1 −βHS
density matrix ρS,β = ZS,β
e
is invertible, we can write (see also the beginning of
P
P
−1
Section 2.1) ρS = ρS,β ρS,β ρS = j pj |ψj ihψj |ρ−1
ρS = j pj |ψj ihρS ρ−1
S,β
S,β ψj |. The latter sum
P √
−1
−1
has the representation j pj ψj ⊗ CρS ρS,β ψj = (1lS ⊗ CρS ρS,β C)ΩS,β in the purification
−1
space CN ⊗ CN . Hence B = CρS ρS,β
C. Note that
β(kHS k−HS )
kBk = kρS ρ−1
S,β k ≤ trCN e

(2.30)

since the operator norm kρS k equals the biggest eigenvalue of ρS which does not exceed 1
βEj
and kρ−1
≤ ZS,β eβkHS k = eβkHS k trCN e−βHS (see (2.4)).
S,β k = ZS,β max1≤j≤N e
The point is that the operator
B ′ = 1lS ⊗ B ⊗ 1lR

(2.31)

commutes with the operator eitLλ π(O)e−itLλ (as the latter belongs to (the weak closure)
of the range of π and B ′ belongs to the commutant of this range). We thus obtain from
(2.28)-(2.31)
ρS ⊗ ωR,β (O) = hΨS ⊗ ΩR , B ′ eitLλ π(O)e−itLλ (ΩS,β ⊗ ΩR )i.

(2.32)

Next, using the normalization (2.22), the bound (2.30) and the expansion (2.21) yields
ρS ⊗ ωR,β (O) = hΨS ⊗ ΩR , B ′ eitLλ π(O)(ΩS,β ⊗ ΩR )i + R1 ,

(2.33)

|R1 | ≤ C|λ|kOk

(2.34)

where

13

is a constant independent of λ, t, ρS and O (we also used ke±itLλ k = 1 and kπ(O)k = kOk).
Note that in (2.33) we cannot commute B ′ back to the right as it will not commute with
eitLλ π(O), because that operator is not in the range of π any longer, after cancelling the
factor e−itLλ .
Consider now an observable O = A ⊗ 1lF on the system alone (A an N × N matrix).
Then the main term on the right side of (2.33) is of the form as indicated in Corollary
2.2 of [28],
hΨS ⊗ ΩR , B ′ eitLλ π(A ⊗ 1lF )(ΩS,β ⊗ ΩR )i = hφS ⊗ ΩR , eitLλ ψS ⊗ ΩR i
φS = (1lS ⊗ B ∗ )ΨS
ψS = (A ⊗ 1lS )ΩS,β .

(2.35)
(2.36)
(2.37)

Assuming that 0 < |λ|3/4 ≤ cλ0 (c.f. (2.14) in [28]), the Corollary 2.2 of [28] thus yields
hφS ⊗ ΩR , eitLλ ψS ⊗ ΩR iH − hφS, eitM (λ) ψS iCN ⊗CN ≤ C|λ|1/4 κ0 kφS k kψS k,

Due to the Fermi Golden Rule condition, all Im ae > 0 and |Seosc | = 1. There is exactly

one real eigenvalue of Lλ , namely E0 (λ) = 0. This is also the only real eigenvalue of Λ0 ,

χS ∈ CN ⊗ CN can be written as χS = (D ⊗ 1lS )ΩS,β for a unique operator D on CN (one
says that the vector ΩS,β is cyclic for the algebra B(CN ) ⊗ 1lS ). It is clear from (2.42) that

(2.45)

for a constant C independent of ρS and independent of λ, g, a, α, κ, δ. In the chain of
equalities (2.44) we have first used that 1lS ⊗ B commutes with (etL∗ A) ⊗ 1lS , then that
(1lS ⊗ B)ΩS,β = ΨS (see (2.29)) and finally that ΨS is the purification of the initial system
density matrix ρS (see (2.2)).
We now combine (2.44) with (2.33):

ρS ⊗ ωR,β (A ⊗ 1lF ) = trCN (etL ρS )A + R1 + R2 .
(2.46)

The bounds (2.34) and (2.45) yield

|R1 + R2 | ≤ C|λ|1/4 kAk.

(2.47)

According to (1.10), (1.11) we have ρS ⊗ ωR,β (A ⊗ 1lF ) = trCN ((Vt ρS )A) and so (2.46),
(2.47) give

trCN (Vt ρS )A − (etL ρS )A ≤ C|λ|1/4 kAk.
(2.48)
It follows that

Vt ρS − etL ρS ≤ C|λ|1/4 ,

(2.49)

where the norm is that of functionals on B(CN ). Upon changing the constant C in
(2.49), the norm can also be taken to be the trace norm (equivalence of norms in finite
dimensional spaces). Since C does not depend on ρS , (2.49) gives kVt − etL k ≤ C|λ|1/4 .
By definition, L is the adjoint of L∗ , (2.43), and it is shown in the Appendix of [27]
that L = −i[HS , *] + λ2 K, where K is the Davies generator. This completes the proof of
Theorem 1.1.

This is the adjoint with respect to the Hilbert space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on CN , with

Verifying conditions (A1)-(A5) of [28]

The Hilbert space in the current paper has the form H = HS ⊗ HR and dim HS < ∞.
The uncoupled operator is L0 = LS ⊗ 1lR + 1lS ⊗ LR , see (2.24). We will often leave out the
trivial factors 1lS , 1lR in our notation. The assumption (A1) of [28] is that all eigenvalues of
Lλ for small λ 6= 0 are simple. This is true in the current setup, since the only eigenvalue
of Lλ for λ 6= 0 small is e = 0 and it is simple, as is guaranteed by the Fermi Golden Rule
Condition (1.22) (see also the Remark (ii) following it). The condition (A4) of [28] is that
Pe IPe = 0, which is obviously true.

3.1

Regularity of the resolvent, conditions (A2), (A3)

The reservoir dynamics has a unique stationary state represented by ΩR ∈ HR , that is,
KerLR = CΩR . This is clear from (2.26). We set
PR = 1lS ⊗ |ΩR ihΩR |

and

PR⊥ = 1lH − PR .

(3.1)

We denote by Ō is the restriction of an operator O to the range of PR⊥ : Ō = PR⊥ OPR⊥ ↾RanPR⊥ .
For z ∈ C\R the reduced resolvent is given by
RzPR (λ) = (PR⊥ Lλ PR⊥ − z)−1 ↾RanPR⊥ ≡ (L̄λ − z)−1 .
For any integer j ≥ 0, set
γj (β) ≡ γj = k∂uj gβ kL2 (R×S 2 ) ,

(3.2)

where we set for short (see (2.11))
gβ ≡ gβ (u, Σ) ≡ (τβ g)(u, Σ) ∈ L2 (R × S 2 ) ≡ L2 (R × S 2 , du × dΣ).

(3.3)

We note that smoothness of gβ implies decay of the reservoir correlation function.
More precisely, the (symmetrized) reservoir correlation function (1.18) is given by

see e.g. [27], Discussion point (2) after (2.17). Then, if γj is finite for j = 0, . . . , k, we
can use eitu = (it)−1 ∂u eitu and integrate by parts in (3.4) k times. This shows that cβ (t)
decays at least as t−k . As we show below in (3.9), we need k = 4 for our method, which
implies the decay behaviour (1.19).
Define the norm
kφkj = k(1 + Ā2 )j/2 φk,
(3.5)
on H, where

A = dΓ(i∂u ).

Note that kφkk ≤ kφkl for 0 ≤ k ≤ l. Denote by C− = {z ∈ C : Imz < 0} the open lower
complex half plane.

γj = k∂uj gβ kL2 (R×S 2 ) < ∞,

for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

(3.9)

In particular, if (3.9) holds, then we have
max sup ∂zj hφ, RzPR (λ)ψi

(3.15)

The condition (A3) of [28] is that IPe is bounded and belongs to the dense set D,
(3.12), which is immediately seen to hold provided (3.9) holds with j = 0, 1, 2, 3 only.
We now show how the Assumptions (1.20),p(1.21) imply (3.9). Recall the definition
(2.11) of gβ = τβ g. Note that the square root u/(1 − e−βu ) is analytic at u = 0. It is
then clear that if g satisfies (1.20) with p = − 12 , 12 , 23 then γj is finite for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
The point of the discrete powers of p is that they combine with |u|1/2 in (2.11) to yield a
smooth function at u = 0. For vaues p > 2, we use Lemma 3.2 below to see that γj < ∞
for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This lemma gives also a bound on γj with an explicit temperature
dependence.

Then Dr is a polynomial of degree 2r + 1 in D0 and so |Dr | ≤ Cβ r (|D0 | + |D0 |2r+1 ) for
a C independent of β and u. Now |D0 | ≤ 1 + (β|u|)−1/2 and hence |Dr | ≤ Cβ r (1 +

The proof follows the strategy of [20, 19], however, in those papers, the interaction operator I is proportional to a Weyl operator (which is, in particular, a bounded operator)

and not the field operator we have here. It is thus necessary to give a proof in the present
case. Introduce the regularized Liouville operator L̄(α), for α > 0, by

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We show the bounds (3.7), (3.8) for the regularized resolvent
Rz (α). Since the upper bounds are independent of α, since Rz is bounded uniformly in
α for z ∈ C− fixed, and since Rz (α) → Rz strongly as α → 0 (Proposition 3.3 (3)), the
result follows. We write simply R = (L̄(α) − z)−1 here. Let k ≥ 0 be an integer. We have
∂zk R = k!Rk+1 and, denoting

Proof of Proposition 1.2.

By the expression A ≺ B we mean that A ≤ const.B, where the constant is independent
of the parameters λ, g, a, α, κ, δ and of the inverse temperature β. According to the proof
4/3
of Theorem1.1, (2.38), we need that 0 < |λ| ≺ λ0 , where λ0 is given by (see [28], equation

We now estimate λ0 in terms of the inverse temperature β. From (3.16), γj ≺ β −1/2 + β j .
We estimate κ1 using (3.15). Imposing the constraint
|λ| ≺ min{β 1/2 , β −4}

(3.53)

gives that |λ|γj ≺ 1 for j = 2, 3, 4 and then (3.13) implies that c1 (β, λ) ≺ β −1 + β 3 . It
follows from (3.15) that κ1 ≺ β −2 + β 9 .
Consider low temperatures, T = 1/β ≺ 1. Then κ1 ≺ β 9 and so



Level shift operators and Fermi golden rule condition (A5)

It is shown in [25] that if (1.22) is satisfied, then Lλ has a simple eigenvalue at zero for
small λ 6= 0. It then follows that Lλ does not have any other eigenvalues, except for
that single one at the origin ([17, 6]). This argument holds even if the spectrum of HS
is degenerate. Denoting as in [28] the number of eigenvalues of Lλ for λ 6= 0 by m′e , we
see that condition (1.22) implies that m′0 = 1 and m′e = 0 for all e 6= 0. In particular, the
only invariant state for λ 6= 0 is the coupled equilibrium state.
More precisely, as shown in [25], condition (1.22) implies that the spectrum of the level
shift operators Λe for e 6= 0 lies in the open upper complex plane C+ = {z : Imz > 0}
23

and that Λ0 has a simple eigenvalue at the origin (eigenvector ΩS,β , see (2.4)) and all other
eigenvalues of Λ0 are in C+ . Therefore, Λe has exactly m′e real eigenvalues, as required in
condition (A5) of that paper. This characterization of the spectrum of the Λe is usually
called the Fremi Golden Rule Condition.
The assumption (A5) in [28] contains another part, namely that the eigenvalues of Λe
are simple. We have
Λe = −Pe IPe⊥ (L0 − e + i0+ )−1 IPe
(3.57)
with I given in (2.27) and where Pe = PS,e ⊗ PR , where PR is given in (3.1) and PS,e is
the eigenprojection of LS associated to the eigenvalue e. As I contains two terms, (3.57)
is the sum of four terms,
Λe =

The partial trace over the reservoir part is calculated using the formula

The condition that Λe should have simple spectrum can then be verified for concrete cases,
where g, G are given explicitly, see e.g. Section 3.3.1. Note that if e is a simple eigenvalue
of LS , then PS,e has rank one and so Λe has automatically simple spectrum. Note also
that e = 0 is always a degenerate eigenvalue of LS .

3.3.1

Spin-Boson model, proof of Proposition 1.3

Consider HS and G to be given as in (1.27). The energies of HS are E1 = ∆/2, E2 = −∆/2
and so the eigenvalues of LS are e ∈ {−∆, 0, ∆} with multiplicities m−∆ = m∆ = 1 and
m0 = 2. The gap of LS is thus
g = ∆.

Set φij = φi ⊗ φj ∈ C2 ⊗ C2 . We have
P−∆ = |φ21 ihφ21 |,

P0 = |φ11 ihφ11 | + |φ22 ihφ22 |,

The level shift operator Λ−∆ is obtained from the expression on the right side of (3.63)
by replacing P∆ by P−∆ and changing the sign of the two real terms in [* * * ] (see also
Theorem 1.1 of [26]). It is automatic that Λ0 = iΓ0 for a self-adjoint Γ0 (again by Theorem
1.1 of [26]) and an explicit calculation using (3.60) gives

Let us now estimate the parameters a, α, δ, κ, (3.48)-(3.51). In the remainder of this section we write A ≺ B to mean that A ≤ const.B for a constant independent of λ, a, α, δ, κ
and independent of the inverse temperature β.
We start with an estimate for a. The nonzero imaginary

respectively. We have J(ω) ∼ ω 2+2p for ω ∼ 0, where p is the infrared parameter, see

(1.21). Thus 1−e
−βω |ω=0 = 0 for p > −1/2 and
1−e−βω ω=0
thus get, for G12 6= 0 and J(∆) 6= 0,
1≺a≺1

for T = 1/β ≺ 1.

(s)

(3.72)

(1)

Now we estimate α = maxe,s |ae | = max{|a0 |, |a∆ |}, (3.49). From the above analysis
(1)
of a, we know how to estimate a0 as well as the imaginary part of a∆ ; they are ≺ 1.
Consider the the integral involving the principal value of (u − ∆)−1 . The part of the
integral coming from the domain |u − ∆| > ∆/2 is bounded ≺ 1 for 1 ≺ β. On the
part where the distribution becomes singular, |u − ∆| ≤ ∆/2, we estimate the integral as
follows. We write it as
Z

(2/π) P.V.
J(u) coth(βu/2)

J(u)

|u−∆|≤∆/2
In the second integral on the right side of (3.73) the principal value distribution has
become simply the function (u − ∆)−1 . We use the mean value theorem,
coth(βu/2) − coth(β∆/2)

for some ξ between u and ∆. Clearly, ∆/2 ≤ ξ ≤ 3∆/2 and so since 1 ≺ β, we have
eβ∆/2 ≺ eβξ ≺ (eβξ/2 − e−βξ/2 )2 . We conclude that |(3.73)| ≺ β.
Next we analyze the last integral in (3.69). To alleviate the analysis, we shall assume
that p > −1/2. Then the P.V. u1 is simply the function u−1 and it follows readily that the
integral has the upper bound ≺ 1 + 1/β ≺ 1.
We conclude that
α≺β
for T = 1/β ≺ 1.
(3.75)
Next we estimate δ, the gap between the eigenvalues of the level shift operators, (3.50).
Only Λ0 has to be taken into account, since Λ±∆ are one-dimensional. We have
(1)

1 ≺ δ = |a0 | ≺ 1,

for T = 1/β ≺ 1.

(3.76)

Finally, we have (see (3.51))
κ = 1,

(3.77)

since the eigenprojections of all the level shift operators are orthogonal in the case at
hand.
We are now able to simplify the condition (1.26). Using (3.72), (3.76) and (3.77) we
get (recall that we do not estimate uniformly in g = ∆)

K, (1.28). Its expression is given in the Appendix of [27]. This completes the proof of
