Abstract-An important concept in the 5th generation of
mobile networks is multi-tenancy, which allows diverse operators
sharing the same wireless infrastructure. To support this feature
in conjunction with the challenging performance requirements of
future networks, more automated and faster planning of the
required radio capacity is needed. Likewise, installing S mall Cells
is an effective resource to provide greater performance and
capacity to both indoor and outdoor places. This paper proposes
a new framework for automated cell planning in multi-tenant
S mall Cell networks. In particular, taking advantage of the
available network data, a set of detailed planning specifications
over time and space domains are generated in order to meet the
contracted capacity by each tenant. Then, the network
infrastructure and configuration are updated according to an
algorithm that considers different actions such as
adding/removing channels and adding or relocating small cells.
The simulation results show the effectiveness of various methods
to derive the planning specifications depending on the correlation
between the tenant's and network's traffic demands.

INT RODUCT ION

Cellular data traffic has grown exponentially in the last few
years due to the increasing popularity of new mobile devices
and application services. A promising solution to satisfy this
demand in the forthcoming fifth generation (5G) is based on
Small Cell (SC) deployments [1]. SCs, which are more
economically attractive than macrocells, provide additional
capacity to the macro-cell layer, offering overlay coverage over
the area of interest. The dense deployment of SCs has proven
to be a cost-effective way to offer more capacity and more
spectrum reuse because of their smaller cell radius [2-3].
The future 5G radio access networks (RANs) will support
multi-tenancy, so that multiple mobile operators, service
providers, over-the-top companies and vertical sectors can be
served over the same infrastructure. In this respect, the
dynamic resource provisioning between tenants has been
studied in [4-5], where a central entity is responsible for
allocating resources via resource slicing. This kind of solutions
are intended for operating in short-term time scales. From a
perspective of larger time scales, multi-tenancy poses
unprecedented challenges to the owner of the shared RAN in
relation to radio network planning (RNP). For example, each

"tenant" has specific characteristics on its geographic and/or
population coverage [6], which may also change frequently
over the time. To ensure speedy and efficient deployment of
services, traditional RNP has to be evolved toward new
models, where SCs are considered as a key element to increase
capacity.
Thanks to the Self-Organizing Network (SON) concept
introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
[7], traditional management tasks in cellular networks have
been transformed into a set of automated functions. Selfplanning is defined in [8] as the process of identifying the
parameter settings of new network elements, including site
locations and hardware configuration. It was included within
the SON use cases defined by the Next Generation Mobile
Networks (NGMN) alliance [9]. To meet the envisioned
capacity of 5G networks, the concept of "Self-" has to be
applied to the dimensioning, planning and deployment of SCs.
By making these activities more dynamic, faster and automatic,
capital and operational expenditures can be reduced and
network performance improved. Thus, the new RNP functions
will operate at shorter time scales than today, involving a set of
decision-making processes that can be triggered by various
events. The diversity of these events will also be much greater
in the future 5G networks, ranging from call traces and cell
counters crossing a given threshold to the arrival of new
tenants. In addition, the decision-making processes will
manage a wider range of cost-efficient solutions, taking
advantage of the flexibility of SCs and being integrated with
the optimization tasks to avoid suboptimal network
configuration and inconsistencies.
Taking into account the gaps in the open literature, in this
paper, a novel framework that applies the SON principles to the
RNP problem is proposed to meet the challenging requirements
of 5G. In particular, this work tackles the RNP problem in the
context of 5G considering the following: (i) capacity
provisioning will be one of the most challenging issues for
network equipment providers ; (ii) the multi-tenancy feature
will introduce additional complexity to the planning process
since multiple capacity conformance specifications over the
spatial and temporal domains will be defined; and (iii) SCs will
be considered as the main driver to satisfy the traffic demand
because they are a less expensive and easy-to-deploy
alternative to macrocells. Deploying SCs entails strong
implications in the way that the spectrum planning (or channel
allocation) is carried out, since the newly deployed SCs will
interfere other co-channel SCs. Nevertheless, the spectrum
planning problem can be solved in a more localized fashion
than in macrocell deployments, because of the smaller size of
SCs and the usage of high carrier frequencies, which facilitate

extensive spatial reuse. Thus, the proposed framework
advocates a more systematic and efficient way of RNP without
requiring vast computational resources. In this respect, when
network measurements, call traces and/or geo-located data are
available, the models to characterize network performance and
traffic estimation can exploit them. The framework also
reduces the gap between planning and optimization work by
defining a unified approach where the potential solutions are
intended to satisfy the traffic demand while minimizing
capacity overprovisioning in the network.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II the literature related to RNP is discussed. In Section
III the system model is presented. Section IV describes the
proposed architecture and analyzes the multi-tenancy feature
from a planning perspective. Results are discussed in Section
V. Finally, Section VI provides some concluding remarks.

RELAT ED W ORK

The RNP problem has been widely investigated in
macrocell scenarios [10-11]. With the arrival of SCs, the RNP
problem has been addressed in the context of Heterogeneous
Networks, where the cross-tier interference between macrocells
and SCs has been crucial for an efficient deployment [12-17].
However, focusing on the SC-layer, there is a lack of studies on
the joint optimization of SC location planning and spectrum
planning. In general, spectrum planning (or channel allocation)
is seen as a separate issue that is solved only when the location
of the SCs is already known.
RNP as an optimization problem has commonly been
approached as a two-phase process, where the first phase (also
referred to as dimensioning) has to determine the minimum
number of cells to satisfy signal coverage, system capacity and
cost constraints, while the second phase tries to find the
optimal cell locations [10][12][18-19]. Eliminating redundant
base stations can be considered in the method as a third phase
[11], or it can be the fundamental basis of the planning method
[16]. Another approach is based on iteratively adding a cell
which has the highest increment of an utility function among
the set of candidate locations until network capacity reaches a
target value [20-21]. Note that, in this case, the a priori
dimensioning phase is not required. In general, the number of
cells to deploy is estimated as the total traffic demand of the
considered area divided by the average capacity of a cell. In SC
networks, the SCs can use different number and different set of
channels, which also may change over time. Consequently, the
estimation of cell capacity is not as simple as in macrocell
networks, where the frequency reuse is typically one. This
issue obviously affects the accuracy of the estimation of the
number of cells. Thus, to avoid relying on this number, in this
paper, the iterative approach of adding SCs has been selected.
The success of RNP depends to some extent on the model
that is used to characterize the network performance, typically
Monte-Carlo simulations [10][22] or stochastic processes [2325]. These models can be utilized to develop either proactive or
reactive planning strategies. Recently, the energy consumption
of base stations has also been modeled to provide energy efficient planning solutions [20][23][26-27]. From a more
practical perspective, existing commercial planning tools (such
as those mentioned in [19]) provide operators with multitude of
capabilities for efficient RNP, including realistic traffic maps

and accurate propagation models. However, there is very little
open information about methodology and principles due to the
confidential and proprietary nature of these solutions . Lastly,
the RNP of multi-tenant networks has received little attention
in the literature [28].
From the perspective of 5G, network slicing represents a
fundamental feature to accommodate traffic demands in multitenant networks without significantly increas ing operational
and infrastructure costs [29]. Specifically, network slicing
consists of partitioning a common physical infrastructure into
multiple logical networks. The challenges that arise from
introducing this feature in 5G networks have been addressed in
several works [29-30]. The architectural issues for enforcing
slices in mobile networks have been studied in [31-32], while
the algorithmic aspects have been investigated in [33]. In that
work, an algorithm for dynamic resource sharing across slices
taking into account user association decisions has been
proposed. To enable network slicing in mobile networks,
various technologies such as Network Function Virtualization
(NFV), Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and cloud
computing have been considered [34]. In this respect, the
allocation of virtualized network functions, the network
programmability and the centralized coordination are key
aspects for the adoption of network slicing and the diverse
requirements of 5G mobile networks.
With network slicing, a much more efficient utilization of
network resources is achieved in multi-tenant networks.
However, when traffic volumes increase and the current
infrastructure is not enough to meet the required capacity,
investing on new resources remains as the only solution to this
issue. While the above references focus on network slicing to
optimize the resource usage during the network operation, this
paper proposes a framework to update the network
infrastructure during the (re-)planning phase. Such a
framework was initially introduced in [35], where the SC
location problem and spectrum planning were approached as a
joint problem. This paper further develops this initial work
introducing the following contributions and novelties :
 A novel implementation of the SC planning and spectrum
allocation processes is considered. Specifically, when a new
SC has to be deployed, the channel allocation process is
performed through an iterative process to try a variable
number of allocated channels.
 New scenarios are adopted to evaluate a greater variety of
planning actions, such as removing a channel in a SC.
 An exhaustive temporal analysis of the proposed planning
strategies is performed to evaluate the re-planning phase.
This phase takes place after deploying a new tenant and it is
especially effective when the tenant's demand is a priori
unknown.


The proposed capacity planning method is evaluated
against the state-of-the-art, where the spectrum allocation is
commonly seen as an independent function that is executed
only when the location of the SCs is already known.

SYST EM M ODEL

Let us assume a scenario where a certain infrastructure
provider owns a RAN comprised of SCs. The SCs are intended
to meet the high capacity requirements in localized areas. The

provider offers at time t such a RAN to a certain number M ( t )
of tenants, so that the tenants' customers can get access to the
tenant's service. Let denote as Di(,tm) the traffic demand (in
Mbps) of tenant m in SC i at time t , calculated as the sum of
the traffic from all the users attached to SC i. The tenants'
traffic Di(,tm) can be aggregated into a new variable, Di( t ) ,
which provides the total traffic demand in SC i, i.e.:
M (t )

D   Di(,tm) .
(t )
i

(1)

m 1

Let also d u( t, m) be the traffic demand (in Mbps) of tenant m in
the u th pixel of the scenario ( u U ). The metric du( t ) is
computed in a similar way to (1) in order to determine the total
traffic at the pixel-level.
The geographical area of interest is divided into a set U of
grid points, called pixels. A subset U C  U of these locations
are candidate site locations for SCs. A typical placement of a
SC site is below rooftops. However, in many cases, the
selection of potential sites depends on how easily they can be
acquired and backhauled, e.g. if there exists line of sight to a
nearby hub. In this respect, an adequate filter of unaffordable
site locations to determine the subset UC will reduce
computational complexity of the later planning process.
Finally, let U S( t )  U C be the subset of site locations with
deployed SCs at time t .
The transmit power and the allocated bandwidth of the ith
SC are denoted by Pi (t ) and Bi(t ) , respectively. The transmit
power is configured such that it provides a certain Signal-toInterference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the targeted coverage
range [36]. With respect to the carrier frequency, SCs are
assumed to be deployed in higher frequencies than the 1~2
GHz, such as e.g. the 5 GHz considered by the 3GPP as a
feasible solution [36]. The frequency band is partitioned into a
set F   f1 ,..., f K  of K orthogonal channels of bandwidth B.

In a similar way, Bi(t ) represents the required bandwidth on a
cell basis.
IV. FUNCT IONAL A RCHIT ECT URE
This section focuses on elaborating a reference framework
for multi-tenant management from the perspective of network
planning. The proposed model is depicted in Fig. 1. The
network, represented in the bottom of the figure, is
characterized by the network configuration, which is given by
U S( t ) and Fi ( t ) . The network performance can be seen as a
source of relevant information for the planning process. In
particular, it provides a collection of metrics related to the past
and actual traffic demand and also to the quality of the offered
services. The information can be given at either the SC-level or
pixel-level. In the former case, the metrics are derived from cell
counters and they are typically known as Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs). In the latter case, the information is derived
from call traces, which contain geo-located measurements from
users.
The functional architecture of Fig. 1 includes two main
entities described in the following. These entities can be part of
the management systems such as the Element Manager (EM)
or the Network Manager (NM) [37].
A. Multi-tenancy management entity
The multi-tenancy management entity acts as an interface
between the tenants and the network planning tool of the
network provider. From the perspective of planning, the SLA
defines the contracted capacity Aˆ m (in Mbps) that tenant m
demands to the network provider. Normally, it is expressed in
terms of aggregate (or average) values over relatively coarse
time and space scales. The SLA may also include some other

The subset of channels allocated to SC i at time t is given by
Fi (t )  F . Therefore, the total bandwidth allocated to SC i is
expressed as Bi(t )  Fi (t )  B , where  denotes cardinality.
The capacity of SC i is given by:
(t )

Ci(t )  Bi(t )  SE i ,

(2)

(t )

where SE i
represents the average spectral efficiency
achievable at SC i. In general, the spectral efficiency depends
on the radio access technology and the SINR conditions.
To determine areas in the network with a lack of capacity
and areas with spare capacity, the required bandwidth becomes
a key metric in the planning process. Specifically, this metric at
the pixel-level can be determined from the traffic demand and
the spectral efficiency as follows:

guarantees, e.g. related to QoS metrics.
For network planning purposes, the SLA has to be
expressed in smaller time and space scales that can be more
easily used when taking planning decisions . In particular, the

other tenants' traffic demand as follows:

contracted capacity Aˆ m is translated into a set of detailed

Regarding the spatial variations of the traffic demand, the
contracted capacity at the busy hour Am( tB ) is distributed among

planning specifications Am( t,)i that depend on SC i and time t .
To do this, the current or predicted traffic demand in the
network can be employed. This process, which ensures that the
contracted capacity is provided, depends exclusively on the
network provider's side. As a consequence, the SLA is
simplified and tenants are excluded from gaining a detailed
picture of the network infrastructure.
Each time a set of detailed planning specifications are
generated, the multi-tenancy management entity sends this
information to the self-planning entity, which will use them to
determine whether the infrastructure needs to be updated or
not. This situation typically occurs when a new tenant is
aggregated or an ongoing tenant updates the SLA. In the
former case, the traffic demand of the tenant is unknown, while
in the latter case it depends on the geographical area where the
contracted capacity is modified. For example, if an ongoing
tenant extends its service coverage (e.g. according to business
plans) to a new geographical area that is owned by the
infrastructure provider, the traffic demand of the tenant in this
area is unknown. On the contrary, if the tenant modifies the
contracted capacity (i.e. due to an increase in traffic demand)
within the limits of the current service coverage area, the
temporal and spatial distributions of the traffic demand are
already known in this case.
Depending on whether the traffic demand of the tenant is
unknown or not, the detailed planning specifications are
generated in a different way.
(t )

In the first case (i.e. traffic demand is unknown), Am ,i is
calculated based on the temporal and spatial variations of the
traffic demand from other tenants. Specifically, the temporal
variation of the traffic demand is mainly given by the traffic
fluctuations that take place over one day's time. Such a
temporal pattern is typically repeated over different days. An
example sequence of total tenants' traffic demand D ( t ) during
several days is illustrated in Fig. 2, where T stands for the
one-day period and tB is the busy hour. Based on this, let Am( tB )
be the detailed planning specification at the busy hour, which
can be estimated from Aˆ m and from the time variations of the

following condition:

(5)

iU S( t )

where Am( t,Bi ) is the contribution of the contracted capacity in SC
i. Depending on the spatial correlation that can be expected
between the tenant's traffic demand and the actual network's
traffic demand, the detailed planning specifications per cell for
tenant m can be formulated in different ways:
 Uniform distribution. In case that the spatial traffic
demand of the new tenant is unknown, an even
distribution of traffic is assumed. Estimation can be
conducted at the SC-level (6) or pixel-level (7):

Am(t,Bi ) 

Am(tB )
,
U S(t )

(6)

Am( t,Bu) 

Am( tB )
,
U

(7)

where Am( t,Bu) stands for the contracted capacity at the u th
pixel and U is the total number of pixels in the area. If
uniform distribution at the SC-level is adopted, the values
of Am( t,Bu) at pixel u are obtained considering a uniform
distribution of traffic within the service area of the
corresponding SC. On the other hand, when estimation is
at the pixel-level, the value of Am( t,Bi ) in SC i is obtained
from aggregating the values of Am( t,Bu) only for pixels
served by SC i. Note that this value may be different to
that obtained from using (6).
 Correlated distribution. In case that the correlation
between the traffic demand for the new tenant and the
already existing tenants is expected, areas with higher
traffic demand of other tenants will receive a greater
contribution of Am( tB ) . Such an estimation can also be
conducted at either SC- or pixel-level. In the former case,
using the information on KPIs that measure Di( tB ) in SC i
as an estimation of the spatial traffic demand of tenant m,
the detailed planning specification is given by:

Am(t,Bi )  Am( tB ) 

Di(tB )
.
 Dp(tB )

Fig. 2. Example of normalized traffic demand over three days.

In the latter case, the traffic measurements at the pixellevel are taken from call traces that provide geo-located
information for each user in an automatic way. Thus, the
specification is calculated as:

Am( t,Bu)  Am( tB ) 

du( tB )
,
 dv(tB )

(9)

vU ( t )
( tB )
u

where d
is the total traffic demand in the u th pixel of
the scenario.
In the second case (i.e. traffic demand is known), the
temporal and spatial variations of the traffic demand of tenant
m are considered for the generation of the detailed planning
specifications over such domains. In particular, if the traffic
demand is given at the SC-level, Di( tB ) is replaced by Di(,tmB ) in
(8). If, on the contrary, the traffic demand is given at the pixellevel, du( tB ) is replaced by d u( t,Bm) in (9).
B. Self-planning entity
According to Fig. 1, the detailed planning specifications,
Am( t,)i , are used by the self-planning entity, whose aim is
twofold. The first objective is to check whether or not the
deployed network capacity fits the tenants' demand. The
second is to provide the required changes in the network layout
and channel allocation, given by U S( t 1) and Fi ( t 1)
respectively, in case there is a lack of capacity. The selfplanning entity follows an automated approach characterized
by running an iterative process that is executed during the
network operation assuming that a set of SCs have already
been deployed. Thus, the currently deployed infrastructure is
incrementally adapted to the evolving tenants' requirements to
make capacity expansion smoother, less costly and faster. The
proposed approach is applied to smaller regions that are
covered by a subset (or cluster) of SCs, so that dimensioning
and planning tasks are accelerated and simplified. As a result,
dimensioning and planning can be regarded as an automated
function that can be easily integrated into the SON framework.
This approach contrasts with the traditional planning, which
employs longer timescales to accommodate larger capacity
needs over the whole network's geographical area.
Nevertheless, both traditional and SON-based planning are
complementary approaches to drive network expansion at
different time scales.
1) Capacity conformance monitoring
This module watches over the network to determine when
the network infrastructure has to be reconfigured in order t o
meet the tenant's traffic demand while minimizing overprovisioning. The required bandwidth in the SCs can vary due
to high tenant's actual traffic demand Di(,tm) , the addition or
(t )

removal of new tenants (i.e. variations in M ) or changes in
the planning specification Am( t,)i . Also, if the process is executed
proactively, the predicted traffic demand can be considered. To
this end, the traffic forecasting entity provides the predicted
traffic demand in time t at the SC-level (which can be
computed from historical data using statistical models ) as input
in the self-planning entity. The proactive response is key as
long as the deployment of new infrastructure may require
substantial time compared to the evolution of the traffic
demand. Thus, the traffic forecasting entity predicts the traffic
growths on a relatively long-term time scale (e.g. weeks,

months). As a result, the system is able to anticipate the need
for more SCs and/or spectrum.
The capacity conformance is conducted in terms of the

where   [0,1] is an adjustable parameter that determines the
ability to support some variations in the traffic demand with
( tB )
respect to the estimated value. Note that an increase in B%
i
does not always trigger the condition in (14), since there can be
spare capacity in the SCs. This situation can occur when: (i) the
network capacity has been intentionally overprovisioned; (ii)
the traffic demand has been overestimated when planning
tenants for the first time; (iii) the traffic demand of any tenant
has decreased over time; or (iv) a certain SLA has been
modified.
Lastly, note that, if the total traffic demand of any tenant
exceeds the contracted capacity, the capacity conformance

monitoring module should communicate the multi-tenancy
management entity the need of reviewing (or negotiating) the
SLA in order to meet the traffic demand.
2) Capacity dimensioning and planning
This module aims to determine the optimal solution (i.e. an
updated RAN) to cope with the varying traffic demand. A
candidate solution is represented by Uˆ S( t ) and Fˆi ( t ) , which
represent a modified version of the actual network deployment
and spectrum allocation, respectively. The required bandwidth
of the candidate solution, Bˆi( t ) , is obtained from the network
performance model, which emulates the behavior of the
network with a certain layout and configuration. Unlike the SC
bandwidth (measured in steps of

B MHz), Bˆi(t )

the area of interest, K max is the maximum number of channels
that can be allocated in a SC and  ,   [0,1] are adjustable
parameters. In detail, in steps 1-20, the planning process
focuses on extending the capacity in areas with a lack of
capacity, while in steps 21 to 31, this process aims at
minimizing the capacity overprovisioning. Note that actions
such as removing channels or SCs where traffic has decreased
significantly may result in reduced interference, increased
quality and/or capacity. During the execution of this process, a
certain planning action (e.g. adding a channel) can be canceled
due to the execution of the opposite action (e.g. removing a
channel) depending on the actions carried out between the two
(e.g. a channel added in steps 1-6 may no longer be needed if a
SC is later on added in steps 7-20). The channel selection in a
SC is performed so that the SC-to-SC distance between the
given SC and the closest neighboring SC using the same
channel is the maximum possible. This process is summarized
in Algorithm 2. In addition, when a planning action is selected
the network performance model is launched to obtain the value

The dimensioning and planning is modeled as an iterative
process, initiated after satisfying (14), where a set of conditions
are sequentially checked at each time step in order to trigger
specific planning actions (i.e. adding/removing a channel and
deploying/relocating a SC). Such actions are accumulated
during the planning process and, after that, the infrastructure
provider is notified about the changes in the network to be
implemented. The execution of planning actions depends on
the limited budget of possible network changes that can be
taken in a specific period. This means that the infrastructure
provider is responsible for deciding when communicating the
changes to the infrastructure deployment team according to
other regulation and economic factors. Such a problem has
been studied in [28].

Algorithm 1 is designed such that the deployment of new
SCs is carried out gradually as the traffic demand grows and
new channels are allocated. According to this, as the number of
deployed SCs gets closer to the saturation point (given by
SC
), the threshold in the first condition of step 8 that
U S(t)  N max

is used to deploy new SCs approaches the value of maximum
amount of allocable bandwidth in a SC (i.e. K max  B ).
Regarding the computational complexity of Algorithm 1, it
is worth highlighting that, as long as the dimensioning and
planning are rather long-term processes, computational
complexity is not a first-order requirement to consider.
However, to limit the complexity when the number of SCs
increases, the considered geographical area could be divided
into smaller regions so that Algorithm 1 is applied to each of
them independently.
From an economic perspective, each kind of planning
action entails a different cost for the infrastructure provider. In
particular, adding or removing channels represents the cheapest
solution since it can be executed remotely. On the opposite side
is the deployment of new SCs, which requires investing on new
infrastructure. The infrastructure provider can be interested in
balancing the priority of these two planning actions according
to its financial objectives . This can be done in the proposed
SC

algorithm by tuning N max , which is the parameter that has a
direct impact on the deployment costs.

3) Network performance model
To evaluate the candidate solutions, a network performance
model is required. The objective of this model is to compute
the required bandwidth in the network to satisfy a certain
traffic demand. As observed in Fig. 1, the inputs of the model
are the traffic demand (either actual or predicted), the average
spectral efficiency and the candidate network configuration.
In the model, the transmit power Pˆ ( t ) for each SC of the

function of the inter-site distance (ISD), which is given by the
distance to the closest adjacent SC.

too low value of this parameter should be avoided since it
entails a waste of spectrum and an increased cost due to a faster
deployment of SCs.
The parameters  and  determine the amount of spare
capacity that is retained by the infrastructure provider in the
SCs e.g. to absorb eventual peaks of traffic demand. They are
jointly configured to avoid recursive channel allocations and
releases in the SCs.
Lastly, the parameter  establishes the sensitivity of the
planning action related to relocation of SCs that support
marginal amount of traffic. This situation happens, for
example, when a tenant's contract expires leaving a large
amount of spare capacity in the SCs.

The parameter K max is also adjustable and it determines the
interference levels that are allowed in the network. For
example, by setting the maximum value, all the SCs can use all
the channels. However, a high value of this parameter may not
be recommended as it would result in excessive interference
levels, making the solution spectrally inefficient. Likewise, a

The users are served by the SC from which they receive the
strongest received power. In this way, the function ˆ ( t ) (u )
returns the SC that serves the users in pixel u (i.e. it defines the

PERFORMANCE EVALUAT ION

A. Simulation scenario
An urban SC scenario with dimensions 0.4 km × 0.4 km
and a grid resolution of 5 m has been considered. To represent
the areas where deploying SCs is possible, e.g. no backhaul and
site acquisition constraints, 2% of the points (or pixels) in the
scenario have been randomly selected as candidate site
locations. The actual network layout and the traffic demand at
the busy hour in the situation before the consideration of the
new tenant are represented in Fig. 3, where the triangles
represent the location of the three deployed SCs and the values
in brackets are the number of allocated channels. Color scale
indicates the traffic demand density, which is non-uniformly
distributed over the considered area. The traffic demands
supported by SCs 1-3 are 8.8, 5.6 and 5.0 Mbps, respectively.
The network performance model has been implemented
according to Section IV.B. Table I summarizes the main
parameters of this model. The transmit power Pi (t ) is

T ABLE I. SIMULATION P ARAMETERS

From a network planning perspective, the parameters used
in the capacity conformance monitoring module to trigger the
planning actions are configured as :   0.95 ,   0.7 and
  0.05 . Parameter  is configured assuming moderate
traffic variations over the expected values. However,
depending on the provider's deployment policies, this
parameter can be configured with a lower value in order to
provide higher levels of spare capacity in the SCs and thus
leaving some room for coping with unexpected traffic
variations. Regarding parameters  and  , a reasonable
configuration of such parameters has been considered in this
work to react to traffic variations while, at the same time,
limiting the number of "re-planning" actions and targeting an
efficient resource utilization. In addition, the maximum number
of allocated channels per SC is set to K max  3 , while the
maximum number of SCs that can be deployed in the
SC
considered area is set to N max
 10 .
B. Analysis of the network planning solutions
Let assume that the SLA of the new tenant is translated to a
specification at the busy hour of Am( tB )  100 Mbps. At this
initial stage, the new tenant's spatial traffic demand distribution
is assumed to be unknown, so the planning is carried out using

methods, additional SCs are not required in the service area of
SC 3 because a lower traffic density is assumed in this region.

Fig. 4. Network deployment and estimated traffic demand using the detailed
planning specifications: (a) Based on uniform distribution at the SC-level,
(b) Based on correlated distribution at the SC-level, (c) Based on uniform
distribution at the pixel-level, and (d) Based on correlated distribution at
the pixel-level.

the detailed planning specifications from the methods
explained in Section IV.A. Thus, the total traffic demand is
calculated as the actual traffic demand from existing tenants
plus the estimated new tenant's demand. After generating the
detailed planning specifications, it is observed that in the
capacity conformance monitoring module condition (14) is
satisfied for the three deployed SCs, so that the capacity
dimensioning and planning module is launched.
Fig. 4(a-d) show the results of the planning process for
different sets of detailed planning specifications corresponding
to the methods of Section IV.A.
For the uniform distribution at the SC-level method, Fig.
4(a) shows that, given that SC 2 has the smallest service area,
the traffic demand per pixel in this SC is estimated to be
slightly higher than in SC 1 and 3. Then, the capacity
dimensioning and planning module adds 6 new SCs, three of
which are located in the right upper corner of the scenario,
where the traffic density is higher.
The correlated distribution at the SC-level method is
represented in Fig. 4(b). This method estimates that SC 3,
which initially carried less traffic (i.e. 5.0 Mbps), is the cell that
receives proportionally less traffic from the new tenant.
Therefore, compared to the method of Fig. 4(a), additional SCs
such as SC 9 are not required in the service area of SC 3.
Instead, the number of channels allocated to SC 3 is increased
by one.
For the method based on uniform distribution at the pixellevel, illustrated in Fig. 4(c), the results are quite similar to the
first method since both methods approximate the uniform
distribution. The only difference is that SC 4 is placed a bit
more to the right.
The last method [see Fig. 4(d)], based on correlated
distribution at the pixel-level, produces the largest variations in
the traffic demand per pixel. Consequently, SCs 5 and 7 are
placed in, or close to, the area with high traffic density, so that
part of the traffic is offloaded from SC 1, having this cell three
channels allocated after the planning. Besides, unlike other

C. Analysis of the network operation with the new tenant
This section evaluates the solutions of the planning
algorithm when the new tenant's service is operative and the
actual traffic demand at the busy hour of the new tenant is
spatially distributed as illustrated in Fig. 5, where two cases are
distinguished. In the former [Fig. 5(a)], the new tenant's spatial
traffic demand exhibits quite high correlation with already
existing tenants, whose spatial traffic distribution is represented
in Fig. 3. Specifically, using Pearson's coefficient, both traffic
distributions are 90% correlated. In the latter case [Fig. 5(b)],
the distributions are only 15% correlated.
Let assume now that the network has been deployed as
dictated by the planning [i.e. with the real network layouts as
illustrated in Fig. 4(a-d)] and let consider the real traffic
demand of the new tenant shown in Fig. 5. In that case, Table
(t )
II shows the required bandwidth B%
and the cell bandwidth
i

B in each SC considering the actual traffic demand for the two
levels of correlation with the different planning methods . The
last row in the table shows values aggregated over all the SCs.
The notation in the table is X/Y where X represents the
required bandwidth and Y the cell bandwidth. As a reference
for comparison with the methods discussed in Fig. 4, the table
also includes the result of the network planning taking as input
the real traffic of the new tenant (shown in Fig. 5). The
deployments for this case are shown in Fig. 6.
In general, the method that fits better the traffic demand (in
this case, the reference approach) will minimize the required
resources without generating a loss of traffic. However,
according to Table II, this does not necessarily mean a lower
value of total required bandwidth. For example, the methods
based on uniform distribution provide the lowest values;
however, this happens because these methods deploy a greater
number of SCs in the scenario, as reflected in Fig. 4(a) and (c).
Given the minimum number of deployed SCs (i.e. 8), the
reference case obtains the lowest value of total required
bandwidth. With respect to the methods based on correlated
distribution, the method with SC-level resolution results in a
lower total required bandwidth since its network layout is more
similar to the reference case, as previously stated. Regarding
the two methods based on uniform distribution, the results in
terms of required bandwidth are very close to each other
because of the similarity of their network layouts.
Another aspect from Table II (see numbers highlighted in
bold) is that the required bandwidth in some SCs exceeds (or
nearly exceeds) the cell bandwidth, meaning that some traffic

traffic demand; (b) 15% correlated with network's traffic demand.

Fig. 6. Network deployment with real tenant's traffic demand for: (a) 90%
correlated traffic; (b) 15% correlated traffic.

might be lost. These cases are more evident in the case of 15%
correlated traffic due to the poorer match between the network
layout and the spatial distribution of traffic demand. In the case
of 90% correlated traffic, only the methods based on correlated
distribution provide insufficient bandwidth or they are close to
it. However, this lack of bandwidth (about 1 MHz) is marginal
compared to the channel bandwidth. In addition, the
deployment has been carried out with only 8 SCs, so that the
cost of the solution is cheaper than other methods.

it by one.
With respect to the methods based on correlated
distribution, Fig. 7 shows the network layout after the replanning process for 90% and 15% correlated traffic. As
observed, both the network layout and bandwidth assignment
have changed. In case of 90% correlated traffic [Fig. 7(a) and
(b)], a new SC (i.e. SC9) is deployed in the left upper side of
the scenario to relieve traffic from congested SCs. This new SC
also produces changes in the bandwidth assignment, which can
be observed by comparing the numbers in parentheses in Fig.
4(b) and (d) with those of Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. In
total, there are three changes (i.e. adding or removing a
channel) in each case.
In case of 15% correlated traffic [Fig. 7(c) and (d)], a new
SC (i.e. SC9) is deployed in the center of the scenario, where
the traffic density is higher. With respect to the channel
assignment, the changes can be observed by comparing Fig.
4(b) and (d) with Fig. 7(c) and (d), respectively.
Table III shows a comparative analysis between the
network layouts before and after the re-planning process for
each analyzed method. For a high level of correlated traffic
(90%), the best methods (without considering the reference) are
the two based on correlated distribution, since they utilize the
lowest number of channels (i.e. 15 and 17), provided that the
number of deployed SCs is 9 for all methods. Note that these
two solutions are achieved through a two-step process that
comprises planning and re-planning (where an additional SC is
deployed). If the method employs pixel-level resolution, there
is also a bandwidth shortage (about 1 MHz), which might lead
to a small loss of traffic. For this reason, the method based on
correlated distribution at the SC-level is a better solution when
the new tenant's traffic is not fully correlated with already
existing tenants.
For a low level of correlated traffic (15%), it is observed
that all the methods result in bandwidth shortage before the replanning stage, since the network layouts do not fit properly the
traffic demand. Such an effect is more pronounced for the
methods based on correlated distribution, especially when

D. Re-planning the new tenant during tenant's operation
Once the new tenant's service is operative, condition (14) is
evaluated again to determine whether there exists a lack of
capacity or not. If so, the capacity dimensioning and planning
module is relaunched to provide a new network configuration.
In our experiment, this happens for the SCs whose statistics in
Table II are represented in bold.
For the methods based on uniform distribution, it is noted
that, in case of 90% correlated traffic, there is no lack of
capacity. However, in case of 15% correlated traffic, SC 7
satisfies condition (14) and therefore a new planning stage is
launched. As a result of the re-planning process, it is obtained
that the network layout is not modified, but SCs 4 and 7
increase the number of channels by one, while SC 9 decreases

correlated traffic, method based on correlated distribution at the SC-level;
(b) 90% correlated traffic, method based on correlated distribution at the
pixel-level: (c) 15% correlated traffic, method based on correlated
distribution at the SC-level; (d) 15% correlated traffic, method based on
correlated distribution at the pixel-level.

pixel-level resolution is used. In this latter case, because of the
bad traffic estimation, the number of channels assigned after
re-planning represents the worst case (i.e. 20). In case of the
SC-level resolution, there is a bandwidth shortage of 15 MHz.
However, this method eliminates the lack of bandwidth by
adding a new SC in an optimal location during the re-planning
phase, while the other methods that previously deployed more
SCs are unable to improve the solution.
It is clear that the pixel-level methods do not leverage the
higher spatial resolution when the traffic correlation is low, as
they have to employ the greatest number of channels. Thus, the
best methods (excluding the reference) in terms of minimum
number of channels are the two methods with SC-level
resolution. An important difference between them is the
amount of traffic that could be lost before the re-planning
stage. Thus, although one method requires less amount of
resources, it might lead to higher traffic losses.

T ABLE III. NETWORK DEP LOYMENT BEFORE AND AFTER RE - P LANNING

E. Comparison with the state-of-the-art
As explained in Section II, various approaches to solve the
RNP problem have been proposed in the literature. In this
paper, the selected approach, summarized in Algorithm 1, is
based on an iterative approach where a certain planning action
(such as deploying a new SC or adding a channel) is executed
at each step. Previous works based on iterative approach [2021] reduce the set of planning actions at each step to
determining the location of the SC ([20]) and, optionally, in
heterogeneous networks, selecting the optimal bandwidth
allocation with respect to the macrocell layer ([21]). However,
the problem of bandwidth allocation in the SC layer (i.e. with
respect other SCs) has not been addressed in those works.
Based on the above considerations, a state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method has been developed to compare the
performance with the proposed Algorithm 1. Specifically, the
SOTA method implements the iterative approach in [20-21].
Unlike Algorithm 1, this method only comprises the planning
action of deploying a new SC. Since the actions of adding or
removing a channel are not available during the planning
process, the number of allocated channels per SC must be
constant. Lastly, channel selection is performed according to
Algorithm 2.

The SOTA method has been evaluated under two distinct
contexts. One takes as input the real traffic of the new tenant in
the same way that Algorithm 1 was evaluated as a reference in
Section V.C (see Table II). The other combines Algorithm 1
with the best planning method of Section IV.A used to derive
the detailed planning specifications. According to the
evaluations in Section V.A-D, the best solution corresponds to
the method based on correlated distribution at the SC-level,
since it employed the least amount of network resources. The
study has been performed with two different values of the
number of channels per SC, i.e. 2 and 3 channels. This
constraint is only applied to the newly deployed SCs in the
scenario, because the SOTA method does not consider the
possibility of changing the number of allocated channels in
existing SCs. In addition, evaluations are carried out for the
two levels of traffic correlation (90 and 15%) used in previous
sections.
Table IV shows the required bandwidth and the cell
bandwidth in each SC for the SOTA method under the aboveexplained conditions (the notation is the same as in Table II).
The values in the table correspond to the situation when the
updated network is operative and carries actual traffic from the
new tenant. Compared to Algorithm 1 (see Table II), it is
observed that, in general, the number of SCs is larger with the
SOTA method. In addition, since the same (constant)
bandwidth is allocated for all the newly deployed SCs, the total
number of allocated channels is also larger. This highlights that
the possibility of changing the number of channels per SC (e.g.
by considering a larger set of possible planning actions to
choose from as in Algorithm 1) is much more effective than
limiting the cell bandwidth to a constant value and just
considering the addition of new SCs as in the SOTA method . A
closer look at Table IV reveals that, when three channels per
SC are allocated, the SOTA method based on correlated
distribution at the SC-level employs, as expected, a larger
amount of resources (10 SCs) than if the actual traffic is known
(8-9 SCs). However, when the cell bandwidth is limited to two
channels, the amount of resources in both cases is the same (10
SCs). In turn, the method proposed in this paper is able to
support the traffic with only 8 SCs (see Table II), thus
outperforming the SOTA method with both 2 and 3 channels.
VI.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, the cell planning problem for small cell multitenant networks has been studied. From the perspective of
infrastructure providers, the automation of procedures is a key
consideration due to the complexity of managing diverse
tenants' capacity requirements. In the proposed scheme, these
requirements are translated into a set of detailed planning
specifications over the spatial/temporal domains . Then, the
planning process is modeled following a SON approach, where
a condition to detect capacity issues is periodically checked in
order to trigger particular planning actions, such as
adding/removing a channel or deploying/relocating a SC.
The proposed framework has been evaluated in a scenario
in which a new tenant is added in the network. To derive the
set of planning specifications of the new tenant, different
methods are considered depending on the expected correlation
with the actual traffic demand in the network and the spatial
resolution of the traffic measurements. The evaluation has been

carried out for two different traffic correlation levels. Results
show that the detailed planning specifications based on
correlated distribution with a spatial resolution at the SC-level
employ the least amount of network resources. This is because
the differences between the estimated and actual traffic demand
make the use of higher spatial resolutions less effective. The
specifications based on uniform distribution require a larger
amount of resources to meet the traffic demand even if the new
tenant's traffic and network's traffic are poorly correlated. In
addition, the proposed capacity and dimens ioning scheme
(Algorithm 1) has been compared with existing planning
solutions, which do not consider the spectrum planning in the
SC-layer. Results show that the existing solutions require a
larger number of deployed SCs for serving the same traffic
than the proposed approach.

T ABLE IV. ACTUAL REQ . BW [MHZ] AND CELL BW [MHZ] FOR SOT A
METHOD

As future work, it is planned to further analyze the
proposed planning methodology for ongoing tenants whose
traffic demand varies significantly over time. In particular,
when the traffic demand of a certain tenant decreases, planning
actions such as channel releases and SC relocations become
effective solutions to minimize capacity over-provisioning in
the network. In addition, more sophisticated combinatory
optimization will be investigated for solving the problem.
