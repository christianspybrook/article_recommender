Abstract
The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid
model with a non-Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle
and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon
system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence.
The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago,
which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not
be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark
matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 × 10-22 s-1m-1.
This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration
rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2.

1. Introduction

The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth-Moon system is that
the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the
Earth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the
formation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well
known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth's rotation and Moon's
rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes.
However, based on tidal friction model and the current Moon-Earth system data, the tidal
friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the
past because the Moon was closer, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the
Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in
1 to 2 billion years ago. This, however, never happened. Furthermore, geological
evidence indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present
rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Based on tidal friction models, it
must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we
would deduce on the basis of present-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called
"geological time scale difficulty" or "Lunar crisis" and is one of the main arguments by
creationists against the tidal friction theory (Brush 1983). Various models were proposed
in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on tidal friction
mechanism to avoid this difficulty and put the Moon at quite a comfortable distance from
Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray et al. 1999,
Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal
dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the
response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal
friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about
geological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and
many parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with timedependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully
adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence.

In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society,
University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model
(Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with
this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth
system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions
about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of
the Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the
author's knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model.
2. Invisible matter
In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is
about 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently
invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an antigravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster.
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis,
then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of
such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current
Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian
physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis,
then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in
everywhere of the universe (the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to
place); in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible
matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible
matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter.
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis,
then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the
detection limit of the current technology; otherwise, it would be detected long time ago
with such dominant amount.

With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the
dark matter field fluid model with non-Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible
matter (dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms) is called dark matter here.
3. The dark matter field fluid model
In this proposed model, it is assumed that:
1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly
filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the
celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property; it can
interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties; therefore, it can have
energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body.
2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter
field fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary
"baryonic" matter; i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter
field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the
manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter
field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with
the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the
celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the
gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive
force is unknown.
With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may
influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The
common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes's law, a rigid non-

4

permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds
number experiences a resistance force F
F = −6πμrv

(1)

where v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity
constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the
velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual
properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F
may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the
mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of
both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is
assumed to be of the scaled form
F = −6πηr 1−n mv

(2)

where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be
viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and η
is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to μ. The direction of the
resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force
described by Eq. 2 is velocity-dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to
Newton's second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is
dv
= −6πηr 1− n mv
dt

(3)

v = v0 exp( −6πηr 1−n vt )

(4)

m

Then

5

where v0 is the initial velocity (t = 0) of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a
massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the
gravitational center: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and
(3) the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the
orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center.
However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is
stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from
the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is
sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and
centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively
slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be
approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is
GMm mv 2
=
R
R2

(5)

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is
the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields
R=

GM
exp(12πηr 1− n t )
2
v0

(6)

or
R = R0 exp(12πηr 1− n t )

(7)

where
R0 =

GM
v02

(8)

6

R0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center. Note that R exponentially increases
with time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive
force of dark matter field fluid. The recessional rate of the sphere is
dR
= 12πηr 1− n R
dt

(9)

The acceleration of the recession is

(

d 2R
= 12πηr 1− n R .

dt

(10)

The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the
gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster.
According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating
about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere
is
T = −8πμr 3ω

(11)

where ω is the angular velocity of the sphere. The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is
opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent
dark matter field fluid with angular velocity ω, similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted
on the sphere is

( )

T = −8πη r 1− n mω
3

(12)

The direction of the torque in Eq. 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The
torque causes the negative angular acceleration
T =I

dω
dt

(13)

where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid

I=

(14)

Therefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is
dω
= −20πηr 1− nω
dt

(15)

Solving this equation yields

ω = ω 0 exp( −20πηr 1− n t )

(16)

where ω0 is the initial angular velocity. One can see that the angular velocity of the
sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to
its angular velocity.
For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields

1 dω
ω dt = − 5 = −1.67

(17)

The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and
undetermined parameters; therefore, it is a critical test for this model.
For two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq.

4. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model

The Moon-Earth system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is
complex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also
interactions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as
an isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets
on the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is
assumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other.
In addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is small enough to be ignored. The data
about the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994, and Lang, 1992) are
listed below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may
vary slightly with different data sources.
Moon:
Mean radius: r = 1738.0 km
Mass:

m = 7.3483 × 1025 gram

Rotation period = 27.321661 days
Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 × 10-6 rad s-1
Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km
Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1
Orbit eccentricity e = 0.0549
Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 ± 0.5 arcsec century-2
= (-1.255 ± 0.024) × 10-4 rad century-2
= (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2
Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 ± 0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 ± 0.02) × 10-9 m s-1

9

Earth:
Mean radius: r = 6371.0 km
Mass:

m = 5.9742 × 1027 gram

Rotation period = 23 h 56m 04.098904s = 86164.098904s
Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 × 10-5 rad s-1
Mean distance to the Sun Rm= 149,597,870.61 km
Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1
Angular acceleration of Earth = (-5.5 ± 0.5) × 10-22 rad s-2
The Moon's angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth
(receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey
et .al., 1994). By inserting the data of the Moon's rotation and recession into Eq. 17, the
result is
− 1.26 × 10 −23 × 3.92509 × 10 8
= −1.54 ± 0.039
1.21 × 10 −9 × 2.662 × 10 − 6

(19)

The distance R in Eq. 19 is from the Moon's center to the Earth's center and the number
384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the Moon's surface to the Earth's surface.
Eq. 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of -1.67. The result is in accord
with the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of -1.54 and 1.67 may come from several sources:
1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle
2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere.
3. The effect from Sun and other planets.
4. Errors in data.
5. Possible other unknown reasons.

10

The two parameters n and η in Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 can be determined with two data
sets. The third data set can be used to further test the model. If this model correctly
describes the situation at hand, it should give consistent results for different motions. The
values of n and η calculated from three different data sets are listed below (Note, the
mean distance of the Moon to the Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the Earth are
used in the calculation).
The value of n:

n = 0.64

From the Moon's rotation: η = 4.27 × 10-22 s-1 m-1
From the Earth's rotation:

η = 4.26 × 10-22 s-1 m-1

From the Moon's recession: η = 4.64 × 10-22 s-1 m-1
One can see that the three values of η are consistent within the range of error in the data.
The average value of η: η = (4.39 ± 0.22) × 10-22 s-1 m-1
By inserting the data of the Earth's rotation, the Moon's recession and the value of n into
Eq. 18, the result is
− 5.5 × 10 −22 × 3.92509 × 10 8 ⎛ 1738000 ⎞
⎟
⎜
7.29 × 10 −5 × 1.21 × 10 −9 ⎝ 6371000 ⎠

(1− 0.64 )

= −1.53 ± 0.14

(20)

This is also in accord with the model used here.
The dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field
fluid is -1.11 × 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between
the Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 × 1020 N; and the torque exerted by the dark matter field
fluid on the Earth's and the Moon's rotations is T = -5.49 × 1016 Nm and -1.15 × 1012 Nm,
respectively.

5. The evolution of Earth-Moon system

Sonett et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was
about 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al.,
1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day
was about 19.2 hours, this agrees very well with Sonett et al.'s result. Based on the dark
matter field fluid model, and the above result, the closest distance (center to center) of the
Moon to the Earth was about 259000 km or about two-thirds of current distance at 4.5
billion years ago, this is far beyond the Roche's limit. This number agrees closely with
some of earlier Moon-Earth models. The closest distance of the Moon to the Earth by
Hansen's models was about 38 Earth radii or 242000 km (Hansen, 1982). According to
this model, the length of day of the Earth was about 8 hours at 4.5 billion years ago. Fig.
1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the length of day of the
Earth with the age of the Earth-Moon system described by this model along with data
from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One can see that those
data fit this model very well in their time range.
Fig. 2 shows the geological data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from
Sonett et al. (1996) and the description (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model
for past 900 million years. One can see that the model agrees with the geological and
fossil data beautifully.
The important difference of this model with early models in describing the early
evolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this model is based only on current data of the
Moon-Earth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth
rotation and continental drifting. Based on this model, the Earth-Moon system has been

12

smoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate
of the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description does not take it into
account that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly
significant changes in the motions of the Earth and the Moon, such as strong impacts by
giant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very common in the universe.
The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model
agrees with geological evidence. Based on Eq. 9, the recessional rate exponentially
increases with time. One may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become
very large. The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be
3.04 × 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 × 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years.
However, whether the Moon's recession will continue or at some time later another
mechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction
does affect the evolution of the Earth itself such as the surface crust structure, continental
drifting and evolution of bio-system, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earth's
rotation, however, such role is not a dominant mechanism.
Unfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital
motion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results,
the recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 × 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km
century-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is
-1.8 × 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of the Sun and the stable environment on
the Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length
of the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as
some other evidences) suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the

13

year over the billion years and the Earth's orbital motion is more stable than its rotation.
This suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same
direction and similar speed of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital range). Therefore, the
Earth's orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter
field fluid. However, this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify
if this is the case.
6. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars

The Moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface, even there is no air, therefore,
there is no ocean-like tidal friction force to slow its rotation; however, the rotation of the
Moon is still slowing at significant rate of (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2, which agrees
the model very well. Based on this, one may reasonably think that the Mars's rotation
should be slowing also.
The Mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted human's great attention
since ancient time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades.
NASA, Russian and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect
data and study this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about the
history of this planet to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth, the Mars rotates about
its central axis and revolves around the Sun, however, the Mars does not have a massive
moon circulating it (Mars has two small satellites: Phobos and Deimos) and there is no
liquid fluid on its surface, therefore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal friction force to
slow its rotation by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and current the
Mars's data, this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the Mars should be about
-4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the

14

solar days/Mars year, the vertical dash line marks the current age of the Mars with
assumption that the Mars was formed in a similar time period of the Earth formation.
Such description was not given before according to the author's knowledge and is
completely skeptical due to lack of reliable data. However, with further expansion of the
research and exploration on the Mars, we shall feel confident that the reliable data about
the angular rotation acceleration of the Mars will be available in the near future which
will provide a vital test for the prediction of this model. There are also other factors
which may affect the Mars's rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season
change, winds, possible volcano eruptions and Mars quakes. Therefore, the data has to be
carefully analyzed.
7. Discussion about the model

From the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the
geological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the
Earth-Moon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional
parameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and
receding (Eq. 17 and Eq. 18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in
the same gravitational system, such relationship is not known before. Such success can
not be explained by "coincidence" or "luck" because of so many data involved (current
Earth's and Moon's data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is just a
"ad hoc" or a wrong model, although the chance for the natural happening of such
"coincidence" or "luck" could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery; the future Mars's
data will clarify this; otherwise, a new theory from different approach can be developed

15

to give the same or better description as this model does. It is certain that this model is
not perfect and may have defects, further development may be conducted.
James Clark Maxwell said in the 1873 " The vast interplanetary and interstellar
regions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has
not seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find
them to be already full of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human power can
remove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite
continuity. It extends unbroken from star to star ...." The medium that Maxwell talked
about is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The
Michelson-Morley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not
depend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar
space. In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically
recently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The dark matter field
fluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and "precisely" described by Maxwell.
7. Conclusion

The evolution of the Earth-Moon system can be described by the dark matter field
fluid model with non-Newtonian approach and the current data of the Earth and the Moon
fits this model very well. At 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the
Earth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Roche's limit and the length of
day was about 8 hours. The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system
described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may
not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The Mars's rotation
is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2.

The age of the Earth (109 years)

The evolution of Solar days of year with the age of the Earth-Moon system. The
solid line is calculated according to dark matter field fluid model. The data are from
Wells (3.9 ~ 4.435 billion years range), Sonett (3.6 billion years) and current age (4.5
billion years).
