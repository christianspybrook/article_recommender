Abstra t
A fully dierential al ulation in perturbative quantum hromodynami s is presented for the
produ tion of massive photon pairs at hadron olliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative
ontributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subpro esses are in luded,
as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmi a ura y. The region of phase spa e is spe ied in whi h the al ulation is most reliable.
Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predi tions are made
for more detailed tests with CDF and DØ data. Predi tions are shown for distributions of diphoton
pairs produ ed at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton
pairs from the de ay of a Higgs boson are ontrasted with those produ ed from QCD pro esses at
the LHC, showing that enhan ed sensitivity to the signal an be obtained with judi ious sele tion
of events.

INTRODUCTION

The long-sought Higgs boson(s)

h

of ele troweak symmetry breaking in parti le physi s

may soon be observed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through the diphoton
de ay mode (h

→ γγ ).

Purely hadroni

standard model pro esses are a

opious sour e

of diphotons, and a narrow Higgs boson signal at relatively low masses will appear as a
small peak above this

onsiderable ba kground. A pre ise theoreti al understanding of the

kinemati distributions for diphoton produ tion in the standard model ould provide valuable
guidan e in the sear h for the Higgs boson signal and assist in the important measurement
of Higgs boson

oupling strengths.

In this paper we address the theoreti al

al ulation of the invariant mass, transverse mo-

mentum, rapidity, and angular distributions of

ontinuum diphoton produ tion in proton-

antiproton and proton-proton intera tions at hadron

ollider energies. We

ompute all

on-

tributions to diphoton produ tion from parton-parton subpro esses through next-to-leading
order (NLO) in perturbative quantum

hromodynami s (QCD). These higher-order

ontri-

butions are large at the LHC, and their in lusion is mandatory for quantitatively trustworthy predi tions. We resum initial-state soft and
with gluon radiation to all orders in the strong

We

al ulations with data on isolated

diphoton produ tion from the Fermilab Tevatron [1℄. The good agreement we obtain with
the Tevatron data adds

onden e to our predi tions at the energy of the LHC. The present

work expands on our re ent abbreviated report [2℄, and it may be read in
our detailed treatment of the

onjun tion with

ontributions from the gluon-gluon subpro ess [3℄.

Our attention is fo used on the produ tion of isolated photons, i.e., high-energy photons
observed at some distan e from appre iable hadroni

remnants in the parti le dete tor.

The rare isolated photons tend to originate dire tly in hard QCD s attering, in

opiously produ ed non-isolated photons that arise from nonperturbative pro esses su h as

A generalized fa torization approa h that

CONCLUSIONS

The theoreti al study of

ontinuum diphoton produ tion in hadron

ollisions is interesting

and valuable for several reasons: there are data from the CDF and DØ
