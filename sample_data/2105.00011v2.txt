Abstract: We put forward a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model that couples (bosonic)
matter fields to topological Hořava gravity on a nonrelativistic worldsheet. In the target space,
this sigma model describes classical strings propagating in a curved spacetime background,
whose geometry is described by two distinct metric fields. We evaluate the renormalization
group flows of this sigma model on a flat worldsheet and derive a set of beta-functionals for
the bimetric fields. Imposing worldsheet Weyl invariance at the quantum level, we uncover
a set of gravitational field equations that dictate the dynamics of the bimetric fields in the
target space, where a unique massless spin-two excitation emerges. When the bimetric fields
become identical, the sigma model gains an emergent Lorentz symmetry. In this single metric
limit, the beta-functionals of the bimetric fields reduce to the Ricci flow equation that arises
in bosonic string theory, and the bimetric gravitational field equations give rise to Einstein's
gravity.

1. Introduction
String theory has been serving as a powerful paradigm for addressing fundamental questions in
theoretical physics. As a quantum-mechanically consistent framework that admits a massless
spin-two excitation, string theory provides a natural arena for testing outstanding ideas about
quantum gravity. It has been long known that different superstring theories are corners of a
single eleven-dimensional theory of supermembranes dubbed M-theory. However, unlike string
theory, which can be defined perturbatively with respect to the genera of Riemann surfaces,
there is no simple way of justifying a perturbative expansion in membranes. Another difficulty
of defining a quantum theory of membranes comes from the lack of quantization techniques
[1]. It is widely believed that the hypothetical M-theory is inevitably strongly coupled and
should be probed by exploring nonperturbative regimes of string theory.
In [2], a rather different approach towards a quantum theory of membranes is pioneered,
which is designed such that its ground-state wavefunction reproduces the partition function of bosonic string theory. This construction introduces a space and time anisotropy in
the worldvolume, and the membranes are described by a three-dimensional nonlinear sigma
model (NLSM) at a z = 2 Lifshitz point, where z denotes the critical dynamical exponent,
implying that the worldvolume degrees of freedom enjoy a quadratic dispersion relation and
are fundamentally nonrelativistic. The NLSM is coupled to three-dimensional Hořava gravity
on the nonrelativistic worldvolume. The worldvolume anisotropy induces a preferred foliation
structure by leaves of constant time, which allows one to consistently restrict the sum over
three-manifolds in the membrane theory to be a set of more tractable foliated manifolds,
bypassing some of the major difficulties in the construction of quantum membranes.
The membrane theory introduced in [2], referred to as membranes at quantum criticality,
opens up the study of a new spectrum of power-counting renormalizable sigma models coupled
to worldvolume Hořava gravity of different dimensions. In the flat worldvolume limit, the
worldvolume admits isometries generated by time and space translations, supplemented with
the spatial rotations, but there are no boost symmetries. This spacetime is nonrelativistic and
known as Aristotelian spacetime [3, 4]. At renormalization group (RG) fixed points, the sigma
models develop various anisotropic scaling invariances, i.e. Lifshitz scaling symmetries, and
become of the Lifshitz-type. One important step forward is to understand the appropriate
target spacetime geometries to which the branes (strings) described by such Lifshitz-type
sigma models should be coupled. This requires a thorough analysis of the RG flow structure
of these nonrelativistic sigma models, which still remains under-explored.
In this paper, we focus on the simplest example of the infinite hierarchy of Lifshitz-type
sigma models: a two-dimensional sigma model at a z = 1 Lifshitz point that describes classical
strings propagating in spacetime, which is the stringy analogue of the three-dimensional sigma
model for membranes at quantum criticality. At the z = 1 Lifshitz point, the space and time
have the same scaling dimension. However, the NLSM is generically nonrelativistic because

where X μ = X μ (t, x) , μ = 0, 1, * * * , d − 1 are worldsheet fields that map the worldsheet
Σ to a d-dimensional target space. Without any (neither Lorentzian nor Galilean) boost
symmetry on the worldsheet, the background fields Gμν and Hμν are independent symmetric
two-tensors. Assuming that these two-tensors are non-degenerate, the geometry of the target
space described by Gμν and Hμν has a bimetric feature. 1 Although the worldsheet is not
boost invariant, the target space is Lorentzian (see §2.3). The action (1.1) defines a unitary
and renormalizable quantum field theory. At the RG fixed point where Gμν = Hμν , the
action (1.1) develops an emergent Lorentz symmetry on the worldsheet and underlies standard
bosonic string theory, with the target space geometry encoded in a single metric.
For the sigma model (1.1) to describe nonrelativistic strings moving in a bimetric spacetime, we will couple the matter fields X μ to appropriate worldsheet gravity that lacks any
local boost symmetry, i.e. Hořava gravity in two-dimensions, which is topological and has
the notion of a preferred time direction. We will discuss how to couple the sigma model to
dilaton fields on a curved worldsheet, at least at the classical level. This forms an essential
ingredient towards understanding whether our NLSM is ultimately qualified as a consistent
quantum theory of strings that generalize the standard string theory. If there indeed exists a
notion of perturbative string theory for the Lifshitz-type NLSM (1.1), we will have a simple
example that goes beyond the framework of relativistic (bosonic) string theory. 2 This hypothetical "bimetric string theory" would define us a bimetric quantum gravity. Alternatively, if
there arise any obstacles for defining such bimetric string theory with two distinct spacetime
metrics at the quantum level, we would have a rather strong no-go theorem that reinforces
the uniqueness of relativistic string theory.
Regardless whether our sigma model can ultimately be promoted to be a full-fledged
quantum theory of strings, the renormalization of the Lifshitz-type sigma model (1.1) already
presents a well-defined and challenging problem. In this paper, we will mostly focus on the
beta-functionals of the background metric fields Gμν and Hμν in (1.1). 3 Imposing worldsheet
Weyl invariance at the quantum level leads to vanishing beta-functionals, which give rise
to a set of field equations that define a novel bimetric gravity. This is analogous to how
Einstein's gravity arises in two-dimensional relativistic sigma model on a curved spacetime
background. We will analyze the linearized bimetric gravity and reveal that, in the free

Lifshitz-type sigma models that describe supermembranes propagating in a bimetric spacetime have been
discussed in [5], which we will review later in §4.

Different notions of nonrelativistic strings already exist in the literature. See, e.g., [6–12]. These theories
of nonrelativistic strings arise as different corners embedded in relativistic string theory, with various Galileantype boost symmetries. Along other lines, certain classes of multi-gravity have been shown to arise in relativistic
string theory [13]. In contrast, the Lifshitz-type sigma models are beyond relativistic string theory.

The beta-functionals will be expressed as a Taylor expansion with respect to G − H that we take to be
sufficiently small. See §3.3.3.

theory perturbing around flat spacetime, there is one massless spin-two gauge field, together
with other tensorial degrees of freedom that satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation. This RG
calculation not only provides us with an opportunity for probing exotic bimetric geometries,
but also constitutes essential first steps towards a vast landscape of generically nonrelativistic
theories of strings and membranes, 4 where relativistic string theory only emerges at a corner
with Lorentz symmetry.
The paper is organized as follows. In §2, we define our sigma model coupled to twodimensional Hořava gravity on the worldsheet, and show that this sigma model describes
strings moving in a bimetric spacetime when a time-reversal symmetry is imposed. In §3,
we use the heat kernel method to compute the one-loop beta-functions of the bimetric sigma
model on a flat worldsheet, in terms of a Taylor expansion with respect to the difference
between the metric fields. This result is summarized in (3.89). In §4, we discuss generalizations of the string sigma model to classical theories of membranes at quantum criticality.
We conclude the paper in §5. In Appendix A, we present the full result of the heat kernel
coefficient that is relevant to the beta-function calculation.

2. Classical Strings in a Bimetric Geometry
In this section, we construct a NLSM that maps a two-dimensional nonrelativistic worldsheet
Σ to a d-dimensional spacetime manifold M equipped with two metric fields. We first define
the desired nonrelativistic symmetries of the worldsheet, generically excluding any (Lorentzian
nor Galilean) boost transformations. The dynamics of the worldsheet geometry is described
by two-dimensional Hořava gravity at a z = 1 Lifshitz point, which is topological. We will
couple scalar fields to this two-dimensional nonrelativistic gravity and build up a sigma model
that describes classical strings moving in a bimetric geometry.
2.1. Elements on Hořava gravity
We start with a brief review of Hořava gravity following [2, 14], which we will use later to describe the worldsheet geometry. Hořava gravity lives on a (D + 1)-dimension spacetime manifold Σ equipped with a foliation by leaves of codimension one, which are slices of constant time.

We will use the coordinates t, x = (xi , i = 1, * * *, D) that are adapted to the foliation structure. The dynamics of this foliated geometry is described by the ADM formalism variables,
originally introduced in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, where the relativistic spacetime metric is decomposed into the lapse function N , the shift vector Ni , and the
spatial metric γij [15]. In Hořava gravity, the ADM variables are used to define the time length


element ds2T = N 2 dt2 , and the space length element ds2L = γij N i dt + dxi N j dt + dxj ,
which are a priori unrelated [16]. The time (space) length is measured in the time (space)
unit T (L) , with
dim(dsT ) = dim(t) = T ,

dim(dsL ) = dim(x) = L .

4

(2.1)

In the particle case, however, the sigma model is defined on a worldline and identical to the relativistic
case, with a unique metric encoding the target space geometry.

–4–

It follows that the classical dimensions of the ADM variables are
dim(N ) = 1 ,

dim(Ni ) = L/T ,

dim(γij ) = 1 .

(2.2)

At RG fixed points, the classical theory develops anisotropic scale invariance with the dynamical critical exponent z , such that T ∼ Lz , which leads to the scaling dimensions for the
spacetime coordinates,
[t] = −1 ,
[x] = −z −1 ,
(2.3)
and for the ADM variables,
[N ] = 0 ,

[Ni ] = 1 − z −1 ,

[γij ] = 0 .

(2.4)

In this convention, energy is of scaling dimension one.
The gauge symmetries in Hořava gravity are diffeomorphisms that preserve the foliation
structure. These foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms act on the spacetime coordinates as
t → t0 (t) ,

x → x0 (t , x) .

(2.5)

Infinitesimally, we write δt = ζ(t) and δxi = ξ i (t, x) . The ADM variables transform under
the infinitesimal foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms as
δN = ∂t (ζ N ) + ξ i ∂i N ,

(2.6a)

δNi = ∂t (ζ Ni ) + ξ j Dj Ni + Nj Di ξ j + γij ∂t ξ j ,

(2.6b)

δγij = ζ ∂t γij + Di ξj + Dj ξi .

(2.6c)

Quantities that transform covariantly with respect to the foliation-preserving diffeomorphims
include the extrinsic curvature,
Kij =

1
(∂t γij − Di Nj − Dj Ni ) ,
2N

(2.7)

the spatial Riemann curvature tensor Rk `ij , the acceleration ai = −N −1 Di N , the covariant
time derivative dn , and the spatial covariant derivative Di . Here, dn is defined to be the Lie
derivative with respect to the vector field
n=



∂t − N i ∂i ,
N

(2.8)

and projected onto the spatial slice. The covariant derivative Di is defined with respect to
the spatial metric γij , satisfying the compatible condition Di γjk = 0 . We will also impose
the following time-reversal symmetry:
t → −t ,

N → N,

Ni → −Ni ,

γij → γij ,

(2.9)

which forbids terms that are odd in time derivatives. In addition, we impose the anisotropic
Weyl invariance [2],
N → ez W (t, x) N,

Ni → e2 W (t, x) Ni ,

–5–

γij → e2 W (t, x) γij .

(2.10)

We will soon construct the NLSM that couples scalar fields to two-dimensional Hořava gravity.
Requiring that the anisotropic Weyl invariance (2.10) hold classically as well as at quantum
level will give rise to a set of consistency equations that dictate the dynamics of the target
space geometry.
In flat limit, we have the ground state solution N = 1 , Ni = 0 , and γij = δij . This
ground state solution possesses the isometries
δt = ζ ,

δxi = ξ i + ω i j ξ j ,

(2.11)

where ζ and ξ i parametrize translations in temporal and spatial directions, respectively, and
ω i j parametrizes spatial rotations. Such spacetime without any (Lorentzian or Galilean)
boost symmetry is Aristotelian spacetime [3, 4]. In the special case when z = 1 , however, the
isometry group of the ground state solution is enlarged to the Poincaré group that incorporates
the Lorentzian boosts.
2.2. Dynamics of worldsheet geometry
We define the worldsheet to be a two-dimensional manifold Σ , equipped with a codimensionone foliation structure. The coordinates on the worldsheet are (t, x ≡ x1 ) . We also require
the foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms (2.5) on the worldsheet,
t → t0 (t) ,

x → x0 (t , x) .

(2.12)

δt = ζ(t) ,

δx = ξ(t , x) .

(2.13)

Infinitesimally, we write
Note that we have suppressed a raised "x" index in ξ. Under the infinitesimal foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms, from (2.6) we find that the ADM variables transform as
δN = ∂t (ζ N ) + ξ ∂x N ,

δχ = ∂t (ζ χ) + ∂x ξ χ + γ ∂t ξ ,
√ 

δγ = ζ ∂t γ + 2 γ ∂x γ ξ .

(2.14a)
(2.14b)
(2.14c)

We defined the shift function χ ≡ Nx and the spatial metric γ ≡ γxx . The dynamics of
the worldsheet geometry is then described by two-dimensional Hořava gravity that we have
briefed in §2.1 with D = z = 1 , such that the theory is at its lower critical dimension.

are extended to the full relativistic diffeomorphisms.

2.3. Sigma models in a bimetric spacetime
We are ready to couple scalar fields to the worldsheet geometry presented in §2.2, and construct the sigma model that describes classical strings propagating in a bimetric geometry.
Define the worldsheet scalar fields X μ (t, x) , μ = 0 , 1 , * * * , d − 1 that map the twodimensional worldsheet Σ to a d-dimensional target space M . We require that X μ transform
trivially under the worldsheet foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms, time-reversal symmetry,
and Weyl transformation. Coupling X μ to the worldsheet gravity introduced in §2.2 gives
rise to the following sigma model action:

where [X μ ] = 0 and Gμν [X] and Hμν [X] are arbitrary functionals of X μ . All the terms in
(2.24) are marginal. The background fields Gμν and Hμν are a priori unrelated due to the
lack of any boost symmetries that transform the worldsheet coordinates t and x into each
other. The action (2.24) is invariant under the target space reparametrizations:

i.e. both Gμν and Hμν transform as a symmetric two-tensor field. Under the condition that
these two-tensor fields are non-degenerate, they are both qualified as metric fields. Therefore,
the sigma model defined in (2.24) that consists of Lifshitz scalars at a z = 1 Lifshitz point
describes strings moving in a target space whose geometry is encoded in two metric fields.
We will refer to this type of geometries as a bimetric geometry. Intriguingly, even though
the worldsheet lacks any boost symmetry, the target space geometry has the full Lorentzian
boost symmetry. As we will see in later discussions, the bimetric geometry that arises in
our sigma model deviates drastically from the ones considered so far in the literature. Also
note that the sigma model we consider here does not accommodate any Kalb-Ramond field,
which breaks the time-reversal symmetry (2.15). In a variant of our sigma model that we
will soon introduce in §2.4, the time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken, and the same
Kalb-Ramond term considered in relativistic string theory can be included.
The Nambu-Goto formalism of (2.24) can be obtained readily by integrating out the
√
worldsheet gravitational fields N , γ , and Nx in the path integral. Since there is no prop√
agating degrees of freedom in our worldsheet gravity, we can eliminate N , γ , and Nx by
taking their equations of motion to be on-shell. There are two independent equations of
motion from varying these worldsheet gravitational fields,

Using the space diffeomorphism δx = ξ(t, x) in (2.13), we fix the shift function χ to

δt = ζ(t) is not sufficient to fix N and γ up to a conformal factor as in relativistic string
theory. Plugging χ = 0 into (2.28), we obtain the gauge-fixed action,

The curvature terms in (2.30) are total derivatives and do not make contribution to the stress

the Virasoro constraints in bosonic string theory. However, unlike the relativistic worldsheet
theory, we do not have enough diffeomorphism to fix e to one. Instead, the Virasoro-type
constraint (2.34) also involves e(t, x) .
If we further take the worldsheet to be flat and rescale (t, x) such that c = 1 , then (2.31)

that underlies bosonic string theory. The distinction here is that, instead of fixing the full
relativistic diffeomorphisms, we fixed part of the foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms followed
√
by the special choice N = γ = 1 to obtain (2.36). This implies that we have a rather
different BRST symmetry and ghost action. Therefore, the resemblance between (2.36) and
the relativistic string action is only at the classical level.
2.4. Time-reversal breaking and trimetricity
We mentioned earlier that the sigma model defined in (2.24) does not accommodate any
Kalb-Ramond term, which explicitly breaks the time-reversal symmetry (2.15) that forbids
any terms containing both space and time derivatives. However, the time-reversal symmetry
is not an essential ingredient in our formalism. Explicitly breaking the time-reversal symmetry
not only enriches the worldsheet topologies, but also introduces a plethora of extra Lagrangian
terms that include the Kalb-Ramond term. Each of these extra terms is an infinite sum of
a series of marginal operators, invariant under the foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms and
the Weyl invariance,

3. Renormalization of Bimetric Sigma Models
We are now ready to compute the beta-functionals for the background fields in the sigma
model (2.30), with the time-reversal symmetry imposed. We will not consider the betafunctionals of the dilaton fields in this paper, which require a more thorough understanding
of the foliated worldsheet geometry and further examinations of the Weyl anomalies on a
curved worldsheet. From now on, we simply take the flat worldsheet limit by setting e = 1 ,
which does not affect the beta-functionals of the metric fields Gμν and Hμν . We will therefore
focus on the following renormalizable NLSM:

We have performed a Wick rotation t = −iτ in (2.30) (together with S = −iSE ). Note
that one is free to introduce a constant rescaling factor between the bimetric fields such that
Gμν → Gμν and Hμν → c2 Hμν , by rescaling the worldsheet fields and coordinates. Later
in this section, we will also include the contributions from the dilaton fields to the betafunctionals of the metric fields. At the lowest order in α0 that we are interested in, these
contributions from dilatons are purely classical as in relativistic string theory. Since we are
focusing on the RG flows, which only capture local properties of the system, we can drop any
total derivative terms through the calculation.
It is important to note that the action (3.1) is invariant under the following mapping:
τ ←→ x ,

Gμν ←→ Hμν .

(3.2)

This self-dual property has to be preserved in the resulting beta-functionals. We will use this
duality frequently to guide our quantum calculations as well as a sanity check.
3.1. Bimetric geometry in the target space
As a preparation for quantum calculations, we investigate some essential ingredients of the
target-space bimetric geometry here. Some of these ingredients have been introduced in
[20, 21].
With respect to the metric fields Gμν and Hμν , we introduce two Levi-Civita connections,
∇ and ∆ , satisfying the compatibility conditions ∇ρ Gμν = 0 and ∆ρ Hμν = 0 , respectively.
Define the Christoffel coefficients Γρ μν (Θρ μν ) associated with the connection ∇μ (∆μ ),

symbols transforms as a (1, 2)-tensor, with

The difference between the Riemann curvatures can be written in terms of the tensor S ρ μν as
Rρ σμν − Σρ σμν = ∇μ S ρ νσ − ∇ν S ρ μσ − S ρ μλ S λ νσ + S ρ νλ S λ μσ
= ∆μ S ρ νσ − ∆ν S ρ μσ + S ρ μλ S λ νσ − S ρ νλ S λ μσ .
With the above elements of bimetric geometry in hand, we are ready to use the covariant
background field method to expand the worldsheet action (3.1), as a preparation for evaluating
the one-loop effective action on the worldsheet. We first choose Gμν to be the reference metric,
with respect to which the standard background field method can be applied. Consider a
sufficiently small neighborhood O of a point X0μ in the target space M . For an arbitrary
point X μ in O, and with respect to the reference metric field Gμν , there exists a unique
geodesic interpolating between X0μ and X μ , parametrized by Y μ (s) , with an affine parameter
s ∈ [0, 1] . The geodesic equation is

Alternatively, we can choose Hμν instead of Gμν to be the reference metric, which must
be equivalent when any physical observable is concerned. There also exists a unique geodesic
interpolating between X0μ and X μ and parametrized by Z μ (r) , defined with respect to Hμν
and an affine parameter r ∈ [0, 1] , such that

tangent at X0μ to the geodesics defined respectively with respect to the connections Γ and Θ :
q μ = pμ −

Now, we return to the action (3.1) and expand it around X0μ , with respect to the reference

be transformed to be the one defined with respect to the reference metric Hμν by applying
the self-dual mapping (3.2), supplemented with the following derived rules:
∇μ −→ ∆μ ,

Rμ ρσν −→ Σμ ρσν ,

S μ ρσ −→ −S μ ρσ ,

pμ −→ q μ .

(3.24)

Recall that q μ is the quantum fluctuation defined in (3.13) with respect to the geodesic
associated with the metric Hμν . This does not suffice our need for a manifestly self-dual

– 15 –

formula: since the supplementary duality transformations in (3.24) also act nontrivially on
the quantum fluctuations pμ and q μ , choosing to integrate out either pμ or q μ will lead to
beta-functionals that do not manifest the self-dual transformations. This drawback can be
circumvented by taking the change of variables,
pμ = `μ + 14 S μ ρσ `ρ `σ + O(`3 ) .

(3.25)

`μ = pμ − 41 S μ ρσ pρ pσ + O(p3 ) = q μ + 41 S μ ρσ q ρ q σ + O(q 3 ) ,

(3.26)

Together with (3.17), we find

and it is evident that ` is invariant under the transformation (3.24). Integrating `μ out will
then lead to a self-dual one-loop effective action as desired. Comparing (3.25) with (3.15) and
the definition of pμ in (3.7), we find that `μ is the tangent vector at u = 0 along the geodesic
parametrized by an affine parameter u , satisfying the geodesic equation,

3.3. Heat kernel method for bimetric sigma models
We are now ready to use the heat kernel method to compute the one-loop effective action
associated with the sigma model (3.1). We start with defining the effective action. Then, we
will review some essential ingredients in the standard heat kernel method [23–25] and discuss
in detail how it is applied to our sigma model in a bimetric spacetime.
3.3.1. Heat kernel representation of the effective action
We start with a quick review of the heat kernel method and derive the general form of the
effective action, following [23–27] but with adaptions to the bimetric sigma models. First, we
define the associated path integral for the covariantly expanded action (3.30), with respect
to a reference metric Gμν [X0 ] ,

Even though we chose to define the measure in the path integral with respect to the reference
metric Gμν [X0 ] with G ≡ det(Gμν ) , it does not give Gμν any privileges in physical results as
long as we integrate out all configurations of the quantum fluctuation. Later on, we will see
explicitly that this choice preserves the self-dual property (3.2) in the final beta-functionals.

Clearly, the heat kernel coefficient E2 contributes the log divergence in the one-loop effective
action (3.54). This log divergence is associated with the beta-functionals of various couplings
in the sigma model. The power-law divergences can be set to zero by choosing appropriate
counterterms.
3.3.2. Solving the recursion relations
Now, we compute the coincidence limit of the symbol σ2μν , from which we will be able to read
off the beta-functionals by using (3.52). Using the explicit expression for O in (3.32), we find

[Q] ≡ Q(τ0 , x0 ; τ0 , x0 ) . Using (3.43), we find from (3.57) that

(3.58c)

Here, Dμν is the inverse of Aμν , satisfying Dμρ Aρν = δνμ . Recall that we are interested in
the heat kernel coefficient E2 defined in (3.52), which is determined by σ2μν and gives rise
to the log divergence in the one-loop effective action (3.54). Further note that E2 involves
integrations over the frequency ω and momentum κ , and only receives nonzero contributions
from terms in [σ2μν ] that are even in both ω and κ . According to (3.58c), this implies that we
only need to keep terms in [∇τ σ1μν ] that are odd in ω but even in κ , and terms in [∆x σ1σν ] that
are odd in κ and even in ω . This observation brings some simplification in the calculation,
which we will come back to momentarily.

Plugging the result of [σ2μν ] back into (3.52) and performing the integrals over ω and κ , the
heat kernel coefficient E2 can be derived. The exact result after performing these integrals is
difficult to compute; however, as we will show in the following, when the difference between
Gμν and Hμν is sufficiently small, the heat kernel coefficient can be computed order by order
perturbatively.
3.3.3. Perturbative expansion of the heat kernel coefficient
We now perform the frequency-momentum integrals in the expression for the heat kernel
coefficient E2 in (3.52). From now on, we focus on the case where the difference between Gμν
and Hμν is controlled by a sufficiently small parameter  , such that
Gμν − Hμν =  fμν .

which demonstrates that U remains unchanged if G and H are swapped. The remaining
perturbative expansion in (3.73) can be extended to all orders in  as well, leading to the
exact heat kernel coefficient. Since this exact expression does not take any illuminating form,
we refer the interested readers to Appendix A for details.
Further note that the effective action (3.71) is self-dual under the mapping (3.2),6 which
is a symmetry of the sigma model (3.1) that we started with. This is highly nontrivial since all
the intermediate steps that eventually lead to the effective action are taken with respect to a
reference metric Gμν . These intermediate steps (e.g., (3.69)) do not manifest the self-duality
transformation (3.2). The fact that the final effective action (3.71) is self-dual therefore acts
as a strong sanity check of our calculation.
3.4. Dilaton contributions
Up to now, we have been focusing on the flat worldsheet, where the contributions from the
dilaton terms to the effective action are invisible. In this subsection, we revisit the dilaton
terms on a curved worldsheet and evaluate the contributions from the dilatons to the RG
flows of Gμν and Hμν .
Recall that the sigma model on a curved worldsheet is given by (2.28). In the flat
worldsheet limit, the dilaton term vanishes; however, the dilaton term in (2.28) still makes
nontrivial contributions to the trace anomaly,
TΦ = ∂τ2 ΦT + ∂x2 ΦL = ∂τ X μ ∂τ X ν ∇μ ∇ν ΦT + ∂x X μ ∂x X ν ∆μ ∆ν ΦL
+ ∇τ ∂τ X μ ∇μ ΦT + ∆x ∂x X μ ∆μ ΦL .

(3.82)

On the other hand, the trace of the stress energy tensor is related to the beta-functionals of
G and β H as

T = − 0 ∂τ X μ ∂τ X ν βμν

(3.83)
2α
For TΦ in (3.82) to be absorbed into the beta-functionals in (3.83), we need to remove in
(3.82) the last two terms that depend on ∇τ ∂τ X μ and ∆x ∂x X μ . This can be achieved by
first using the equation of motion (3.23) satisfied by the background field X0μ ,
Gμρ ∇τ ∂τ X0μ + Hμρ ∆x ∂x X0μ = 0 ,
6

Under the duality transformation (3.2), we have f ←→ −f , which induces g ←→ −h .

– 24 –

(3.84)

which allows us to rewrite (3.82) as
TΦ = ∂τ X μ ∂τ X ν ∇μ ∇ν ΦT + ∂x X μ ∂x X ν ∆μ ∆ν ΦL

+ ∇τ ∂τ X μ ∇μ ΦT − Gμρ H ρσ ∆σ ΦL .

(3.85)

Setting the extra ∇τ ∂τ X μ term to zero requires that the background fields satisfy
Gμν ∇ν ΦT = H μν ∆ν ΦL .

(3.86)

This condition is fullfilled, for example, when the dilaton fields are constant. As a result,
TΦ = ∂τ X μ ∂τ X ν ∇μ ∇ν ΦT + ∂x X μ ∂x X ν ∆μ ∆ν ΦL .

(3.87)

Comparing with (3.83), we find that the classical trace anomaly in (3.82) can be absorbed
G and β H by adding the following terms:

μν
G
βμν
⊃ 2 α0 ∇μ ∇ν ΦT ,

(3.88)

We emphsize that the extra condition (3.86) has to be imposed, otherwise we would have the
extra term ∇τ ∂τ X μ in (3.85) that cannot be absorbed into any local counterterms.
3.5. Beta-functionals and coupled Ricci flows
In (3.71) and (3.88), we derived the Weyl anomalies in the effective action that are generated
by quantum corrections, which lead to the following beta-functionals:

Recall that Rρ μνσ (Σρ μνσ ) and ∇μ (∆μ ) are respectively the Riemann tensor and covariant
derivative defined with respect to the metric Gμν (Hμν ) . Under the duality map Gμν → Hμν ,
G is transformed into β H . To map out the full RG flow structure of the
the beta-functional βμν
μν
sigma model, however, we will also need to compute the beta-functionals for the dilaton fields
ΦT, L at the lowest order in α0 , which are, for example, important for determining the critical
dimension (if such notion still exists) of the target space. However, the analysis of the dilaton
beta-functionals requires a more thorough understanding of the worldsheet geometry and
higher-loop calculation [29], for which other techniques are needed. For example, evaluating
the Weyl anomalies on a curved worldsheet with a foliation structure requires the method
developed in [27], which we leave for future studies.
The set of beta-functionals in (3.89) gives rise to a notion of coupled Ricci flows. In the
limit Hμν → Gμν , the condition (3.86) gives ∇μ ΦT = ∇μ ΦL ≡ ∇μ Φ . Moreover, the two
equations in (3.89) reduce to the following beta-functional in relativistic string theory:

where ι ≡ ln M , with M the renormalization scale. Here, Rμν ≡ Rρ μρν is the Ricci tensor
defined with respect to the unique metric Gμν = Hμν . Note that (3.91) is Perelman's Ricci
flow equation for the metric field [30]. The equations in (3.89) can be viewed as a generalization of the Ricci flow equation that governs the evolution of two different geometries in a
coupled way.
3.6. Bimetric dynamics and linearized gravity
Requiring Weyl invariance at the quantum level sets the beta-functionals in (3.89) to zero.
This gives rise to the equations of motion that dictate the dynamics of the target space
geometry,

beta-functionals of the dilaton fields to zero to determine the full dynamics of the target space

In the single metric limit Gμν = Hμν , the spacetime equations of motion (3.92) reduce to

In the case of a constant Φ , this gives the Ricci flat condition that describes Einstein's gravity
in absence of matter fields. In this sense, the equations of motion in (3.92) extend Einstein's
gravity to a bimetric gravity.
To further understand the dynamics of the bimetric geometry, we set the background
dilaton fields to be constant and focus on the linearized part of the spacetime equations of
motion in (3.92). It is instructive to first linearize the beta-functionals in (3.89) and then
impose the Weyl invariance to get the linearized spacetime equations of motion. We expand
the metrics Gμν and Hμν around the Minkowskian metric ημν as

These expressions are invariant under the linearized infinitesimal gauge transformation (3.95).
Therefore, at the linearized order, from Gμν and Hμν we form a massless spin-two gauge field
Fμν and a matrix fμν that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation. This is not necessarily against
the usual no-go theorem that multiplets of interacting massless spin-two fields do not exist
[31]: even though the target-space geometry is described by two metric fields Gμν and Hμν ,
there is only one massless spin-two excitation formed by these two metric fields. In the single
metric limit Hμν → Gμν , i.e. fμν → 0 , the extra modes are set to zero and we are left with
Einstein's gravity. Our analysis here is only for the free theory, and it requires further analysis
to determine whether the interacting theory is free of ghosts, which we leave for future work. 7

4. Outlooks: Membranes at Quantum Criticality
Since we have given up the worldsheet boost symmetry, strings no longer have any privileged
position, and a broader spectrum of theories that are beyond string theory present. So far,
we have been focusing on two-dimensional sigma models that describe strings propagating
in a bimetric spacetime. In the following, we discuss natural generalizations to Lifshitz-type
NLSMs that describe membranes at quantum criticality, following [2, 5, 32].
We consider worldvolume theories described by sigma models at a Lifshitz point, in which
case it is possible to construct quantum theories of membranes that are potentially perturbatively defined. A quantum theory of membranes of this type is introduced in [2] and has been
preluded in §1, where the worldvolume theory of the sigma model is described by a threedimensional quantum field theory at a z = 2 Lifshitz point, coupled to worldvolume Hořava
gravity. Due to the foliation structure induced by the foliation-preserving diffeomorphism on
the worldvolume, the summation over the three-manifold can be consistently restricted to be
over a specific class of foliated manifolds, whose spatial leaves are Riemann surfaces. The spatial topology in the foliated manifold changes when the membranes interact with each other.
When the three-dimensional sigma model satisfies the so-call "detailed balance condition,"
i.e., the time-evolution of the worldsheet gravitational and matter fields is governed by a gradient flow generated by some Euclidean action principle, an intriguing connection to string
theory can be established: as shown in [2], the quantum theory of membranes that satisfies
7

A preliminary analysis of the Lagrangian formalism for the linearized equations of motion in (3.99) shows
that there are kinetic terms with a wrong sign, which could be problematic when interactions are included.
Nevertheless, it is possible that the related ghost-like modes are removed by nonlinear Hamiltonian constraints
in the full interacting theory. This endeavour requires first constructing an action principle and then performing
a Hamiltonian analysis. On the other hand, as long as the worldsheet quantum field theory that underlies this
bimetric gravity is well-defined, the worldsheet perspective will keep providing us with a solid foundation for
future studies of this exotic gravity theory.

the detailed balance condition, and with compact spatial topology Σh , has the property that
its ground-state wavefunction reproduces the partition function of bosonic string theory on
the worldsheet Σh . Moreover, the three-dimensional sigma model that describes membranes
at quantum criticality inherits the RG properties of the two-dimensional relativistic sigma
model that underlies bosonic string theory. As a result, the appropriate spacetime geometry
coupled to the membranes is the same as in string theory, and the dynamics of the spacetime
geometry is described by Einstein's gravity.
It is, however, intriguing to consider sigma models that generalize the theory of membranes at quantum criticality in [2] by relaxing the detailed balance condition. This will allow
us to probe more exotic spacetime geometries. We will discuss different generalizations below.
An especially interesting example has been introduced in [5, 32], where a three-dimensional
NLSMs with Aristotelian supersymmetry is formulated, presenting a nonrelativistic ultraviolet (UV) completion of three-dimensional relativistic N = 1 supersymmetric sigma models.
This Lifshitz-type NLSM provides a manageable candidate for a quantum membrane theory
in a bimetric spacetime.
4.1. Bosonic membranes and O(N ) nonlinear sigma model
For simplicity, we will impose the worldvolume time-reversal symmetry throughout this section. In the bosonic case, the generalization to theories of membranes leads to a proliferation
of terms. To construct such membrane theories, we introduce the coordinates (t, xi ) , i = 1, 2
on the worldvolume. The engineering scaling dimensions at a z = 2 Lifshitz point are
[t] = −1 ,

e μν , and Qμν are symmetric and transform
metric field Hμν [X] (H
as two-tensors and Tμνρσ transforms as a four-tensor with respect to spacetime diffeomorphisms. The action Sbrane is invariant under reparametrizations of the target space coordie μν = Qμν and Tμνρσ = 0 , and the
nates X μ . At the detailed balance, we have Gμν = Hμν = H
beta-functional of Gμν is the usual Ricci flow equation as in (3.91) (with the dilaton field set
to zero). However, without the detailed balance condition, the spacetime geometry in (4.2)
is quite intricate and described by multiple tensorial fields. The sigma model (4.2) can also
be consistently coupled to the worldvolume Weyl-invariant Hořava gravity, which does not
possess any propagating gravitational degree of freedom [2].

In the simple case when the target space is an (d − 1)-sphere S d−1 , the sigma model in
(4.2) still deviates from its relativistic counter-partner in an interesting way. The marginal
Lagrangian terms invariant under the target space O(d) symmetry are [33–35] 8

The RG flows of the NLSM in (4.3) have been evaluated in [34, 35]. Intriguingly, projected
in the α1 -α2 plane, the RG flows possess multiple fixed points, depending on the value of d .
In particular, there is one RG fixed point that is independent of d at α1 = α2 = 0 . At this
common fixed point in the α1 -α2 plane, the theory exhibits the detailed balance properties.
The beta-function calculation of the O(d) NLSM (4.3) is already rather involved, due to the
presence of the terms that are quartic in spatial derivatives. When it comes to the NLSM
(4.2) in general target spaces, the proliferation of tensorial structures in spacetime poses more
challenges, which might require new techniques to tackle with.
4.2. Supermembranes in a bimetric spacetime
Just like the case of the O(N ) NLSM, imposing the detailed balance condition on Sbrane
in (4.2) significantly simplifies the quartic derivative terms. At the meantime, the detailed
balance condition also forces Gμν = Hμν . Nevertheless, it is indeed possible to simplify
the quartic derivative terms but still allow a bimetric structure in the target space. This is
achieved in [5, 32] by introducing Aristotelian supersymmetry in three dimensions, generated
by two real supercharges Q1 and Q2 that form a multiplet Qα , α = 1, 2 .
We follow closely [5] below and review the basic ingredients in the construction of the
theory of supermembranes in a bimetric spacetime. The same superspace formalism for
Lifshitz-type O(N ) sigma models can be found in [37]. We start with some conventions.

where c is a dimensionful coupling (that plays the role of speed of light) from the perspective

temporal and spatial translations and spatial rotational transformations (but without any
boost transformation), we form the algebra of Aristotelian supersymmetry [5, 32] (also see
[16] for related discussions). Since we are zooming in around the UV z = 2 Lifshitz point
here, we will tune the coupling c to zero in the following discussion.
Next, we introduce worldvolume fermions Ψμα = (Ψμ1 , Ψμ2 )| together with an auxiliary
field B μ . The fermionic symmetry transformations generated by Qα and parametrized by

We use the convention d2 θ θθ = 1 . At the RG fixed point Gμν = Hμν , the theory is closely related

e.g., [38]). At equilibrium, the action (4.12) in the single metric limit reduces to a two-dimensional Euclidean
theory, which coincides with the action of the harmonic topological sigma model on a flat worldsheet [39, 40].

This significantly simplifies the bosonic action (4.2) while retaining the bimetric natural of
the target space. It is manifest that the matter fields have a quadratic dispersion relation.
The supersymmetric NLSM describes classical membranes propagating in a bimetric
spacetime. However, unlike the two-dimensional sigma model (3.1) in a bimetric spacetime,
which is self-dual under the transformation (3.2), now, in (4.12), the metric fields Gμν and
Hμν are not on the same footing anymore. Therefore, we expect genuinely distinct betafunctionals for Gμν and Hμν in the membrane action (4.12). Power-counting renormalizable
NLSMs of this type can also be constructed in higher dimensions. These NLSMs exhibit different Lifshitz scaling symmetries and in principle lead to an infinite hierarchy of multi-tensorial
target-space geometries.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we considered a novel type of two-dimensional NLSMs, defined on a nonrelativistic worldsheet that lacks any local (Lorentzian nor Galilean) boost symmetries. The
worldsheet dynamics is described by topological Hořava gravity. Imposing the worldsheet
time-reversal symmetry, the sigma model is coupled to a pair of metric fields and describes
classical strings propagating in a bimetric spacetime. We analyzed the RG flows in the bimetric sigma model, and derived the beta-functionals of the bimetric fields in (3.89), up to
the fourth-order in the Taylor expansion with respect to a small deviation away from equal
metric. This set of beta-functionals form a pair of coupled Ricci flow equations. In the limit
where the two metric fields are identical to each other, the coupled Ricci flow equations reduce
to a single Ricci flow equation that arises as the beta-functional in relativistic string theory.
Imposing Weyl invariance at the quantum level, we discover the equations of motion that govern the dynamics of the background geometry in the bimetric sigma model. In the linearized
bimetric gravity, there emerges a massless gravitational excitation, which is accompanied by
other degrees of freedom that satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation in (3.99).

Our study of Lifshitz-type sigma models hints at new bimetric gravity theories. Different
versions of bimetric and multimetric gravity theories have been studied extensively in the
literature. A general formulation of bimetric gravities is introduced in [43] (see also [20, 21]),
using which a special version of bimetric gravity is put forward and shown to be free of
singularities while preserving the general covariance principles [44]. Along other lines, in
the context of massive gravity, a modern version of bimetric gravity (see, e.g., [45, 46] and
references therein) has been constructed, which has the attractive feature of being free of
the Boulware-Deser ghosts [47] and also bears applications to cosmology, the electroweak
hierarchy problem [48], the fractional quantum Hall effect in condensed matter theory [49],
et cetera. Furthermore, it has been shown in [13] that related multi-metric description of
massive gravity also arises in the context of non-local multi-string theory [50]. Nevertheless,
the bimetric gravity considered in our work does not seem to fit into any of the previously
existing models. To further the understanding of the bimetric gravity that arises in our
work, and to identify its relation to existing bimetric theories, one imminent future task is to
construct a gravitational action principle that gives rise to the spacetime equations of motion
found in this paper and analyze the Hamiltonian constraints to determine the actual degrees
of freedom. The fact that our bimetric gravity arises from a string-theoretical setup makes it
promising that the full interacting theory might be free of ghosts.
The main focus of this paper has been the beta-functionals of the spacetime bimetric
fields. However, to map out the complete RG structure of the two-dimensional Lifshitz-type
sigma model, one also needs to determine the beta-functionals for the dilaton fields, for which
detailed RG properties of the worldsheet Hořava gravity is required (some useful techniques
have been developed in the literature, see, e.g., [27, 51–55]). This piece of calculation will be
essential for understanding the notion of critical dimensions in Lifshitz-type sigma models.
Further investigations of the foliated worldsheet topology will be important for revealing
whether there exists a well-defined perturbative expansion with respect to a unique effective
string coupling, formed by the two dilaton fields in (2.28). It will be fascinating to find
out whether our nonrelativistic sigma model can ultimately be promoted to describe a selfconsistent quantum theory of strings that generalizes relativistic string theory.
The concepts and techniques developed in this paper are applicable to a large class of
Lifshitz-type sigma models that map p-branes to novel spacetime geometries described by
multi-tensorial fields. We have discussed two natural generalizations in the paper. The first
variant that we introduced in §2.4 is by explicitly breaking the time-reversal symmetry in
our sigma model, which leads to a two-dimensional sigma model in a trimetric spacetime
geometry, coupled to a B-field and multiple dilaton fields. Later in §4, we studied a second
variant that is a three-dimensional supersymmetric sigma model describing membranes at
quantum criticality, following [5, 32]. Understanding these new ingredients will boost the
exploration of the mostly uncharted territory of Lifshitz-type NLSMs, providing an arena for
probing new geometries and alternative constructions of quantum membranes.
