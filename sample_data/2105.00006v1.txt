Abstract
We present a global interpretation of Higgs, diboson, and top quark production and decay
measurements from the LHC in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory
(SMEFT) at dimension six. We constrain simultaneously 36 independent directions in its parameter space, and compare the outcome of the global analysis with that from individual and
two-parameter fits. Our results are obtained by means of state-of-the-art theoretical calculations
for the SM and the EFT cross-sections, and account for both linear and quadratic corrections

in the 1/Λ2 expansion. We demonstrate how the inclusion of NLO QCD and O Λ−4 effects is
instrumental to accurately map the posterior distributions associated to the fitted Wilson coefficients. We assess the interplay and complementarity between the top quark, Higgs, and diboson
measurements, deploy a variety of statistical estimators to quantify the impact of each dataset in
the parameter space, and carry out fits in BSM-inspired scenarios such as the top-philic model.
Our results represent a stepping stone in the ongoing program of model-independent searches
at the LHC from precision measurements, and pave the way towards yet more global SMEFT
interpretations extended to other high-pT processes as well as to low-energy observables.

Introduction

A powerful, model-independent framework to constrain, identify, and parametrise potential
deviations with respect to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) is provided by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) [1–3], see also [4] for a review. A particularly
attractive feature of the SMEFT is its capability to systematically correlate deviations from
the SM between different processes, for example between Higgs and top quark cross-sections,
or between high-pT and flavor observables.

1

A direct consequence of this model independence is the high dimensionality of the parameter space spanned by the relevant higher-dimensional EFT operators. Indeed, the number of
Wilson coefficients constrained in typical SMEFT analyses can vary between just a few up to
the several tens or even hundreds, depending on the specific assumptions adopted concerning
the flavour, family (non-)universality of the couplings, and CP-symmetry structure (among
others) of the UV-complete theory. For this reason, the full exploitation of the SMEFT potential for indirect New Physics searches from precision measurements requires combining the
information provided by the broadest possible dataset.
The phenomenology of the SMEFT has attracted significant attention, with most analyses
focusing on specific sectors of the parameter space and groups of processes. Some of these
recent studies have targeted the top quark properties [5–8], the Higgs and electroweak gauge
sector [9–11], single and double gauge boson production [12–15], vector-boson scattering [14,
16, 17], and flavour and low-energy observables [18–20], among several others. Furthermore,
analyses that combine the constraints of different groups of processes in the EFT parameter
space, such as the Higgs and electroweak sector with the top quark one [21] or top quark
data with B-meson observables [22, 23], have also been presented. These and related studies
demonstrate that a global interpretation of the SMEFT is unavoidable and makes possible
benefiting from hitherto unexpected connections, such as the correlation of the LHCb flavour
anomalies [24, 25] at the B-meson scale with the high-pT tails at the LHC [15, 26].
With the ultimate motivation of performing a truly global EFT interpretation of particle
physics data, the SMEFiT fitting framework was developed in [7] and applied to the analysis of the top quark properties at the LHC as a proof-of-concept. This novel EFT fitting
methodology, inspired by techniques deployed by the NNPDF Collaboration to determine the
proton's parton distribution functions (PDFs) [27–31], made possible constraining the Wilson
coefficients associated to 34 independent dimension-six operators that modify the production
cross-sections of top quarks. Our results improved over existing bounds [32] for the wide majority of directions in the SMEFT parameter space and in several cases the associated Wilson
coefficients were constrained for the first time. Subsequently, SMEFiT was extended with the
Bayesian reweighting method [33] developed for PDFs [34, 35] which allows one constraining
the EFT parameter space a posteriori with novel measurements without requiring a dedicated
fit. SMEFiT has also been recently applied for the first SMEFT interpretation of vector boson
scattering data [14] from the full Run II dataset.
In this work, we complement and extend the SMEFiT analysis framework of [7] in several
directions. First and foremost, we extend the dimension-six EFT operator basis in order to
simultaneously describe top-quark measurements together with Higgs boson production and
decay cross-sections, as well as with weak gauge boson pair production from LEP and the
LHC. Specifically, we consider Higgs signal strengths, differential distributions, and simplified
template cross-section (STXS) measurements from ATLAS and CMS taken at Runs I and II.
Furthermore, we account for the most recent top-quark observables from the Run II dataset,
such as updated measurements of four-top, top quark pair in association with a Z boson,
and differential single-top and top quark pair production. We also include the differential
distributions in gauge boson pair production from LEP and the LHC, which constrain complementary directions in the EFT space. In addition, we account in an indirect manner for
the information provided by electroweak precision observables (EWPO) from LEP [36] by
means of imposing restrictions on specific combinations of the EFT coefficients.
A second improvement as compared to [7] concerns the fitting methodology. On the one
hand, the Monte Carlo replica fitting method has been upgraded by means of more efficient
2

optimizers and the imposition of post-fit quality selection criteria for the replicas. On the
other hand, we have implemented a novel, independent approach to constrain the parameter
space based on Nested Sampling (NS) by means of the MultiNest algorithm [37]. As opposed
to the replica fitting method, which is an optimisation problem, NS aims to reconstruct
the posterior probability distribution given the model and the data by means of Bayesian
inference. We have cross-validated the performance of the two methods and demonstrated
that they lead to equivalent results. The availability of two orthogonal fitting strategies
strengthens the robustness of SMEFiT and facilitates the combined interpretation of data from
different processes.
From the combination of the improved fitting framework and the extensive input dataset,
we derive individual, two-dimensional, and global (marginalised) bounds for 36 independent
directions (and 14 dependent ones) in the EFT parameter space. The EFT cross-sections
used inthis analysis account for either only the linear or for both linear and quadratic effects,
O Λ−2 and O Λ−4 respectively, and include NLO QCD corrections whenever available.
We demonstrate in detail how the inclusion of NLO QCD and O Λ−4 corrections in the
EFT calculations is instrumental in order to accurately pin down the posterior distributions
associated to the fitted Wilson coefficients.
By means of information geometry and principal component analysis techniques, we quantify the sensitivity of each of the input datasets to the various Wilson coefficients. We validate
these statistical diagnosis tools by means of a series of fits restricted to subsets of processes,
such as Higgs-only and top-only EFT analyses. Specifically, we quantify the interplay between
the top-quark and Higgs measurements in the determination of EFT degrees of freedom sensitive to both processes, such as the modifications of the top Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, we
explore how the EFT fit results are modified when additional, UV-inspired theory restrictions
are imposed in the parameter space, and present results for the case of a top-philic model.
The paper is organised as follows. First of all, Sect. 2 discusses the operator basis, flavour
assumptions, the fitted degrees of freedom, and the top-philic scenario. Then Sect. 3 describes
the top-quark, Higgs, and diboson datasets that are used as input to the analysis together with
the corresponding SM and EFT calculations. The methodological improvements in SMEFiT,
together with the description of the fit settings, are presented in Sect. 4. The main results
of this work, namely the combined SMEFT interpretation of top-quark, Higgs, and diboson
measurements at the LHC, are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6 we
summarise and discuss future steps in this project.
Supplementary information is provided in three appendices. In App. A we present the
comparison between the SM and SMEFT theory predictions with the experimental datasets
used as input to the fit; in App. B we describe the implementation of the Higgs signal strength
measurements; then in App. C we discuss how the results of this work are rendered publicly
available and provide usage instruction.

EFT description of the top, Higgs, and electroweak sectors

In this section we collect the definitions and conventions that will be used to construct the
dimension-six operators and the associated degrees of freedom (DoFs) relevant for the theoretical description of the processes considered in this analysis. These are operators that modify
the production and decay of Higgs bosons and top quarks at hadron colliders, precision electroweak measurements from LEP/SLC, and gauge-boson pair production cross-sections both
3

at LEP2 and at the LHC.
First of all, we provide explicit definitions for the operators and for the physical EFT coefficients adopted in this work, as well as the corresponding notational conventions. Following
the recommendation of the LHC Top Quark Working Group [32] as well as the strategy of
our previous work [7], in the top-quark sector we fit specific degrees of freedom closely related to the experimental measurements, instead of directly using the Warsaw-basis operator
coefficients. Our degrees of freedom are therefore linear combinations of the Warsaw-basis
operator coefficients, which appear in the interference with SM amplitudes, and represent
interactions of physical fields after electroweak symmetry breaking. These combinations are
then aligned with physically relevant directions of the parameter space, and thus have a more
transparent physical interpretation. They also represent the maximal information that can
be extracted from measuring a certain process.
We will then discuss how the constraints provided by the electroweak precision observables
(EWPOs) from LEP/SLC can be approximately accounted for by means of a series of restrictions on the EFT parameter space. We also discuss theoretical constraints on the operator
coefficients following a more restrictive assumption about the UV-complete theory, namely
the so-called top-philic scenario. Finally, we discuss several theoretical relations that must be
satisfied by the EFT cross-sections following the requirement that physical cross-sections are
positive-definite quantities.

2.1

Operator basis and degrees of freedom

Conventions. Let us start by summarizing the notation and conventions that are adopted
in this work concerning the relevant dimension-six SMEFT operators. Here we follow the
notation of the Warsaw basis presented in [3]. In this notation, flavour indices are labelled
by i, j, k and l; left-handed quark and lepton fermion SU(2)L doublets are denoted by qi , `i ;
the right-handed quark singlets by ui , di , while the right-handed lepton singlets are denoted
by e, μ, τ without using flavor index. Given the special role of the top-quark in this work, we
use Q and t to denote the left-handed top-bottom doublet and the right-handed top singlet,
instead of using q3 and u3 . The Higgs doublet is denoted by φ; the antisymmetric SU(2)
tensor by ε ≡ iτ 2 ; φ̃ = εφ∗ ; and we define
←
→
(φ† iD μ φ) ≡ φ† (iDμ φ) − (iDμ φ† )φ ,

←
→
(φ† iD Iμ φ) ≡ φ† τ I (iDμ φ) − (iDμ φ† )τ I φ ,

(2.1)

I
where τ I are the Pauli matrices. In the following, GA
μν , Wμν , and Bμν stand for the SU(3)
strong and SU(2)L and U(1)Y weak gauge field strengths respectively, and the covariant
derivatives include all the relevant interaction terms. For instance, the gluon field strength
tensor is given by
A
A
ABC B C
GA
G μ Gν ,
(2.2)
μν = ∂μ Gν − ∂ν Gμ + gs f

where GA
μ is the gluon field, A, B, C are color indices in the adjoint representation, gs is the
strong coupling and f ABC are the structure constants of SU(3). Similar definitions hold for
the electroweak WIμν and B μν field strength tensors, for instance one has
I
Wμν
= ∂μ WνI − ∂ν WμI + gw IJK WμJ WμK ,

where gw is the SU(2)L coupling constant.

Flavour assumptions. The number of independent dimension-six operators can be unfeasibly large, if all three generations of the SM fermions are taken into account: there are
2499 in total [38], with 572 four-fermion operators that are in principle relevant for topquark physics [39]. In this analysis, we follow closely the strategy which we adopted in our
previous top-quark sector study [7] and that has been documented in the LHC Top Quark
Working Group note [32]: we implement the Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) hypothesis [40] in the quark sector as the baseline scenario. A slight difference is that instead of a
U (2)q × U (2)u × U (2)d flavour symmetry among the first two generations, we now impose
the U (2)q × U (2)u × U (3)d symmetry, under the assumption that the Yukawa couplings are
nonzero only for the top quark. This flavour assumption is consistent with the SMEFT@NLO
model [41], the implementation of automated one-loop calculation in the SMEFT which we
will use to the provide theoretical inputs for our global fit, as discussed in the next section.
As a result of the different flavour assumption, the EFT parameter space is further reduced
compared to [7]. In particular, the coefficients of operators with right-handed bottom quarks
are either set to zero or set equal to the corresponding down-quark ones. Furthermore, we then
slightly relax our assumptions by keeping the bottom and charm quark Yukawa operators in
our fit, to account for the current LHC sensitivity to these parameters. All other light quark
Yukawa operators are set to zero, since we do not expect to have any sensitivity on their
coefficients.
Concerning the leptonic sector, the adopted flavour symmetry is (U (1)` × U (1)e )3 , also
following [32]. This assumption sets all the lepton masses as well as their Yukawa couplings
to zero in the SM, while leaving independent parameters for each lepton-antilepton pair of a
given generation. This is then relaxed by including the τ Yukawa operator, to account for
the expected LHC sensitivity arising from dedicated measurements. In practice, the lepton
flavor assumptions do not have implications for the EFT fit given the constraints from Z-pole
measurements at LEP and SLC, see the discussion below.
Purely bosonic operators. Table 2.1 reports the purely bosonic dimension-six operators
that modify the production and decay of Higgs bosons as well as the interactions of the
electroweak gauge bosons. For each operator, we indicate its definition in terms of the SM
fields and the notation that we will use both for the operators and for the Wilson coefficients.
These operators modify several important Higgs boson production and decay processes that
are (or will become) accessible at the LHC, as well as the production of gauge boson pairs
both in electron-positron and in proton-proton collisions.
One can comment on some interesting features of the operators defined in Table 2.1.
To begin with, the operators OφW B and OφD are the ones often identified as the S and T
oblique parameters, though this identification is basis-dependent and is not strictly correct
in the Warsaw basis. Together with several of the two-fermion operators listed in Table 2.2,
they are severely constrained by the Z-pole and W -pole measurements available from LEP
and SLC, but with 2 linear combinations left unconstrained. These two combinations in
turn modify the electroweak triple gauge boson (TGC) couplings and the Higgs-electroweak
interactions. They are thus constrained mainly by the diboson measurements at the LEP2
and the LHC, as well as the Higgs measurements at the LHC. We will discuss this property in
more detail in the following section. The operator OW generates a TGC coupling modification
which is purely transversal and is hence constrained only by diboson data.
The rest of the bosonic operators listed in Table 2.1 modify only the Higgs boson couplings,

Table 2.1. Purely bosonic dimension-six operators that modify the production and decay of Higgs
bosons and the interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons. For each operator, we indicate its
definition in terms of the SM fields, and the notational conventions that will be used both for the
operator and for the Wilson coefficient. The operators OφW B and OφD are severely constrained by
the EWPOs together with several of the two-fermion operators from Table 2.2.

and represent degrees of freedom that are accessible only with Higgs data. First, the operators
OφW and OφB modify the interaction between Higgs bosons and electroweak gauge bosons.
At the LHC, they can be probed for example by means of the Higgs decays into weak vector
bosons, h → ZZ ∗ and h → W + W − , as well as in the vector-boson-fusion (VBF) process and
in associated production with vector bosons, hW and hZ. In addition, the OφG operator is
similar but introduces a direct coupling between the Higgs boson and gluons. It therefore
enters the Higgs total width and branching ratios, the production cross section in gluon fusion
channel, as well as the associated production channel tt̄h. Finally, the Oφd operator generates
a wavefunction correction to the Higgs boson, which rescales all the Higgs boson couplings in
a universal manner.
Two-fermion operators. Table 2.2 collects, using the same format as in Table 2.1, the
relevant Warsaw-basis operators that contain two fermion fields, either quarks or leptons,
plus a single four-lepton operator. From top to bottom, we list the two-fermion operators
involving 3rd generation quarks, those involving 1st and 2nd generation quarks, and operators
containing two leptonic fields (of any generation). We also include in this list the four-lepton
operator O`` .
The operators that involve a top-quark field, either Q (left-handed doublet) or t (righthanded singlet), are crucial for the interpretation of LHC top-quark measurements. Interestingly, all of them involve at least one Higgs-boson field, which introduces an interplay
between the top and Higgs sectors of the SMEFT. For example, the chromo-magnetic dipole
operator OtG and the dimension-six Yukawa operator Otφ are constrained by both top quark
measurements, such as tt̄h associated production, as well as Higgs measurements, such as

Higgs production through gluon fusion. Furthermore, the electroweak-dipole operators, OtW
(3)
and OtB , as well as the current operators, OφQ and Oφt , can be constrained by the associated
production of single top-quarks and Higgs bosons, as well as by the loop-induced Higgs decays
into a Zγ final state.
In Table 2.2 we also list operators that contain light quark (1st and 2nd generation) and
leptonic fields (of any generation). The light quark operators enter the Higgs production
through the V h and VBF channels, as well as the diboson processes. These operators also
modify the Higgs boson width and branching ratios. For example, the Higgs decay width to
q q̄`+ `− becomes modified by operators that induce an effective Zhq q̄ vertex, such as Oφu .
The leptonic operators are relevant for the same reason, once we account for the leptonic
(3)
decays of the Higgs and gauge bosons. In addition, indirect contributions arise from the Oφ`1 ,
(3)

Oφ`2 , and O`` operators, which modify the measurement of the Fermi constant, GF , and this
affects the extracted SM parameters. They therefore introduce a universal contribution to all
electroweak interactions, and are relevant for V h, VBF, and for the diboson channels.

Table 2.3. Additional degrees of freedom defined from linear combinations of the two-fermion operators listed in Table 2.2. The first two DoFs modify the tt̄Z couplings, while the third combination is
introduced for consistency with the first one. These are the DoFs that enter at the fit level, replacing
those marked with (*) in Table 2.2.

We point out that most of the operator coefficients defined in Table 2.2 correspond directly
to degrees of freedom used in the fit, except for three of them, which are indicated with a (*)
in the second column. Instead, following Ref. [32], three additional degrees of freedom are
defined from the linear combinations indicated in Table 2.3. These are the DoFs that enter
at the fit level, replacing those marked with a (*) in Table 2.2.
Finally, we note that, as mentioned above, here flavour universality in the leptonic sector
is not imposed, and thus the coefficients of the operators involving bilinears in the electron,
muon, and tau lepton fields are in principle independent. In total we have 23 independent
fit parameters, defined from two-fermion operators, plus in addition the four-lepton operator
c`` . However, in practice, this flexibility will not be relevant for the present fit due to the
constraints from the EWPOs, to be discussed next.
The role of electroweak precision observables. At this point, one should note that a
subset of the dimension-six operators defined in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 are already well constrained
by the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) [42] measured at the Z-pole [36] and the
W -pole at the LEP and SLC electron-position colliders. Given in particular the high accuracy
of these LEP measurements, these constraints are known to dominate in many cases when
compared to those provided by the LHC cross-sections. Specifically, the operators sensitive
8

to the EWPO are the following (with definitions presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2)

(2.4)

Note that, with i = 1, 2, 3, these add up to 16 operators, rather than the 10 which would
correspond to the flavour universal configuration in the leptonic sector.
Fourteen linear combinations of the coefficients associated to these 16 operators are constrained by the LEP EWPOs [43], leaving therefore only two linear combinations unconstrained. These two remaining unconstrained directions can be determined from the information contained in diboson production cross-sections [38, 44, 45] as well as by the Higgs
production and decay measurements.
For completeness, the 14 linear combinations of bosonic and two-fermion Wilson coefficients which are constrained by the EWPOs measured at LEP are the following:

While in this work we do not explicitly include any EWPO data in the present fit, we still
need to account for the information that they provide on the SMEFT parameter space. This
is achieved by assuming that the EWPOs are precise enough to allow us to set the 14 linear
combinations of Eq. (2.5) to zero in our fit. The remaining two degrees of freedom can be

These relations will emulate the impact of LEP EWPOs in the fit, and allow us to produce a
consistent fit without explicitly including the EWPOs.
Thanks to these 14 constraints, the 7 and 24 operators listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 respectively are then reduced to 17 independent degrees of freedom to be constrained by the
LHC experimental data and the LEP diboson cross-sections. This allows us to set bounds
on all operator coefficients listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Of course, the bounds on the 16
operators of Eq. (2.4) will be highly correlated as indicated by Eq. (2.7). When presenting
results for the independent DoFs, for example when evaluating the Fisher Information matrix
or the principal components, we will select cφW B and cφD , with the understanding that the
replacements of Eq. (2.7) have been made. Note that it has been argued that the diboson
channels at the LHC can in principle compete with EWPO [46, 47], which indicates that in
an accurate fit one should always include the full set of EWPO constraints explicitly, as has
been done, for example, in the combined Higgs/electroweak fits of [10, 21]. We however leave
this option to future work.
Four-fermion top quark operators. We finally discuss the four-quark operators which
involve the top quark fields and thus modify the production of top quarks at hadron colliders.
The dimension-six four-fermion operators sensitive to top quarks can be classified into two
categories: operators composed by four heavy quark fields (top and/or bottom quarks) and
operators composed by two light and two heavy quark fields. The physical degrees of freedom
corresponding to four-heavy and two-light-two-heavy interactions that we use in the present
analysis are constructed in terms of suitable linear combinations of the four fermion coefficients
in the Warsaw basis, whose corresponding operators are defined as
1(ijkl)
Oqq
= (q̄i γ μ qj )(q̄k γμ ql ),
3(ijkl)
Oqq

where recall that i, j, k, l are fermion generation indices. In Table 2.4 we provide the definition
of all degrees of freedom that enter the fit in terms of the coefficients of Warsaw basis operators
of Eq. (2.8). Within our flavour assumptions, the coefficients associated to different values of
the generation indices i (i = 1, 2) or j (j = 1, 2, 3) will be the same.
Comparing with our previous EFT analysis of the top quark sector [7], in this work
due to the different flavor assumptions several degrees of freedom that were used there as
independent fit parameters are now absent. In particular, the coefficients c1QtQb and c8QtQb
are set to zero. In addition, four-heavy operators that involve right-handed bottom quarks
are not free parameters anymore. The correspondence between these four-heavy degrees of

(2.9)

Furthermore, we do not have c1,8
Qb,tb in the present fit anymore. These considerations explain
why the 11 four-heavy operators of our previous study are now reduced to the 5 listed in
Table 2.4.
All in all, in total we end up with 5 degrees of freedom involving four heavy quark fields
and 14 involving two light and two heavy quark fields, for a total of 19 independent parameters
at the fit level associated to four-quark operators. The more stringent flavour assumptions
restricting the four-heavy operators imply that the constraints that we will obtain in the
present fit for the four-fermion operators will be superior, thanks to these new constraints as
well as the addition of the latest top production measurements from Run II of the LHC.
Overview of the degrees of freedom. We summarise in Table 2.5 the degrees of freedom considered in the present work. These are associated either to the Wilson coefficients
of Warsaw-basis operators or to linear combinations of those. We categorize the DoFs into
five disjoint classes, from top to bottom: four-quark (two-light-two-heavy), four-quark (fourheavy), four-lepton, two-fermion, and purely bosonic DoFs. We end up with 50 EFT coefficients that enter the theory predictions associated to the processes input to the fit, of
which 36 are independent. The 16 DoFs displayed in the last columns are subject to the 14
constraints from the EWPOs listed in Eq. (2.7), leaving only 2 independent combinations to
be constrained by the fit. When presenting results for the independent DoFs, for example
when evaluating the Fisher Information matrix, we will select cφW B and cφD , for illustration
purposes. Then in Table 2.6 we indicate the notation that will be used to indicate the EFT
coefficients listed in Table 2.5 in the subsequent sections, as well as in the released output
files with the results of the global analysis, where again only two of the 16 EFT coefficients
labelled in blue are independent fit parameters.

2.2

The top-philic scenario

The four-fermion operators defined in the previous section and listed in Table 2.4 correspond
to a specific set of assumptions concerning the flavour structure of the UV-completion of the
Standard Model. However, there exist well-motivated BSM scenarios that suggest further
restrictions in the SMEFT parameter space spanned by these four-fermion operators. Therefore, phenomenological explorations of the SMEFT would benefit from comparing results
obtained in different scenarios concerning the possible UV completion, from more restrictive
to more general.
With this motivation, we have implemented a new feature in the SMEFiT analysis framework which allows one to implement arbitrary restrictions in the EFT parameter space, for
example those motivated by specific BSM scenarios or existing constraints such as those from
EWPO, as discussed in the previous section. As a proof of concept, here we will present results
for the top-philic scenario introduced in [32]. This scenario is not constructed by imposing
a specific flavour symmetry, but rather by assuming that new physics couples predominantly
to the third-generation left-handed doublet, the third-generation right-handed up-type quark
singlet, the gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson. In other words, that new physics interacts
mostly with the top and bottom quarks as well as with the bosonic sector. The top-philic

scenario satisfies the flavour assumptions that we are imposing in this work, but is based on
a more restrictive theoretical assumption.
The restrictions in the EFT parameter space introduced by the top-philic assumption
lead to a number of relations between the DoFs listed in Table 2.5. These relations are the
following:
cQDW

3,1
= cQq
,

cQDG = cQq
= c8Qu = c8Qd ,

(2.10)

ctDG = c8tq = c8tu = c8td ,
c3,8
Qq = 0 ,
which can be implemented as an additional restriction at the fitting level. Therefore, we
now have 9 equations that relate a subset of the 14 two-heavy-two-light degrees of freedom
listed in Table 2.5 among them, which leave 5 independent two-heavy-two-light degrees of
freedom. The number of operators coupling the top quark with gauge bosons, as well as that
of the four-heavy operators, is not modified. By comparing with Table 2.5, we see that in the
top-philic scenario the EFT fit will constrain 41 DoFs, of which 27 are independent.
In principle, the top-philic assumption also implies non-trivial correlations between the
light-fermion couplings to the gauge and Higgs bosons. However, following our strategy to
include the EWPO, most of them are already set to zero, while the two remaining degrees of
freedom are not affected. The same assumptions also imply that the light fermion Yukawa
operator coefficients are proportional to the SM Yukawa couplings. As will be shown in Sect. 5,
imposing the additional relations of the top-philic scenario leads to more stringent bounds
on all the relevant Wilson coefficients, due to the fact that the same amount of experimental
information is now used to constrain a significantly more limited parameter space.

2.3

Cross-section positivity

The constraint that physical cross-sections are (semi-)positive definite quantities can also be
accounted for in global SMEFT analyses. This positivity requirement has different implications depending on whether the EFT expansion is considered up to either the linear or
quadratic level.
The expansion up to linear terms, O(Λ−2 ), does not automatically lead to positive-definite
cross sections, as in this case the new physics terms are generated by interference with the SM
amplitudes, and their sign and size directly depend on the Wilson coefficients ci . Imposing
the positivity of the cross sections will therefore set (possibly one-sided) bounds on the Wilson
coefficients. This can be easily implemented in the fitting procedure if helpful. In fact, we do
not find the need to do so, since the fitted experimental data already leads to positive-definite
cross-sections.
The expansion up to quadratic terms, O(Λ−4 ), i.e. specifically those coming from squaring
the linearly expanded amplitudes, obviously automatically leads to positive definite cross
sections. No constraints on the Wilson coefficients can therefore be obtained or need to be
imposed. On the other hand, verifying the positivity of the cross section at the quadratic level
15

provides a sanity check that the theoretical calculation of the various contributions is correctly
performed, also taking into account the MC generation uncertainties. The conditions that
have to be met are simple to obtain. Consider the SMEFT Lagrangian
L = LSM +

nop
X
ci
i=1

Λ2

(2.11)

Oi ,

where Oi stand for dimension-six operators and ci are the corresponding Wilson coefficients,
which we assume to be real. Any observable calculated using this Lagrangian can be written
as a quadratic form
Σ = c20 Σ00
+ c0 c1 Σ01 + c1 c0 Σ10 + c0 c2 Σ02 + . . .
+ c21 Σ11 + c1 c2 Σ12 + c1 c3 Σ13 + . . .
= cT * Σ * c.

(2.12)

The first line corresponds to the SM contribution, where c0 is an auxiliary coefficient that
can be set to unity at the end. The second line corresponds to the linear O(Λ−2 ) EFT
contributions, while the third line to the O(Λ−4 ) contributions. Σ is by construction a
symmetric matrix.1
Given that a physical cross-section must be either positive or null, the matrix Σ must
be semi-positive-definite. We can therefore use the Sylvester criterion that states that a
symmetric matrix is semi-positive-definite if and only if all principal minors are greater or
equal to zero. As a simple example, the constraints coming from the 2 × 2 minors are:




Σii Σjj − Σ2ij ≥ 0 ,

i, j = 0, . . . nop .

(2.13)

We have verified that the Sylvester criterion, and Eq. (2.13) in particular, are satisfied by the
EFT calculations used as input to the present analysis.

Experimental data and theoretical calculations

In this section we present the experimental measurements and the theoretical computations
used to constrain the SMEFT operators introduced in Sect. 2. We focus in turn on each of
the three groups of LHC processes that we consider in the current analysis: top quark, Higgs
boson, and gauge boson pair production.

3.1

Top-quark production data

The top-quark production measurements included in this analysis belong to four different
categories: inclusive top-quark pair production, top-quark pair production in association with
vector bosons or heavy quarks, inclusive single top-quark production, and single top-quark
production in association with vector bosons. In the following we present the datasets that
belong to each of these categories. Top-quark pair production in association with a Higgs
boson is discussed in Sect. 3.2.

Inclusive top-quark pair production. The experimental measurements of inclusive topquark pair production included in this analysis are summarised in Table 3.1. For each of
√
them, we indicate the dataset label, the center of mass energy s, the integrated luminosity
L, the final state or the specific production mechanism, the physical observable, the number
of data points ndat , and the publication reference. Measurements indicated with a (*) were
not included in our earlier analysis [7].
The bulk of the measurements correspond to datasets already included in [7]: at 8 TeV,
the ATLAS top-quark pair invariant mass distribution [48] and the CMS top-quark pair normalized invariant rapidity distribution [49], both in the lepton+jets final state, the CMS
top-quark pair normalized invariant mass and rapidity two-dimensional distribution in the
dilepton final state [50], and the ATLAS and CMS W helicity fractions [51, 52]; at 13 TeV,
the CMS top-quark pair invariant mass distributions in the lepton+jets and dilepton final
states based on integrated luminosities of up to L = 35.8 fb−1 [53–55]. In addition to these,
we now consider further top-quark pair invariant mass distributions: at 8 TeV, the ATLAS
measurement in the dilepton final state [56]; at 13 TeV, and the ATLAS and CMS measurements, respectively in the lepton+jets and dilepton final states, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of L = 35.8 fb−1 [57, 58]. We also include top-quark pair charge asymmetry measurements: the ATLAS and CMS combined dataset at 8 TeV [59], and the ATLAS dataset
at 13 TeV [60].
Although several distributions differential in various kinematic variables are available for
the measurements presented in [49, 50, 53–58], only one of them can typically be included in
the fit at a time. The reason is that experimental correlations between pairs of distributions
are unknown: including more than one distribution at a time will therefore result in a double
counting. An exception to this state of affairs is represented by the ATLAS measurement
of [48], which is provided with the correlations among differential distributions. Unfortunately,
they significantly deteriorate the fit quality when an analysis of all the available distributions
is attempted, a fact that questions their reliability (see also [61, 62]). We therefore include
only one distribution also in this case. In general, we include the invariant mass distribution
mtt̄ , whose high-energy tail is known to be particularly sensitive to deviations from the SM
expectations. For [49] we include instead the invariant rapidity distribution as in our earlier
analysis [7], due to difficulties in achieving an acceptable fit quality to mtt̄ .
The additional top-quark pair measurements considered in this work do not expand the
kinematic coverage in the EFT parameter space in comparison to those already included
in [7]. Nevertheless, they provide additional weight for the inclusive top-quark pair differential
distributions in the global fit, which are known to provide the dominant constraints on several
of the EFT coefficients. All in all, we end up with ndat = 94 data points in this category.
Additional sensitivity to EFT effects could be achieved by means of LHC Run-II measurements with an extended coverage in the invariant mass or transverse momentum. However,
differential distributions based on luminosities larger than L ' 36 fb−1 are not available yet:
the statistical precision of the data, and consequently their constraining power, remain therefore limited. For instance, the ATLAS fully hadronic final state measurement [63] is available,
but it exhibits larger uncertainties than in the cleaner lepton+jets and dilepton final states.
Furthermore, some measurements are not reconstructed at the parton level, as required in our
analysis. This is the case of the ATLAS and CMS measurements at high top-quark transverse
momentum [63, 64], that are based on reconstructing boosted topologies, and of the dilepton
distributions from ATLAS [65], that are restricted to the particle level.
Concerning theoretical calculations, the SM cross-sections are evaluated at NLO using

set is NNPDF3.1NNLO no-top [69], to avoid possible contamination between PDF and EFT
effects.2 The EFT cross-sections are evaluated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [66] combined with
the SMEFT@NLO model [41]. Unless otherwise specified, the same EFT settings will be used
also for the other processes considered in this analysis. Specifically, NLO QCD effects to the
EFT corrections are accounted systematically whenever available.
Associated top-quark pair production. Table 3.2 lists, in the same format as Table 3.1,
the experimental measurements for top quark pair production in association with heavy
quarks or weak vector bosons. The dataset considered in [7] consisted of the CMS measurements of total cross-sections for tt̄tt̄ and bb̄bb̄ at 13 TeV [72, 73], and in the ATLAS and
CMS measurements of inclusive tW and tZ production at 8 TeV and 13 TeV [74–77]. In
the present analysis, we augment this dataset with the most updated measurements of total
cross-sections for tt̄tt̄ and tt̄bb̄ production at 13 TeV: for tt̄bb̄, with the ATLAS and CMS

measurements based on L = 137 fb−1 [78, 79]; for σtot (tt̄bb̄), with the ATLAS and CMS
measurements based on L = 36 fb−1 [80, 81]. These measurements are comparatively more
precise than the measurements already included in [7] thanks to the increased luminosity.
Concerning top-quark pair production in association with an electroweak gauge boson,
we include here the ATLAS total cross-section measurements of tt̄W and tt̄Z based on L =
36 fb−1 [82], as well as the CMS differential measurements of dσ(tt̄Z)/dpZ
T based on L =
−1
78 fb [83], which is the first differential measurement of tt̄V associated production presented
at the LHC. We do not include the still preliminary ATLAS measurement of σtot (tt̄Z) based
on L = 139 fb−1 [84]. The tt̄V measurements are especially useful to constrain EFT effects
that modify the electroweak couplings of the top-quark. In total, we include ndat = 20 data
points in the category of tt̄ associated production with heavy quark pairs or weak vector
bosons.
Theoretical predictions are computed at NLO both in the SM and in the EFT. We use
MCFM for the SM cross-sections and SMEFT@NLO for the EFT corrections, with NLO QCD
effects accounted for exactly for the 2-fermion operators. The exception is the pZ
T distribution
in tt̄Z events, for which MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is used instead to evaluate the SM cross-section
at NLO.

Table 3.3. Same as Table 3.1, now for inclusive single t production both in the t- and the s-channels.

Inclusive single top-quark production. We now move to consider the inclusive production of single top-quarks, both in the t-channel and in the s-channel (tW associated production
is discussed separately below). Table 3.3 displays the information on the experimental data for
these processes that is being considered in the present analysis. The dataset in this category
that was already included in our previous analysis [7] consisted, at 8 TeV, of the t-channel total
cross-sections and in the top-quark rapidity differential distributions from CMS [85, 86] and
from ATLAS [87], and in the s-channel total cross-sections from ATLAS [88] and CMS [89]; at
13 TeV, in the t-channel total cross-sections and top-quark rapidity differential distributions
from ATLAS [90] and CMS [91, 92].
Here we augment this dataset with one additional measurement, namely the CMS topquark rapidity differential cross-section for t-channel single top-quark production at 13 TeV
based on L = 35.9 fb−1 [93]. As customary, we consider the distribution reconstructed at
parton level for consistency with the theoretical predictions. No differential measurements of
single top-quark production based on the Run II dataset have been presented by ATLAS so
far. Furthermore, while the ATLAS and CMS combination of total cross-sections for single
top-quark production at 7 TeV and 8 TeV has been presented in [94], here we include instead
the original individual measurements. We end up with ndat = 27 data points in this category.
The calculation of the SM and EFT cross-sections has been carried out with the same
settings as for inclusive tt̄ production. Note that for single top we work with a 5-flavour
number scheme (5FNS) where the bottom quark is considered as massless, and thus enters
the initial state of the reaction, see [95] for details. The NNLO QCD K-factors in the 5FNS
are obtained from the calculation of [96].
Associated single top-quark production with weak bosons. Finally, in Table 3.4 we
consider the experimental measurements on the associated production of single top-quarks
together with a weak gauge boson V . The dataset in this category that was already part of
our original analysis [7] consisted of the total inclusive cross-sections for tW production by

ATLAS and CMS at 8 TeV [97, 98] and at 13 TeV [99, 100], as well as in the ATLAS and CMS
measurements of the tZ total cross-sections at 13 TeV [101, 102], in the latter case restricted
to the fiducial region in the W b`+ `− q final state.
In addition to these datasets, we include here several new measurements of tW and tZ
production. First of all, we include a new total cross-section measurement of tW production
by ATLAS at 8 TeV [103]. This measurement is carried out in the single lepton channel,
and thus does not overlap with [97], which instead was obtained in the two leptons with one
central b-jet channel. Then we include the ATLAS measurement of the fiducial cross-section
for tZ production [104] using the t`+ `− q final state (in the tri-lepton channel) based on the
full Run II luminosity of L = 139 fb−1 . In this analysis, the cross-section measurement
differs from the background-only hypothesis (dominated by tt̄Z and dibosons) by more than
five sigma and thus corresponds to an observation of this process. We also consider the
corresponding measurement from CMS, where the observation of tZ associated production is
reported by reconstructing the t`+ `− q final state [105] based on a luminosity of L = 77.4 fb−1 .
No differential distributions for tZ have been reported so far. The settings of the theoretical
calculations for these ndat = 9 data points are the same as of [7].
In addition to these measurements, both ATLAS and CMS have measured differential
distributions in tW production at 13 TeV based on a luminosity of L = 35.9 fb−1 [106, 107].
However, these measurements are reported at the particle rather than at the parton level,
and therefore they are not suitable for inclusion in the present analysis, which is restricted to
top-quark level observables. We also note that CMS has reported on the EFT interpretation
of the associated production of top-quarks, including with vector bosons, in an analysis based
on a luminosity of L = 41.5 fb−1 [108].
Combining the four categories discussed above, the present analysis contains ndat = 150
top-quark cross-sections, to be compared with ndat = 103 in [7]. In Sect. 5.3 we will quantify

3.2

Higgs production and decay

We now turn to the Higgs boson production and decay measurements. We consider first
inclusive cross-section measurements, presented as signal strengths normalised to the SM
predictions, and then differential distributions and STXS measurements.
Signal strengths. First of all, we consider the inclusive Higgs boson production signal
strengths μfi measured by ATLAS and CMS from LHC Run I and Run II. These signal
strengths are defined for each combination of production and decay channels in terms of
cross-section σi and the branching fraction Bf as
μfi

that is, as the ratio of the experimentally measured production cross-sections in specific
decay channels to the corresponding (state-of-the-art) SM predictions. These inclusive signal
strengths can also be expressed as

in terms of the partial and total decay widths. The measurements of signal strengths that
we consider in the present analysis are collected in Table 3.5. In contrast to the differential
distributions and STXS discussed below, these signal strengths are typically extrapolated to
the full phase space and do not include selection or acceptance cuts.
For the LHC Run I, we take into account the inclusive measurements of Higgs boson
production and decay rates from the ATLAS and CMS combination based on the full 7 and
8 TeV datasets [109]. Specifically, we include the 20 measurements presented in Table 8
of [109]. These measurements correspond to five different production channels (ggF, VBF,
W h, Zh, tth) for five final states (γγ, ZZ, W W , τ τ , bb̄), excluding those combinations that
22

are either not measured with a meaningful precision or not measured at all. We account for
the experimental correlations between the measured signal strengths using the information
provided in [109]. In addition to these ATLAS+CMS combination results from Run I, we also
include two more signal strengths measurements from Run I, namely the ATLAS constraints
on the Zγ and μμ decays from [110].
For the LHC Run II, we consider the ATLAS measurement of signal strengths corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L = 80 fb−1 [111], and the CMS measurement corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of L = 35.9 fb−1 [112]. As in the case of the Run I signal strengths,
we keep into account correlations between the various production and final state combinations. The ATLAS combination contains 16 signal strengths for the ggF, VBF, V h and tt̄h
production channels and the γγ, ZZ, W W , τ τ and bb̄ final states. As in the case of Run I,
measurements are sometimes not available for all final states for a given production channel,
for example the h → bb̄ decay is not available for ggF while τ τ is not provided in the case
of V h associate production. The CMS analysis contains 24 signal strengths measurements
in the ggF, VBF, W h, Zh, and tt̄h production channels for the same final states as in the
ATLAS case. Results for the W W , ZZ andγγ final states are available for all production
channels, while for the other final states, μμ, τ τ , and bb̄, signal strength measurements are
only available for specific production channels. In total, we have ndat = 62 measurements of
Higgs inclusive signal strengths from Runs I and II.
Concerning the theoretical calculations corresponding to these measurements, the SM
production cross-sections and decay branching fractions are obtained from the associated
experimental publications. In turn, these represent the most updated available predictions,
and are provided in the LHC Higgs Cross-Section Working Group (HXSWG) reports [113–
115]. As in the case of top-quark production processes, EFT calculations are obtained at NLO
QCD using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [66] with the SMEFT@NLO model. Additional details about
the implementation of EFT corrections to the Higgs signal strengths are provided in App. B.
Differential distributions and STXS. Table 3.6 summarizes the experimental measurements of differential distributions and STXS for Higgs boson production and decay at the LHC
considered in the present analysis. Whenever one has a potential double counting between
a signal strength measurement and the corresponding differential distribution or STXS measurement, we always select the latter, which provides more information on the EFT parameter
space due to its enhanced kinematical sensitivity.
To being with, we consider the ATLAS and CMS differential distributions in the Higgs
boson kinematic variables obtained from the combination of the h → γγ, h → ZZ, and (in
the CMS case) h → bb̄ final states at 13 TeV based on L = 36 fb−1 [116, 117]. Specifically, we
consider the differential distributions in the Higgs boson transverse momentum phT . These distributions are particularly sensitive probes of new physics, for instance through new particles
circulating in the gluon-fusion loop.
We also include the ATLAS measurement of the associated production of Higgs bosons,
V h, in the h → bb̄ final state at 13 TeV [118]. These measurements, performed in kinematic
fiducial volumes defined in the simplified template cross-section framework, correspond to an
integrated luminosity of L = 79.8 fb−1 . Specifically, here we include the data corresponding
to the 5-POI (parameters of interest) category, which refers to three cross-sections for Zh

Z
production in the bins 75 < pZ
T < 150 GeV, 150 < pT < 250 GeV, and pT > 250 GeV,

T > 250 GeV. Gauge bosons are reconstructed by means of their leptonic decays.
Then we also include selected differential measurements presented in the ATLAS Run II
Higgs combination paper [111]. Specifically, we include the measurements of Higgs production
in gluon fusion, gg → h, in different bins of phT and in the number of jets in the event. These
(SM)
measurements are presented as σi × BZZ /BZZ , since the ZZ branching fraction is used to
normalise the data. We include the 0-jet cross-section, the 1-jet cross-section for phT < 60
GeV, 60 ≤ phT ≤ 120 GeV, and 120 ≤ phT ≤ 200 GeV, and the ≤ 1 jet and ≤ 2 jet cross-sections
for phT ≥ 200 GeV and phT < 200 GeV respectively.
Furthermore, we consider the differential Higgs boson production measurements presented
by CMS at 13 TeV based on an integrated luminosity of L = 77.4 fb−1 and corresponding to
the final state γγ [119]. The STXS measurements associated to different final-state topologies
and kinematic values such as phT are presented. These inclusive measurements are dominated
by the gluon-fusion production channel. Note that the CMS diphoton measurement of [119]
supersedes [120], which was based on the 2016 dataset only.
Whenever available, the information on the experimental correlated systematic uncertainties is included. As mentioned above, the SM theoretical predictions are taken from
the HXSWG reports [113–115]. In total, we include ndat = 35 measurements of differential
cross-sections and STXS on Higgs production and decay from the LHC Run II.
We note that additional Higgs production and decay measurements have been recently
presented by ATLAS and CMS based on the full Run II luminosity of L = 139 fb−1 . Two
examples of these are the CMS measurement of the phT distribution in the h → W W fully
leptonic final state [121] and the updated ATLAS measurement of V h associated production in
the bb̄ final state [122]. These measurements are however not expected to modify significantly
the results of the present analysis, since the constraints they provide on the EFT parameter
space are already covered by other measurements, and their inclusion is left for future work.

Diboson production from LEP and the LHC

We complement the constraints provided by the Higgs data with those provided by diboson
production cross-sections measured by LEP and the LHC. The dataset is summarised in Table 3.7. To begin with, we consider the LEP-2 legacy measurements of W W production [123].
Specifically, we include the cross-sections differential in cos θW in four different bins in the
√
√
center of mass energy, from s = 182 GeV up to s = 206 GeV. Here θW is defined as the
polar angle of the produced W − boson with respect to the incoming electron beam direction.
Each set of bins with a different center-of-mass energy correspond to a different integrated
√
luminosity, ranging between L = 163.9 pb−1 and 630.5 pb−1 . For each value of s, there are
10 bins in cos θW , adding up to a total of ndat = 40 data points. The theoretical calculations
of the SM predictions, which include higher-order electroweak but not NLO QCD corrections,
are also taken from [123]. For this process, the squared terms in the EFT proportional to
ci cj /Λ−4 are small and will be neglected.
Concerning the LHC datasets, we include measurements of the differential distributions
for W ± Z production at 13 TeV from ATLAS [127] and CMS [126] based on a luminosity
of L = 36.1 fb−1 . In both cases, the two gauge bosons are reconstructed by means of the
0
fully leptonic final state, whereby events of the type W Z → `+ `− `( )± are selected. The
different leptonic final states are then combined into an inclusive measurement. For the
ATLAS measurement three fiducial distributions are presented, respectively differential in
Z
WZ
pW
T , pT and mT . As indicated in Table 3.7, in this analysis, our baseline choice will be to

Z = 600 GeV. In
include the mT Z distribution, which extends up to transverse masses of mW

In addition to these measurements, we also consider the differential distributions for
W W production from ATLAS at 13 TeV based on a luminosity of L = 36.1 fb−1 [125]. Events
are selected by requiring one electron and one muon in the final state, corresponding to the
decay mode W W → e± νμ± ν. Several differential distributions in the fiducial region are provided, including meμ , peμ
T and |yeμ |. Here our baseline choice will be the meμ distribution, the
invariant mass of the dilepton system, which reaches values of up to meμ ' 1 TeV. The total
number of data points in the LHC diboson category is ndat = 30.
Other diboson measurements from the LHC have been presented but their EFT interpretation is left for future work. For instance, the data for the CMS differential distributions of
W W production at 13 TeV based on L = 36.1 fb−1 [128] is still preliminary. ATLAS has presented recent measurements of the differential cross-sections in four-lepton events in 13 TeV

based on L = 139 fb−1 [129], though here the measured distributions receive contributions
from single Z and Higgs boson production, in addition to those from ZZ production.
The theoretical predictions for the SM cross-sections of these LHC diboson processes are
accurate to NNLO QCD and were computed with MATRIX [130]. The EFT contributions
for this process include NLO QCD corrections and take into account the constraints from
Eq. (2.5) to express the calculation in terms of only three Wilson coefficients, one being the
triple-gauge operator cW W W and the other two the purely bosonic coefficients cφD and cφW B .
This choice is ultimately arbitrary and has no physical implications; any other two coefficients
out of Eq. (2.4) would lead to the same results. Its only motivation is to facilitate the event
generation of the diboson processes.

Dataset and theory overview and EFT sensitivity

We conclude this section by presenting an overview of the datasets considered (and of the
corresponding theoretical calculations), summarizing their dependence on the EFT coefficients
defined in Sect. 2, and quantifying the sensitivity that each process has on these coefficients
by means of information geometry.
Dataset overview. In Table 3.8 we summarise the number of data points in our baseline
dataset for each of the data categories and processes considered in this analysis, as well as the
total per category and the overall total. We include 150, 97, and 70 cross-sections from topquark production, Higgs boson production and decay, and diboson production cross-sections
from LEP and the LHC respectively in the baseline dataset, for a total of 317 cross-section
measurements.

Overview of theoretical calculations. Table 3.9 displays a summary of the theoretical
calculations used for the description various datasets included in the present analysis. We
indicate, for both the SM and the SMEFT contributions to the cross-sections, the perturbative
accuracy and the codes used to produce the corresponding theoretical predictions.
Dependence on the EFT coefficients. In order to interpret the results of the global
EFT analyses which will be presented in Sect. 5, it is useful to collect the dependence of the
various datasets described in this section with respect to the degrees of freedom defined in
Sect. 2. Table 3.10 indicates which EFT coefficients contribute to the theoretical description
of each of the processes considered in this analysis. Recall that the 16 coefficients listed in
Eq. (2.4) are related among them by the EWPO relations, and that only two of them are
independent.
In Table 3.10 we display from top to bottom the coefficients associated to the two-lighttwo-heavy, four-heavy, four-lepton, two-fermion plus bosonic, and purely bosonic dimensionsix operators. The Higgs measurements are separated between the Run I and Run II datasets,
and in the latter case also between signal strengths and differential distributions and STXS.
A check mark outside (inside) brackets indicates that a given process constrains the corresponding coefficients starting at O(Λ−2 ) (O(Λ−4 )) at LO. Entries labelled with (b) indicate
that the sensitivity to the associated coefficients enters via bottom-initiated processes, which
arise due to contributions from the b-PDF in the 5FNS adopted here.
Several observations can be drawn from this table. First of all, we observe that the
four-heavy coefficients are constrained only by the tt̄QQ̄ production data, either tt̄tt̄ or tt̄bb̄.
Such measurements also depend on the 2-light-2-heavy operators, as well as on ctG , although
in practice this correlation is small. Furthermore, the four-heavy coefficients are essentially
left undetermined at O Λ−2 , and can only be meaningfully constrained only the quadratic
corrections are accounted for. One can also note how the two-light-two-heavy operators are
constrained by top-quark pair production (inclusive and in association with vector bosons)
as well as by the tt̄h production measurements. As will be shown below, by far the dominant
constraints on these coefficients arise from the differential distributions in inclusive top quark
pair production.
Concerning the two-fermion operators, most of them are constrained both by top and
by Higgs production process. Recall that the top and Higgs sectors are connected, among
others, by means of the gluon-fusion production process (with its virtual top-quark loop) as
well as by tt̄h associated production. In particular, we note that ctφ , which modifies the
top Yukawa coupling, is constrained by these Higgs production measurements. The purely
bosonic operators exhibit sensitivity only to Higgs and diboson processes, since these do not
affect the properties of top quarks. The diboson data is uniquely sensitive to the triple-gauge
coefficient cW W W , which modifies the triple (and quartic) electroweak gauge couplings, as
well as to cφD and cφW B , which are also constrained by Higgs data.
The Fisher matrix and information geometry. The information presented in Table 3.10 does not allow one to compare the sensitivity brought in by different datasets on
a given EFT coefficient. To achieve this, here we adopt the ideas underlying information
geometry [131] and define the Fisher information matrix Iij as
∂ 2 ln f (σexp |c)
Iij (c) = −E

∂ci ∂cj

where E[ ] indicates the expectation value and f (σexp |c) indicates the relation between a
set of experimental measurements and the assumed true values of the EFT coefficients c.
The covariance matrix in the EFT parameter space, Cij (c), is then bounded by the Fisher

For a given set of EFT coefficients, comparing the values of Iij between different datasets
highlights those which provide the highest information. The larger the entries of the Fisher
matrix, the better (smaller uncertainty) that these coefficients can be constrained by the data
considered. The Fisher information matrix can also be understood as a metric in model space.

The diagonal entries of the Fisher matrix Iii are then given by the sum over a given dataset (or
group of processes) of the square of the linear EFT cross-sections over the total experimental
uncertainty. In the specific case of one-parameter fits, the Cramer-Rao bound reads

which, provided that the sum is over the global dataset, can be used to cross-check the results
of individual (one-parameter) fits.
One should emphasize that the absolute size of the entries of the Fisher matrix does not
contain physical information: one is always allowed to redefine the overall normalisation of
(eft)
0(eft)
(eft)
0(eft)
an operator such that ci σm,i = c0i σm,i , with c0i = Bi ci and σm,i = σm,i /Bi with Bi being
arbitrary constants. However, the relative value of Iii between two groups of processes is
independent of the choice of operator normalisation and thus conveys meaningful information.
For this reason, in the following we present results for the Fisher information matrix such
that the sum of the diagonal entries associated to a given EFT coefficient adds up to a fixed
reference value.
Fig. 3.1 displays the values of the diagonal entries of the Fisher information matrix,
Eq. (3.9), evaluated for the same groups of processes as in Table 3.10. The normalisation
is such that the sum of the entries associated to each coefficients adds up to 100. We show
results for the Fisher information both at the linear level, Eq. (3.10), and with the quadratic
corrections included, Eq. (3.9), in the left and right panels respectively. The entries in blue
indicate those groups of processes which provide more than 75% of the information on the
corresponding EFT coefficient. Entries in grey indicate relative contributions of less than
10%.
The information contained in Fig. 3.1 is consistent with that of Table 3.10, but now we can
identify, for each coefficients, which datasets provide the dominant constraints. For instance,
one observes that the two-light-two-heavy operators are overwhelmingly constrained by inclu3,1
sive top quark pair production data, except for cQq
for which single top is the most important
set of processes. In the case of the two-fermion operators, the leading constraints typically
arise from Higgs data, in particular from the Run II signal strengths measurements. Two exceptions are cφt , which at the linear level (but not at the quadratic one) is dominated by tt̄V ,
and the chromo-magnetic operator ctG , for which inclusive tt̄ production is most important.
Also for the purely bosonic operators the Higgs data provides most of the information, except
for cW W W , as expected since this operator
is only accessible in diboson processes. Further
−4
more, one observes that the O Λ
corrections induce in most cases a moderate change in
the Fisher information matrix, but in others they can significantly alter the balance between

processes. As a representative example, some of the two-fermion operators such as cφt and
(3)
cφQ become dominated by the Higgs data only once quadratic corrections are accounted for.
Another relevant application of the Fisher information matrix is the determination of
optimal directions in the EFT parameter space by means of principal component analysis
(PCA), and in particular the assessment of whether or not the coefficients basis adopted for
the fit contains flat directions. We will discuss this related application in the Sect. 4.5.

Fitting methodology

In this section we describe the fitting methodology that is used in this work to map the
EFT parameter space spanned by the Higgs, diboson, and top quark data. In addition to
results obtained with the Monte Carlo replica fitting (MCfit) method presented in Ref. [7],
now we also determine the posterior probability distributions in the parameter space using
the MultiNest Nested Sampling (NS) algorithm [37, 132], a robust sampling procedure that
is completely orthogonal to the MCfit method and that is based on Bayesian inference.
We begin with a brief discussion of the log-likelihood function and the treatment of uncertainties that is adopted in the fit. We then present the individual χ2 profiles associated to each
EFT coefficient in the quadratic fits and discuss the eventual presence of (quasi-)degenerate
minima. Subsequently, the main features of the NS and MCFit strategies used in the global
fit are summarized, including several improvements that have been implemented in the latter technique. The results obtained with the two methods are also benchmarked. Finally,
we carry out a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the linear combinations of
parameters that have the highest and lowest variabilities given our global dataset and assess
the possible presence of flat directions.

4.1

(4.1)

i,j=1

(th)

where σi
and σi (c) are the central experimental data and corresponding theoretical
predictions for the i-th cross-section, respectively. The total covariance matrix, covij , should
contain all relevant sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Assuming the latter
are normally distributed, and that they are uncorrelated with the experimental uncertainties,
this total covariance matrix can be expressed as a sum of the separate experimental and
theoretical covariance matrices [133, 134],
(exp)

covij = covij

(th)

+ covij .

(4.2)

As usual, the experimental covariance matrix is constructed from all sources of statistical and
systematic uncertainties that are made available by the experiments (as discussed in Sect. 3).
Moreover, the correlated multiplicative uncertainties are treated via the 't0 ' prescription [135]
in the fit, while the standard experimental definition is used to quote the resulting χ2 values.
Concerning the theoretical covariance matrix, cov(th) , its contributions depend on the
specific type of processes considered. In the case of the top quark and LHC diboson production
33

cross-sections, we compute the SM predictions using the best possible theoretical accuracy. In
doing so, we also evaluate the uncertainty associated to the input PDFs and their correlations,
as discussed in Ref. [7]. These computations are based on the NNPDF3.1 no-top fit [69], a
global PDF determination based on a dataset that excludes all measurements that are used
in the present SMEFT analysis.
For the Higgs production and decay measurements, we take instead the SM predictions
from the experimental publications, which in turn are collected from the HXSWG reports.
In such a case, the total theory uncertainty is available, which includes both PDF errors
and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs). The total theory uncertainty for Higgs
measurements is therefore included in the fit covariance matrix by means of the correlation
prescription provided in the corresponding ATLAS and CMS publications.

4.2

Individual fits from the χ2 profiles

Individual (one-parameter) fits correspond to varying a single EFT coefficient while keeping
the rest fixed to their SM values. While such fits neglect the correlations between the different
coefficients, they provide a useful baseline for the global analysis, since there the CL intervals
will be by construction looser (or at best, similar) as compared to those of the one-parameters
fits. They are also computationally inexpensive, as they can be carried out analytically from
a scan of the χ2 profile without resorting to numerical methods. Another benefit is that they
facilitate the comparison between different EFT analyses, which may adopt different fitting
bases but whose individual bounds should be similar provided they are based on comparable
data sets and theoretical calculations.
In the scenario where a single EFT coefficient, cj , is allowed to vary while the rest are set
to zero, the theoretical cross-section (for Λ = 1 TeV) given by Eq. (3.7) simplifies to
(eft)

(eft)

(th)
(sm)
σm
(cj ) = σm
+ cj σm,j + c2j σm,jj ,

(4.3)

which results in a quartic polynomial form for the χ2 when inserted into Eq. (4.1), namely
χ2 (cj ) =

4
X

ak (cj )k .

(4.4)

k=0

Restricting the analysis to the linear order in the EFT expansion further simplifies Eq. (4.4)
to a parabolic form,
χ (cj ) =
2

2
X

ak (cj )k = χ20 + b(cj − cj,0 )2 ,

(4.5)

k=0

where cj,0 is the value of cj at the minimum of the parabola, and in this case linear error
propagation (Gaussian statistics) is applicable.
To determine the values of the quartic polynomial coefficients ak in Eq. (4.4), it is sufficient
to fit this functional form to a scan of the χ2 profile obtained by varying the EFT coefficient
cj when all other coefficients are set to their SM value. The associated 95% CL interval to
the coefficient cj can then be determined by imposing the condition
χ2 (cj ) − χ2 (cj,0 ) ≡ ∆χ2 ≤ 5.91 .

(4.6)

We note that if the size of the quadratic O Λ−4 corrections is sizable, there will be more
than one solution for cj,0 and one might end up with pairwise disjoint CL intervals.

Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 display the results of quartic polynomial fits to the χ2 profiles obtained
in the one-parameter scans of each EFT coefficient, based on the ndat = 317 data points
of the global dataset and the baseline theory settings (where higher-order QCD and EFT
corrections are accounted for). Here the absolute χ2 is evaluated with the t0 prescription,
and we also display the corresponding 95% CL ranges (vertical line) and the SM expectation
(horizontal line). We show the 34 profiles associated to the independent EFT coefficients in
Table 2.5 which are not constrained by the EWPOs. These profiles are shown in the following
order: four-heavy, two-light-two-heavy, two-fermion, and purely bosonic coefficients.
From the χ2 profiles displayed in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 one can observe, on the one hand, how
for several of the coefficients the parabolic approximation performs reasonably well, indicating
the dominance of the linear EFT corrections. On the other hand, other coefficients deviate
from the parabolic behaviour in a striking manner, including several degrees of freedom that
exhibit two quasi-degenerate solutions, one being "SM-like" and the other distinctly non-zero.
It is important to identify in particular which coefficients display such degenerate solutions
in the one-parameter fits, since these might lead to a multi-modal posterior distributions in
the case of the global analysis.
From the inspection of these χ2 profiles one can identify three categories of EFT coefficients
whose individual profiles are poorly described by the parabolic approximation. First of all, one
has the case of coefficients such as the four-heavy operators, for which a quartic profile with
two quasi-degenerate solutions distributed symmetrically around the SM value is observed.
Secondly, there are coefficients such as cW W W , ctZ , and c1tu which display a second solution
far from the SM-like one but which corresponds to higher values of the χ2 , and hence does not
modify the calculation of the CL intervals. We note that close to these absolute minima, the
parabolic approximation can be reliably adopted. In both cases, the resulting CL intervals
remain non-disjoint. Thirdly, one finds coefficients that exhibit quasi-degenerate solutions
leading to disjoint CL intervals, where again one solution is SM-like and the other is far from
the SM value. Examples of this category are the operators that modify the bottom, charm,
and tau lepton Yukawa interactions, cφb , cφc , and cφτ , and the purely bosonic operator
cφd . Such degenerate solutions are likely to propagate to the global fit where all operators
are simultaneously varied, and indeed as will be discussed in Sect. 5 the presence of these
quasi-degenerate minima on the one-parameter fits has consequences at the level of posterior
probability distributions in the global case.
Another useful application of the parameter bounds obtained from these individual fits is
to help defining in an automated manner the suitable initial sampling ranges for each EFT
coefficient in the global fits based on the MCfit and NS approaches. With this motivation,
the individual bounds corresponding to a given input dataset and settings of the theoretical calculations are evaluated by default before each fitting run. Let us also mention that
the bounds on the EFT coefficients obtained with the method presented here for the oneparameter analyses (quartic fits to the χ2 profiles) are found to be in agreement with the
corresponding results obtained the NS and MCfit approaches.

4.3

Nested Sampling

The main approach that is adopted in this work to constrain the EFT parameter space is
Nested Sampling (NS), specifically the version implemented in the MultiNest algorithm [37].
In comparison to MCfit, which is an optimisation problem aimed to determine the best-fit
values for each of the replicas, NS is based on sampling the figure of merit χ2 to determine its
37

dependence on the Wilson coefficients and locate the region of maximum likelihood. Since NS
is completely independent from the MCfit procedure, its availability makes possible validating
the robustness of the resulting bounds in EFT parameter space via two orthogonal methods.
The starting point of NS is Bayes' theorem, which allows one to evaluate the probability
distribution of a set of parameters c associated to a model M(c) given a set of experimental
measurements D,
P (D|M, c)P (c|M)
P (c|D, M) =
.
(4.7)
P (D|M)
Here P (c|D, M) represents the posterior probability of the model parameters given the assumed model and the observed experimental data, P (D|M, c) = L(c) is the likelihood (conditional probability) of the experimental measurements given the model and a specific choice
of parameters, and P (c|M) = π(c) is the prior distribution for the model parameters. The
denominator in Eq. (4.7), P (D|M) = Z, is known as the Bayesian evidence and ensures the
normalisation of the posterior distribution,
Z=

Z

L(c)π(c)dc ,

(4.8)

where the integration is carried out over the domain of the model parameters c.
The key ingredient of Nested Sampling is to utilise the ideas underlying Bayesian inference
to map the n-dimensional integral over the prior density in model parameter space π(c)dc,
where n represents the dimensionality of c, into a one-dimensional function of the form
X(λ) =

Z

π(c)dc .
{c:L(c)>λ}

(4.9)

In this expression, the prior mass X(λ) corresponds to the (normalised) volume of the prior
density π(c)dc associated with values of the model parameters that lead to a likelihood
L(c) greater than the parameter λ. Note that by construction, the prior mass X decreases
monotonically from the limiting value X = 1 to X = 0 as λ is increased. The integration
of X(λ) extends over the regions in the model parameter space contained within the fixedlikelihood contour defined by the condition L(c) = λ. This property allows the evidence to
be expressed as,
Z
Z=

1

L(X)dX ,

0

(4.10)

where L(X) is defined as the inverse function of X(λ), which always exists provided the
likelihood is a continuous and smooth function of the model parameters. Therefore, the
transformation from c to X in Eq. (4.9) achieves a mapping of the prior distribution into
infinitesimal elements, sorted by their associated likelihood L(c).
The next step of the NS algorithm is to define a decreasing sequence of values in the prior
volume, that is now parameterised by the prior mass X. In other words, one slices the prior
volume into a large number of small regions
1 = X0 > X1 > . . . X∞ = 0 ,

(4.11)

and then evaluates the likelihood at each of these values, L = L(Xi ). This way, all of the Li
values can be summed in order to evaluate the integral for the Bayesian evidence, Eq. (4.10).
Since in general the likelihood L(c) exhibits a complex dependence on the model parameters c, the summation in Eq. (4.10) must be evaluated numerically using e.g. Monte Carlo
38

integration methods. In practice, one draws Nlive points from the parameter prior volume
π(c), known as live points, and orders the likelihood values from smallest to largest, including
the starting value of the prior mass at X0 = 1. As samples are drawn from the prior volume,
the live point with the lowest likelihood Li is removed from the set and replaced by another
live point drawn from the same prior distribution but now under the constraint that its likelihood is larger than Li . This sampling process is repeated until the entire hyper-volume π(c)
of the prior parameter space has been covered, with ellipsoids of constrained likelihood being
assigned to the live-points as the prior volume is scanned.
While the end result of the NS procedure is the estimation of the Bayesian evidence Z, as
a byproduct one also obtains a sampling of the posterior distribution associated to the EFT
coefficients expressed as
{c(k) } ,
k = 1, . . . , Nspl ,
(4.12)
with Nspl indicating the number of samples drawn by the final NS iteration. One can then
compute expectation values, variances, and correlations of the model parameters by evaluating
the MC sum over these posterior samples together with their associated weights, in the same
manner as averages are carried out over the Nrep replicas in the MCfit method.
Prior volume. An important input for NS is the choice of prior volume π(c) in the model
parameter space. In this analysis, we adopt flat priors defined by ranges in parameter space
for the coefficients c. A suitable choice of prior volume where the sampling takes place is
important to speed up the NS algorithm: a range too wide will make the optimisation less
efficient, while a range too narrow might bias the results by cutting specific regions of the
parameter space that are relevant. Furthermore, using a common range for all parameters
should be avoided, since the range of intrinsic variation will be rather different for each of the
EFT coefficients, as illustrated also by the one-parameter fits reported in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2.
Taking these considerations into account, we adopt here the following strategy. First, a
single model parameter ci is allowed to vary while all others are set to their SM value, cj = 0
(min)
for j 6= i. The χ2 (ci ) is then scanned in this direction to determine the values ci
and
(max)
2
ci
satisfying the condition χ /ndat = 4. We then repeat this procedure for all parameters
and end up with a hyper-volume defined by pairs of values
π(c) =

(min)

(max)

,

i = 1, . . . , nop ,

(4.13)

which then defines the initial prior volume. At this point, one performs an initial exploratory
NS global analysis using this volume to study the posterior probability distribution for each
EFT coefficient. Our final analysis is then obtained by manually adjusting the initial sampling ranges until the full posterior distributions are captured for the chosen prior volume.
For parameters that are essentially unconstrained in the global fit, such as the four-heavy
operators in the case of linear EFT calculations, a hard boundary of (−50, 50) is imposed (for
Λ = 1 TeV) .
Performance. In order to increase the efficiency of the posterior probability estimation by
NS, we enable the "constant efficiency mode" in MultiNest, which adjusts the total volume
of ellipsoids spanning the live points so that the sampling efficiency is close to its associated
hyperparameter set by the user. With 24 cpu cores, we are able to achieve an accurate
posterior for the linear EFT fits in around 30 minutes using 500 live points, a target efficiency
39

of 0.05, and an evidence tolerance of 0.5, which results in Nspl ' 5000 posterior samples.
To ensure the stability of our final results, we chose 1000 live points and a target efficiency
of 0.005, which yields '1.5 × 104 samples for the linear analysis and '104 samples for an
analysis that includes also the quadratic EFT corrections. With these settings, our final
global analyses containing the simultaneous determination of nop ' 36 coefficients take ∼ 3.5
hours running in 24 cpu cores, with a similar performance for linear and quadratic EFT fits.
The NS method is especially suitable to tackle parameter spaces of moderate dimensionality. Being based purely on sampling, it is not affected by limitations in minimisation methods
such as ending up in local minima. It is also more robust upon the presence of fluctuations,
and does not require specifying certain hyperparameters such as the learning rates which are
used in MCfit. The main limitation of NS is that, as in all sampling methods, the execution
times grows exponentially with nop , the dimensionality of the model parameter space. For parameter spaces of dimensionality greater than around 50, the current NS implementation that
we use becomes unpractically slow and MCfit becomes the most suitable strategy available.

4.4

The Monte Carlo replica method revisited

The SMEFiT analysis of Ref. [7] was based on the Monte Carlo replica approach (MCfit),
which in turn was inspired by the NNPDF analysis of the quark and gluon substructure of
protons. The MCfit method aims to construct a sampling of the probability distribution in
the space of the experimental data, which then translates into a sampling of the probability
distribution in the space of the EFT coefficients through an optimisation procedure where
the best-fit values of the coefficients for each replica, c(k) , are determined.

Given an experimental measurement of a hard-scattering cross-section, denoted by σi

ensuring that ri,α = ri0 ,α . It can be show that central values, variances, and covariances
evaluated by averaging over the MC replicas reproduce the corresponding experimental values.
A fit to the nop degrees of freedom c/Λ is then performed for each of the MC replicas
generated by Eq. (4.14). These best-fit values are determined from the minimisation of the
cost function

where σi (c(k) ) indicates the theoretical prediction for the i-th cross-section evaluated with
the k-th set of EFT coefficients. This process results in a collection of c(k) best-fit coefficient
values from which estimators such as expectation values, variances, and correlations are evaluated. The overall fit quality is then evaluated using Eq. (4.1), where the central experimental
values are compared to the mean theoretical prediction computed by the resulting fit replicas.
40

As mentioned in Sect. 4.1, various theoretical uncertainties are also included in the χ2
definition for some datasets. A consistent treatment of theoretical uncertainties in the fitting procedure means that these are not only included in the fit via the covariance matrix
in Eqs. (4.15), but also in the corresponding replica generation. In other words, the replicas are sampled according to a multi-Gaussian distribution defined by the total covariance
matrix Eq. (4.2) which receives contributions both of experimental and of theoretical origin.
We therefore account for such errors in the generation of Monte Carlo replicas [133] using
Eq. (4.14).
There are numerous advantages of using the MCfit method for global EFT analyses. First,
it does not require specific assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the
fit parameters, and in particular does not rely on the Gaussian approximation. Secondly, the
computational cost scales in a much milder way with the number of operators nop included
in the fit as compared to NS. Thirdly, it can be used to assess the impact of new datasets in
the fit a posteriori with the Bayesian reweighting formalism.
In comparison with [7], several improvements have been implemented to increase the
efficiency and accuracy of the MCfit procedure used in this analysis:
Optimisation. In the top quark sector analysis of [7], the minimisation of Eq. (4.15) was
achieved by a gradient descent method which relies on local variations of the error function.
This choice is advantageous since E (k) is at most a quartic form of the fit parameters, see
Eq. (4.4) and its generalisation to multiple operators, and therefore evaluating its gradient is
computationally efficient.
Since in the present analysis our parameter space is more complex, the optimiser that
we use now to determine the best-fit values of the degrees of freedom c(k) within MCfit is
a trust-region algorithm trust-constr available in the SciPy package. An advantage of
using trust-constr in this context is that it allows one to provide the optimiser with any
combination of constraints on the coefficients, including existing bounds. This is a rather
useful feature, since in many cases of interest one would like to restrict the EFT parameter
space based on theoretical considerations, such as when accounting for the LEP EWPOs or
in the top-philic scenario discussed in Sect. 2.
Initial sampling range and bounds. For each MC replica fit, the initial values of the fit
coefficients c(k) are initialised at random within a pre-defined range. This sampling range,
as well as the boundaries imposed on the minimisation procedure for the poorly constrained
parameters, are taken to be the same as those used in the NC procedure. That is, the
sampling ranges for the global fits are derived from a one-parameter χ2 scanning procedure
subsequently inflated to cover a sufficiently large parameter hyper-volume.
Cross-validation. Given the large dimensionality of the considered EFT parameter space,
it is conceivable that the optimiser algorithm ends up fitting the statistical fluctuations of the
experimental data rather than the underlying physical law. One way to prevent the minimiser
from over-fitting the data is to use look-back cross-validation stopping. In this method, each
replica dataset is randomly split with equal probability into two disjoint sets, known as the
training and validation sets. Only the data points in the training set are then used to compute
the figure of merit being minimised, Eq. (4.15), while the data points in the validation set
are monitored alongside the fit. The random assignment of the data points to the training or

Figure 4.3. The best-fit values and 95% CL intervals for a global fit based on linear EFT calculations,
comparing the outcome of the NS and MCfit methods. We display the results corresponding to the
50 coefficients listed in Table 2.5 (except for c`` = 0), of which 36 are independent fit parameters,

validation sets is different for each MC replica, and the splitting only occurs for experiments
that contain more than 5 bins in the distribution. The fit is run for a fixed large number of
iterations, and then the optimal stopping point of the fit is then determined as the iteration
(k)
for which the figure of merit evaluated on the validation set, Eval , exhibits a global minimum.
All in all, it is found that the risk of over-fitting is small and that MCfit results with and
without cross-validation applied are reasonably similar.
Quality selection criteria. One disadvantage of optimisation strategies such as MCfit is
that as the parameter space space is increased, the minimiser might sometimes converge on a
local, rather than on the global, minimum. This is specially problematic in the quadratic EFT
fits which often display quasi-degenerate minima, as illustrated by the χ2 profiles of Figs. 4.1
and 4.2. For this reason, it is important to implement post-fit quality selection criteria that
indicate when a fitted replica should be kept and when it should be discarded. Here, a MC
(k)
(k)
replica is kept if the total error function of the replica dataset, Etot , satisfies Etot ≤ 3.
Benchmarking. Fig. 4.3 compares the outcome of global fits obtained with either the NS
or MCfit method, all other settings identical. Specifically, here we show the best-fit values
and 95% CL intervals for global fits based on linear EFT calculations. We provide the results
corresponding to the 50 coefficients listed in Table 2.5 (except for c`` , which is set to zero by
the EWPOs) of which 36 are independent fit parameters. We will further discuss the physical
interpretation of these results in Sect. 5, here we only aim to establish that the two methods
indeed lead to equivalent results.
The comparison of Fig. 4.3 demonstrates that in general the two methods are in excellent
agreement, both in terms of best-fit values and of the corresponding uncertainties. This said,
for specific coefficients one observes small differences, with MCfit in general tending to provide

somewhat looser bounds. The reason for this behaviour is that optimisation-based methods
such as MCfit can be distorted by fitting inefficiencies, such as when the optimiser finds a
local, rather than global, minimum. This phenomenon is further illustrated in Fig. 4.4, which
compares the χ2 distributions evaluated over replicas and posterior samples in the MCfit
and NC methods respectively. We observe that the MCfit distribution exhibits broader tails,
implying that the bounds obtained this way might in some cases be slightly over-conservative.
Fig. 4.3, as well as the corresponding benchmark comparison for fits based on quadratic
EFT calculations, demonstrates that results obtained with either NS or MCfit are statistically
equivalent. In the rest of this work, we will adopt NS as the baseline method, since its not
affected by potential inefficiencies in the minimisation procedure and, as discussed above, can
produce global fits within a reasonable execution time.

Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) represents a valuable tool to identify the combinations
of degrees of freedom that exhibit the largest and smallest variabilities in a linear algebra
problem. This identification has many applications, for instance, a large gap in variability
suggests that the effective dimensionality of the problem is smaller than the nominal one, and
thus dimensional reduction methods are advantageous to simplify the solution. Furthermore,
directions in the parameter space with very small variability are difficult to constrain from data
and are identified with flat directions. Such flat directions might compromise the reliability
of the obtained results i.e. in Hessian EFT fits.3
3

The PCA method can also be exploited to efficiently carry out linear SMEFT fits [136].

43

Here we apply the PCA technique combined with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
to global fits based on linear EFT calculations. The goal is to ascertain the presence of
possible flat directions, identify large gaps in variability between the principal components,
and determine the relation between the physical fitting basis and these principal components.
The starting point is the expression for the cross-section as a function of the EFT coefficients,
Eq. (3.7), truncated at the linear order,

where recall that we have set Λ = 1 TeV. We then define a matrix K of dimensions ndat × nop
(eft)
and (dimensionless) components Kmi = σm,i /δexp,m , where δexp,m is the same total experimental error that appears in the evaluation of the Fisher information matrix Eq. (3.9). By
means of SVD, we can decompose this matrix K as
K = UWV † ,

(4.17)

where U (V ) is a ndat ×ndat (nop ×nop ) unitary matrix and W is an ndat ×nop diagonal matrix
with semi-positive real entries, called the singular values, which are ordered by decreasing
magnitude. The larger a singular value, the higher the variability of its principal component
and the higher the likelihood that this component will be well constrained from the fit.
The elements of the symmetric matrix V in Eq. (4.17) contain the principal components
associated to each of the nop singular values. These correspond to a linear superposition of
the original coefficients, that is, we have that

k = 1, . . . , nop ,

a2ki = 1 ∀k

(4.18)

where the larger the value of the squared coefficient a2kl , the larger the relative weight of the
associated EFT coefficient in this specific (normalised) principal component. By means of
the matrix V (and its inverse), one can rotate between the original fitting basis and the one
defined by the principal components.
Fig. 4.5 displays the singular values λi , that is, the elements of the diagonal matrix W
in the decomposition of Eq. (4.17), for the nop = 36 principal components associated to the
global fit settings summarised in Tables 2.5 and 3.8. From the definition of the matrix K, a
singular value λi ' 1 corresponds to a direction in the parameter space where the magnitude
of the (linear) EFT corrections is of the same size as the associated experimental uncertainties.
We observe that there are three flat directions (principal components with vanishing singular
value), which as shown below can be associated to linear combinations of the four-heavy operators. Except for these three flat directions, there are no large hierarchies in the distribution
of singular values, indicating that the physical dimensionality of our problem coincides with
that of the chosen fitting basis. The principal component with the highest singular value is
dominated by the bosonic operator cφD , which modifies the Higgs-gauge interactions and is
well constrained by the EWPOs.
Then Fig. 4.6 displays a heat map with the values of the (squared) coefficients a2ki that
relate the original fitting basis to the principal components, Eq. (4.18), and whose associated
eigenvalues are displayed in the upper panel. For those entries with a2ki ≥ 0.1 we also indicate
the corresponding numerical value. Since the principal components are normalised, the sum

Figure 4.5. The distribution of singular values λi (the elements of the diagonal of the matrix W ),

the linear EFT approximation where the PCA analysis is carried out, there exist three flat directions
(with vanishing singular values) associated to the four-heavy operators.

of the entries associated to a given row in the heat map adds up to unity. Note also that in
this table we have chosen the purely bosonic coefficients cφW B and cφD to represent the two
directions that are left unconstrained by the EWPOs, see the discussion in Sect. 2.1.
From Fig. 4.6 one can observe that some principal components (PCk ) are dominated by
a single EFT coefficient from the fitting basis. Examples of this are cφD (for k = 1), cφG
3,1
(k = 7). These PCs have associated reasonably
(k = 2), cφB (k = 3), ctG (k = 4), and cQq
large singular values, λk & 10, and therefore one expects that the corresponding coefficients
will be well constrained from the fit. Other principal components are instead composed by a
(3)
superposition of two or at most three coefficients, for instance cφW B and cφQ are combined
into PC14 and PC15 with similar weight each. On the other hand, several PCs arise instead
from the combination of a large number of EFT coefficients without any of them dominating.
This is the case e.g. for PCs associated to combinations involving of the two-light-two-heavy
operators, such k = 22, 23 and 25, where no single squared coefficient a2ki is larger than 0.4.
The three flat directions (vanishing singular values) observed in Fig. 4.5 can be traced back
to linear combinations for four-heavy operators, specifically to the following combinations:
PC34 = 0.91c1QQ − 0.42c1tt ,
PC35 = 0.62c1Qt − 0.56c8Qt + 0.49c8QQ ,

(4.19)

PC36 = 0.78c1Qt − 0.50c8QQ + 0.38c8tQ ,
where we don't indicate the contributions with a2ki < 0.1. This implies that, in a linear EFT
fit, one can only constrain two directions out of the five four-heavy operators considered.
These flat directions disappear only once we consider the quadratic corrections to the tt̄tt̄
and tt̄bb̄ cross-sections.
The results of this PCA indicate that our choice of fitting basis, summarised in Table 2.5,

represents a sensible option for which well-defined constraints will be obtained from the fit,
up to the previous caveat concerning the four-heavy operators. Therefore, in our case there is
no advantage in carrying out the fit in the rotated basis spanned by the principal components
Eq. (4.18) rather than in the original one. Furthermore, the lack of large hierarchies in the
distribution of singular values reflects the fact that the true dimensionality of the problem
coincides with that of the original basis.
While for the global dataset genuine flat directions are either absent or removed by
quadratic corrections, this might not be in general the case if we consider fits to reduced
datasets. In such scenario, one could consider deploying the PCA method to reduce the
dimensionality of the EFT parameter space by removing the directions with singular values
below some threshold before inverting back to the physical basis. We note that a similar strategy has been successfully applied to construct compressed Hessian PDF sets in [137, 138].
However, in this work we use PCA as a diagnosis tool to guide the selection of the fitting
basis, and postpone to future work its application to carry out EFT fits in the PC rotated
basis.

Results

We now present the main results of this work: the determination of the best-fit values, confidence level intervals, and posterior probability distributions associated to the nop = 50 EFT
coefficients (of which 36 are independent) listed in Table 2.5 from the global interpretation
of Higgs, top quark, and diboson cross-section measurements. As motivated in Sect. 4, the
results shown here have been obtained with the NS approach, and we have verified that
equivalent results are obtained with the MCfit method.
First of all, we discuss the quality of the fit, both for the total and for individual datasets.
Second, we present the bounds and posterior probability distributions for the various EFT
coefficients, assess their consistency with the SM hypothesis, and determine their pattern
of cross-correlations. Third, we study the dependence of our results on the choice of input
dataset, in particular with fits based only on top or Higgs data, as well as on that of the
theory settings, where the impact of the NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections
is quantified. Finally, we present EFT fits in the top-philic scenario, where the parameter
space is restricted by constraints motivated by specific UV-complete models. The comparison
between SM and SMEFT theory predictions with the experimental dataset used as input to
the fit is then collected in App. A.

Fit quality

datasets as well as for the global one. The values that will be provided here correspond to a

due to the presence of the quadratic corrections to the EFT cross-sections.
With the figure of merit defined in Eq. (5.1), we collect in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 the values of
the χ2 per data point corresponding to the baseline settings of our analysis. We display both
the values based
on the SM
theory predictions as well as the best-fit SMEFT results obtained

with O Λ−2 and O Λ−4 calculations. Note that, for ease of reference, in these tables each
dataset has associated a hyperlink pointing to the original publication. For those datasets for
which more than one differential distribution is available, we indicate the specific one used
in the fit. Then Table 5.3 presents the summary of these χ2 values now indicating the total
values for each group of processes as well as for the global dataset. Furthermore, the results
of Tables 5.1 and 5.2 are graphically represented in Fig. 5.1.
Let us discuss first the χ2 results evaluated in terms of the groups of processes, listed in
Table 5.3. One can observe that the global χ2 per data point improves from 1.05 when using
SM theory to 0.96 (linear) and 1.01 (quadratic) once SMEFT corrections are accounted for.

Table 5.3. Summary of the χ2 results listed in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. We indicate the total values for
each group of processes as well as for the global dataset.

Considering the fit quality to the various groups of processes, we observe that the description
of the inclusive top-quark pair cross-sections is clearly improved once EFT corrections are
accounted for, with χ2 = 1.36 in the SM decreasing to 1.14 and 1.23 in the linear and quadratic
EFT fits respectively. For the rest of the datasets, and in particular for the Higgs and diboson
measurements, the overall EFT fit quality is similar to that obtained using SM calculations.
Inspection of the χ2 values associated to individual datasets reported in Tables 5.1 and 5.2,
as well as their graphical representation from Fig. 5.1, reveals that in some cases the agreement between the prior SM theoretical calculations and the data is poor. This is the case,
in particular, for some of the inclusive tt̄ datasets such as ATLAS_tt_8TeV_ljets_mtt and
CMS_tt_13TeV_dilep_2016_mtt, binned in terms of the top-quark pair invariant mass distribution mtt̄ . Such relatively high values of the χ2 do not necessarily imply the need for
some New Physics effects, but could also be explained by issues with the modelling of the
experimental systematic correlations in differential distributions, as discussed for the ATLAS
8 TeV lepton+jets data in [61, 68, 140]. Nevertheless, when all the inclusive tt̄ datasets are
considered collectively, a reasonable value of χ2SM = 1.36 for the ndat = 94 data points in the
fit is obtained. In Sect. 5.3 we will assess the stability of the global fit results by presenting
fit variants with the individual datasets that lead to a poor χ2 removed. We will also study
variants where distributions sensitive to the high energy behaviour of the EFT, such as mtt̄
in top quark pair production, have their bins with mtt̄ & 1 TeV removed from the fit.
Beyond the inclusive tt̄ datasets, there are some other instances of a sub-optimal agreement
between SM theory and data. In all cases, there exist comparable measurements of the same
√
process, either from the same experiment at a different center-of-mass energy s or from a
√
different experiment at the same value of s, for which the χ2 reveals good consistency with
the SM. These include CMS_ttbb_13TeV, when comparing with the same measurement based

Figure 5.1. Graphical representation of the results of Tables 5.1 and 5.2, displaying the values of the
χ2 per data point, Eq. (5.1) for the all datasets used as input in the fit. The χ2 values are shown for
the SM and for the two global
 SMEFT baseline fits, based on theory calculations at either the linear
O Λ−2 or quadratic O Λ−4 order in the EFT expansion.

on the full 2016 luminosity, and CMS_tW_13TeV_inc, where again the ATLAS measurement
√
at the same s exhibit as good χ2 . All in all, one finds a reasonable description of the global
input dataset when using SM cross-sections which is further improved in the EFT fit.
For the rest of this section, when presenting the results of fits corresponding to variations
of the baseline settings, such as fits based on reduced datasets, we will only indicate the χ2
values associated to groups of processes using the same format as Table 5.3, rather than to
individual datasets, and comment when required on the results for the latter.

Constraints on the EFT parameter space

Following this assessment of the fit quality, we move to present the constraints on the SMEFT
parameter space that can be derived from the present global fit. We will present results for
the nop = 50 Wilson coefficients listed in Table 2.5, with the understanding that only 36 of
them are linearly independent.4 Specifically, we provide the 95% confidence level intervals for
each EFT coefficients, study their posterior probability distributions, evaluate the pattern of
their correlations, and compare the marginalised bounds with those obtained in individual
fits where only one coefficient is varied at a time. We will also assess the overall consistency
of the fit results with respect to the Standard Model hypothesis. The results discussed here
correspond
to the global dataset with the baseline theory settings for both O Λ−2 and

O Λ−4 theory calculations. Fits based on either reduced datasets or different theory settings
are then discussed in Sects. 5.3 and 5.4 respectively.

We note that the EWPO constraints of Eq. (2.7) set the four-lepton operator to zero, c`` = 0, and hence
we exclude this coefficient from the plots and tables of this section.

Figure 5.2. The normalised posterior probability distributions associated to each of the nop = 50
fit coefficients considered in the present analysis, for both the linear and quadratic EFT fits. Note
that the x-axis range is different in each case. From top to bottom and from left to right, we display
the four-heavy, two-light-two-heavy, two-fermion, and purely bosonic coefficients. Only 36 of these
coefficients are independent as indicated in Table 2.5.

Posterior distributions. Fig. 5.2 displays the normalised posterior probability distributions associated to each of the nop = 50 fit coefficients considered in the present analysis, for
the linear (blue) and quadratic (orange) EFT fits. As discussed in Sect. 4.3, the NS prior
sampling volumes have been optimised to ensure that the posterior distribution associated to
each coefficient is fully contained within them. One can observe how in general the O Λ−4
corrections modify significantly the distributions that is obtained from the linear fits, for
instance by shifting its median or by decreasing its variance. For several coefficients, the posterior distributions would be poorly described in the Gaussian approximation, and in some
cases one finds multi-modal distributions such as for the Yukawa operators cφc , cφb , and cφτ .
Such double-humped distributions can be traced back to the (quasi)-degenerate minima in the
individual χ2 profiles reported in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2. We can also observe how the four-heavy
coefficients can only be meaningfully constrained in the quadratic fit. All in all, inclusion
of the quadratic EFT corrections modifies in a significant manner the posterior distributions
associated to most of the fit coefficients as compared to the linear approximation.

Figure 5.3. The best-fit (median) value of the EFT coefficients ci /Λ2 and their associated 95%
CL intervals for the global fits based on either linear or quadratic EFT calculations, whose posterior
distributions are represented in Fig. 5.2. The dashed horizontal line indicates the SM expectation.

Confidence level intervals. From the posterior probability distributions displayed in
Fig. 5.2, one can derive the marginalised 95% CL intervals on the EFT coefficients both
for the linear and quadratic fits. These results are collected in Table 5.4 (for Λ = 1 TeV) and
represented graphically in Fig. 5.3. In addition, Table 5.4 also includes the corresponding
obtained in individual NS fits, where only one operator is varied at a time and the rest are
set to their SM values (recall the χ2 profiles from Figs. 4.1 and 4.2). We will further discuss
the outcome of these individual fits below.
From the marginalised bounds displayed in Fig. 5.3, one can observe how the uncertainties
associated to the fit coefficients are in general reduced in the quadratic fit in comparison to
the linear one. The 95% CL interval is disjoint for the Yukawa coefficients cbφ and cτ φ in the
quadratic fit, with both a SM-like solution and a second one far from the SM. For the linear
fit, we find that all EFT coefficients agree with the SM expectation at the 95% CL level. For
the quadratic fit instead, this is not the case for two of the two-light-two-heavy coefficients,
specifically for c1tu and c8qu . These deviations from the SM predictions can be traced back to
the quadratic corrections entering the high-energy tt̄ differential cross-sections.
The global fit results of Fig. 5.3 are further scrutinized in Fig. 5.4, which displays both the
magnitude of the 95% CL intervals and the 68% CL residuals compared to the SM hypothesis
associated to the linear and quadratic EFT fits. In the upper panel, the horizontal line
indicates the boundaries of the sampling volume used for the poorly-constrained coefficients as
explained in Sect. 4.3. From these comparisons, one can observe how the inclusion of quadratic
corrections leads to markedly more stringent bounds for most of the fit coefficients, a trend
which is specially significant for the four-heavy (unconstrained in the linear fit) and two-lighttwo-heavy operators which modify the properties of the top quark. The only exception are
the Yukawa coefficients, since there the quadratic corrections introduce a second degenerate
solution thus enlarging the magnitude of the CL interval.

Figure 5.4. The magnitude of the 95% CL intervals (top) and the value of the 68% CL residuals
compared to the SM hypothesis (bottom panel) for the fit results displayed in Fig. 5.3.

The 68% CL residuals displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 5.4 are defined by
R(ci ) ≡

(ci |EFT − ci |SM )
,
δci

i = 1, . . . , nop ,

(5.3)

with ci |EFT being the median of the posterior distribution from the EFT fit, ci |SM = 0, and
δci is the total fit uncertainty for this parameter. We can observe that |R(ci )| . 1 for most
of the fit coefficients, both for the linear and quadratic cases, with exceptions in the case of
the two-light-two-heavy coefficients, such as c1qd in the linear fit and c1tu in the quadratic one.
Nevertheless, for a large enough number of EFT coefficients one would expect a fraction
of these residuals to be larger than unity, even if the SM is the underlying theory. Fig. 5.5
then displays the normalised distribution of these fit residuals. While these coefficients are
correlated among them (see the following discussion) and thus cannot be treated as independent variables, the shapes of these distributions are reasonably close to a Gaussian, specially

Correlations. The correlation coefficient between any two fit coefficients ci and cj can be
evaluated as follows,

where Nspl denotes the number of samples produced by NS, hci i indicates the mean value of
this coefficient, and, as in Fig. 5.3, δci is the corresponding uncertainty (standard deviation).
The values of Eq. (5.4) are displayed in Fig. 5.6 separately for the linear and quadratic fits.
We display only the numerical values for the pair-wise coefficient combinations for which the
correlation coefficient is numerically significant, |ρ(ci , cj )| ≥ 0.5. The pairs (ci , cj ) that do not
appear in Fig. 5.6 have a correlation coefficient below this threshold.
We observe how the majority of the fit coefficients are loosely correlated among them,
that is, their correlations being |ρ| ≤ 0.5. One also finds that while several of the two-lighttwo-heavy coefficients turn out to be strongly correlated at the linear EFT level, this pattern
disappears once the quadratic corrections are accounted for. Concerning the two-fermion
operators, the correlation patterns present at the linear level are also often reduced in the
quadratic fits. For instance, ctZ displays a strong correlation with cφB at the linear level
which is then washed out by the quadratic effects. The purely bosonic operators exhibit in
general more stable correlations, for example cφW B is strongly anti-correlated with cφD in a
manner which is similar in the linear and the quadratic fits. Furthermore, we do not find any
pair of fit coefficients where the quadratic corrections flip the sign of their correlation.
In general, from Fig. 5.6 one can conclude that only a moderate subset of Wilson coefficients end up being strongly (anti-)correlated among them after the fit, specially so once

Figure 5.6. The correlation coefficients ρ(ci , cj ) between the EFT coefficients in the linear (left) and
quadratic (right panel) fits. We only display the entries with significant (anti)-correlation, |ρ| ≥ 0.5.
Pairs of coefficients (ci , cj ) that do not displayed here have a correlation coefficient below this threshold.

quadratic EFT corrections are taken into account. This finding is partially explained by our
wide input dataset, which makes possible constraining independently most if not all the EFT
degrees of freedom.
Individual fits. As motivated in Sect. 4.2, individual (one-parameter) fits have several
important applications. These include representing a benchmark reference for the global fit
results, where the obtained bounds can only loosen as compared to one-parameter fits. The
95% CL bounds associated to the one-parameter linear and quadratic EFT fits were reported
in Table 5.4, and the corresponding graphical comparison with the marginalised global fit
results is displayed in Fig. 5.7.
Considering first the results of the linear fits, one can observe how in all cases the individual
bounds are tighter (or at most comparable) than the marginalised ones by a large amount,
around a factor ten or more in most cases. These differences are particularly striking for some
of the two-fermion operators, in particular for ctZ , as well as for bosonic operators such as
cφB and cφW , for which the differences between the individual and marginalised results can
be as large as two orders of magnitude. Specifically, in the cases of ctZ and cφB , the 95% CL
intervals are increased as follows when going from the individual to the marginalised fits:
ctZ :

[−0.04, 0.010] (individual)

vs

[−15, 5.8] (marginalised) ,

cφB :

[−0.005, 0.002] (individual)

vs

[−0.7, 0.3] (marginalised) .

This effect clearly emphasizes the importance of adopting a fitting basis as wide as possible,
in order to avoid obtaining artificially stringent bounds simply because one is being blind
to other relevant directions of the parameter space. One important exception of this rule
would be those cases where one is guided by specific UV-complete models, which motivate

the reduction in the parameter space to a subset of operators. We also note that the triple
gauge operator cW is one of the few coefficients whose individual and marginalised bounds
are identical: this can be traced back to the fact that this operator is very weakly correlated
with other coefficients (see also Fig. 5.6), being constrained exclusively by the diboson data.
Inspection of the corresponding results from the quadratic fits, bottom panel of Fig. 5.7,
reveals that the differences between individual and marginalised bounds are in general smaller
as compared to the linear case. This effect is particularly visible for the two-light-two-heavy
and the four-heavy operators, for which one finds that the individual fits underestimate the
magnitude of the 95% CL interval by around a factor two on average, rather than by a factor
10 as in the linear case. The situation is instead similar to the linear fits for the two-fermion
and the purely bosonic operators, and for example now also for ctZ , cφB and cφW one finds
large differences between marginalised and individual fits. One should point out, however,
that even on those cases where the magnitude of the bound does not vary much, the central

Figure 5.8. Representative results for two-parameter fits carried out at linear order in the EFT. We
display the 95% CL ellipses obtained for different data subsets and for the complete dataset, labelled
as "All Data (2D)". For reference, we also show the marginalised bounds obtained in the global fit.
The black square in the center of the plot indicates the SM value.

best-fit values can still shift in a non-negligible manner. This is illustrated by the two-lighttwo-heavy operators c1tu and c8Qu , for which one obtains
c1tu :

vs

[−0.30, −0.10] (marginalised) ,

:

[−0.55, 0.22] (individual)

vs

[−1.01, −0.09] (marginalised) ,

c8Qu

hence for instance while c1tu agrees with the SM at the 95% CL in the individual fit, this is
not the case in the marginalised one. From this comparison, one can conclude that for the
two-light-two-heavy and the four-heavy operators most of the sensitivity is already captured
by the individual fits once quadratic corrections are included.
Two-parameter fits. To complement the insights provided by individual fits, it can also
be instructive to carry out two-parameter fits, specially to investigate the relative interplay
between specific pairs of EFT coefficients. In such fits, two coefficients are allowed to vary
simultaneously while the rest are set to zero. To illustrate the information that can be provided
by such two-parameter fits, Fig. 5.8 displays representative results for fits performed at the
linear order. We display the 95% CL ellipses obtained when different subsets of data are used
as input, as well as for the complete dataset, labelled as "All Data (2D)". For reference, we
also show here the marginalised bounds obtained from the global fit.
59

To begin with, the upper panels of Fig. 5.8 display two-parameter fits for the three possible
pair-wise combinations of the ctφ , ctG , and cφG coefficients, which connect Higgs production in
gluon fusion with top quark pair production, see also the Fisher information table of Fig. 3.1.
These comparisons illustrate the relative impact of the various dataset in constraining each
coefficient. For example, from the (ctφ , ctG ) fit we see that the sensitivity of ctG is driven by tt̄
data, while the Higgs measurements have a flat direction resulting in a elongated ellipse. When
top and Higgs data are combined, the resulting 95% CL ellipse is much smaller as compared
to the results obtained separately from the two groups of processes. Note that, as in the case
of the individual fits reported in Fig. 5.7, also for two-parameter fits the obtained bounds are
more stringent as compared to the global marginalised results. Similar considerations apply
to the (cφG , ctG ) fit, while from the (cφG , ctφ ) one learns that the sensitivity is still dominated
by the Higgs signal strengths rather than by the differential cross-section measurements.
Then the bottom panels of Fig. 5.8 display two-parameter fits involving the two-light3,8 8

8
two-heavy coefficients c1,8
Qq , cQq , ctu , ctd , and ctq , all of which are constrained mostly from top
quark pair differential distributions as indicated by the Fisher information matrix. Here the
scope is to illustrate the relative sensitivity provided by some of the tt̄ datasets that enter
the fit: single-inclusive mtt̄ distributions, the double-differential (mtt̄ , ytt̄ ) distributions, and
tt̄V measurements. The results confirm both that the mtt̄ distributions completely dominate
the fit of these coefficients, and that the marginalised CL ellipses are rather broader than for
the two-dimensional fits. The latter is again in agreement with the results of the individual
linear fits, reported in the upper panel of Fig. 5.7.

5.3

Dataset dependence

The discussion so far has focused on the output of the global fits obtained for the baseline
dataset summarised in Tables 3.1 to 3.4. Here we aim to assess the dependence of these
results with respect to the choice of input dataset. With this purpose, we consider here fits
for the following variations:
• A fit which includes only top quark measurements. This fit makes possible quantifying
the interplay between the top and the Higgs data in the global fit.
• A fit which includes only Higgs boson production and decay data, which provides complementary information as compared to the top-only fit.
• A fit which includes only top quark measurements, but now restricted to the same
dataset as in our original study from [7]. This comparison allows one to assess the
impact in the top-only EFT fit of the new LHC top quark measurements that have
become available in the last two years.
• A fit where the diboson data is removed, to determine how much weight the diboson
cross-sections carry in the global fit results.
• A fit where all high-energy bins, defined as those bins probing the region E & 1 TeV, are
removed. The motivation for such a fit is to study how important are the constraints
provided by the high-energy region in the global fit results, which in turn is an important
input to establish the validity of the EFT approximation.
• A fit where those datasets displaying poor agreement with the SM cross-sections are
removed. Specifically, here one removes the datasets whose χ2 differs by more than 3σ

Table 5.5. Same as Table 5.3 for EFT fits obtained from variations of the baseline dataset. We list
the results of the following fits: including only top quark measurements (either for the 2018 or the
current dataset); a Higgs-only dataset; without the diboson cross-sections; with the high-energy bins
excluded; and with the datasets with a poor χ2sm excluded. In all cases, the quadratic EFT corrections
are accounted for. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of data points, in the case that
these are different from those of the baseline settings (listed in the second column).

from their statistical expectation assuming the SM hypothesis. While such disagreements between data and SM theory could very well indicate hints of BSM physics, they
can also be explained by for example issues with the experimental correlation models.
Hence, this fit allows us to verify to which extent the global fit results are determined
from the datasets that disagree the most with the SM predictions.
Note that, as explained in Sect. 3, for the purposes of categorisation into datasets the tt̄h
cross-sections are considered part of the Higgs measurements. Furthermore, we note that all
these fits are based on quadratic EFT calculations and that the constraints provided by the
EWPOs on the EFT parameter space are always accounted for.
To begin with, Table 5.5 collects the values of the χ2 per data points for EFT fits obtained
from variations of the input dataset. We list the results of the various fits described above:
including only top quark measurements (either from the current or the 2018 dataset); with a
Higgs-only dataset; without the diboson cross-sections; with the high-energy bins excluded;
and with the datasets with a poor χ2sm excluded. The numbers in parentheses indicate the
number of data points, in the case that these are different from those of the baseline settings
listed in the second column. We observe how the description of the Higgs cross-sections is
essentially unaffected in these fits with reduced datasets. Concerning the total χ2 for the
top data, we see that it is stable in the fit where the high-energy bins are removed, but that
is markedly improved (from 1.02 to 0.77) in the fit where the datasets with poor χ2sm are
excluded.
Then in Fig. 5.9 we compare the magnitude of the 95% CL bounds, same as in the upper
panel of Fig. 5.4, between the global fit results with those obtained in the top-only and Higgs61

only fits. As mentioned above, these fits allow us to assess the interplay between the top
and the Higgs data in the global analysis, in other words, to identify what are the main
benefits of the simultaneous mapping of the EFT parameter space as compared to carrying
out separate fits to each group of processes. First of all, we note that the global fit bounds
are more stringent for all the EFT coefficients than in either the top-only or Higgs-only fit,
highlighting the overall consistency of the two datasets. Secondly, the cross-talk of the top
(−)
and Higgs data is found to be most relevant for the two-fermion coefficients cφt and cφQ ,
whose bounds are improved by around a factor 2 in the global fit as compared to the top-only
fit. Another operator that benefits from the global fit is cφG , which is unconstrained in the
top-only fit but bound in the global fit is clearly improved as compared to the Higgs-only
fit. This study shows how by breaking degeneracies one gains information in the global fit
as compared to the partial ones, sometimes in unexpected directions in the parameter space
such as for cφG in this case.
Next, Fig. 5.10 displays a similar comparison as in Fig. 5.9 now comparing first the
outcome of the global fit with that of a fit where the diboson cross-sections have been removed,
and second comparing two top-only fits, namely the fit displayed in the upper panel of Fig. 5.9
with a fit based on the same dataset as our previous study from [7]. The fit without diboson
data demonstrates that the constraints provided by the diboson cross-sections are negligible
in comparison with those provided by the Higgs data (and the EWPOs) for all coefficients
considered in the fit, except for the triple gauge operator cW . This result is consistent with
the Fisher information analysis of Fig. 3.1, and indicates that, apart from cW , the diboson
data does not provide competitive information on the EFT parameter space in the context of
a global fit.
The comparison of the two top-only fits in the bottom panel of Fig. 5.10 illustrates how
for all coefficients the bounds are improved thanks to the more recent LHC measurements.5
The improvement is consistent across the board, quantifies the additional information brought
in by the new top-quark cross-section measurements (see Table 5.5) and confirms that the
broader and more diverse the input dataset is, the more stringent the resulting constraints
on the EFT parameter space that will be obtained.
To conclude this discussion of the dataset dependence of our results, we consider the
outcome of two more fits: first, one where the datasets exhibiting poor agreement with the
SM predictions are excluded, and second, another where all bins sensitive to the high-energy
region, defined as E & 1 TeV, are removed. The best-fit values and 95% CL intervals of these
two fits are compared with the baseline results in Fig. 5.11. As indicated in Table 5.5, in the
fit where those datasets with poor χ2sm have been removed, one is essentially cutting away
27 points from top quark production, mostly from the inclusive tt̄ category. The only coefficients that are affected by this reduction in the dataset are some of the two-light-two-heavy
operators, whose bounds are somewhat enlarged consistently with the loss of experimental
information. Specifically, this has the consequence that the 95% CL intervals for c1tu and c8Qu
now agree with the SM expectation, as opposed to the global fit configuration.
Concerning the outcome of the fit without the high-energy bins, as expected the only
differences are observed again for the two-light-two-heavy coefficients. The results are similar
as in the previous case: an increase in the coefficient uncertainties and an improved agreement
of c1tu and c8Qu with the SM predictions. From these comparisons, one can conclude that
the global fit is not dominated by the high-energy regions where the EFT validity could be
5

questioned, except for some of the two-light-two-heavy coefficients. Hence, we have established
that the large residuals reported in Fig. 5.4 for c1tu and c8Qu arise from fitting the large-mtt̄ bins
of the top quark pair production datasets that, to begin with, are described sub-optimally by
the SM predictions.

Impact of NLO QCD corrections in the EFT cross-sections

In addition to the choice of input dataset, another important factor that determines the
outcome of a global analysis such as the present one is the accuracy of the EFT theoretical
calculations. Here we assess the role played at the level of the fit results by the inclusion of
NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections. As indicated in Table 3.9, our baseline fit
includes these NLO corrections to the EFT calculations whenever available, so now we switch

them off deliberately to quantify how much they affect the fit outcome.6 In the following, the
theoretical predictions for the SM cross-sections, based on the state-of-the-art calculations,
remain unchanged, and only the EFT ones are modified as compared to the baseline settings.
Table 5.6 compares the values of the χ2 for the various groups of processes in quadratic
fits with and without NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections, as well as for the
associated SM results. One can observe how the fit quality worsens if NLO QCD effects are
not accounted for, with the total dataset (top-quark dataset) increasing to χ2 = 1.05 (1.11)
from χ2 = 1.01 (1.02) in the baseline. On the other hand, the fit quality is essentially
unchanged for the Higgs and diboson datasets, irrespective of whether or not NLO QCD
corrections are accounted for. One can therefore trace back this increase in the χ2 values
when LO EFT calculations are used to the top-quark pair distributions, which contribute to
6

This study is also motivated by the fact that many EFT fits rely on LO QCD for the EFT cross-sections.

Fig. 5.12 then displays the posterior probability distributions and the corresponding 95%
CL intervals for the Wilson coefficients, comparing the results of quadratic fits with and
without NLO corrections to the EFT cross-sections. One can observe that these posterior
distributions can be severely distorted when LO EFT calculations are used as compared to
the baseline, for instance in terms of a shift in the best-fit values or due to an increase in the
width of the distributions. As an illustration, the operator that modifies the charm Yukawa
interaction, ccφ , exhibits a bimodal distribution once NLO effects are accounted for, while
the dominant solution for the cφt coefficient is far from the SM in the LO fit but SM-like
in the NLO case. This comparison highlights how the inclusion of NLO QCD corrections is
necessary to achieve robust results for the fitted EFT coefficients. Alternatively, one could
account for the missing higher-order uncertainties (MHOUs) in the EFT cross-sections, which

Table 5.6. Same as Table 5.3 now for fits based on variations of the theory settings as compared to the
baseline ones. Specifically, we provide the results of a fit where the EFT cross-sections are evaluated
at LO in the QCD expansion, as well as those of the top-philic scenario where the parameter space has
been restricted as described in Sect. 2.2. In both cases, quadratic EFT corrections are being included.
Note that the SM cross-sections are always evaluated using state-of-the-art theory calculations.

are usually neglected, using for instance the approach advocated in [133, 134]. Implementing
MHOUs systematically is expected to improve the overall compatibility of EFT fits performed
with and without NLO QCD corrections.
Interestingly, for specific operators such as the two-light-two-heavy coefficients and the
triple gauge operator cW , neglecting NLO corrections leads to both a shift in the best-fit
values but also to somewhat reduced 95% CL intervals. Such behaviour may arise when
NLO contributions to the quadratic EFT cross-sections introduce novel new directions in the
parameter space, for example with coefficients that are absent at the LO level. Nevertheless,
only once all sources of theory uncertainty are included it will be possible to ascertain in an
unambiguous manner whether or not NLO QCD corrections lead to more precise (in addition
to more accurate) global EFT analyses.
In the specific case of the cφt coefficient, one can verify that the corresponding individual
χ2 profile (analog of Fig. 4.2 for LO fits) does not exhibit the second solution identified in
Fig. 5.12, and hence it must be induced by the cross-talk with other coefficients in the fit. To
validate this hypothesis, Fig. 5.13 displays the outcome of two-parameter quadratic fits for
(cφt , ctZ ) and (cφt , cφW ) comparing the results of the LO EFT fit with its NLO counterpart.
In both cases, the LO two-parameter fits based on the full dataset favour the solution far
from the SM, while the NLO ones instead favour the SM-like one. The explanation for this
behaviour can be traced back to the fact that the non-SM solution is disfavored by higherorder EFT corrections to hZ associated production, in particular the loop-induced gluon-gluon
contributions.
Another remarkable effect of the NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections can be

observed as a modification of the correlation patterns. Fig. 5.14 displays the same correlations
maps as in Fig. 5.6 now for global fits based on LO EFT calculations at the linear and
quadratic level. Specially for the linear fits, we observe that correlations become more sizable
in general (higher fraction of colored entries) in the LO case, while these are reduced once
NLO corrections are accounted for. This feature demonstrates how NLO QCD effects may
reduce parameter correlations by introducing additional sensitivity to the fit coefficients given
the same input dataset.

The top-philic scenario

To conclude this section, we present results for a global EFT fit carried out in the top-philic
scenario defined in Sect. 2.2. In this scenario, we have the 9 equations of Eq. (2.10) that
relate a subset of the 14 two-heavy-two-light coefficients listed in Table 2.5 among them,
leaving 5 independent parameters to be constrained in the fit. Given the more constraining

assumptions associated to the top-philic scenario, one expects to find an improvement in the
bounds of the two-light-two-heavy EFT operators due to the fact that the parameter space
is being restricted by theoretical considerations, rather than by data in this case.
The values of the χ2 for each group of datasets in the top-philic scenario were reported in
Table 5.6. One finds that the χ2 to the top quark cross-sections is somewhat worsened with
respect to the baseline fit (1.07 versus 1.02), while remaining better than in the SM case.
The same considerations apply at the level of the total dataset, driven by the different fit
quality to the top quark observables, while the Higgs and diboson data are unaffected. This
slightly inferior description of the top quark experimental data in the top-philic scenario can
be explained by the reduction in the EFT parameter space, which restricts the number of
independent directions that can be explored by the fit. As we show below, the main benefit
of the top-philic scenario is instead that, within its assumptions, one achieves more stringent
limits for many of the operators that modify top quark properties.
Fig. 5.15 displays the 95% CL intervals for the EFT coefficients comparing the global
fit results with those of the top-philic scenario. The only operators that are affected in a
significant manner turn out to be the two-light-two-heavy operators, with the bounds in
1
several of them such as c1td , c1,1
Qq , and ctq improving by almost an order of magnitude. The fact
that only the bounds on the two-light-two-heavy operators are modified is consistent with the
top-philic scenario, given that only this specific group of EFT coefficients is being constrained
by its model assumptions.
It is worth emphasizing at this point that, from the technical point of view, carrying out
global EFT fits with specific restrictions in the parameter space motivated by UV-completions,
such as those arising in the top-philic scenario and leading to Fig. 5.15, is relatively straightforward. Indeed, the most efficient fitting strategy would be to start from the broadest possible parameter space, and once the corresponding fit has been performed, introduce model
assumptions relating EFT coefficients in a systematic manner. This way one can connect
with specific models for UV-completions of the SM, which typically result in a rather smaller

Summary and outlook

In this work we have presented an extensive interpretation of Higgs, diboson, and top quark
measurements from the LHC in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.
By combining the most updated experimental data with state-of-the-art theory calculations,
both in the SM and in the EFT, we have provided bounds on 50 directions in the SMEFT
parameter space of which 36 correspond to independent parameters. We have quantified in
detail the relative impact that the different types of processes have in the results of this global
EFT analysis, both in terms of fits with dataset variations and by means of statistical diagnosis
tools such as information geometry techniques and principal component analysis. Our analysis
highlights the overall complementarity of the various input processes, further motivating the
need for a global interpretation of LHC measurements. We have also demonstrated how,
within such a global EFT analysis, genuinely flat directions are essentially absent since each
process and each kinematic bin of a distribution constrains separate combinations of the fit
parameters. The robustness of our fitting methodology has been cross-validated by deploying
two completely independent methods, MCfit and NS, for mapping the EFT parameter space.
We have also extensively quantified the role played in the global analysis by the inclusion
of NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections, whose automation has been recently
achieved. We find that the posterior probability distributions of the fit parameters can be
modified in non-trivial ways by these NLO QCD effects, shifting the best-fit value, modifying
the magnitude of the 95% CL intervals, and even inducing multi-modal distributions. These
findings demonstrate that available LHC data is already sensitive to NLO effects in the EFT
cross-sections, further highlighting the importance of accounting for them in a systematic
70

manner to achieve both accurate and precise results.
One could consider several directions in which the present study could be extended. To
begin with, one would like to include directly the constraints provided by LEP's electroweak
precision observables, rather than in an approximate manner as done in the present work.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to add to the global analysis new high-pT observables
providing complementary information on the Higgs and gauge sectors of the SMEFT, such as
for instance vector boson scattering (VBS), Z production in vector boson fusion (VBF), or
high-mass Drell-Yan production, all of them constraining the electroweak interactions. Other
processes that one might consider in this context are single-inclusive jet, dijet, and multijet
production, which are sensitive to several directions in the parameter space not covered by
other processes, specifically to a large number of four-fermion operators.
From the point of view of theoretical calculations, it would be important to systematize the
study of higher-order terms in the EFT expansion, considering in particular double insertions
of dimension-six operators and representative subsets of dimension-eight operators. We point
out that, within our fitting methodology, accounting for these higher order terms is technically
straightforward. Along the same lines, one could extend the fitting formalism to account for
all sources of theoretical uncertainties and their correlations in a systematic manner, both for
the SM and for the EFT calculations, something which is done only partially here. In addition,
it should be interesting to develop statistically optimal observables for EFT analyses, such
as those based on deep learning [141–143], making possible complementing the constraints
obtained at the level of unfolded cross-sections with those extracted directly at the detector
level.
Another promising research direction is that of combining the global EFT interpretation
of high-pT observables at the LHC presented here with that of flavour data from LHCb
and from other B-factories such as Belle. The urgency of a simultaneous EFT analyses
of high-pT and flavour data has been further highlighted by the recent evidence reported
by the LHCb experiment for the violation of lepton flavour universality (LFU) in B-meson
decays [25]. These findings demand exploiting the flexibility of the EFT framework in order
to comprehensively map the allowed signatures of eventual LFU violation in high-pT crosssections at the LHC and elsewhere.
Likewise, it would be important to account for the constraints provided by low energy
processes in the SMEFT parameter space, from neutrino data and electric dipole moment
measurements to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In the latter case, a 4.1σ
deviation with respect to the SM expectation has recently been reported [144], confirming and
strengthening one of the most puzzling anomalies in particle physics. Indeed, the ultimate goal
of our program would be a truly global EFT interpretation including all processes sensitive to
the sought-for UV completion of the SM, making sure no stone is left unturned in the ongoing
quest to unravel the new particles and interactions that lie beyond the Standard Model.

Comparison with experimental data

In this appendix, we present a systematic comparison between the experimental data used as
input to the fit with the corresponding theoretical cross-sections based both
on the SM and on

the best-fit SMEFT results, either at linear O Λ−2 or at quadratic O Λ−4 accuracy. In these
comparisons, the experimental measurements will be presented both in terms of unshifted
central values, where the error band represents the total uncertainty, and once the best-fit
systematic shifts have been subtracted, such that the error band contains only the statistical
component. Note that the evaluation of the shifted data is only possible whenever the full
breakup of the experimental systematic uncertainties is made available by in HepData. If this
is not the case, for example when only the full experimental correlation matrix is provided or
no information on correlations is released, we will display only the unshifted data.
To begin with, Fig. A.1 displays the comparison between experimental data and the
best-fit EFT theory predictions (for linear and quadratic fits) in the case of representative
differential top quark pair and single top quark production datasets. Both the data and the
EFT fit results are normalised to the central value of the SM theory prediction. This implies
that the more the fit results deviate from unity, the larger the best-fit EFT effects are for
this specific observable. Furthermore, the error band in the EFT prediction indicates the
associated 95% CL interval evaluated over the Nspl samples produced by the NS method.
From these comparisons, one can observe how for some datasets the best-fit EFT results
move in the direction of the experimental data, for instance in the case of the mtt̄ distributions
at large invariant masses for inclusive tt̄ production. This is an important kinematic region
in the fit, since energy-growing effects increase the EFT sensitivity. Interestingly, in the
highest mtt̄ bins for some of the 13 TeV top datasets the 95% CL interval associated to the
EFT prediction does not include the SM expectation. In the case of the single-top t-channel
differential cross-sections, the EFT fit results are very close to the SM predictions, indicating
that EFT effects are well constrained for this process at the scale of the present experimental
uncertainties. We also note that the uncertainty
band associated to the EFT prediction can

turn out to be rather different in the O Λ−2 fits as compared to the O Λ−4 ones, with the
latter in general being more precise than the former for the processes considered here.
Then Fig. A.2 displays the same comparison between data and the SM and EFT predictions as in Fig. A.1 now for the W helicity fractions, the single-top s-channel and tV
total cross-sections, the four-heavy-quark fiducial measurements, the LHC diboson differen72

tial distributions at 13 TeV, and the LEP diboson cross-sections at different center-of-mass
energies. Note that contrary to the rest of the datasets, the comparison for the W helicity
fraction is carried out at the absolute rather than at the normalised level. Concerning the
single top measurements, the best-fit EFT predictions tend to move towards the experimental
data, which in most cases is somewhat higher than the SM prediction. For some datasets,
such as single-top s-channel cross-section at 8 TeV and the tW cross-sections at 13 TeV, the
agreement between ATLAS and CMS is at best marginal and thus the EFT fit interpolates
between the two measurements. A similar behaviour is observed for the tt̄tt̄ cross-sections at
13 TeV. Furthermore, as was the case for the processes considered in Fig. A.1, the EFT fit
uncertainties appear to be reduced in the quadratic case.
Moving to the LEP and LHC diboson datasets, one finds that for electron-positron collisions the EFT fit result is very close to the SM cross-section with a vanishing uncertainty.
This result is likely to be related to the constraints imposed by the EWPOs as well as by
the LHC diboson data. Nevertheless, the SM predictions are in good agreement with the
LEP data for all four center-of-mass energies considered to begin with. In the case of the
Z distributions in the W + W − and W Z
LHC measurements, for the ATLAS meμ and mW

final states, respectively, the data is in good agreement with the SM and the net effect of

In the case of the differential Higgs distributions, we can observe the good agreement both
the SM and the EFT predictions within the relatively large experimental uncertainties. For
these distributions, the EFT effects can reach a magnitude of up to a few percent in the global
fit. For instance, for the CMS pT,H distribution in the quadratic fit, the best-fit results are
' 15% higher than the SM for the pT,H = 1 TeV bin. For the case of the signal strengths,
also a fair agreement is found, though for some combinations of production channel and decay
mode the experimental uncertainties still remain rather large.

Implementation of Higgs signal strengths

In this appendix, we describe how the Higgs signal strengths have been implemented in
the present analysis. For a generic Higgs production and decay cross-section, denoted as
σ(pp → h → X), the experimentally measured signal strength is defined as the product of the
production cross-section times the corresponding branching ratio, normalised to the Standard
Model predictions:
(exp)

μpp→h→X =

σ (exp) (pp → h → X)
σ (exp) (pp → h → X)
=
,
σ (sm) (pp → h → X)
σ (sm) (pp → h) × BR(sm) (h → X)

(B.1)

which in turn can be expressed as

μpp→h→X =


,
=
(sm)
(sm)
σ (sm) (pp → h → X)
σ (sm) (pp → h) × ΓX /Γtot

(B.2)

where Γtot indicates the total Higgs width and ΓX is the partial width for the decay into the
specific final state X. In this work, we assume that the Higgs boson decays only to known
particles and hence set to zero its branching ratio to invisible final states. The theoretical
prediction corresponding to the measurement of the signal strengths Eq. (B.2) in the SMEFT
is given by

If we Taylor expand the last term at O Λ−2 , we obtain the required expression for the

Usage of SMEFiT results

The results of this work are made available via the website of the SMEFiT project:
https://lhcfitnikhef.github.io/SMEFT/
as well as via the corresponding public GitHub repository:
https://github.com/LHCfitNikhef/SMEFiT/
Specifically, we provide the full set of Nspl samples corresponding to the NS fits presented in
this work for the nop = 50 Wilson coefficients. We recall that not all of these coefficients are
associated to independent degrees of freedom, and that 14 of them are constrained by the
EWPO relations as discussed in Sect. 2.
These Nspl samples provide a representation of the probability density associated to the
EFT coefficients. From these samples, it is easy to evaluate statistical estimators such as
means, standard deviations, and correlations, e.g.,
Nspl
1 X (k)
hci i =
c ,
Nspl k=1 i

(C.3)

as well as other estimators such as confidence level intervals and higher moments beyond the
quadratic approximation. One should emphasize that, as discussed in Sect. 5, the Gaussian
approximation is in general not reliable for most of the EFT parameters in the case that the
quadratic O Λ−4 corrections are accounted for.
These samples spanning the probability density in the space of EFT Wilson coefficients
could also be used to quantify a posteriori the impact in the fit of new measurements by
means of the Bayesian reweighting method presented in [33].
To facilitate the usage of the results presented in this work, we also make available via
the GitHub repository a Python analysis code that takes as input the samples corresponding
to a specific EFT fit and then evaluates means, correlations, and 95% CL intervals, as well
as produces most of the plots and statistical estimators displayed in Sect. 5. In a future
installment of our global EFT analysis, we plan to release the full smefit fitting code and
the associated theoretical and experimental inputs, together with a complete documentation
and user-friendly examples.
