The Hardy-Lorentz Spaces H p,q (Rn )
Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky
Abstract
In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces H p,q (Rn ), with
0 < p ≤ 1, 0 < q ≤ ∞. We discuss the atomic decomposition of
the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the
behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them.

The real variable theory of the Hardy spaces represents a fruitful setting for
the study of maximal functions and singular integral operators. In fact, it
is because of the failure of these operators to preserve L1 that the Hardy
space H 1 assumes its prominent role in harmonic analysis. Now, for many
of these operators, the role of L1 can just as well be played by H 1,∞ , or
Weak H 1 . However, although these operators are amenable to H 1 − L1 and
H 1,∞ − L1,∞ estimates, interpolation between H 1 and H 1,∞ has not been
available. Similar considerations apply to H p and Weak H p for 0 < p < 1.
The purpose of this paper is to provide an interpolation result for the
Hardy-Lorentz spaces H p,q , 0 < p ≤ 1, 0 < q ≤ ∞, including the case of
Weak H p as and end point for real interpolation. The atomic decomposition
is the key ingredient in dealing with interpolation since in this context neither
truncations are available, nor reiteration applies.
The paper is organized as follows. The Lorentz spaces, including criteria
that assure membership in Lp,q , 0 < p < ∞, 0 < q ≤ ∞, are discussed in
Section 1. In Section 2 we show that distributions in H p,q have an atomic
decomposition in terms of H p atoms with coefficients in an appropriate mixed
norm space. An interesting application of this decomposition is to H p,q −Lp,∞
estimates for Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operators, p < q ≤ ∞.
Also, by manipulating the different levels of the atomic decomposition, we
show that, for 0 < q1 < q < q2 ≤ ∞, H p,q is an intermediate space between
H p,q1 and H p,q2 . This result applies to Calderón-Zygmund singular integral
operators, including those with variable kernels, Marcinkiewicz integrals, and
other operators.

The Lorentz spaces

The Lorentz space Lp,q (Rn ) = Lp,q , 0 < p < ∞, 0 < q ≤ ∞, consists of those
measurable functions f with finite quasinorm kf kp,q given by

The Lorentz quasinorm may also be given in terms of the distribution function m(f, λ) = |{x ∈ Rn : |f (x)| > λ}|, loosely speaking, the inverse of the
non-increasing rearrangement f ∗ of f . Indeed, we have

Note that, in particular, Lp,p = Lp , and Lp,∞ is weak Lp .
The following two results are useful in verifying that a function is in Lp,q .
Lemma 1.1. Let 0 < p < ∞, and 0 < q ≤ ∞. Assume that the non-negative
sequence {μk } satisfies {2k μk } ∈ lq . Further suppose that the non-negative
function φ verifies the following property: there exists 0 < ε < 1 such that,
given an arbitrary integer k0 , we have φ ≤ ψk0 + ηk0 , where ψk0 is essentially
bounded and satisfies kψk0 k∞ ≤ c 2k0 , and

k0

Then, φ ∈ Lp,q , and kφkp,q ≤ c k{2k μk }klq .
Proof. It clearly suffices to verify that k{2k |{φ > γ 2k }|1/p }klq < ∞, where γ
is an arbitrary positive constant. Now, given k0 , let ψk0 and ηk0 be as above,
and put γ = c + 1, where c is the constant in the above inequalities; for this
choice of γ, {φ > γ 2k0 } ⊆ {ηk0 > 2k0 }.

The reader will have no difficulty in verifying that, for Lemma 1.1 to hold,
it suffices that ψx0 satisfies
m(ψx0 , 2k0 )1/p ≤ c μk0 ,

all k0 .

This holds, for instance, when kψx0 krr ≤ c 2k0r μpk0 , 0 < r < ∞. In fact, the
assumptions of Lemma 1.1 correspond to the limiting case of this inequality
as r → ∞.
Another useful condition is given by our next result, the proof is left to
the reader.
Lemma 1.2. Let 0 < p < ∞, and let the non-negative sequence {μk } be
such that {2k μk } ∈ lq , 0 < q ≤ ∞. Further, suppose that the non-negative
function φ satisfies the following property: there exists 0 < ε < 1 such that,
given an arbitrary integer k0 , we have φ ≤ ψk0 +ηk0 , where ψk0 and ηk0 satisfy

Then, φ ∈ Lp,q , and kφkp,q ≤ c k{2k μk }klq .
We will also require some basic concepts from the theory of real interpolation. Let A0 , A1 , be a compatible couple of quasinormed Banach spaces,
4

i.e., both A0 and A1 are continuously embedded in a larger topological vector
space. The Peetre K functional of f ∈ A0 + A1 at t > 0 is defined by
K(t, f ; A0 , A1 ) =

inf

f =f0 +f1

kf0 k0 + t kf1 k1 ,

where f = f0 + f1 , f0 ∈ A0 and f1 ∈ A1 .
In the particular case of the Lq spaces, the K functional can be computed
by Holmstedt's formula, see [12]. Specifically, for 0 < q0 < q1 ≤ ∞, let α be
given by 1/α = 1/q0 − 1/q1 . Then,

Finally, for the L and Lp,q spaces, we have the following result. Let
0 < q1 < q < q2 ≤ ∞, and suppose that 1/q = (1 − η)/q1 + η/q2 . Then,
Lq = (Lq1 , Lq2 )η,q , and, L1,q = (L1,q1 , L1,q2 )η,q , see [4].

The Hardy-Lorentz spaces H p,q

In this paper we adopt the atomic characterization of the Hardy spaces H p ,
0 < p ≤ 1. Recall that a compactly supported function a with [n(1/p − 1)]
vanishing moments is an H p atom with defining interval I (of course, I is
a cube in Rn ), if supp(a) ⊆ I, and |I|1/p |a(x)| ≤ 1. The Hardy space

distributions
f that can be written as f =
P (R ) = H consists of those
P
λj aj , where the aj 's are H p atoms,
|λj |p < ∞, and the convergence is
in the sense of distributions as well as in H p . Furthermore,
X
1/p
kf kH p ∼ inf
|λj |p
,
where the infimum is taken over all possible atomic decompositions of f .
This last expression has traditionally been called the atomic H p norm of f .
5

C. Fefferman, Rivière and Sagher identified the intermediate spaces between the Hardy space H p0 , 0 < p0 < 1, and L∞ , as
(H p0 , L∞ )η,q = H p,q ,

1/p = (1 − η)/p0 , 0 < q ≤ ∞ ,

where H p,q consists of those distributions f whose radial maximal function
Mf (x) = supt>0 |(f ∗ φt )(x)| belongs to Lp,q . Here φ is a compactly supported, smooth function with nonvanishing integral, see [10]. R. Fefferman
and Soria studied in detail the space H 1,∞ , which they called Weak H 1 , see
[11].
Just as in the case of H p , H p,q can be characterized in a number of
different ways, including in terms of non-tangential maximal functions and
Lusin functions. In what follows we will calculate the quasinorm of f in H p,q
by the means of the expression
 k
2 m(Mf, 2k )1/p
, 0 < p ≤ 1, 0 < q ≤ ∞ ,
lq

where Mf is an appropriate maximal function of f .
Passing to the atomic decomposition of H p,q , the proof is divided in two
parts. First, we construct an essentially optimal atomic decomposition; Parilov has obtained independently this result for H 1,q when 1 ≤ q, see [14].
Also, R. Fefferman and Soria gave the atomic decomposition of Weak H 1 ,
see [11], and Alvarez the atomic decomposition of Weak H p , 0 < p < 1, see
[2].
Theorem 2.1. LetP
f ∈ H p,q , 0 < p ≤ 1, 0 < q ≤ ∞. Then f has an atomic
decomposition f = j,k λj,k aj,k , where the aj,k 's are H p atoms with defining
intervals Ij,k that have bounded overlap uniformly for each k, the sequence

Proof. The idea of constructing an atomic decomposition using Calderón's
reproducing formula is well understood, so we will only sketch it here, for
further details, see [5] and [18]. Let Nf (x) = sup{|(f ∗ ψt )(y)| : |x − y| < t}
denote the non-tangential maximal function of f with respect to a suitable
smooth function ψ with nonvanishing integral. One considers the open sets
Ok = {Nf > 2k }, all integers k, and builds the atoms with defining interval
associated to the intervals, actually cubes, of the Whitney decomposition
of Ok , and hence satisfying all the required properties. More precisely, one
6

k
constructs a sequence of bounded
P functions fk with norm not exceeding c 2
for each k, and such that f − |k|≤n fk → 0 as n → ∞ in the sense of distriP
butions. These functions have the further property that fk (x) = j αj,k (x) ,
where |αj,k (x)| ≤ c 2k , c is a constant, each αj,k has vanishing moments up
to order [n(1/p − 1)] and is supported in Ij,k - roughly one of the Whitney
cubes -, where the Ij,k 's have bounded overlaps for each k, uniformly in k. It
only remains now to scale αj,k ,

αj,k (x) = λj,k aj,k (x) ,
and balance the contribution of each term to the sum. Let λj,k = 2k |Ij,k |1/p .
Then, aj,k (x) is essentially an H p atom with defining interval Ij,k , and one

As an application of this atomic decomposition, the reader should have
no difficulty in showing directly the C. Fefferman, Rivière, Sagher characterization of H p,q , see [10].
Another interesting application of this decomposition is to H p,q − Lp,∞
estimates for Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operators T , p < q ≤ ∞.
This approach combines the concept of p-quasi local operator of Weisz, see
[17], with the idea of variable dilations of R. Fefferman and Soria, see [11].
Intuitively, since Hörmander's condition implies that T maps H 1 into L1 , say,
for T to be defined in H 1,s , 1 < s ≤ ∞, some strengthening of this condition
is required. This is accomplished by the variable dilations. Moreover, since
we will include p < 1 in our discussion, as p gets smaller, more regularity of
the kernel of T will be required. This justifies the following definition.
Given 0 < p ≤ 1, let N = [n(1/p − 1)], and, associated to the kernel
k(x, y) of a Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operator T , consider the
modulus of continuity ωp given by

where 0 < δ ≤ 1, and the sup is taken over the collection of arbitrary intervals
I of Rn centered at yI . Here, for a multi-index α = (α1 , . . . , αn ),
kα (x, yI ) =

ωp (δ) controls the behavior of T on atoms. More precisely, if a is an H p atom
with defining interval I, and 0 < δ < 1, observe that

and, consequently,

We are now ready to prove the H p,q − Lp,∞ estimate for a CalderónZygmund singular integral operator T with kernel k(x, y).
Theorem 2.2. Let 0 < p ≤ 1, and p < q ≤ ∞. Assume that a CalderónZygmund singular integral operator T is of weak-type (r, r) for some 1 < r <
∞, and that the modulus of continuity ωp of the kernel k satisfies a Dini
condition of order q/(q − p), namely,

We pass now to the converse of Theorem 2.1. It is apparent that a
condition that relates the coefficients λj with the
P corresponding atoms aj
involved in an atomic decomposition of the form j λj aj (x) is relevant here.
More precisely, if Ij denotes the supporting interval of aj , let
Ik = {j : 2k ≤ |λj |/|Ij |1/p < 2k+1 } ,
and, for λ = {λj }, put
kλk[p,q] =

We then have,
Theorem
and let f be a distribution given
P 2.3. Let 0 < p ≤ 1, 0 < q ≤ ∞,
p
by f = j λj aj (x) , where the aj 's are H atoms, and the convergence is in
the sense of distributions. Further, assume that the family {Ij } consisting of
the supports of the aj 's has bounded overlap at each level Ik uniformly in k,
and kλk[p,q] < ∞. Then, f ∈ H p,q , and kf kH p,q ≤ c kλk[p,q].
Proof. Let Mf (x) = supt>0 |(f ∗ ψt )(x)| denote the radial maximal function
of f with respect to a suitable smooth function ψ with support contained in
{|x| ≤ 1} and nonvanishing integral. We will verify that Mf satisfies the
conditions of Lemma 1.1 and is thus in Lp,q .
Fix an integer k0 and let
XX
g(x) =
λj aj (x) .
k<k0 j∈Ik

Since kMgk∞ ≤ kgk∞ it suffices to estimate |g(x)|. Let C be the bounded
overlap constant for the family of the supports of the aj 's. Then, for j ∈ Ik ,
|λj | |aj (x)| =

Since aj has N = [n(1/p − 1)] vanishing moments, it is not hard to see
that, if Ij is the defining interval of aj and Ij is centered at xj , and γ =
(n + N + 1)/n > 1/p, then, with c independent of j, φj (x) = Maj (x) satisfies
φj (x) ≤ c

Interpolation between Hardy-Lorentz spaces

We are now ready to identify the intermediate spaces of a couple of HardyLorentz spaces with the same first index p ≤ 1.
Theorem 2.5. Let 0 < p ≤ 1. Given 0 < q1 < q < q2 ≤ ∞, define 0 < η < 1
by the relation 1/q = (1 − η)/q1 + η/q2 . Then, with equivalent quasinorms,
H p,q = (H p,q1 , H p,q2 )η,q .
Proof. Since the non-tangential maximal function Nf of a distribution f in
H p,q1 is in Lp,q1 , and that of f in H p,q2 is in Lp,q2 , we have
K(t, Nf ; Lp,q1 , Lp,q2 ) ≤ c K(t, f ; H p,q1 , H p,q2 ) .
Thus,
kNf kp,q ∼ kNf k(Lp,q1 ,Lp,q2 )η,q ≤ c kf k(H p,q1 ,H p,q2 )η,q ,
and (H p,q1 , H p,q2 )η,q ֒→ H p,q .

Let μk = j∈Ik |λj,k | . By construction, k μk ∼ kf kH p,q . Now, rearrange
{μk } into {μ∗l }, and, for each l ≥ 1, let kl P
be suchPthat μkl = μ∗l . For
l0 ≥ 1, let Kl0 = {k1 , . . . , kl0 }, and put f1,l0 = k∈Kl
j λj,k aj,k and f2,l0 =

f − f1,l0 . Then, by Theorem 2.2, f1,l0 ∈ H , f2,l0 ∈ H p,q2 , and, with the
usual interpretation for q2 = ∞,

Now, by Homstedt's formula, there is a choice of l0 such that the right-hand

K(t, f ; H p,q1 , H p,q2 ) ≤ c K(t, {μk }; lq1 , lq2 ) .

Thus,
kf k(H p,q1 ,H p,q2 )η,q ≤ c k{μk }k(lq1 ,lq2 )η,q
≤ c k{μk }klq ≤ c kf kH p,q ,
and H p,q ֒→ (H p,q1 , H p,q2 )η,q .

The reader will have no difficulty in verifying that Theorem 2.5 gives that
if T is a continuous, sublinear map from H 1 into L1 , and from H 1,∞ into L1,∞ ,
then kT f k1,q ≤ c kf kH 1,q for 1 < q < ∞. This observation has numerous
applications. For instance, consider the Calderón-Zygmund singular integral
operators with variable kernel defined by
Z
Ω(x, x−y)
TΩ (f )(x) = p.v.
f (y) dy .
|x − y|n
Rn
Under appropriate growth and smoothness assumptions on Ω, TΩ maps H 1
continuously into L1 , see [6], and H 1,∞ continuously into L1,∞ , see [8]. Thus,
if Ω satisfies the assumptions of both of these results, TΩ maps H 1,q continuously into L1,q for 1 < q < ∞. A similar result follows by invoking the
characterization of H 1,q given by C. Fefferman, Rivière and Sagher. However, in this case the H p −Lp estimate requires additional smoothness of Ω, as
shown, for instance, in [6]. Similar considerations apply to the Marcinkiewicz
integral, see [9], and [7].
Finally, when p < 1, our results cover, for instance, the δ-CZ operators
satisfying T ∗ (1) = 0 discussed by Alvarez and Milman, see [3]. These operators, as well as a more general related class introduced in [15], preserve H p
and H p,∞ for n/(n + δ) < p ≤ 1, and, consequently, by Theorem 2.5, they
also preserve H p,q for p in that same range, and q > p.
