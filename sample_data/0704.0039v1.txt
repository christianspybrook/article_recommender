Abstract
The quadratic pion scalar radius, hr 2 iπs , plays an important role for present precise determinations of ππ scattering. Recently, it has been object of controversy between Ynduráin, on
the one hand, and Ananthanarayan, Caprini, Colangelo, Gasser and Leutwyler (ACCGL),
on the other. While the former, based on an Omnès representation of the scalar form factor,
obtains hr 2 iπs = 0.75 ± 0.07 fm2 , the latter, from a solution of the Muskhelishvili-Omnès
equations with ππ and K K̄ as coupled channels, end with hr 2 iπs = 0.61 ± 0.04 fm2 . A large
discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Ynduráin's
method and show that for some S-wave null isospin (I) T −matrices the scalar form factor
has a zero previously overlooked. Once this is accounted for, the resulting hr 2 iπs is compatible with the value of ACCGL. Following the corrected version of Ynduráin's approach we
perform a new determination and obtain hr 2 iπs = 0.63 ± 0.05 fm2 . The main source of error
is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 ππ phase shifts. Another
important contribution to the error is the not yet settled asymptotic phase of the scalar form
factor from QCD.

where hr 2iπs is the quadratic scalar radius of the pion.
The quantity hr 2 iπs contributes around 10% [1] to the values of the S-wave ππ scattering lengths
0
a0 and a20 as determined in ref.[1], by employing Roy equations and χP T to two loops. If one
takes into account that this reference gives a precision of 2.2% in its calculation of the scattering
lengths, a 10% of contribution from hr 2 iπs is a large one. Related to that, hr 2 iπs is also important
in SU(2) × SU(2) χP T since it gives the low energy constant l̄4 that controls the departure of Fπ
from its value in the chiral limit [2, 3] at leading order correction.
Based on one loop χP T , Gasser and Leutwyler [2] obtained hr 2 iπs = 0.55 ± 0.15 fm2 . This
calculation was improved later on by the same authors together with Donoghue [4], who solved
the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omnès equations with the coupled channels of ππ and K K̄. The
update of this calculation, performed in ref.[1], gives hr 2 iπs = 0.61±0.04 fm2 , where the new results
on S-wave I=0 ππ phase shifts from the Roy equation analysis of ref.[5] are included. Moussallam
[6] employs the same approach and obtains values in agreement with the previous result.
One should notice that solutions of the Muskhelishvili-Omnès equations for the scalar form
factor rely on non-measured T −matrix elements or on assumptions about which are the channels
that matter. Given the importance of hr 2 iπs , and the possible systematic errors in the analyses
based on Muskhelishvili-Omnès equations, other independent approaches are most welcome. In
this respect we quote the works [7, 8, 9], and Ynduráin's ones [10, 11, 12]. These latter works have
challenged the previous value for hr 2 iπs , shifting it to the larger hr 2 iπs = 0.75 ± 0.07 fm2 . From
ref.[1] the equations,
(1.3)
δa00 = +0.027∆r2 , δa20 = −0.004∆r2 ,

give the change of the scattering lengths under a variation of hr 2 iπs defined by hr 2iπs = 0.61(1 +
∆r2 ) fm2 . For the difference between the central values of hr 2 iπs given above from refs.[1, 10], one
has ∆r2 = +0.23. This corresponds to δa00 = +0.006 and δa20 = −0.001, while the errors quoted
are a00 = 0.220 ± 0.005 and a20 = −0.0444 ± 0.0010. We then adduce about shifting the central
values for the predicted scattering lengths at the level of one sigma.
The value taken for hr 2 iπs is also important for determining the O(p4 ) χP T coupling l̄4 . The
value of ref.[1] is l̄4 = 4.4 ± 0.2 while that of ref.[10] is l̄4 = 5.4 ± 0.5. Both values are incompatible
within errors.
The papers [10, 11, 12] have been questioned in refs.[13, 14]. The value of the Kπ quadratic
2 Kπ
scalar radius, hr 2 iKπ
= 0.31 ± 0.06 fm2 , is not accurate,
s , obtained by Ynduráin in ref.[10], hr is
because he relies on old experiments and on a bad parameterization of low energy S-wave I=1/2 Kπ

phase shifts by assuming dominance of the κ resonance as a standard Breit-Wigner pole [15]. Furthermore, hr 2 iKπ
was recently fixed by high statistics experiments in an interval in agreement with
s
the sharp prediction of [15], based on dispersion relations (three-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès
equations from the T −matrix of ref.[16]) and two-loop χPT [17]. From the recent experiments
±π
[18, 19], one has for the charged kaons [18] hr 2 iK
= 0.235 ± 0.014 ± 0.007 fm2 , and for the
s
Lπ
neutral ones [19] hr 2 iK
= 0.165 ± 0.016 fm2 . The prediction of [15], in an isospin limit, is
s
hr 2 iKπ
= 0.192 ± 0.012 fm2 , lying just in the middle of the experimental determinations. Another
s
issue is Ynduráin's more sounded determination of the pionic scalar radius, whose (in)correctness
is not settled yet.
In this paper we concentrate on the approach of Ynduráin [10, 11, 12] to evaluate the quadratic
scalar radius of the pion based on an Omnés representation of the pion non-strange scalar form
factor. Our main conclusion will be that this approach [10] and the solution of the MuskhelishviliOmnès equations [4], with ππ and K K̄ as coupled channels, agree between each other if one
properly takes into account, for some T −matrices, the presence of a zero in the pion scalar form
factor at energies slightly below the K K̄ threshold. Precisely these T −matrices are those used in
[10] and favoured in [11]. Once this is considered we conclude that hr 2 iπs = 0.63 ± 0.05 fm2 .
The contents of the paper are organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the Omnès representation of Γπ (t) and derive the expression to calculate hr 2 iπs . This calculation is performed
in section 3, where we consider different parameterizations for experimental data and asymptotic
phases for the scalar form factor. Conclusions are given in the last section.

Scalar form factor

The pion scalar form factor Γπ (t), eq.(1.1), is an analytic function of t with a right hand cut,
due to unitarity, for t ≥ 4m2π . Performing a dispersion relation of its logarithm, with the possible
zeroes of Γπ (t) removed, the Omnès representation results,

Here φ(s), s ≥ 4m2π , is the phase of the scalar form factor and P (t) is a polynomial made up from
the zeroes of Γπ (t). In ref.[10] the scalar form factor is assumed to be free of zeroes and hence
P (t) is just the constant Γπ (0) (the exponential factor is 1 for t = 0). Thus,

One of the features of the pion scalar form factor of refs.[4, 6, 8], as discussed in ref.[13], is the
presence of a strong dip at energies around the K K̄ threshold. This feature is also shared by the
strong S-wave I=0 ππ amplitude, tππ . This is so because tππ is in very good approximation purely
elastic below the K K̄ threshold and hence, neglecting inelasticity altogether in the discussion that
3

follows, it is proportional to sin δπ eiδπ , with δπ the S-wave I=0 ππ phase shift. It is an experimental
fact that δπ is very close to π around the K K̄ threshold, as shown in fig.1. Therefore, if δπ = π
happens before the opening of this channel the strong amplitude has a zero at that energy. On
the other hand, if δπ = π occurs after the K K̄ threshold, because inelasticity is then substantial,
see eq.(2.4) below, there is not a zero but a pronounced dip in |tππ |. This dip can be arbitrarily
close to zero if before the K K̄ threshold δπ approaches π more and more, without reaching it.

Figure 1: S-wave I = 0 ππ phase shift, δπ (s). Experimental data are from refs.[21, 25, 26, 27].
Because of Watson final state theorem the phase φ(s) in eq.(2.1) is given by δπ (s) below the
K K̄ threshold, neglecting inelasticity due to 4π or 6π states as indicated by experiments [20]. The
situation above the K K̄ threshold is more involved. Let us recall that
tππ = (η e2iδπ − 1)/2i ,

(2.4)

with 0 ≤ η ≤ 1 and the the inelasticity is given by 1 − η 2 , with η the elasticity coefficient. We
denote by φ(s) the phase of tππ , required to be continuous. By continuity, close enough to the
K K̄ threshold and above it, η → 1 and then we are in the same situation as in the elastic case.
As a result, because of the Watson final state theorem and continuity, the phase of Γπ (t) must
still be given by φ(s). For δπ (sK ) < π, sK = 4m2K , φ(s) does not follow the increasing trend with
energy of δπ (s) but drops as a result of eq.(2.4), see fig.2 for δπ (sK ) < π. This is easily seen by
writing explicitely the real and imaginary parts of tππ in eq.(2.4),

tππ = η sin 2δπ + (1 − η cos 2δπ ) .
(2.5)

The imaginary part is always positive (η < 1 above the K K̄ threshold and 1.1 GeV [20]) while the
real part is negative for δπ < π, but in an interval of just a few MeV the real part turns positive

details see the text. Notice that the uncertainty due to φas (s) is much reduced in the integrand.

as soon as δπ > π, fig.1. As a result, φ(s) passes quickly from values below but close to π to
the interval [0, π/2]. This rapid motion of φ(s) gives rise to a pronounced minimum of |Γπ (t)| at
this energy, as indicated in ref.[13] and shown in fig.3. The drop in φ(s) becomes more and more
dramatic as δπ (sK ) → π − (with the superscript +(−) indicating that the limit is approached from
values above(below), respectively); and in this limit, φ(sk ) = φ(sK ) is discontinuous at sK . This is
easily understood from eq.(2.5). Let us call s1 the point at which δπ (s1 ) = π with s1 > sK . Close
and above s1 , φ(s) ∈ [0, π/2], for the reasons explained above, and φ(s) has decreased very rapidly
from almost π at the K K̄ threshold to values below π/2 just after s1 . Then, in the limit s1 → s+

is discontinuous at s = sK . We stress that this discontinuity of φ(s) at sK when δπ (sK ) → π −
applies rigorously to φ(sK ) as well since η(sK ) = 1. This discontinuity at s = sK implies also that
the integrand in the Omnès representation for Γπ (t) develops a logarithmic singularity as,

changing the degree from 0 to 1. Hence, if δπ (sK ) ≥ π for a given tππ , instead of eqs.(2.2) and

For those tππ for which δπ (sK ) > π then φ(s) follows δπ (s) just after the K K̄ threshold and there
is no drop, as emphasized in ref.[11], see fig.2.
Summarizing, we have made here the same assumption as in ref.[11], that φ(s) follows φ(s)
above the K K̄ threshold, and we have shown that a necessary consequence of such hypothesis is
the zero of Γπ (t) at s1 when δπ (sK ) ≥ π. As a result eqs.(2.8) and (2.9) must be used in the latter
case, instead of eqs.(2.2) and (2.3), valid for δπ (sK ) < π. This was overlooked in refs.[10, 11, 12].
We show in appendix A why the previous discussion on the zero of Γπ (t) for δπ (sK ) ≥ π at s1
cannot be applied to all pion scalar form factors, in particular to the strange one.
If eq.(2.2) were used for those tππ with δπ (sK ) ≥ π then a strong maximum of |Γπ (t)| would be
wrongly obtained around the K K̄ threshold, instead of the aforementioned zero or the minimum
of refs.[4, 6], as shown in fig.3 by the dashed-dotted line. That is also shown in fig.10 of ref.[22]
or fig.2 of [13]. This is the situation for the Γπ (t) of refs.[10, 11], and it is the reason why
hr 2 iπs obtained there is much larger than that of refs.[4, 1, 6]. That is, Ynduráin uses eqs.(2.2),
(2.3) for δπ (sK ) ≥ π, instead of the correct eqs.(2.8), (2.9) (solid line in fig.3). The unique and
important role played by δπ (sK ) (for elastic tππ below the K K̄ threshold) is perfectly recognised
in ref.[11]. However, in this reference the astonishing conclusion that Γπ (t) has two radically
different behaviours under tiny variations of tππ was sustained. These tiny variations are enough
to pass from δπ (sK ) < π to δπ (sK ) ≥ π [10], while the T − or S−matrix are fully continuous.
We see now that the origin of such conclusion is the use of eq.(2.2) even when δπ (sK ) ≥ π, in
which case eq.(2.8) is the correct one. If this is properly taken into account, we then observe
a continuous behaviour of Γπ (t) under variations in the parameters of the K−matrix eq.(3.14),
compare between the solid and dashed lines in fig.3.
Let us now show how to fix s1 in terms of the knowledge of δπ (s) with δπ (sK ) ≥ π. For this
purpose let us perform a dispersion relation of Γπ (t) with two subtractions,

or smaller than π but close to.

Figure 3: |Γπ (t)/Γπ (0)| from eq.(2.2) with δπ (sK ) < π, dashed-line, and δπ (sK ) > π, dashed-dotted line.

The solid line corresponds to use the correct eq.(2.8) for the latter case. For this figure we have used
parameterization II (defined in section 3) with α1 = 2.28 (dashed line) and 2.20 (dashed-dotted and solid
lines). The dashed-double-dotted line is the scalar form factor of ref.[8] that has δπ (sK ) > π.

From asymptotic QCD [23] one expects that the scalar form factor vanishes at infinity [10, 12],
then the dispersion integral in eq.(2.10) should converge rather fast. Eq.(2.10) is useful because
it tells us that the only point around 1 GeV where there can be a zero in Γπ (t) is at the energy
s1 for which the imaginary part of Γπ (t) vanishes. Otherwise, the integral in the right hand side
of eq.(2.10) picks up an imaginary part and there is no way to cancel it as Γπ (0), hr 2 iπs and t are
all real. Since ImΓπ (t) = |Γπ (t)| sin δπ (t) for t ≤ sK , it certainly vanishes at the point s1 where
δπ (s1 ) = π. As there is only one zero at such energies, this determines s1 exactly in terms of the
given parameterization for δπ (s).
One could argue against the argument just given to determine s1 that this energy could be
complex. However, this would imply two zeroes at s1 and s∗1 , and then the degree of P (t) would
be two instead of one. Notice that the degree of the polynomial P (t) is discrete and thus, by
softness in the continuous parameters of the T −matrix, its value should stay at 1 for some open
domain in the parameters with δπ (sK ) > π until a discontinuity develops. Physically, the presence
of two zeroes would in turn require that φ(s) → 3π so as to guarantee that Γπ (t) still vanishes as
−1/t, as required by asymptotic QCD [23, 10]. This value for the asymptotic phase seems to be
rather unrealistic as φ(s) only reaches 2π at already quite high energy values, as shown in fig.2.

with sH = 2.252 GeV2 . Reasons for fixing sH to this value are given below.
The main issue in the application of eq.(3.11) is to determine φ(s) in the integrand. Below the
K K̄ threshold and neglecting inelasticity, one has that φ(s) = δπ (s), 4m2π ≤ s ≤ 4m2K . This follows
because of the Watson final state theorem, continuity and the equality φ(4m2π ) = δπ (4m2π ) = 0.
For practical applications we shall consider the S-wave I=0 ππ phase shifts given by the
K−matrix parameterization of ref.[20] (from its energy dependent analysis of data from 0.6 GeV
up to 1.9 GeV) and the parameterizations of ref.[1] (CGL) and ref.[24] (PY). The resulting δπ (s)
for all these parameterizations are shown in fig.1. We use CGL from ππ threshold up to 0.8 GeV,
because this is the upper limit of its analysis, while PY is used up to 0.9 GeV, because at this
energy it matches well inside the experimental errors with the data of [20]. The K−matrix of
ref.[20] is used for energies above 0.8 GeV, when using CGL below this energy (parameterization
I), and above 0.9 GeV, when using PY for lower energies (parameterization II). We take the parameterizations CGL and PY as their difference below 0.8 GeV accounts well for the experimental
uncertainties in δπ , see fig.1, and they satisfy constraints from χP T (the former) and dispersion relations (both). The reason why we skip to use the parameterization of ref.[20] for lower energies is
because one should be there as precise as possible since this region gives the largest contribution to
hr 2 iπs , as it is evident from the right panel of fig.2. It happens that the K−matrix of [20], that fits
data above 0.6 GeV, is not compatible with data from Ke4 decays [25, 26]. We show in the insert
of fig.1 the comparison of the parameterizations CGL and PY with the Ke4 data of [25, 26]. We
also show in the same figure the experimental points on δπ from refs.[20, 21, 27]. Both refs.[20, 21]
are compatible within errors, with some disagreement above 1.5 GeV. This disagreement does not
affect our numerical results since above 1.5 GeV we do not rely on data.
The K−matrix of ref.[20] is given by,

with units given in appropriate powers of GeV. In order to calculate the contribution from the
phase shifts of this K−matrix we generate Monte-Carlo gaussian samples, taking into account the
errors shown in eq.(3.14), and evaluate QH according to eq.(3.12). The central value of δπ (sK )
for the K−matrix of ref.[20] is 3.05, slightly below π. When generating Monte-Carlo gaussian
samples according to eq.(3.14), there are cases with δπ (sK ) ≥ π, around 30% of the samples. Note
that for these cases one also has the contribution −6/s1 in eq.(3.11).
The application of Watson final state theorem for s > 4m2K is not straightforward since inelastic
channels are relevant. The first important one is the K K̄ channel associated in turn with the
appearance of the narrow f0 (980) resonance, just on top of its threshold. This implies a sudden
drop of the elasticity parameter η, but it again rapidly raises (the f0 (980) resonance is narrow with
a width around 30 MeV) and in the region 1.12 . s . 1.52 GeV2 is compatible within errors with
η = 1 [20, 21]. For η ≃ 1, the Watson final state theorem would imply again that φ(s) = φ(s) [10],
but, as emphasized by [13], this equality only holds, in principle, modulo π. The reason advocated
in ref.[13] is the presence of the region sK < s < 1.12 GeV2 where inelasticity can be large, and
then continuity arguments alone cannot be applied to guarantee the equality φ(s) = φ(s). This
argument has been proved in ref.[11] to be quite irrelevant in the present case. In order to show
this a diagonalization of the ππ and K K̄ S−matrix is done. These channels are the relevant ones
when η is clearly different from 1, between 1 and 1.1 GeV. Above that energy one also has the
opening of the ηη channel and the increasing role of multipion states.
We reproduce here the arguments of ref.[11], but deliver expressions directly in terms of the
phase shifts and elasticity parameter, instead of K−matrix parameters as done in ref.[11]. For
two channel scattering, because of unitarity, the T −matrix can be written as:

with δK the elastic S-wave I=0 K K̄ phase shift. In terms of the T -matrix the S-wave I=0 S−matrix
is given by,

a real orthogonal matrix C, and hence both the T − and S−matrices are also diagonalized with
the same matrix. Writing,

The eigenvalue phase δ(+) satisfies δ(+) (sK ) = δπ (sK ). The expressions above for exp 2iδ(+) and
exp 2iδ(−) interchange between each other when tan ∆ crosses zero and simultaneously the sign in
the right hand side of eq.(3.19) for sin θ changes. This diagonalization allows to disentangle two
elastic scattering channels. The scalar form factors attached to every of these channels, Γ′1 and
Γ′2 , will satisfy the Watson final state theorem in the whole energy range and then one has,

(3.22)
ΓK = qK

The ± in front of |Γ′2 | is due to the fact that Γ′2 = 0 at sK , as follows from its definition in the
equation above. Since Watson final state theorem only fixes the phase of Γ′2 up to modulo π, and
the phase is not defined in the zero, we cannot fix the sign in front at this stage. Next, Γ′1 has a
zero at s1 when δπ (sK ) ≥ π. For this case, −|Γ′1 | must appear in the previous equation, so as to
θ(δπ (sK )−π)
guarantee continuity of its ascribed phase,
.
p and this is why λ = (−1)
Now, when η → 1 then sin θ → 0 as (1 − η)/2. Thus, the phase φ(s) of Γπ is the eigenvalue
phase δ(+) . This eigenvalue phase can be calculated given the T −matrix. For those T −matrices
employed here, and those of refs.[10, 11, 4, 13], δ(+) (s) follows rather closely φ(s) in the whole
energy range. This is shown in fig.2 and already discussed in detail in ref.[11]. In this way, one
guarantees that φ(s) and φ(s) do not differ in an integer multiple of π when η ≃ 1, 1.12 . s . 1.52
GeV2 .
For the calculation of QH in eq.(3.12) we shall equate φ(s) = φ(s) for 4m2K < s < 1.52 GeV2 .

Now, eq.(3.22) can also be used to estimate the error of approximating φ(s) by φ(s) in the range
4m2K < s < 1.52 GeV2 to calculate I2 and I3 as done in eq.(3.23). We could have also used δ(+) (s)
in eq.(3.23). However, notice that when η . 1 then φ(s) ≃ δ(+) (s) and when inelasticity can be
substantial the difference between δ(+) (s) and φ(s) is well taken into account in the error analysis
that follows. Remarkably, consistency of our approach also requires φ(s) to be closer to φ(s) than
to δ(+) (s). The reason is that φ(s) for δπ (sK ) ≥ π is in very good approximation the φ(s) for
δπ (sK ) < π plus π, this is clear from fig.2. This difference is precisely the required one in order
to have the same value for hr 2iπs either for δπ (sK ) < π or δπ (sK ) ≥ π from eq.(3.11). However, the
difference for δ(+) (s) between δπ (sK ) < π and δπ (sK ) ≥ π is smaller than π. Indeed, we note that
φ(s) follows closer φ(s) than δ(+) (s) for the explicit form factors of refs.[8, 4].
Let us consider first the range 1.12 < s < 1.52 GeV2 where from experiment [20] η ≃ 1 within
errors. With ǫ = ± tan θ|Γ′2 /Γ′1 | and ρ = δ(−) − δ(+) , eq.(3.22) allows us to write,

The the ratio |Γ′2 /Γ′1 |, present in ǫ, is not expected to be large since the f0 (1300) couples mostly to 4π and
similarly to ππ and K K̄, and the f0 (1500) does mostly to ππ [28].

Using η = 0.8 in the range 1.12 . s . 1.52 GeV, η ≃ 1 from the energy dependent analysis of
ref.[20] given by the K−matrix of eq.(3.13), one ends with ǫ ≃ 0.3. Taking into account that δ(+)
is larger than & 3π/2 for δπ (sK ) ≥ π (in this case δ(+) ≃ δπ ), and around 3π/4 for δπ (sK ) < π,
see fig.2, one ends with relative corrections to δ(+) around 6% for the former case and 13% for the
latter. Although the K−matrix of ref.[20], eq.(3.13), is given up to 1.9 GeV, one should be aware
that to take only the two channels ππ and K K̄ in the whole energy range is an oversimplification,
particularly above 1.2 GeV. Because of this we finally double the previous estimate. Hence I3 is
calculated with a relative error of 12% for δπ (sK ) ≥ π and 25% for δπ (sK ) < π.
In the narrow region between sK < s < 1.12 GeV2 , η can be rather different from 1, due to
the f0 (980) that couples very strongly to the just open K K̄ channel. However, from the direct
measurements of ππ → K K̄ [29], where 1 − η 2 is directly measured,#4 one has a better way to
determine η than from ππ scattering [20, 21]. It results from the former experiments, as shown
also by explicit calculations [30, 31, 32], that η is not so small as indicated in ππ experiments [20],
and one has η ≃ 0.6 − 0.7 for its minimum value. Employing η = 0.6 in eq.(3.28) then ǫ ≃ 0.5.
Taking δ(+) around π/2 when δπ (sK ) < π this implies a relative error of 30%. For δπ (sK ) ≥ π one
has instead δ(+) & π, and a 15% of estimated error. Regarding the ratio of the moduli of form
factors entering in ǫ we expect it to be . 1 (see appendix A). Therefore, our error in the evaluation
of I2 is estimated to be 30% and 15% for the cases δπ (sK ) < π and δπ (sK ) ≥ π, respectively.
As a result of the discussion following eq.(3.24), we consider that the error estimates done
for I2 and I3 in the case δπ (sK ) < π are too conservative and that the relative errors given for
δπ (sK ) > π are more realistic. Nonetheless, since the absolute errors that one obtains for I2 and
I3 are the same in both cases (because I2 and I3 for δπ (sK ) < π are around a factor 2 smaller than
those for δπ (sK ) ≥ π) we keep the errors as given above. To the previous errors for I2 and I3 due
to inelasticity, we also add in quadrature the noise in the calculation of QH due to the error in
tππ from the uncertainties in the parameters of the K−matrix eqs.(3.13), (3.14), and those in the
parameterizations CGL and PY.
We finally employ for s > 2.25 GeV2 the asymptotic phase of the pion scalar form factor in
order to evaluate QA in eq.(3.12). This phase is determined so as to match with the asymptotic
behaviour of Γπ (t) as −1/t from asymptotic QCD. The Omnès representation of the scalar form
factor, eqs.(2.2) and (2.8), tend to t−q/π and t−q/π+1 for t → ∞, respectively. Here, q is the
asymptotic behaviour of the phase φ(s), when s → ∞. Hence, for δπ (sK ) < π the form factor is
required to tend to π while for δπ (sK ) ≥ π the asymptotic value should be 2π. The way φ(s) is
predicted to approach the limiting value is somewhat ambiguous [11, 12],

There is as well a controversy between [14] and [12] regarding the ± sign in eq.(3.29). If leading
twist contributions dominate [11, 12] then the limiting value is reached from above and one has
the plus sign, while if twist three contributions are the dominant ones [14] the minus sign has to
be considered [12]. In the left panel of fig.2 we show with the wide bands the values of φ(s)as for

In the value for hr 2 iπs the errors due to I1 , I2 , I3 and QA are added in quadrature.
s > 2.25 GeV2 from eq.(3.29), considering both signs, for n = 1 (δπ (sK ) < π) and 2 (δπ (sK ) ≥ π).
We see in the figure that above 1.4 − 1.5 GeV (1.96 − 2.25 GeV2 ) both φ(s) and φ(s)as phases
match and this is why we take sH = 2.25 GeV2 in eq.(3.11), similarly as done in refs.[10, 11]. In
this way, we also avoid to enter into hadronic details in a region where η < 1 with the onset of
the f0 (1500) resonance. The present uncertainty whether the + or − sign holds in eq.(3.29) is
taken as a source of error in evaluating QA . The other source of uncertainty comes from the value
taken for Λ2 , 0.1 < Λ2 < 0.35 GeV2 , as suggested in ref.[10]. From fig.2 it is clear that our error
estimate for φas (s) is very conservative and should account for uncertainties due to the onset of
inelasticity for energies above 1.4 − 1.5 GeV and to the appearance of the f0 (1500) resonance. In
the right panel of fig.2 we show the integrand for hr 2 iπs , eq.(3.12), for parameterization I (dashed
line) and II (solid line). Notice as the large uncertainty in φas (s) is much reduced in the integrand
as it happens for the higher energy domain.
In table 1 we show the values of I1 , I2 , I3 , QH , QA and hr 2 iπs for the parameterizations I and
II and for the two cases δπ (sK ) ≥ π and δπ (sK ) < π. This table shows the disappearance of the
disagreement between the cases δπ (sK ) ≥ π and δπ (sK ) < π from the ππ and K K̄ T −matrix
of eq.(3.13), once the zero of Γπ (t) at s1 < sK is taken into account for the former case. This
disagreement was the reason for the controversy between Ynduráin's and ACCGL's values of hr 2 iπs .
The fact that the parameterization II gives rise to a larger value of hr 2 iπs than I is because PY
follows the upper δπ data below 0.9 GeV, while CGL follows lower ones, as shown in fig.1.
The different errors in table 1 are added in quadrature. The final value for hr 2 iπs is the mean
between those of parameterizations I and II and the error is taken such that it spans the interval
of values in table 1 at the level of two sigmas. One ends with:
hr 2 iπs = 0.63 ± 0.05 fm2 .

(3.30)

The largest sources of error in hr 2 iπs are the uncertainties in the experimental δπ and in the
asymptotic phase. This is due to the fact that the former are enhanced because of its weight in
the integrand, see fig.2, and the latter due to its large size.
We see that this number is compatible with that of refs.[1, 4] hr 2 iπs = 0.61±0.04 fm2 . Ynduráin's
value should be considered superseded by that of eq.(3.30) since the presence of the zero in Γπ (t)
was not considered for δπ (sK ) ≥ π. Now, this is corrected. On the other hand, we have also
13

evaluated hr 2 iπs directly from the scalar form factor obtained with the dynamical approach of ref.[8]
from Unitary χPT and we obtain hr 2 iπs = 0.64 ± 0.06, in perfect agreement with eq.(3.30).#5
We can also work out from our determination of hr 2 iπs , eq.(3.30), values for the O(p4 ) SU(2)
χP T low energy constant l̄4 . We take the two loop expression in χP T for hr 2 iπs [1],

where fπ = 92.4 MeV is the pion decay constant, ξ = (Mπ /4πfπ )2 and Mπ is the pion mass. First,
at the one loop level calculation ∆r = 0 and then one obtains,
l̄4 = 4.7 ± 0.3 .

(3.32)

We now move to the determination of l̄4 based on the full two loop relation between hr 2 iπs and l̄4 .
The expression for ∆r can be found in Appendix C of ref.[1]. ∆r is given in terms of one O(p6 )
χP T counterterm, reS2 , and four O(p4 ) ones. Taking the values of all these parameters from ref.[1],
and solving for l̄4 , one arrives to
l̄4 = 4.5 ± 0.3 .

(3.33)

This number is in perfect agreement with l̄4 = 4.4 ± 0.2 [1].

Conclusions

In this paper we have addressed the issue of the discrepancies between the values of the quadratic
pion scalar radius of Leutwyler et al. [4, 13], hr 2 iπs = 0.61 ± 0.04 fm2 , and Ynduráin's papers
[10, 11, 12], hr 2 i = 0.75±0.07 fm2 . One of the reasons of interest for having a precise determination
of hr 2 iπs is its contribution of a 10% to a00 and a20 , calculated with a precision of 2% in ref.[1]. The
value taken for hr 2 iπs is also important for determining the O(p4 ) χPT coupling l̄4 .
From our study it follows that Ynduráin's method to calculate hr 2 iπs [10, 11], based on an
Omnès representation of the pion scalar form factor, and that derived by solving the two coupled
channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès equations [4, 1], are compatible. It is shown that the reason for the
aforementioned discrepancy is the presence of a zero in Γπ (t) for those S-wave I=0 T −matrices
with δπ (sK ) ≥ π and elastic below the K K̄ threshold, with sK = 4m2K . This zero was unnoticed
in refs.[10, 11, 13], though necessarily required by the approach followed there. Once this zero
is taken into account the same value for hr 2 iπs is obtained irrespectively of whether δπ (sK ) ≥ π
or δπ (sK ) < π. Our final result is hr 2 iπs = 0.63 ± 0.05 fm2 . This value takes into account
present experimental uncertainty in the values of δπ (s), inelasticity effects and discrepancies in
the predicted asymptotic phase of Γπ (t) from QCD. In this sense, we wonder about the reliability
of the error analysis in refs.[1, 4] since the last source of uncertainty was not considered in those
papers and is almost as large as their quoted total uncertainty hr 2 iπs = 0.61 ± 0.04 fm2 . Employing
our value for hr 2 iπs we calculate l̄4 = 4.5 ± 0.3. This value is in very good agreement with
l̄4 = 4.4 ± 0.2 of ref.[1].
#5

The scalar form factor of ref.[8] has δπ (sK ) > π and we have checked that it has a zero at s1 , as it should.
This is shown in fig.3.

where the functions Gi (t) do not have right hand cut. This equation is interesting as tells us that
if pion dynamics dominate, |G1 | >> |G2 |, then F1 ≃ G1 t11 and the form factor phase φ(s) follows
φ(s). As a result, like t11 , it has a zero at s1 below the K K̄ threshold for δπ (sK ) ≥ π, as shown
in section 3. On the other hand, if kaon dynamics dominates, |G2 | >> |G1 |, then F1 ≃ G2 t12 and
φ(s) follows the phase of t12 , that above the K K̄ threshold is clearly above π. This is why for
the pion strange scalar form factor there is no zero at s1 . sK for δπ (sK ) ≥ π, indeed there is a
maximum like that shown in fig.3 by the dashed-dotted line.
As in section 3 we now proceed to the diagnolization above the K K̄ threshold of the renormalized T −matrix T ′ ,

For δπ (sK ) ≥ π typical values, somewhat above the K K̄ threshold, are e2iδ(+) ≃ +i, e2iδ(−) ≃ −i
and sin θ > 0. For dominance of G1 one has F1 /G1 ≃ ρ−1
1 (i + cos 2θ)/2 while for dominance
−1/2 −1/2
of G2 the result is F1 /G2 ≃ − sin θ cos θ ρ2 ρ1
< 0. The factors G1,2 do not introduce
any change in φ(s) with respect to its value before the opening of the K K̄ threshold since they
are smooth functions in s.#6 In both cases the phase φ(s) is larger than π and F1 follows the
upper trend of phases shown in fig.2 (note that in this case e
t11 is in the first quadrant though
δπ > π). Now, doing the same exercise for δπ (sK ) < π, one has the typical values e2iδ(+) ≃ −i,
e2iδ(−) ≃ +i and sin θ < 0. For pion dominance then F1 /G1 ≃ ρ−1
1 (i − cos 2θ)/2 and for the kaon
−1/2 −1/2
one F1 /G2 ≃ + sin θ cos θρ2 ρ1
< 0. Thus, in the former case the phase is & π/2, and follows
the lower trend of phases of fig.2, while in the latter is & π and follows again the upper trend (this
is the case of the strange scalar form factor).
The demonstration in section 3 that φ(sK ) is discontinuous in the limit δπ (sK ) → π − by taking
s1 → s+

typically |t11 /t22 | ≃ 1, as shown above for energies somewhat above the K K̄ threshold, then
|Γ′2 /Γ′1 | ≃ | tan θ| < 1. This is why we consider that equating it to 1 in section 3 is a conservative
estimate.

Due to the Adler zeroes this is not necessarily case close to the ππ threshold.
