Abstract
We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as regulator an
exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions. We
show that the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual
strings can be formulated as an index problem in even-dimensional (loop-)space. We
think that the regulator used in this Letter can be applied to this index problems.

Introduction

We do not know what six-dimensional (2, 0) theory really is. It is believed
that it can sustain solitonic self-dual strings [1], although no one today knows
what a (non-Abelian) self-dual string really is. But if we break the gauge group
maximally to U (1)r , then we should be able to define the charges of these
mysterious self-dual strings by the asymptotic behaviour of the U (1) gauge
fields. One should expect these asymptotic U (1) fields to be (at least isomorphic
with) a copy of the familiar abelian two-form gauge potentials (with self-dual
field strengths).
It now seems to make sense to ask a question like, what is the dimension of
the moduli space of self-dual strings of a given charge?
If the gauge group is SU (2) and is broken to U (1) by the Higgs vacuum
expectation value (that should also determine the tension of the string), then the
intuitive answer to this question is 4N where N is the U (1) charge in a suitable
normalization, such that N = 1 corresponds to one self-dual string. One may
argue that half the supersymmetry is broken by the string. Therefore one string
should sustains 4 fermionic zero modes. Since some (half) of the supersymmety
is unbroken there should also be 4 corresponding bosonic zero modes. These
are naturally identified with the translational zero modes associated with the
four transverse directions to the string. Furthermore, the strings being BPS,
should be possible to separate at no cost of energy (thus staying in the moduli
space approximation). If we take them far from each other, one may suspect
that we can just add 4 bosonic zero modes from each string, to get 4N bosonic
zero modes in total in a configuration of N strings [2].
It would of course be nice to have a proof of this conjecture. Could it be
proven if one had some index theorem? We will not provide a full solution to
this problem in this Letter. But we will make it plausible that the problem can
indeed be solved by computing the index of a certain Dirac operator in loop
space.
To address our index problem, we think that one can lend the methods
that Callias [3] used to prove his index theorem in odd-dimensional spaces. In
our case we have an even number of dimensions (namely the four transverse
direction) so it is apparent that we would have to construct a new type of
index. This we do in section 3.
In section 2 we recall the Callias method [3] to address index problems
in open spaces, though we will modify Callias' regularization, using the more
convergent exponential function to obtain the index, as the limit

(2)

which is the regularization that Callias used. We think that using the more
convergent regularization of an exponential function is interesting in itself, as
it could possibly extend the Callias index theorem to a wider class of index
problems. Therefore we will devote the first part of this Letter on this subject.

But let us at once say that our regulator probably has no advantages when
attacking these old problems. It does not provide us with a solution for how to
count the number of zero modes in a multimonopole configuration with a nonmaximally broken gauge group, where the index can not be reliable computed
due to a contribution from the continuum portion of the spectrum. What we
hope though, is that our regulatization can be useful when attacking our new
index problem associated with the moduli space of self-dual strings.
In section 2 we obtain the index in one and three dimensions. In three
dimensions we apply this on the multimonopole moduli space and re-derive the
result in [4]. A recent review article on monopoles and supersymmetry is [5].
The one and three-dimensional index problems have also been studied in [6].
We then indicate how our method manages to reproduce the correct results in
any odd dimensions. In section 3 we show how one at least in principle should
be able to compute the dimension of the moduli space of N self-dual strings by
computing a certain index.

Computing the Callias index in odd-dimensional
spaces

For Dirac operators on open n − 1-dimensional space where n − 1 is odd, there
is an index theorem by Callias [3]. This applies to Dirac equations of the form
Dψ = 0

(3)

where the Dirac operator D is of the form
D = γi iDi + γn φ.

(4)

Here i = 1, ..., n − 1 and γμ ≡ (γi , γn ) denote the Dirac gamma matrices,
{γμ , γν } = 2δμν .

(5)

We define the gauge covariant derivative as iDis = i∂is + Ais and all our fields
are hermitian. If n − 1 is odd, the gamma matrices can be represented as


0 γi
γi =
,
γi 0 
0 i
γn =
(6)
−i 0
One may use the n-dimesional notation Aμ = (Ai , φ), D = γμ iDμ , but one must
then remember that space is really n − 1 dimensional.
If n − 1 is even there is no Weyl representation of the gamma matrices
(because of the inclusion of the 'gamma-five'), and no index theorem of this
form exists.
We define the 'gamma-five' for even n as
n

γ ≡ −i− 2 γ1***n

(7)

which then is hermitian, and we define the projectors
P± =

1
(1 ∓ γ) .
2
3

(8)

In odd dimensions n − 1, the Dirac operator splits into two Weyl operators
D
D†

≡
≡

P+ DP−
P− DP+

(9)

Because P± and D are all hermitian, it follows that D† is the hermitian conjugate
of D. Also, because D is already of an off-block diagonal form, it suffices to
include just one of the projectors, so we can just as well write this as
D = P+ D = DP−
D† = P− D = DP+

(10)

The index can now be defined as
dim ker D − dim ker D†
(11)


Since ker D = ker D† D and ker D† = ker DD† we can express this as2



(12)
dim ker D† D − dim ker DD† = dim ker γD2 .

where we have noted that γ = P− − P+ .
Callias, Weinberg and others used the regulator


M2

I(M ) = Tr γ 2
D + M2

(13)

to obtain the index as the limit M 2 → 0. In this Letter we will be slightly more
general. We define
Ji (x, y) ≡ tr hx |γγi f (D)| yi ,

(14)

for any function f (and of course D is not dimensionless, so D has to be accompanied by M in a suitable way). Then we notice that
W (x, y) ≡
=
where (manifestly)

(iγi ∂xi + γμ Aμ (x) + M ) hx |f (D)| yi 
hx |f (D)| yi −iγi ∂yi + γμ Aμ (y) + M

W (x, y) = hx |(D + M )f (D)| yi .
From this, we obtain the following identity

i ∂xi + ∂yi Ji (x, y) = 2tr hx |γDf (D)| yi
+tr (Aμ (y) − Aμ (x)) hx |γγμ f (D)| yi

(15)

(16)

(17)

In odd dimensions, the second term in the right hand side vanishes as x approaches y. This can be seen as being equivalent to the statement that there is
no chiral anomaly in odd dimensions (by using point-splitting and inserting a
Wilson line). So we get
i∂i Ji (x, x)

If we wish to compute the index as in Eq (13), then we can take
f (D) =

(however there is no unique choice of Ji ). We then get

(20)

The virtue of expressing Eq (13) as a total divergence, is that we then can
compute the index as a boundary integral over an (n − 2)-sphere at infinity as
Z

dΩn−2 rn−2 x̂i Ji (x, x).
(21)
I(M 2 ) =

where r is the radius of the sphere and dΩn−2 denotes the volume element of
the unit sphere.
If instead we wish to compute the index as the limit of

as s → ∞, then we get

We will now illustrate how one can use this Ji to compute the index in odd
dimensions.

The Dirac operator reads

(26)

We need the square of the Dirac operator,

(28)

We assume that φ(x) converges towards some constant values at x = −∞ and
x = +∞. That means that we may ignore ∂φ(x) for sufficiently large |x|, where
we then get

otherwise.

then we get

J(x, x) = tr (γγ1 γ2 )

φ

e−s(k +φ )
2π k 2 + φ2

(32)

If we compute the integral over k in the most natural way, then we get a result
that vanishes in the limit s → ∞. Could there be another way of defining this
integral, such that we do not get zero as the result? We notice that the integral
A(s) ≡

2

Z

dk

e−s(k +1)
k2 + 1

(33)

for s > 0 is convergent only if we integrate k along a line in the complex plane
which is such that it asymptotically is such that − π2 < θ < π2 where k = |k|eiθ .
Integrating along any such line in the complex plane, we get the same value of
this integral. If on the other hand we integrate over a line that asymptotically
lies outside this cone, then we get a divergent integral for s > 0. But we get
a convergent integral for s < 0. We then define the value of the integral for
s > 0 as the analytic continuation of the same integral for s < 0. It remains to
compute this convergent integral. Replacing k by ik and s by −s, we get the
integral

We define this as the principal value. This is ad hoc – we have no argument

We conclude that we could just as well define the integral that we had, as
lim

k2 + 1

(38)

But this requires us to perform the integration of k in the cone where it diverges
for s > 0, and then define this integral by analytic continuation. This seem to
be rather ad hoc. We have three rather week arguments why one should Wick
rotate. First, if we keep x − y as a small number, then we get the factor
eik(x−y) and this can act as a convergence factor only if we Wick rotate. (We
illustrate this in the Appendix where we compute the corresponding integral in
any complex number of dimensions.) Second, it seems to be the only way that
we could produce a non-trivial answer. Third, with this prescription we will
manage to reproduce the right answer in any odd number of dimensions, where
we can check our result against the safer regularization used by Callias.
If we compute the integral by this prescription, then we get

and we see that we indeed get the right answer.

Three dimensions and magnetic monopoles
The physics problem that we will consider in three dimensions, is to compute
number of zero modes of the Bogomolnyi equation
Fij = ǫijk Dk φ

(40)

We choose the convention that our fields are hermitian. It is convenient to group
the fields into 'gauge potential'
Aμ = (Ai , φ)

(41)

We define Dμ = (Di , φ) such that iDμ = i∂μ + Aμ and we let Gμν = i[Dμ , Dν ]
be the associated 'field strength'. Then the Bogomolnyi equation reads
Gμν =

1
ǫμνρσ Gρσ .
2
7

(42)

Linearizing this, we get
Dμ δAν =

1
ǫμνρσ Dρ δAσ
2

(43)

Contracting with γμν , we get
(1 + γ)γμν Dμ δAν = 0

(44)

and if we impose the background gauge condition
Dμ δAμ = 0

(45)

which is to say that zero modes are orthogonal to gauge variations with respect
to the moduli space metric, then we can write this linearized equation as a Dirac
equation
Dψ ≡ γμ Dμ ψ = 0

(46)

ψ := (1 + γ)γμ δAμ .

(47)

D2 = −Di2 + φ2 + iγμν Gμν

(48)

where

We compute

Inserting the Bogomolnyi configuration we can write this, thus using the fact
that Gμν is selfdual,
1
D2 = −Di2 + φ2 + (1 + γ)iγμν Gμν .
4

(49)

and get a vanishing theorem. Namely, dim ker DD† = 0 as DD† > 0 is strictly
postive. Hence we can compute the dimension of the moduli space dim ker D ≡
dim ker D† D just by computing the index of D. To compute the index, we now
wish to compute

a sufficiently large two-sphere, only from the term

is twice the index, i.e. 4Q [4, 5].

We have now showed that if we use our prescription of Wick rotating k to
compute the integrals over the exponential, then we get the right answer for all
cases that can be safely computed using a regulator that is less convergent. We
are inclined to think that our prescription for how to compute the integral, will
also work for index problems where the Callias regulator diverges. But we have
no proof. It is perhaps not so obvious that more general index problems can be
formulated. In the next section we will give one example of a more general type
of index problem.

Four dimensions and self-dual strings

To introduce the notation, we first consider the free Abelian tensor multiplet
theory in 1 + 5 dimensions. The on-shell field content is a two-form gauge
10

potential Bμν , five scalar fields φA and corresponding Weyl fermions ψ. The
field strength Hμνρ = ∂μ Bνρ + ∂ρ Bμν + ∂ν Bρμ is selfdual. The supersymmetry
variation of the Weyl fermions is


1 μνρ
μ
A
Γ Hμνρ + Γ ΓA ∂μ φ
δψ =
ǫ
(68)
12
where we use eleven-dimensional gamma matrices splitted into SO(1, 5)×SO(5),
so that in particular
{Γμ , ΓA }

= 0.

(69)

In a static and x5 independent field configuration, in which only φ5 =: φ is
non-zero, we find the SUSY variation

δψ = Γ0i5 H0i5 + Γi ΓA=5 ∂i φ ǫ
(70)

If we assume that the classical bosonic field configuration is such that
∂i φ = H0i5

(71)

then the SUSY variation reduces to

δψ = ∂i φΓi Γ05 + ΓA=5 ǫ

(72)

and we find the condition for unbroken SUSY as

1 + Γ05 ΓA=5 ǫ = 0

(73)

If we use the Weyl condition

Γǫ = −ǫ

(74)

of the (2, 0) supersymmetry parameter ǫ, then we can also write this as

1 + Γ1234 ΓA=5 ǫ = 0.

(75)

We may represent the gamma matrices as
Γμ
ΓA

=
=

(Γ0 , Γi , Γ5 ) = 1 ⊗ iσ 2 ⊗ 1, γi ⊗ σ 1 ⊗ 1, γ ⊗ σ 1 ⊗ 1
1 ⊗ iσ 2 ⊗ σA



(76)

where σ 1,2,3 are the Pauli sigma matrices, γ = γ1234 . Then the condition for
unbroken SUSY is
(1 + γ ⊗ σ) ǫ = 0

(77)

Hijk = ǫijkl ∂l φ

(78)

where σ = σ1234 = σA=5 .
We have found that if

then half SUSY is unbroken. This equation is the Bogomolnyi equation for selfdual strings [1]. We are interested in finding the number of parameters needed
to describe solutions of this equation. We can linearize it and get the equation
γi ∂i χ = 0
11

(79)

for the bosonic zero modes, that we have gathered into a matrix
χ ≡ γij δBij + γδφ.

(80)

For this to work we must also assume the background gauge condition
∂i Bij = 0.

(81)

Now this linearized equation Eq (79) does not make any reference to the gauge
field. So there is no way that we could count the number of parameters of a
multi-string configuration just using this equation. This should of course not be
a surprise. The strings that we have in the Abelian theory are not solutions of
the field equations. They have to be inserted by hand, that is we need to insert
delta function sources by hand, in the same spirit as for Dirac monopoles.
To be able to count the number of zero modes, we must consider some
interacting theory which (at the classical level) has solitonic string solutions.
To pass to non-Abelian theory we begin by rewriting the Abelian theory
in loop space. Loop space consists of parametrized loops C: s 7→ C μ (s). We
introduce the Abelian 'loop fields' [7]
Aμs
φμs
ψ μs

= Bμν (C(s))Ċ ν (s)
= φ(C(s))Ċ μ (s)
= ψ(C(s))Ċ μ (s)

(82)

With these definitions, a short computation reveals that Aμs transforms as a vector and φμs a contra-variant vector under diffeomorphisms in loop space induced
by diffeomorphisms in space-time. One may then extend these transformation
properties to any diffeomorphism in loop space. Space-time diffeomorphism and
reparametrizations of the loops then get unified and are both diffemorphisms
in loop space. The only thing to remember is what is kept fixed under the
variation. If it is the parameter of the loop, or the loop itself.
The field strength becomes
Fμs,νt = Hμνρ (C(s))Ċ ρ (s)δ(s − t)

(83)

In terms of these fields, the Bogomolnyi equation will read4
Fis,jt = ǫijkl ∂k(s φlt) .

(84)

We pass to the non-Abelian theory by letting these loop fields become nonAbelian, in the sense that Aμs = Aaμs λa (s) where λa (s) are generators of a loop
algebra associated to the gauge group [7]. We introduce a covariant derivative
Dμs

= ∂μs + Aμs .

(85)

= Dμs Λ
= [φμs , Λ].

(86)

Local gauge transformations act as
δΛ Aμs
δΛ φμs

Given a loop C, we automatically get a tangent vector Ċ μ (s) that makes no
reference to space-time. We can therefore impose the loop space constraints
Ċ μ (s)Aμs = 0
4 We

denote by ∂is the usual functional derivative with respect to

12

(87)
C μ (s).

for each s, and also
φμs = Ċ μ (s)φ(s; C)

(88)

for some subtle field φ(s; C) on loop space. As a consequence, we find that
Aμs φμs = 0.

(89)

These constraints are covariant under diffeomorphisms of space-time and reparametrizations of loops. They are invariant also under local gauge transformations, provided that the gauge parameter is subject to the condition
Ċ μ (s)∂μs Λ = 0

(90)

which is the condition of reparametrization invariance. With the assumption
made that λa (s) are generators of a loop algebra, we find that the constraint
can also be written as
[Aμs , φμt ] = 0

A local gauge variation of this constraint is
[Dμs Λ, φμt ] + [Aμs , [φμt , Λ]] =
=

[∂μs Λ, φμt ] + [[Aμs , Λ], φμt ] + [Aμs , [φμt , Λ]]
[∂μs Λ, φμt ] + [Λ, [φμt , Aμs ]]
(92)

The last term vanishes by the constraint. The first term gives us the constraint
Eq (91) that we must impose on the gauge parameter
Z
Λ = dsΛa (s, C)λa (s).
(93)
We have now introduced non-local non-Abelian fields with infinitely many
components. It is also likely that consisteny of the theory requires an infinite
set of constraints on these fields. Maybe then, it could be that we may in the
end descend to a finite degrees of freedom. But this is just a speculation. The
problem appears to be difficult and ill-defined – How should one define a degree
of freedom in a strongly coupled non-local theory?
The non-Abelian generalization of the Bogomolnyi equation should be given
by [7]
Fis,jt = ±ǫijkl Dks φlt .

(94)

This equation is gauge invariant and invariant under the residual SO(4) Lorentz
group that is preserved by the strings. We can not think of any reasonable
modification of this equation that would preserve these symmetries, so on this
grounds alone one could suspect this equation to be correct. Of course this is not
the only requirement that the BPS condition imposes. We also get conditions
on the 0s and the 5s components. But these BPS equations will be of no interest
to us right now.
We will show below that the linearized Bogomolnyi equation can be written
as

(95)
γi Di(s + σφi(s χt) = 0
13

We will also see below that we (presumably) can actually drop the symmetrization in s and t in this equation. The fields transform in the adjoint representation of the loop algebra, by which we mean that φis χt = [φis , χt ]. We define
the Dirac operator
Ds = γi (Dis + σφis )

(96)

and the projectors
P± ≡

1
(1 ∓ γσ) ,
2

(97)

We can now formulate an index problem, in an even-dimensional (loop-)space.
The even-dimensional space in this case is given by the 4-dimensional transverse
space to the strings, and the index is given by
dim ker Ds − dim ker Ds†

(98)

Ds = P+ Ds = Ds P−
Ds† = P− Ds = Ds P+ .

(99)

where

Since Ds and P± are hermitian, it is manifest that Ds† defined this way will be
the hermitian conjugate of Ds , thus justifying the notation.
Computing the index alone is not sufficient in order to obtain the dimension
of the moduli space of self-dual strings. We also need a vanishing theorem that
says that dim ker Ds† = 0.
Linearizing the Bogomolnyi equation, we get
2D[is δAjt] = ±ǫijkl (Dks δφlt + φks δAlt )

(100)

Contracting by γ ij , we get
γ ij D̃is χjt = 0

(101)

where we have defined
D̃is
χis

≡
≡

Dis ∓ γφis
δAis ∓ γδφis

(102)

To see that the linearized BPS equation can be written like this, one must use
the constraint
γ ij φis δφjt = 0.

(103)

We can avoid having explicit ± signs by introducing the other chiraly matrix
at our disposal, namely σ that lives in a different vector space than γ. We can
then hide the ± signs in the tensor product
γ ⊗ σ = ±1
which amounts to
D̃is

≡ Dis + σφis
14

(104)

χis

≡ δAis + σδφis

(105)

without any ±.5 If we define
χs ≡ γ i χis

(107)

then we can write the zero mode equation as
γ i D̃is χt + D̃si χit = 0.

(108)

Let us analyze the second term in this equation. It is given by
Dsi δAit + φis δφit 
γ φis δAit + Dsi δφit

(109)

(δΛ Ais , δAit ) + (δΛ φis , δφjt ) = 0

(110)

−

We should not count variations that are gauge variations as bosonic zero modes.
We can insure this by demanding the zero modes to be orthogonal to gauge
variations, with respect to the metric on the moduli space,

This leads to the background gauge condition
Dsi δAit + φis δφit = 0.

(111)

This condition implies that the gauge variation of the zero modes vanishes,
δΛ δAis = 0 = δΛ δφis

(112)

To see this, we make a gauge variation δΛ δAis = Dis Λ, δΛ φis = φis Λ, and
ask which gauge parameters Λ will respect the background gauge condition.
Inserting this gauge variation into the background gauge condition, we get

Dsi Dit + φis φit Λ = 0.
(113)

For this to work nicely, it seems that we must constrain the non-locality of our

loop field such that ∂(s
In other words all gauge variations of the zero modes have to vanish.
Furthermore we want the variation to preserve the orthogonality between
Ais and φis ,
(Ais , δφit ) + (δAis , φit ) = 0

(114)

If we make a gauge variation of this, then we get the condition
(δΛ Ais , δφit ) + (δAis , δΛ φit ) = 0

(115)

φis δAit + Dsi δφit = 0.

(116)

which amounts to

5 To

really understand what is going on, one should apply (1 ± γσ) on everything, on ψs
and on Ds . Then one notices that
∓γ (1 ∓ γσ) = σ (1 ∓ γσ) .

(106)

That is, we can trade ∓γ for σ, once we apply (1 ± γσ) on everything. This is what we really
should do, but to keep the notation simple, we do not spell this out.

15

We conclude that the zero mode equation can be written as
D s χt = 0

(117)

Ds = γi (Dis + σφis )

(118)

where

We are interested in counting the number of such modes in a background of k
BPS strings. We compute
1
(119)
(Dis )2 + (φis )2 + γ ij (Fis,js + γσǫijkl Dks φls )

R ds
Ds Ds , and analogously for the other fields or opera(Here D2 ≡ Ds Ds ≡ 2π
tors.) In a BPS configuration, we get is
D2

=

D2

=

1
(Dis )2 + (φis )2 + γ ij (1 + γσ) Fis,js
2

(120)

Furthermore, in the subspace where 1 + γσ = 0, we find that
D2

=

(Dis )2 + (φis )2

(121)

is a strictly negative operator, hence has no zero modes. This means that we
have a vanishing theorem, dim ker D† = 0.

A small comment
The zero mode equation was really
D(s χt) = 0

(122)

where we should symmetrize in s and t. That means that we should rather
consider
Ds D(s χt)

=
=

1
(Ds Ds χt + Ds Dt χs )
2
1
(Ds Ds χt + Dt Ds χs + [Ds , Dt ]χs ) .
2

(123)

If now D[s Dt] = 0 and Ds χs = 0, then we get
D s D s χt = 0

(124)

The latter condition, Ds χs = 0 is of course a consequence of D(s χt) = 0 with
s = t. The former condition reads
0

= D[s Dt]
= Di[s Dit] + φi[s φit] + σDi[s φit]

(125)

In the Abelian case we find that ∂i[s ∂|i|t] = 0 and φi[s φ|i|t] = 0. A delicate
computation also shows that ∂i[s φ|i|t] χs = 0. The philosophy we have is that
any Abelian constraints are lifted to non-Abelian ones by covariantizing.

16

If we accept these constraints, then we have now seen that the zero mode
equation Eq (122) implies
Z
dsDs† Ds χt = 0
(126)
because Ds is anti-self-adjoint with respect to the inner product
Z

(ψs , χt ) = DCtr ψs† (C)χt (C)

(127)

on loop space. We can also go in the opposite direction. Assuming that Eq
(126) holds, we get

(128)
0 = χt , Ds† Ds χt = (Ds χt , Ds χt )

and we conclude that (122) implies

D s χt = 0

(129)

with no symmetrization in s, t.

How to compute the index
We should now be able to compute an index associated to self-dual strings, as
the limit

I(s) = Tr γσesD
when s → ∞. We define the quantity

and find that

We can separate the functional integral over parametrized loops C into several
pieces. We can keep a point on the loops C(s) = x fixed, and separate it as

where thus x = C(s).
If we assume that the gauge group is maximally broken to a product of
U (1)'s by the Higgs vacuum expectation values, then we should have U (1) loop
fields at spatial infinity.
17

If we assume that the gauge group is SU (2) and that it is broken to U (1),
then we need only the asymptotic form of the U (1) fields at spatial infinity,
= Hijl (x)Ċ l (s)δ(s − t)
= v Ċk (s)

Fis,jt
φks

(135)

Without doing any computations, we can guess what the outcome of the
index calculation should be. A term like
Z
ǫijkl Dx Ctr (Fis,jt (C)Fks,jt (C))
(136)
can (and hence probably does) arise, but here this term vanishes identically if
one uses the Bogomolnyi equation and notices the constraint
Fis,jt Dis φjt = 0

(137)

For the U (1) fields, this is just the fact that
Fis,jt ∂is φjt ∼ Hijk (C(s))∂i φ(C(s))Ċ k (s)Ċ j (s)δ(s − t)2 ≡ 0.

(138)

Then there can be a term
ǫijkl

(139)

that should arise in a very similar way as the corresponding term arose for
monopoles. If we insert the asymptotic U (1) fields, this term becomes proportional to
ǫijkl Hijk (x)

(140)

That means that the index should be given by some numerical constant, times
the magnetic charge

Integrals over the exponential

k +1
−∞

(142)

for any complex number ζ. (The ǫ > 0, say, will be taken towards zero. It
arose from ǫ = x − y and we keep it here just as a convergence factor.) We first
compute
Z +∞
k 2ζ iǫk
a(0) =
dk 2
e
(143)
k +1
−∞
In order to make this integral converge for any ζ, we should Wick rotate k to
ik, and henceforth we will always mean by i the branch eiπ/2 , and by −1 we
mean eiπ . Then we get
Z +∞
k 2ζ −ǫk
e
(144)
a(0) = −i2ζ+1
dk 2
k −1
−∞
and this integral we evaluate as a principal value. That means to evaluate the
residues along the real axis and multiply them not by 2πi, but by half of it, that
is, by πi. We get
a(0) = (−1)ζ π

1 − (−1)2ζ
.

(145)

Next we turn to our integral a(s). It is easier to first compute the derivative.
We should still work with the Wick rotated integral. Making the substitution
ξ = k 2 we can put it on the form of two gamma functions. The result is that

result is
