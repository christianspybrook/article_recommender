determined except c 2880 in order to understand their structures using the present experimental information we study the strong decay pattern of the excited charmed baryons systematically in this work in the past decades there has been some research work on heavy baryons 8 11 12 the quantum numbers and decay widths of swave and some pwave charmed baryons are known 13 we first systematically analyze their strong decays in the framework of the 3 p0 strong decay model accordingly one can extract the parameters and estimate the accuracy of the 3 p0 model when its applied in the charmed baryon system then we go one step further and extend the same formalism to study the decay patterns of these new charmed baryons c 2880 2940 2980 30770 under different assignments of their quantum numbers after

in our calculation as can be seen from table v c 2880 and c 2940 are observed in the invariant mass spectrum of d0 p 1 the first radial excitation of c does not decay into d0 p from the 3 p0 model hence the possibility of c 2880 and c 2940 being a radial excitation is excluded we calculate their strong decays assuming they are dwave charmed baryons the results are shown in table vi and vii with

phenomenological strong decay models were proposed such as the 3 p0 model flux tube model qcd sum rule lattice qcd etc among which only the first two approaches can be applied to the strong decays of excited hadrons to a large extent the predictions from the 3 p0 and flux tube models roughly agree with each other table iv the decay widths of pwave charmed baryons c 2593 2625 and c 2790 2815 with

experimental width the uncertainty source of the 3 p0 model arises from the strength of the quark pair creation from the vacuum the approximation of nonrelativity and assuming the simple harmonic oscillator radial wave functions for the hadrons even with the above uncertainty the 3 p0 model is still the most systematic effective and widely used framework to study the hadron strong decays in this work we have calculated the strong decay widths of charmed baryons using the 3 p0 model our numerical results do not strongly depend on the parameters and as shown in figs 5 6 and 7 thus the following qualitative features and conclusions remain essentially unchanged with reasonable variations of and our results for the swave charmed baryons c0 2455 0 2520 and 0 2645 are roughly consistent with experimental data within the inherent uncertainty of the 3 p0 model as a byproduct we have also calculated the strong decays of b and b table v the decay widths of c 2800 in different pwave charmed baryons assignments  0 c 0 the total width of c 2800 is 7522 17 mev 13 here all results are in units of mev assignment c0 12 c1 2 c1 23 c2 2 c2 52 c1 2 c1 32 307  0 c 0 296 220 740 3 103 observed by cdf collaboration recently the numerical results are consistent with the experimental values too the decay width of pwave baryon c 2593 is three times larger than the experimental value with the large experimental uncertainty and the inherent theoretical uncertainty of the the 3 p0 model such a deviation is still acceptable the decay widths of c 2625 and c 2790 2815 are compatible with the experimental upper bound by comparing our results with the experimental total width we tend to exclude the c0 12 assignment for since the c 2800 c 2800 is observed in channel there are only two assignments left for c 2800 ie c2 32 or c2 25 more experimental information such as the ratio 2800  0 2800 will be helpful in the deter mination of the quantum number of c 2800 we have also calculated the strong decay widths of newly observed c 2880 2940 2980 30770 assuming they are candidates of dwave charmed baryons we find that the only possible assignment of c 2880 is 2c3 52 after considering both its total decay width and the ratio c c which agrees very well with the indication from belle experiment that c 2880 fa vors j p 25 by the analysis of the angular distribution unfortunately the experiment information about the c 2940 2980 30770 is scarce at present from their calculated decay widths we can only exclude some assignments which are marked with crosses in tables vii viii and ix the decay width ratios of c 2940 2980 30770 from the 3 p0 model will be useful in the identification of their quantum numbers in the future since the inherent uncertainty cancels largely we have also discussed the strong decays of 2980 30770 assuming they are radial excitations unfortunately the numerical results in fig 8 depend quite strongly on the node of the spatial wave function which is related to the parameters of the harmonic oscillator wave functions as shown in fig 8 we are unable to make strong conclusions here appendix the harmonic oscillator wave
