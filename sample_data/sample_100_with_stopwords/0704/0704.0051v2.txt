visualizing teleportation scott m cohen arxiv07040051v2 physicsedph 13 may 2008 department of physics duquesne university pittsburgh pennsylvania 15282 and department of physics carnegiemellon university pittsburgh pennsylvania 15213 a novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon the discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining teleportation to nonscientists the basic ideas of quantum physics are first explained in lay terms after which these ideas are used with a graphical description out of which teleportation arises naturally introduction one of the most exciting and fastestgrowing fields of physics today is quantum information especially since the discovery by shor 1 2 that there exist calculations for which a quantum computer is apparently far more efficient than a classical computer interest in understanding quantum information has increased at an impressive rate one widely publicized discovery that has emerged from work in this field is teleportation 3 while not precisely equivalent to the process enjoying widespread fame amongst fans of star trek beam me up scotty the phenomenon referred to here is nonetheless fascinating and perhaps even astonishing the reason for the widespread publicity of this rigorously proven and experimentally tested 4 5 6 7 8 though not yet unambiguously demonstrated scientific prediction is almost certainly in large part due to the fact that it shares the same name as the justmentioned intriguing idea from sciencefiction the usual way of describing teleportation is through mathematical equations and this mathematics is relatively straightforward as has been amply demonstrated elsewhere 3 9 hence an understanding of this phenomenon is accessible to physicists other scientists and those possessing a reasonably strong level of mathematical skill there does on the other hand seem to be a good deal of misunderstanding of teleportation amongst nonscientists with the notion floating around that the amazing phenomenon shown regularly in episodes of star trek that is of material objects being teleported from one place to another has actually turned out to be possible in real life nothing could be further from the truth of course so we are left wondering how to rectify this unfortunate state of affairs the question i address here is the following can the true scientific phenomenon of teleportation be understood by others those without much skill in mathematics the usual explanations will certainly fail in this regard even if carefully presented by a competent physicist because mathematics has a wellknown tendency to scare people away and in any case the mathematics of teleportation is not all that simple the paper is addressed to physicists possessing a solid understanding of quantum physics including graduate students with the aim to provide a method by which such a physicist can explain teleportation to someone who is not mathematically inclined thus the objective is ultimately though indirectly to educate the general public about teleportation and by extension quantum mechanics itself the approach involves only the most basic ideas about quantum physics and while it does not entirely avoid mathematical expressions it uses only the simplest mathematics one only needs to accept that certain objects are either 0 or 1 and relies almost entirely on pictures allowing the layperson to visualize and thus understand what is happening in the following sections i will describe my method of directly visualizing teleportation these sections are written as if addressed to the layperson the next section explains the probabilistic nature of quantum physics by considering quantum coins which are examples of twolevel systems this section describes how one should think about measurements what is meant by probabilities for classical systems and then how these ideas can be used to describe quantum systems then in section iii i present my graphical approach to understanding the dynamics of quantum information processing which is then used in section iii b to explain in pictures how teleportation of quantum states is possible one of the crucial observations will be that a shared entangled state on say systems a and b provides the parties with multiple images of the state of an additional system a the ability to manipulate these images  independently by each party and differently from one image to the next is what allows teleportation to be accomplished more generally these ideas provide important insights into why entanglement is a valuable resource as i have described in detail elsewhere and they have been useful in understanding other aspects of quantum information  electronic address cohensmduqedu processing 10 11 probabilities perhaps the most fundamental aspect of quantum theory is that it can only make predictions in terms of probabilities in general even if one has a complete description of the state of a quantum system one will not know ahead of time what the outcome of a given measurement will be this is in direct contradiction with our everyday experience which we refer to as classical for example a flipped classical coin which lands heads heads is then a complete description of the state of this coin is known with certainty to be heads and also with certainty to not be tails that is if we know the state of a classical coin in this case heads we can predict with certainty the answer to any reasonable question we choose to ask or measure about that coin for example is it tails we therefore need to understand what is meant by the state of a quantum system and how this state relates to probabilities and outcomes of measurements the following definition of a measurement will be adequate for our purposes definition a measurement is a procedure that provides answers to a collection of yesno questions which is both mutually exclusive when the answer to one of the questions is yes the answer to all the others is no and complete all possibilities are included that is one of the questions will always be answered in the affirmative the single question that receives the yes answer is referred to as the outcome of the measurement for example since a classical coin is either heads or tails and these two possibilities are mutually exclusive a measurement on a classical coin is a procedure that answers the two questions is it heads and is it tails since the coin will always be one or the other there will always be a yes answer to one of these questions and then the other question is always answered no hence these two questions do indeed constitute a measurement according to the above definition if is it heads is answered affirmatively then heads is the outcome of the measurement it turns out that these two questions also constitute a measurement on quantum coins however in contrast to the classical case in which this is the only possible measurement there is a vast array of possible measurements on quantum coins this will become clearer from the discussion in the following sections where we introduce a compact way of describing these things a way commonly used in quantum mechanics classical coins and classical probabilities consider again a flipped classical coin the coin lands either heads or tails it will be useful to use a somewhat abbreviated notation hi for heads and t i for tails the statement that if it is heads it is not tails that is has zero probability of being tails will be represented as ht hi 0 the leftfacing bracket hi represents the known initial state it is heads and the rightfacing bracket ht represents the question is it tails the number 0 appearing on the righthand side of the equal sign then gives the probability that with this initial state the answer to this question will be yes for the above example we have that the probability is 0 which is as expected since when the coin is h it will never be t note that it is useful to use the left and rightfacing brackets so that we can easily read off what is the initial state and what is the question being asked about it simply writing t h 0 in the above equation would lead to confusion when we discuss two coins see below which might have an initial state where one is tails the other heads represented by t hi perhaps an even more trivial statement if it is heads then it is heads with certainty or with probability one will similarly be represented as hhhi 1 again the rightfacing bracket contains the question hh or is it heads and the fact that the expression is equal to 1 indicates that the answer to this question will always be yes when the initial state is hi these statements are trivial because if we know the state of a classical coin we can predict with certainty whether it will be heads or tails when we look at it although the remaining equations will look a bit more involved the only mathematics the reader need understand is contained in the above two equations along with two others that are almost exactly the same the discussion in the remainder of this paper will follow from the four simple statements hhhi 1 ht t i 1 ht hi 0 hht i 0 next let us consider two coins in this case a complete list of mutually exclusive possibilities is hh ht t h t t we can make statements in exactly the same way we did above for example if they are hh then they are not ht which in our notation is written hh1 t2 h1 h2 i hh1 h1 i ht2 h2 i 1 0 0 where the subscripts 1 2 have been inserted for clarity to indicate which coin is which note that in this equation we have equated the expression hh1 t2 h1 h2 i with the product of two expressions hh1 h1 i and ht2 h2 i this is because any question about the two coins jointly is the same as two questions one about each of the coins separately it is obviously also true that if they are hh then they are hh so hh1 h2 h1 h2 i hh1 h1 i hh2 h2 i 1 1 1 for three coins there are eight possibilities hhh hht ht h t hh ht t t ht t t h t t t and the same notation will readily account for this case as well we will not need to consider more than three coins here though it is in principle straightforward to do so quantum coins and quantum probabilities quantum coins behave very differently as compared to their classical counterparts and quantum probabilities must be understood in very different ways we still have heads and tails hi and t i as possible states of a quantum coin we refer to these two states as being orthogonal to each other by which we simply mean that they are mutually exclusive if the quantum coin is h it is definitely with certainty not t and viceversa we note that the four equations appearing in the previous section are equally true for both quantum and classical coins however there now exist some very strange possibilities if i were to suggest that a classical coin can be both h and t at one and the same time you would be completely justified in thinking id gone slightly crazy i am going to tell you though that at least in a certain though very real sense this is the case for quantum coins though you may still wonder a bit about my sanity the point is that in the quantum case it makes complete sense to ask questions such as if the coin is h is it half h and half t or we can turn this around and ask if the coin is half h and half t is it h neither of these questions makes any sense whatsoever when referred to a classical coin on the other hand for a quantum coin these are not only legitimate questions but they are in fact very important ones we do not consider the negligible possibility of a classical coin landing on its edge and in any case this bears no relationship to what we mean by a quantum coin being half h and half t to represent these questions we can write the state q of a quantum coin that is half h and half t as qi hi t i then the answer to the question if the coin is half h and half t is it h is answered by the equation hhqi hh hi t i  hhhi hht i  1 0 which should be interpreted as meaning yes with probability 12 implying also no with probability 112 12 in quantum mechanics it is actually the square of the object on the lefthand side of the foregoing equation that represents the probability rather than that object itself which is known as the probability amplitude however although the difference between probabilities and probability amplitudes is crucial to the understanding of quantum mechanics i have chosen in the present discussion to overlook this distinction for the benefit of the layperson to whom these ideas are aimed as they would only serve to complicate matters causing unnecessary confusion amongst the intended audience the leftfacing bracket qi represents the known initial state and the rightfacing bracket hh represents the question is it heads the number 12 appearing on the righthand side of the last line then gives the probability that with this initial state the answer to this question will be yes the point to understand here is that even though we have a complete description q of the state of the quantum coin we do not generally know in advance whether the coin will be h or t when we look at it we can only predict in terms of probabilities if we perform this experiment many times half the time the answer will be yes and the other half of the time it will be no furthermore there are many more questions we can ask in the quantum as compared to the classical case we are no longer restricted to asking is the coin h or is it t but we can ask other questions such as the reverse of the question we just answered hqhi hh ht hi  hhhi ht hi  1 0 we see that the question if the coin is h is it half h and half t has the same answer as the previous question yes with probability 12 and no with probability 12 we note that in the remainder of the paper instead of phrasing questions as is the coin half h and half t we instead ask whether it is equal parts h and t while there is no real difference between these two questions this rephrasing allows us to simplify the notation by dispensing with the factors of 12 that have appeared in the above discussion in doing so the equations will not yield the same numbers as probabilities for the various questions but this will not hamper the presentation since the numerical values of the probabilities are not crucial to the ideas we wish to convey we just need to remember that certain objects are equal to 1 and others are equal to 0 iii teleportation what exactly do we mean by teleportation in the context of quantum information it is not a material object that is being teleported but rather the state of a quantum system we will assume that the system is a quantum coin with a complete set of mutually exclusive orthogonal states being heads and tails which we may denote as hi and t i suppose alice and bob are physicists in locations widely separated from each other they each have a quantum coin labeled a and b respectively and these two coins are in the state b0 iab ha hb i ta tb i where the subscripts used here refer to system a b in alices bobs possession this state of two quantum coins has a very strange property which is known as entanglement and the state itself is an example of a maximally entangled state entanglement is a rather strange sort of correlation between quantum systems which manifests itself in the state b0 by the fact that neither system a nor b can be considered to have a definite state of its own independent of the other system whatever is the state of coin a coin b will have the same state but one cannot say anything about the state of either coin independent of the other one it is this property of entanglement that is credited with enabling alice and bob to accomplish teleportation alice is given another coin system a prepared in a state sa i ch ha i ct ta i with arbitrary coefficients ch and ct that are completely unknown to her and to bob if ch 12 and ct 12 we have the case discussed in the previous section where the coin is equally likely to be found to be h or t for other values of these coefficients the two possibilities will in general not be equally likely alices task is to perform operations on the systems in her possession a and a in such a way that bob will end up with his system b in precisely the state sb i which is the same state as sa i but now on the distant system b it turns out that this task can be accomplished if alice communicates information to bob perhaps via a telephone about what she ended up doing to her systems after which bob performs a rather simple quantum operation dependent on the information obtained from alice on system b an important point to understand in what follows is that nothing either of them does in this process provides even the slightest information about the coefficients ch and ct so the state s that has been teleported remains completely unknown to the parties this aspect of teleportation becomes even more amazing if one considers the amount of information that is conveyed the information contained in a quantum state is far greater than the amount actually transmitted from alice to bob via the telephone as we will see below the amount transmitted via the telephone is two classical bits enough to convey which one of four possibilities has been chosen true the classical information one can encode in a twolevel quantum system cannot exceed one bit one bit is the amount of information needed to choose between two possibilities such as hi and t i but if alice wanted to tell bob how to create the state in his own lab by communicating with him over a phone line this would require an infinite amount of classical information that is enough information to completely describe the arbitrary numbers ch and ct it is infinite because one of these numbers might well be an irrational number such as having a decimal expansion that is unending never repeating itself of course alice and bob are both completely ignorant of what these numbers are so even if it were possible to transmit an infinite amount of information they dont even know what information they would need to send nonetheless when they share entanglement it is possible for the two of them by working together to create the unknown state on bobs coin b with the communication of only two classical bits visualizing quantum information processing let us now introduce the pictorial method which will be used to visualize teleportation the simple diagrams we will use to depict states of multiple quantum coins held by two different parties are familiar to many researchers working in quantum information we will now illustrate how these diagrams are used to represent quantum states and then how they can be used to follow what happens to these coins when measurements are performed by one of the parties then we will be ready to use them for visualizing teleportation states of quantum coins to depict the state of a single quantum coin labeled a standing for alice she will also have the other coin labeled a while bobs single coin is labeled b we may use a simple box diagram sa i ch hai ct ta i hai ch ta i the coefficients ch and ct appearing in the boxes indicate how much is in that part of the state sa of coin a the next example illustrates the case where there are two coins a and b held by two different parties then the state of these two coins might be hb i tb i sa hb i hai ch ta i with sa as given above the empty squares on the righthand side of this diagram represent the fact that system b is not t has zero probability of being tails the ch in the upperleft corner represents the probability the coins are both heads and the ct in the lowerleft the probability bobs coin is heads and alices is tails if there are three parties involved a threedimensional cube could be used to represent this situation however it will serve our present purposes to represent both of alices systems along the vertical dimension of the diagram we might have coins a and b as in the previous example and coin a being heads the overall state of these three coins represented as hb i tb i sa hahb i haha i ta ha i hata i ta ta i if instead the ab systems are both t this picture is hb i tb i haha i ta ha i sa ta tb i hata i ta ta i now consider what happens if we add the previous two equations together then our two coins ab are equal parts in hh and in t t which is what we previously referred to as the maximally entangled state b0 iab ha hb ita tb i the corresponding diagram looks like hb i tb i sa iha hb i ta tb i haha i ta ha i hb i tb i hata i ta ta i hai sa ta i notice how there are now two images of the state sa i this observation turns out to be rather useful in understanding entanglement 10 11 but we will not need to discuss such issues here let us now look at how to represent measurements by use of these diagrams measurements on quantum coins suppose alice and bob share three quantum coins in the state represented in the last equation of the previous section and alice wants to know something about her coins if she measures coin a and discovers it is h then we have hbi tb i hha hai sa ta i hb i tb i recall that when the rightfacing bracket hha is attached to the leftfacing one ha i on the left of this equation we get hha ha i 1 which preserves the upper row whereas hha ta i 0 indicating that the bottom row is annihilated multiplied by 0 which is why it no longer appears on the far right of this equation the interpretation is as follows when the question is coin a heads is answered in the affirmative the other coins are left in the state sa hb i we see how this measurement acts on both of the images simultaneously rather than on the two independently the upperleft image has been preserved intact but the other image was annihilated disappearing altogether on the other hand if the outcome of alices measurement had been that coin a was t this would be represented hbi tb i hta hai sa ta i hb i tb i in this case the upperleft image has disappeared and the one in the lowerright has been preserved intact in each of these cases the state of coin a is unchanged but that of coin b is left in a state that corresponds directly to the outcome of alices measurement on a if she discovers that coin a was h or t then coin b ends up h or t alternatively she could do a measurement that includes the question is coin a equal parts h and t if the answer to this question is yes then hb i tb i hha hta hb i tb i hai sa ta i sa i hb i tb i which is just a sum of the previous two equations notice how after each of the three measurement outcomes we have just considered the two images have been collapsed into a single row once again we see that the state of coin b ends up corresponding to the outcome of alices measurement on coin a this illustrates some of the strangeness that resides in entangled states of quantum systems no matter what measurement alice makes on coin a and no matter what outcome she obtains from that measurement the resulting state of coin b will correspond directly to that outcome the way the images of sa appear in the diagram is crucial the fact that the two start out in different rows and in different columns will be important in what is to come if entanglement between systems ab was absent for example if they were in the unentangled state ha i ta i hb i then this would be represented by recall that sa i ch ha i ct ta i hb i tb i ha hai taha i hata i ta ta i sa i hai ta i hb i hb i tb i hai sa ta i under these circumstances bobs view of the lower image of sa is obstructed by the presence of the upper image the two images effectively appear as one to him as will become clear in the following section the presence of entanglement between the ab coins will be necessary for them to accomplish teleportation we will see that it is bobs and alices ability to see the two images separately and the consequent ability for each of them to act differently on one of the images as compared to the other that is crucial to their success in the next section we turn to the task of teleporting the state sa onto bobs coin b to begin this process alice will perform a measurement that asks joint questions that is questions about both coins in her possession simultaneously as an example she could ask if they are both h that is hb i tb i hha ha ha hai taha i hb i tb i hata i ta ta i the ch appearing in the box on the right corresponds to the probability that the answer to this question will be yes more important for our purposes is to recognize that when this is the outcome of the measurement coin b ends up h once again a consequence of the initial entanglement between coins a and b now let us see how teleportation is possible visualizing teleportation teleportation is accomplished with the aid of the extra systems a b in the entangled state b0 iab system a starts in state sa i discussed above and this is the state they will teleport alice will ask a set of joint questions which together constitute a measurement about the state of the two coins in her possession a and a the first question she asks is whether these two coins are equal parts hh and t t when the answer is yes we have hb i tb i hha ha hta ta ha hai taha i hbi tb i hata i ta ta i notice how the middle two rows are annihilated by this outcome because these rows correspond to a situation where the two coins are different one h and one t whereas we are asking if they are the same and the remaining rows are collapsed into a single row now if we look carefully or perhaps not even so carefully at the final diagram in this picture we will arrive at a rather startling conclusion we see that the state of bobs system b is now sb i ch hb i ct tb i that is the unknown state sa i originally on system a is now on bobs system b furthermore the question asked by alice had nothing whatsoever to do with the coefficients ch and ct which determine what the original state of coin a was hence the parties remain completely ignorant of the state s yet that state has been successfully teleported we are not quite finished however since we would like for alice and bob to be able to teleport no matter which joint question ends up being the outcome of alices measurement because of the probabilistic nature of the quantum world she cannot choose the outcome of her measurement instead alice effectively asks all of the questions in her chosen measurement and then must wait for nature to decide which question she nature that is will choose as the outcome the nice thing about nature is that she will tell alice which question was chosen there must be four questions in a complete set of questions making up a joint measurement on coins a a let me illustrate with one other question how alice and bob can succeed with teleportation and then the reader is asked to believe that they can also succeed with either of the remaining two questions these can be treated in a very similar way to the one shown here 12 the second question is are coins a a equal parts t h and ht the corresponding diagram is hb i tb i hta ha hha ta ha hai taha i hbi tb i hata i ta ta i here the first and last rows are annihilated by this outcome and the middle two are collapsed into a single row looking at the final diagram we see that coin b is left in the state ct hb i ch tb i which has the coefficients ch and ct exchanged in comparison to the state s that we want it to be in however alice knows that this is the question to which nature answered yes and she can call bob on the telephone and inform him of this fact once he knows this is the question that was answered affirmatively all he needs to do is flip his quantum coin recall that this is a quantum coin which he cannot simply pick up and turn over instead what we mean by this is that he exchanges h for t and viceversa in turns out that this is a legitimate action that can be performed on a quantum coin and it will leave coin b in the desired state ct hb i ch tb i ct tb i ch hb i sb i notice also that they again remain completely ignorant of the coefficients ch and ct nothing that has happened has provided them with any such information nor have they needed it it turns out that no matter which of the four outcomes of alices measurement she obtains once she informs bob of that outcome he will be able to perform a legitimate action on his quantum coin that will leave his coin in the state sb i all bob needs to know in order to choose which action to perform is the outcome of alices measurement alice needs only to send him two bits of information enough to choose between one of the four possible outcomes furthermore none of the four outcomes provides either party with any information about the coefficients ch and ct so they both remain completely ignorant of the original state they have just successfully teleported the diagrams provide a great deal of insight into what is going on the crucial observation is the presence of two images of the state s resulting from the entanglement between coins a b alice does a measurement that while not acting independently on these two images does act differently on them as we alluded to above this measurement picks out different parts of s from the different images in a way such that all of s is preserved and none of it is repeated for example in the previous example the h part is preserved from the lowerright image and the t part from the upperleft one and viceversa in the example before that this suggests and it is indeed the case that for coins that have more than two sides a sixsided quantum die for example the parties can teleport the state of such an nsided coin by sharing a maximallyentangled state that is large enough to provide them with n images of the unknown state s then alice can design her measurement such that for each outcome 1 a different part of s is extracted from each image and 2 the whole state is preserved across the n images afterward bob can recover the state simply by rearranging the various parts which he will be able to do once alice informs him of the outcome of her measurement alices measurement does not provide them with any information about the original state they are attempting to teleport nor does bobs rearrangement require that they know anything about it in all cases they remain ignorant of the state they are teleporting the reader is encouraged to draw a diagram perhaps for coins with n 3 sides each see the following paragraph and follow through the argument to be sure it is clear how this is done the diagram will have n n n2 horizontal rows representing alices two nsided coins a a each row corresponding to one of the combinations of sides of these two coins hh ht hu hv where h t u v label the various sides and n vertical columns representing bobs coin b a complete measurement for the n 3 case will include n2 9 outcomes but an essentially complete understanding can be gained if the reader considers only the three outcomes corresponding to 1 hha ha hta ta hua ua 2 hha ta hta ua hua ha and 3 hha ua hta ha hua ta where u is the third side of these coins the other six outcomes involve additional complications that i have not explained here but these outcomes are not crucial for the general kind of understanding we are aiming for here in this case the appropriate generalization of b0 is the state ha hb i ta tb i ua ub i and the three terms in this expression yield the three images needed for teleportation teleporting classical coins in this section i consider teleportation of classical coins which turns out to be possible using a method that bears a striking resemblance to the method used for quantum coins imagine that chloe prepares a classical coin labeled a as either h or t and gives it to alice who is not allowed to look at the coin chloe also prepares classical coins a and b such that they are either hh both h or t t both t she then gives coin a to alice and coin b to bob but again does not allow these parties to look at their coins alice now asks chloe the following two questions are coins a and a the same or are they different this pair of yesno questions represents a measurement as defined earlier on this pair of coins if chloe informs her they are the same then alice knows that coin b which is guaranteed to be the same as a is also the same as a if on the other hand chloe says coins a and a are different then coin b is also different from a alice now calls bob on the telephone and tells him to flip or dont flip in the first case a same as a she tells him not to flip while when a and a are different she tells him to flip after he follows her instruction bobs coin b will with certainty match coin a the state of coin a has been teleported onto coin b it is instructive to look at why the quantum case is astonishing while the classical one is rather mundane there are three important differences between classical and quantum teleportation the first difference has to do with the information that alice would need to transmit to bob in order to inform him of the state of coin a if she happened to know that state for a classical coin there are only two possibilities h or t so she would need to transmit only one bit to bob this is the same amount of information that is actually transmitted when she tells him flip or dont flip again two possibilities in contrast as was discussed at the beginning of section iii for the case of quantum coins it would require an infinite amount of information for alice to inform bob of the state of coin a whereas she only actually transmits two bits of information when informing him which of her four questions was the outcome of her measurement we see that the two cases classical vs quantum are dramatically different in terms of the amounts of information involved the second difference between these two cases is a bit more subtle in the classical case if alice were to cheat and actually look at coin a she would automatically know what state that coin is in and be able to tell bob what to do with his coin turn it h or turn it t another onebit message encompassing these two possibilities this absolutely will not work for a quantum coin which alice cannot simply look at to discover its state the reason is the following to begin with in contrast to a classical coin when alice looks at her quantum coin she invariably disturbs it in the process that is no matter what state the coin was in before she looked at it the state after she looks at it is with certainty given by the outcome of her measurement for example even if the state is equal parts h and t before she asks if it is h or t if the answer is h t then the coin is now h t or if it is h to begin with and she does a measurement that answers yes to the question is it equal parts h and t then the state of the coin will now be equal parts h and t hence when she looks at it she will get one of two answers those being the two possible outcomes of her measurement as to the state of the coin but if she looks at it wrong that answer will not tell her what the state was beforehand but only what it is now furthermore since she has now disturbed the state there is no way to go back and try again since the coin is now in a completely different state than the one she is trying to discover the moral of this story is twofold with quantum coins 1 dont bother trying to cheat and 2 theres no point in asking for a doover the third difference between the quantum and classical cases is even more subtle and is related to entanglement for which there is no counterpart with classical coins for classical teleportation chloe must tell alice whether or not coins a a are the same or different when these coins are classical and since chloe is the one that prepared them she is certainly able to do so however in the quantum case coins a b are entangled which means that neither one has a definite state of its own since coin a does not have a definite state the question whether coins a a are the same have the same state has no answer even if we assume that chloe prepared coins a b in their entangled state there is nothing whatsoever that she or anyone else can say about the state of coin a except that it is entangled with b and has no definite state of its own it is worth noting that in both the quantum and classical cases coins a b are correlated with each other in ways that at first glance appear to be very similar when one is measured and found to be h t the other one will also be h t nonetheless the correlations present in the entangled state b0 of quantum coins a b have no analog in the case of classical coins one reason is precisely what we have just discussed that the quantum coins can be correlated in this way even though neither of the individual coins has a definite state of its own a classical coin always has a definite state of its own conclusion i have described a novel way to visualize the processing of quantum information and used this picture to give a simple way to see how teleportation is possible the picture turns out to be useful beyond just providing an understanding of previously known phenomena teleportation however indeed it has given us a deeper understanding of the process of deterministically implementing nonlocal unitaries by local operations and classical communication when shared entanglement is available as a resource allowing us to construct new protocols 10 that go far beyond what was previously known to be possible 13 we have also used this picture to study the question of what entanglement resources are required to locally implement other nonlocal operations such as measurement protocols for the purpose of distinguishing sets of quantum states that are indistinguishable without the extra entangled resource 11 acknowledgments this work has been supported in part by the national science foundation through grant no phy0456951 i am very grateful for numerous discussions

hta ha respectively multiplying one or the other of the states h and t by a minus sign is another valid quantum operation which bob can perform on his coin by doing so he effectively turns each of these cases into one of the two already shown explicitly in the paper when question 3 is answered affirmatively multiplication of tb by the minus sign is all that is needed to complete the teleportation and for question 4 the minus sign operation need only be followed by bob flipping his quantum coin 13 b reznik y aharonov and b groisman phys rev a 65 032312 1 2002
