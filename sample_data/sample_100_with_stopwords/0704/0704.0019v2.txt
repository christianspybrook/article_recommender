arxiv07040019v2 mathpr 23 jun 2007 approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on the grbner basis norio konno department of applied mathematics yokohama national university abstract in this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the onedimensional contact process by using the grbner basis introduction let x 0 1z denote a configuration space where zd is the ddimensional integer lattices the contact process t t 0 is an xvalued continuoustime markov process the model was introduced by harris in 1974 1 and is considered as a simple model for the spread of a disease with the infection rate in this setting an individual at x zd for a configuration x is infected if x 1 and healthy if x 0 the formal generator is given f cx f x f xzd where x x is defined by x y y y 6 x and x x 1 x here for each x zd and x the transition rate is cx 1 x y x yyx1 with x x1 xd in particular the onedimensional contact process 001 011 100 110 101 111 1 0 rate rate rate rate let y a zd a where a is the number of elements in a let ta zd denote the state at time t of the contact process with 0a a there is a onetoone correspondence between ta zd and t x such that x ta if and only if t x 1 for any a y we define the extinction probability of a by limt p ta define a x 0 for any x a where is an invariant measure of the process starting from a configuration x 1 x zd and is called the upper invariant measure in other words let 1 st denote the probability measure at time t for initial probability measure i which is the pointmass ii 0 1 then  limt 1 st then selfduality of the process implies that a limt p ta the correlation identities for a can be obtained as follows theorem 11 for any a y i xh x x h  a x a 0  a y a xa yyx1 from now on we consider the onedimensional case we introduce the following notation  0 0 1 0 2 by theorem 11 we obtain corollary 12 2 2 1 1 0  1 0 2 2 3 2 0  2 1 0 the detailed discussion concerning results in this section can be seen in konno 2 3 if we regard as variables then the left hand sides of the correlation identities by theorem 11 are polynomials of degree at most two in the next section we give a new procedure for getting a series of approximations for extinction probabilities based on the grbner basis by using corollary 12 as for the grbner basis see 4 for example our results put x y z w s  u let denote the lexicographic order with x y w z u s for m 1 2 3 let im be the ideals of a polynomial ring rx1 x2 xnm over r as defined below here x1 x2 x x3 y x4 z x5 w x6 s x7 u and n1 3 n2 4 n3 7 first approximation we consider the following ideal based on corollary 12 1 i1 h 2y 2x x 1 y x2 i r x y here y x2 corresponds to the first or meanfield approximation  2 then g1 x 12x 1 y x2 is the reduced grbner basis for i1 with respect to therefore the solution except a trivial one x y 1 is x 12 remark that the trivial solution means that the invariant measure is 0 from this we obtain the first approximation of the density of the particle e x as follows 2 1  1 for any 12 this result gives the first lower bound c of the critical value c of the onedimensional contact process that is c 12 c however it should be noted that the inequality is not proved in our approach the estimated value of c is about 1649 second approximation consider the following ideal based on corollary 12 1 and 2 i2 h 2y 2x x 1 z y y x xz y 2 i r x y z here xzy 2 corresponds to the second or pair approximation  2 then g2 x 12 1x 1 1 2y x x y yx 2x2 z y2 y 4x2 is the reduced grbner basis for i2 with respect to therefore the solution except a trivial one x y z 1 is x 12 1 as in a similar way of the first approxaimation we get the second approximation of the density of the particle 2 1 2 1 for any 1 this result implies the second lower bound c should remark that if we take  1 we i2 h 2y 2x x 1 z y y x y x2 z x3 i r x y z then we have g2 z 1 y 1 x 1 is the reduced grbner basis for i2 with respect to here y x2 and z x3 correspond to an approximation 2 and  3 respectively then we have only trivial solution x y z 1 third approximation consider the following ideal based on corollary 12 14 i3 h 2y 2x x 1 z y y x 2s w 2 3z 2y u 2 1w z x ys z 2 xu yw i r x y z w s u here ysz 2 and xuyw correspond to the third approximation  2 and respectively then g3 x 1123 5 1x2 22 3x 1 is the reduced grbner basis for i3 with respect to therefore the solution except a trivial one x 1 is x 2 3 d123 5 1 where d 164 42 4 1 then we obtain the third approximation of the density of the particle 432 3 123 22 8 1 d for any 1 376 this result corresponds to the third lower bound c 1 376 1180 summary we obtain the first second and third approximations for the extinction probability the density of the particle and the lower bound of the onedimensional contact process by using the grbner basis with respect to a suitable term order these results coincide with results given by the harris lemma more precisely the katorikonno method see 3 or the bfkl inequality 5 see also 3 as we saw the generators of im in section 2 have degree at most two in x1 x2 such as 2y 2x x 1 ys z 2 in the case of i3 we expect that this property will lead to get the higher order approximations of the process and other interacting particle systems having a similar property effectively acknowledgment the author
