general system theory likequantum semantics and fuzzy sets ignazio licata isem institute for scientific methodology pa italy ignaziolicataejtpinfo abstract it is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory it can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory it is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system we are going to show how considering the truthvalues of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics in conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence keywords quantum theory fuzzy sets system theory syntax and semantics of scientific theories logical openness published in systemics of emergence research and development minati g pessa e abram m springer 2006 pages 723734 1the role of syntactics and semantics in general system theory the omologic element breaks specializations up forces taking into account different things at the same time stirs up the interdependent game of the separated subtotalities hints at a broader totality whose laws are not the ones of its components in other words the omologic method is an antiseparatist and reconstructive one which thing makes it unpleasant to specialists f rossilandi 1985 the systemiccybernetic approach wiener 1961 von bertalannfy1968 klir 1991 requires a careful evaluation of epistemology as the critical praxis internal to the building up of the scientific discourse that is why the usual referring to a connective tissue shared in common by different subjects could be misleading as a matter of fact every scientific theory is the outcome of a complex conceptual construction aimed to the problem peculiar features so what we are interested in is not a framework shaping an abstract superscheme made by the filtering of the particular sciences but a research focusing on the global and foundational characteristics of scientific activity in a transdisciplinary perspective according to such view we can understand the general system theory gst by the analogy to metalogic it deals with the possibilities and boundaries of various formal systems to a more higher degree than any specific structure a scientific theory presupposes a certain set of relations between observer and system so gst has the purpose to investigate the possibility of describing the multeity of systemobserver relationships the gst main goal is delineating a formal epistemology to study the scientific knowledge formation a science able to speak about science succeeding to outline such panorama will make possible analysing those interdisciplinary processes which are more and more important in studying complex systems and they will be guaranteed the transportability conditions of a modellistic set from a field to another one for instance during a theory developing syntax gets more and more structured by putting univocal constraints on semantics according to the operative requirements of the problem sometimes it can be useful generalising a syntactic tool in a new semantic domain so as to formulate new problems such work a typically transdisciplinary one can only be done by the tools of a gst able to discuss new relations between syntactics formal model and semantics model usage it is here useful to consider again the omologic perspective which not only identifies analogies and isomorphisms in predefined structures but aims to find out a structural and dynamical relation among theories to an higher level of analysis so providing new use possibilities rossilandi 1985 which thing is particularly useful in studying complex systems where the very essence of the problem itself makes a dynamic use of models necessary to describe the emergent features of the system minati brahms 2002 collen 2002 we want here to briefly discuss such gst acceptation and then showing the possibility of modifying the semantics of quantum mechanics qm so to get a conceptual tool fit for the systemic requirements 2 observer as emergence surveyor and semantic ambiguity solver what we look at is not nature in itself but nature unveiling to our questioning methods w heisenberg 1958 a very important and interesting question in system theory can be stated as follows given a set of measurement systems m and of theories t related to a system s is it always possible to order them such that ti1 ti where the partial order symbol is used to denote the relationship physically weaker than we shall point out that in this case the ith theory of the chain contains more information than the preceding ones this consequently leads to a second key question can an unique final theory tf describe exhaustively each and every aspect of system s from the informational and metrical side this is equivalent to state that all of the information contained in a system s can be extracted by means of adequate measurement processes the fundamental proposition for reductionism is in fact the idea that such a theory chain will be sufficient to give a coherent and complete description for a system s reductionism in the light of our definitions coincides therefore with the highest degree of semantic space compression each object d ti in s has a definition in a theory ti belonging to the theory chain and the latter is on its turn related to the fundamental explanatory level of the final theory tf this implies that each aspect in a system s is unambiguously determined by the syntax described in tf each system s can be described at a fundamental level but also with many phenomenological descriptions each of these descriptions can be considered an approximation of the final theory anyway most of the interesting systems we deal with cannot be included in this chainedtheory syntax compatibility program we have to consider this important aspect for a correct epistemic definition of systems complexity let us illustrate this point with a simple reasoning based upon the concepts of logical openness and intrinsic emergence minati pessa penna 1998 licata 2003b each measurement operation can be theoretically coded on a turing machine if a coherent and complete fundamental description tf exists then there will also exist a finite set or at most countably infinite of measurement operations m which can extract each and every single information that describes the system s we shall call such a measurement set turingobserver we can easily imagine turingobserver as a robot that executes a series of measurements on a system the robot is guided by a program built upon rules belonging to the theory t it can be proved though that this is only possible for logically closed systems or at most for systems with a very low degree of logical openness when dealing with highly logically open systems no recursive formal criterion exists that can be as selective as requested ie automatically choose which information is relevant to describe and characterize the system and which one is not simply because it is not possible to isolate the system from the environment this implies that the turingobserver hypothesis does not hold for fundamental reasons strongly related to zermelofraenkels choice axiom and to classical godels decision problems in other words our robot executes the measurements always following the same syntactics whereas the scenario showing intrinsic emergence is semantically modified so it is impossible thinking to codify any possible measurement in a logically open system the observer therefore plays a key rule unavoidable as a semantic ambiguity solver only the observer can and will single out intrinsicobservational emergence properties bass emmeche1997 cariani 1991 and subsequently plan adequate measurement processes to describe what  as a matter of fact have turned in new systems system complexity is structurally bound to logical openness and is at the same time both an expression of highly organized system behaviours longrange correlations hierarchical structure and so on and an observers request for new explanatory models so a gst has to allow in the very same theoretical context to deal with the observer as an emergence surveyor in a logical open system in particular it is clear that the observer itself is a logical open system moreover it has to be pointed out that the coexistence of many description levels compatible but not each other deductible leads to intrinsic uncertainty situations linked to the different frameworks by which a system property can be defined 3 likequantum semantics im not happy with all the analyses that go with just the classical theory because nature isnt classical damm it and if you want to make a simulation of nature youd better make it quantum mechanical and by golly its a wonderful problem because it doesnt look so easy thank you r p feyman 1981 when we modify andor amplify a theory so as to being able to speak about different systems from the ones they were fitted for it could be better to look at the theory deep structural features so as to get an abstract perspective able to fulfil the omologic approach requirements aiming to point out a nonbanal conceptual convergence as everybody knows the logic of classical physics is a dichotomic language tertium non datur relatively orthocomplemented and able to fulfil the weak distributivity relations by the logical connectives andor such features are the core of the boolean commutative elements of this logic because disjunctions and conjunctions are symmetrical and associative operations we shall here dwell on the systemic consequences of these properties a system s can get or not to get a given property p once we fix the p truthvalue it is possible to keep on our research over a new preposition p subordinated to the previous ones truthvalue going ahead we add a new piece of information to our knowledge about the system so the relative orthocomplementation axiom grants that we keep on following a successions of steps each one making our uncertainty about the system to diminish or in case of a finite amount of steps to let us defining the state of the system by determining all its properties each systems property can be described by a countable infinity of atomic propositions so such axiom plays the role of a describable axiom for classical systems the unconstrained use of such kind of axiom tends to hide the conceptual problems spreading up from the fact that every description implies a context as we have seen in the case of turingobserver analysis and it seems to imply that systemic properties are independent of the observer it surely is a nonvalid statement when we deal with open logical systems in particular the boolean features point out that it is always possible carrying out exhaustively a synchronic description of the properties of a systems in other words every question about the system is not depending on the order we ask it and it is liable to a fixed answer we will indicate as 0 false 1true it can be suddenly noticed that the emergent features otherwise get a diachronic nature and can easily make such characteristics not taken for granted by using venn diagrams it is possible providing a representation of the complete descriptiveness of a system ruled by classical logics if the systems state is represented by a point and a property of its by a set of points then it is always possible a complete blanketing of the universal set i which means the always universally true proposition see fig 1 the quantum logics shows deep differences which could be extremely useful for our goals birkhoff von neumann 1936 piron 1964 at the beginning it was born to clarify some qms counterintuitive sides later it has developed as an autonomous field greatly independent from the matters which gave birth to it we will abridge here the formal references to an essential survey focusing on some points of general interest in systemics the quantum language is a nonboolean orthomodular structure which is to say it is relatively orthocomplemented but noncommutative for the crack down of the distributivity axiom such thing comes naturally from the heisenberg indetermination principle and binds the truth value of an assertion to the context and the order by which it has been investigated griffiths 1995 a wellknown example is the one of a particles spin measurement along a given direction in this case we deal with semantically well defined possibilities and yet intrinsically uncertain let put x the spin measurement along the direction x for the indetermination principle the value y will be totally uncertain yet the proposition y 0 y 1 is necessarily true in general if p is a proposition p its negation and q the property which does not commute with p then we will get a situation that can be represented by a patchy blanketing of the set i see fig2 such configuration finds its essential meaning just in its relation with the observer so we can state that when a situation can be described by a quantum logics a system is never completely defined a priori the measurement process by which the observers action takes place is a choice fixing some systems characteristics and letting other ones undefined it happens just for the nature itself of the observersystem interrelationship each observation act gives birth to new descriptive possibilities the proposition q in the above example describes properties that cannot be defined by any implicational chain of propositions p since the intrinsic emergence cannot be regarded as a system property independent of the observer action as in nave classical emergentism q can be formally considered the expression of an emergent property now we are strongly tempted to define as emergent the undefined proposition of quantumlike anticommutative language in particular it can be showed that a nonboolean and irreducible orthomodular language arises infinite propositions it means that for each couple of propositions p1 and p2 such that non of them imply the other there exists infinite propositions q which imply p1  p2 without necessarily implying the two of them separately tertium datur in a sense the disjunction of the two propositions gets more information than their mere setsum that is the entirely opposite of what happens in the boolean case it is now easy to comprehend the deep relation binding the anticommutativity indetermination principles and systems holistic global structure a system describable by a boolean structure can be completely solved by analysing the subsystems defined by a fit decomposition process heylighen 1990 abram 2002 on the contrary in the anticommutative case studying any subsystem modifies the entire system in an irreversible and structural way and produces uncertainty correlated to the gained information which think makes absolutely natural extending the indetermination principles to a big deal of spheres of strong interest for systemics volkenshtein 1988 a particularly keymatter is how to conceptually managing the infinite cardinality of emergent propositions in a likquantum semantics as everybody knows traditional qm refers to the frequentistic probability worked out within the copenhagen interpretation ciqm it is essentially a sub specie probabilitatis boolean logics extension the values between 01 ie between the completely and always true proposition i and the always false one o are meant as expectation values or the probabilities associated to any measurable property without dwelling on the complex and as for many questions still open debate on qm interpretation we can here ask if the probabilistic acception of truthvalues is the fittest for system theory as it usually happens when we deal with transdisciplinary feels it will bring us to add a new and of remarkable interest for the ordinary qm too step to our search 4 a fuzzy interpretation of quantum languages a slight variation in the founding axioms of a theory can give way to huge changings on the frontier s gudder 1988 the study of the structural and logical facets of quantum semanics does not provide any necessary indications about the most suitable algebraic space to implement its own ideas one of the thing which made a big merit of such researches has been to put under discussion the key role of hilbert space in our approach we have kept the qm internal problems and its extension to systemic questions well separated anyway the last ones suggest an interpretative possibility bounded to fuzzy logic which thing can considerably affect the traditional qm too the fuzzy set theory is in its essence a formal tool created to deal with information characterized with vagueness and indeterminacy the bynow classical paper of lotfi zadeh zadeh 1965 brings to a conclusion an old tradition of logics which counts charles s peirce jan c smuts bertrand russell max black and ian lukasiewicz among its forerunners at the core of the fuzzy theory lies the idea that an element can belong to a set to a variable degree of membership the same goes for a proposition and its variable relation to the true and false logical constants we underline here two aspects of particular interest for our aims the fuzziness definition concerns single elements and properties but not a statistical ensemble so it has to be considered a completely different concept from the probability one it should by now be widely clarified mamdani 1977 kosko 1990 a further essential even maybe less evident point is that fuzzy theory calls up a nonalgorithmic oracle an observator ie a logical open system and a semantic ambiguity solver to make a choice as for the membership degree in fact the most part of the theory in its structure is freemodel no equation and no numerical value create constraints to the quantitative evaluation being the last one the model builders task there consequently exists a deep bound between systemics and fuzziness successfully expressed by the zadehs incompatibility principle zadeh 1972 which satisfies our requirement for a generalized indeterminacy principle it states that by increasing the system complexity ie its logical openness degree it will decrease our ability to make exact statements and proved predictions about its behaviour there already exists many examples of crossing between fuzzy theory and qm dalla chiara giuntini 1995 cattaneo dalla chiara giuntini 1993 we want here to delineate the utility of fuzzy polyvalence for systemic interpretation of quantum semantics let us consider a complex system such as a social group a mind and a biological organism each of these cases show typical emergent features owed both to the interaction among its components and the interrelations with the environment an act of the observer will fix some properties and will let some others undetermined according to a nonboolean logic the recording of such properties will depend on the succession of the measurement acts and their very nature the kind of complexity into play on the other hand prevents us by stating what the system state is so as to associate to the measurement of a property an expectation probabilistic value in fact just the abovementioned examples are related to macroscopic systems for which the probabilistic interpretation of qm is patently not valid moreover the traditional application of the probability concept implies the notion of possible cases and so it also implies a predefined knowledge of systems properties however the noncommutative logical structure here outlined does not provide any cogent indication on probability usage therefore it would be proper to look at a fuzzy approach so to describe the measurement acts we can state that given a generic system endowed with high logical openness and an indefinite set of properties able of describing it each of them will belong to the system in a variable degree such viewpoint expressing the famous theorem of fuzzy subsetness also known as the whole into the part principle could seem to be too strong indeed it is nothing else than the most natural expression of the actual scientific praxis facing intrinsic emergent systems at the beginning we have at our disposal indefinite information progressively structuring thanks to the feedback between models and measurements it can be shown that any logically open model of degree n where n is an integer will let a wide range of properties and propositions indeterminate the qs in fig 2the abovementioned model is a static approximation of a process showing aspects of variable closeness and openness the latter ones varies in time intensity different levels and context it is remarkable pointing out how such systems are flexible and contextsensitive change the rules and make use of contradictions this point has to be stressed to understand the link between fuzzy logic and quantum languages by increasing the logical openness and the unsharp properties of a system it will be less and less fit to be described by a boolean logic it brings as a consequence that for a complex system the intersection between a set properties propositions and its complement is not equal to the empty set but it includes they both in a fuzzy sense so we get a polyvalent semantic situation which is well fitted for being described by a quantum language as for our systemic goal it is the probabilistic interpretation to be useless so we are going to build a fuzzy acception of the semantics of the formalism in our case given a system s and a property q let be a function which associates q to s the expression s q 01 has not to be meant as a probability value but as a degree of membership such union between the noncommutative sides of quantum languages and fuzzy polyvalence appears to be the most suitable and fecund for systemics let us consider the traditional expression of quantum coherence the property expressing the qm global and nonlocal characteristics ie superposition principle uncertainty interference of probabilities a11 a 2 2 in the fuzzy interpretation it means that the properties 1 e 2 belong to with degrees of membership a1 e a 2 respectively in other words for complex systems the schrdingers cat can be simultaneously both alive and dead indeed the recent experiments with squids and the other ones investigating the socalled macroscopic quantum states suggest a form of macrorealism quite close to our fuzzy acception leggett 1980 chiatti cini serva 1995 it can provide in nuce an hint which could show up to be interesting for the qm oldquestioned interpretative problems in general let x be a position coordinate of a quantum object and its wave function  x dv is usually meant as the probability of finding the particle in a region dv of space on the contrary in the fuzzy interpretation we will be compelled to look at the square modulus as the degree of membership of the particle to the region dv of space how unusual it may seem such idea has not to be regarded thoughtlessly at as a matter of fact in quantum field theory and in other more advanced quantum scenarios a particle is not only a localized object in the space but rather an event emerging from the nonlocal networks elementary quantum transition licata 2003a thus the measurement is a defuzzification process which according to the stated reduces the system ambiguity by limiting the semantic space and by defining a fixed information quantity if we agree with such interpretation we will easily and immediately realize that we will able to observate quantum coherence behaviours in nonquantum and quite far from the range of planks h constant situations we reconsider here a situation owed to yuri orlov orlov 1997 let us consider a riemanns sphere dirac 1947 see fig 3 and let assume that each point on the sphere represents a single interpretation of a given situation ie the assigning of a coherent set of truthvalues to a given proposition alternatively we can consider the choosing of a vector v from the centre o to a point on the sphere as a logical definition of a world if we choose a different direction associated to a different vector w we can now set the problem about the meaning of the amplitude between the logical descriptions of the two worlds it is known that such amplitude is expressed by 1 1 cos where is the angle between the two interpretations the amplitude corresponds to a superposition of worlds so producing the typical interference patterns which in vectorial terms are related to w in this case the traditional use of probability is not necessary because our knowledge of one of the two world with probability equal to p 1 certainity say nothing us about the other one probability an interpretation is not a quantum object in the proper sense and yet we are forced to formally introduce a wavefunction and interference terms whose role is very obscure a one the fuzzy approach instead clarifies the quantum semantics of this situation by interpreting interference as a measurement where the properties of the world v v w w are owed to the global and indissoluble nonlocal contribution of the v and w overlapping in conclusion the generalized using of quantum semantics associated to new interpretative possibilities gives to systemics a very powerful tool to describe the observatorenvironment relation and to convey the several
