state university 212 earth and engineering science building university park pennsylvania 16802 lfriedmanpsuedu keywords quantum dots strained films epitaxial growth semiconductors abstract epitaxial selfassembled quantum dots saqds are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers photodetectors and nanoscale logic spatial order and size order of saqds are important to the development of usable devices it is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked thus a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of saqd formation based on surface diffusion analytic formulas for filmheight correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order initial atomicscale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths about two dots when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible however the correlation lengths diverge when saqds are allowed to form at a nearcritical film height the present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and saqd order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations in addition saqd formation is by its nature a stochastic process and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of saqd formation and order are presented introduction epitaxial selfassembled quantum dots saqds represent an important step in the advancement of semiconductor fabrication at the nanoscale that will allow breakthroughs in optoelectronics and electronics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 most frequent optoelectronic applications are high efficiency lasers with exotic wavelengths or photodetectors 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 saqds are the result of a transition from 2d growth to 3d growth in strained epitaxial films such as six ge1x si and inx ga1x asgaas this process is known as stranskikrastanow growth or volmerwebber growth 13 1 14 15 in applications order is a key factor there are two types of order spatial and size spatial order refers to the regularity of saqd dot placement and it is necessary for nanocircuitry applications size order refers to the uniformity of saqd size which determines the voltage andor energy level quantization of saqds it is reasonable to expect that these type of order are linked and it is important to understand the factors that determine saqd order further understanding should help in the design and simulation of both spontaneous bottom up selfassembly and directed or guided selfassembly to enhance saqd order 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23here an elaboration of and further application of a linear analysis of saqd order 24 is presented the work reported here forms the basis of a nonlinear theory and modeling of saqd order that will be reported in future work in 24 it was reported that one could calculate a correlation function using a linearized model of saqd formation this correlation function included two correlation lengths that could be used to describe saqd order it was also found that one effect of a hypothesized wetting potential was to enhance saqd order when growth occurs near the critical film height for 3d growth here these results are expanded to create a more rigorous linearized theory of saqd order that will inform nonlinear theories in particular the model is generalized to any model that combines local energy effects such as surface energy density and nonlocal elastic destabilization and the procedure for predicting order based on any linear theory with peak wavelengths is presented the hypothesized effect of elastic anisotropy in 24 is verified with calculations using linear anisotropic elasticity theory 25 26 details such as statistical fluctuation and convergence are also addressed along with a discussion of the possible forms of linear anisotropic terms in saqd growth kinetics and the effect of an atomicscale cutoff in the continuum theory is addressed finally the order enhancing effect of growing near the critical threshold is explored in more detail using calculations appropriate to gesi saqds in the literature two modes of saqd formation are generally discussed the thermal nucleation mode and the nucleationless mode 27 28 29 in the thermal nucleation mode a 2d film surface is metastable and the formation of individual quantum dots is thermally activated 27 this growth mode leads to the formation of individual quantum dots as uncorrelated or loosely correlated discrete events at essentially random locations in the nucleationless mode the 2d film surface transitions from stable or metastable to unstable in this mode dots form everywhere at once appearing at first as a crosshatched ripplelike disturbance on the 2d film surface and then maturing into recognizable individual dots27 30 28 31 32 these two modes are probably connected via an encompassing conceptual and mathematical model1 and perhaps some of what is observed experimentally is in fact a hybrid mechanism in agreement with intuition it appears that the nucleationless mode leads to a more ordered dot pattern than the thermal nucleation mode that is dominated by randomness 2 thus the presented analysis applies to the nucleationless mode there are various implementations of nucleationless growth models 28 37 38 39 40 18 34 although there is also a great deal of commonality among these models in particular they all include a nonlocal elastic effect and local surface energies andor local wetting energies here a linear analysis of quantum dot order resulting from this class of model is presented particular note is taken of the effects of stochastic initial conditions crystal anisotropy in general elastic anisotropy in particular and the effect of varying film height as a control parameter as first introduced in 33 a simple model similar to 28 37 38 40 18 is presented to produce numerical examples and explore the effects of the average film height concurrently a more abstract and general model is presented and analyzed that includes nonlocal elastic strain effects and a local combined surface and wetting energy the linear model with stochastic initial conditions and deterministic film height evolution will pave the way for more sophisticated analysis involving a nonlinear model of stochastic film height evolution as previously stated one of the goals in the present work is to further explore the role of the wetting potential during growth near the stability threshold in film height a wetting potential has been included in the analysis and simulations in 38 33 37 28 although somewhat controversial the wetting potential plays an important phenomenological role it ensures that growth takes place in the stranskikrastanow mode that a 3d unstable growth occurs only after a critical layer thickness is achieved and that a residual wetting layer persists the physical origins and consequences of the wetting potential are discussed in 41 28 the analysis presented here is usable in models that neglect the wetting potential by simply setting it to zero another possibility is simply that the wetting potential is simply an approximation to the stabilizing effect of intermixing 42 that said if the wetting potential is real the present analysis shows that it is beneficial to saqd order to grow near the critical layer thickness the presented analytic formulas and linear analysis are intended to complement existing numerical models of saqd order 43 37 44 45 and to form a basis for future nonlinear analytic analysis of saqd order the current findings agree with previous work on the beneficial effects of elastic anisotropy to enhance inplane order the linear analysis of course represents a simplification of the film evolution and it applies only to the initial stages of saqd formation when the nominally flat film surface becomes unstable and transitions to threedimensional growth however the small surface fluctuation stage of saqd growth determines the initial seeds of order or disorder in an saqd array thus the small fluctuation stage should have an important influence on the final outcome at later stages when surface fluctuations are large there is a natural tendency of saqds to either order or ripen 33 37 46 39 47 ordering systems tend to evolve slowly due to critical slowing down 39 while ripening tends to diminish order further 37 thus it is possible that the linear model could in fact yield good predictions of saqd order the simplification and linearizion facilitates the development of analytic solutions that are most transparent easily portable to multiple material systems and have no effective limit on system size finally it is virtually impossible to have a thorough understanding of the full nonlinear model without first having a thorough understanding of the linear behavior the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the physical assumptions and mathematical 1 it is likely that there a transition from stable to metastable and finally to unstable the analysis presented in 33 would appear to support such a view where the film height acts as the control parameter driving the transition there is also some controversy regarding whether all dot growth is nucleationless or not 34 32 2 compare various figures in 29 35 14 31 36 approximations used to model film growth section 3 discusses the stochastic initial conditions and the resulting correlation functions and correlation lengths section 4 presents a procedure for estimating saqd order with an application to ge dots on a si substrate section 5 presents conclusions while appendices af present additional calculational details modeling the formation of saqds is modeled as a deterministic surface diffusion process with stochastic initial conditions the resulting equations and ultimately the sought after correlation functions are different depending on whether the film surface is treated as onedimensional isotropic twodimensional isotropic or twodimensional anisotropic the 1d and 2d isotropic cases are discussed first and then the essential differences of the 2d anisotropic model are presented the stochastic initial conditions need to be expressed in terms of the correlation functions that are also use to analyze order consequently the discussion of the initial conditions is deferred to sec 32 it should be noted that the results presented here are fairly general there has been a good deal of recent work refining the modeling of nucleationless growth processes to incorporate various phenomenological aspects of saqd growth for example the inclusion of orientationdependent surface energy 38 straindependent surface energy 34 and explicit modeling of atomic species segregation and filmsubstrate inter diffusion 48 two models are presented here one is a simple concrete example it is the simplest model one can use including elastic effects surface energy and wetting energy the second model is more abstract and describes the general case of a local potential energy that depends on both the film height and film height gradient one effect that is not examined here is that of mixed 4fold and twofold symmetry such a mixing can occur due to diffusional anisotropy or surface energy anisotropy sec 2212 and appendix d however a similar analysis procedure should work for these cases as well the general procedure for possible application to other models is discussed in sec 35 the following discussion will use abstract vector notation eg k instead of ki etc also because it is sometimes computational expedient to perform onedimensional modeling 24 39 17 42 the case of a one dimensional surface with two dimensional volume is discussed along with the case of an isotropic 2d surface to facilitate this combined discussion the dimensionality of the surface will be denoted as d in secs 33 and 34 d 1 2 will be substituted as appropriate finally much of the calculation involves reciprocal space the convention used for the fourier transforms f x dd k eikx fk and fk 2d dd x eikx f x following the example of 28 1d and 2d isotropic model this discussion pertains to both the 1d model and the 2d isotropic model the formation of saqds is modeled as a surface diffusion process where the film height is a function of the lateral position and time the system is treated as deterministic with stochastic initial conditions first the general nonlinear governing equations are presented then the linearized form is presented finally the key behavior is reviewed the mathematical model uses film height hx t as the dependent variable and the horizontal position x and time t as the independent variables the film height evolves over time due to surface diffusion driven by a diffusion potential x t and a flux of new material q the surface velocity is thus vn nz t h s ds x t q where nz is the vertical component of the surface normal nz 1 h2 12 s is the surface gradient d is the diffusivity and s is the surface divergence 211 energetics the diffusion potential x t must produce stranskikrastanow growth thus it must contain an elastic term that destabilizes film growth a surface energy term that stabilizes planar growth and a wetting energy that ensures a wetting layer the diffusion potential can be derived from a total free energy felast fsurf fwet dv dasurf da w h volume surface where is the elastic energy density is the surface energy density w h is the wetting energy density the last integral corresponds to fwet and whether the integral should be taken over the film surface or the substrate is ambiguous the simple model sec 2111 assumes that the integral is over the substrate while the general model sec 2112 can accommodate both cases 2111 simple form the simplest possible model results if the integral corresponding to fwet is taken over the lateral positions x rather than over the actual freesurface in concrete terms one can use dv d2 xdz and dasurf i12 d2 x 1 hx to obtain the expression d2 xdz hx z d2 x 1 hx i12  w hx xplane volume where the h indicates that the elastic energy density is a nonlocal functional of the film height h the diffusion potential can be found similar to 15 by differentiating f with respect to the surface motion appendix a1 x fhx doing so for eq 2 appendix a2 x x x w 0 hx where isthe atomic volume x is the elastic energy density at the film surface implicitly h x hx i12 ff  hx 1 hx is the total surface curvature and w 0 h hx w hx is the derivative of w hx evaluated at x 2112 general form it should be noted that eq 3 is not the same diffusion potential used in 38 the wetting potential used there can be derived by taking w h as an energy density of the free surface not a density in the xplane expressions like eq 3 and eq 1 in 38 are part of a larger class of surface evolution models with more or less the same linear behavior the surface and wetting energy can be combined and incorporated into a more general form with a total free energy fsw and a free energy density fsw h h that depends on the film height hx and the film height slope or orientation hx the total free energy is thus  felast fsw d2 xdz hx z d2 x fsw hx hx xplane volume fsw may not necessarily be the sum of separate surface energy and wetting energy contributions it need only be a local function of h and h the corresponding diffusion potential is x x fsw x f01 indicates the mth derivative with respect to h and the nhth derivative i with respect to h fsw x hx fsw hx hx and each vector component of fsw x is fsw x hxi fsw hx hx one can obtain the results of the simple model eqs 2 and 3 by setting i12 fsw 1 hx  w hx where fsw a diffusion potential like eq 1 in 38 can be obtained by setting i12 fsw 1 hx  hx w hx this is different from eq 6 in two ways first the surface energy density depends on the surface orientation second i12 the jacobian j 1 hx multiplies both the surface energy density and the wetting potential despite these differences the common form of the diffusion potential eq 5 among different models suggests that they might all lead to similar linearized forms and behavior 2113 linearization the diffusion potential is now linearized about the average film height h in general one can control the amount of deposited material and thus the average film height h it is therefore useful to decompose hx into the spatially averaged mean value and fluctuations about the average similar to 28 h h hx t in the present calculation h is specified as constant in time this assumption corresponds physically to a fast deposition and then an anneal it is not too difficult to generalize to a time dependent h but that is beyond the scope of this manuscript in 38 49 deposition and evaporation is explicitly modeled all terms in x t are now kept to only linear order in hx t the elastic energy density is a nonlocal functional of hx t 40 however the equations generating x are translationally invariant thus it is convenient to use reciprocal space for the linearization the curvature is trivially linearized as x 2 hx in real space or k k 2 hk in reciprocal space the linearized elastic strain energy can be found in reciprocal space as in 15 to be k 2m 1 2m hk where m e1 is the biaxial modulus e is the young modulus is the poisson ratio and m is the filmsubstrate mismatch strain this formula neglects possible differences in elastic moduli between the film and substrate as in 28 but a similar method of analysis should apply to that case as well linearizing eqs 3 and 5 in reciprocal space k is proportional to hk with a proportionality coefficient that depends on k and link f k hhk where f k h for three different isotropic cases corresponding to eqs 3 and 5 and an abstracted general form is given by  case a eq 3  2m 1 m k k w h f k h 2m 1 2m k f 02 k 2 f 20  case b eq 5 ak bk c  case c general due to isotropy f k h is independent of the direction of k and only the wave number k kkk appears in the right hand side fsw is the second derivative of fsw with respect to h and fsw the second derivative of fsw with respect to h fsw and fsw depend on h only thus they are constants in the present analysis see appendix b2 for more precise definitions and the derivation of f k h using eq 6 produces fsw and fsw w 00 h which is identical to the simple case of eq 9 a case c labeled as general where a b and c depend implicitly on h shows that f k h for cases a and b have the same relatively simple form it also emphasizes the dynamic effects as opposed to the physical causes there is a destabilizing term ak a short wavelength cutoff term bk 2 and a term that stabilizes the entire spectrum c despite the label general there are of course limitations to the application of eqs 8 and 9 for example there has been recent work on the effects of straindependent surface energies 34 the second form can not represent such an effect because the derivation assumes that the surface energy only depends on local quantities h and h whereas the strain effect is nonlocal however it is reasonable to conjecture that a more detailed analysis of the effects of a strain dependent surface energy term would produce a coefficient function f k h not very different from the case c general form of eq 9 thus the following analysis may very well apply to this more exotic model but more study is needed to be certain 212 dynamics as discussed in sec 211 the dynamics are derived assuming no flux of new material q 0 and keeping only terms to linear order in the height fluctuation hx t under these assumptions eq 1 can be decomposed into a table 1 characteristic wavenumbers characteristic times and associated dimensionless variables for the three cases addressed in eq 9 case a case b case c 2m 12m 2m 12m fsw 16dm 4 14

where lin x is the inverse fourier transform of eqs 8 and 9 and it depends implicitly on the average film height h note that the time dependence is implicitly while the coordinate dependence is explicit the explicit coordinate dependence serves to distinguish assuming that the diffusivity d is constant the fourier transform of eq 11 gives the linearized differential equation for the evolution of each fourier component t hk  dk 2 k dk 2 f k hhk hk t hk 0ek t dk f k h solving eq 12 the surface evolves in reciprocal space as an initial condition hk 0 multiplied by an envelope function ek t for most values of h this envelope function has a peak as time passes this peak narrows and can be approximated by a gaussian to analyze this behavior appropriate dimensionless variables are defined then the stability of the film is discussed finally k is expanded about its peak to aid analytic calculations the time dependent behavior of the film height fluctuations is facilitated by using a characteristic wave number characteristic time and related dimensionless variables for the general case c of eq 9 the characteristic wavenumber is kc ab and the characteristic time is tc 1dbkc4 b3 da4 these characteristic dimensions can be used to define a dimensionless wave vector kkc and a dimensionless wetting parameter cbkc2 cba2 one can also define a dimensionless time ttc to obtain the corresponding characteristic scales for cases a and b one merely has to plug in the appropriate substitutes for a b and c and follow the pattern for example for case a make the substitution a 2m 2 2m etc table 1 summarizes these values for all three cases for all three cases f k h and the growth constant k reduce to the following forms f k h f kc h bkc2 2 1 2 k kc tc where kk kkc is the dimensionless wave number these forms are plotted in figs 1a and 2 fig 1a shows f k hbkc2 vs for an isotropic or one dimensional surface figs 2 shows tc k vs for a 2d anisotropic surface sec 22 however the curves marked 0 are identical to the dispersion relation for a 1d or 2d isotropic surface compare eqs 9 and 23 213 peaks the peak growth rate and the corresponding wavenumber k can be

inserting this approximation for k into eq 13 hk t hk 0e0 t e 2 2 tkk0 the individual initial surface fluctuation components grow with a gaussian shaped envelope an example of this envelope is plotted in fig 3a notice that in two dimensions the envelope forms a ring as the peak is about the wavenumber k0 but not about any particular point in the kplane 214 stability and wetting potential stranskikrastanow growth is marked by a transition from stable twodimensional growth to unstable threedimensional growth once a critical height hc is reached 1 eqs 17 18 and 20 are useful for analyzing the transition from stable to unstable growth in order for this transition to occur there must be some stabilizing term in the diffusion potential in the present model this means that there must be some surface energylike term that varies strongly with film height this condition equates to stating that w 00 h or fsw or c eq 9 must be rather large if h hc however as h increases these terms are reduced finally when h hc this term is no longer capable of stabilizing the film against fluctuations of all possible wavelengths the critical value hc can be found using the analysis from 33 by inspection of eqs 8 9 and 12 modes with f 0 increase the total free energy f as they grow thus they are stable and decay with time modes with f 0 decrease the total free energy f as they grow thus they are unstable and grow with time this growth and decay rule is easily verified by inspection of eq 14 thus stable growth occurs when f k h 0 for all values of k and unstable growth occurs when f k h 0 for some values of k thus the transition from stable to unstable growth occurs when the minimum value of f k h just becomes negative using the same dimensional analysis as in the previous section and following the discussion of 33 one finds that the minimum value fmin bkc2 14 occurs at kmin kc min 12 fmin first becomes negative and the transition to unstable growth occurs when the dimensionless wetting parameter table 1 drops to a critical value 14 14 stable 2d growth and  14 unstable 3d growth it is reasonable to suppose that w h w 00 h and thus are positive monotonically decreasing functions of h so that the interface becomes less important for large values of h for example in 50 it is assumed that w h bh where b is constant when 0 corresponding to large h the case discussed in 28 is obtained a similar analysis can be done for cases b and c once one specifies how the terms fsw and fsw or a b and c depend on h using a guessed form for a wetting potential one can find the critical film height hc by setting 14 applying this condition to case a in eq 3 w 00 hc kc2 4 using the wetting potential of 50 as an example w h bh hc 3 8bkc2 3 8b2m 1 2m 2 conversely one can fit a wetting potential to an observed or reasonable critical layer thickness from the same condition using the example wetting potential from 50 2m 1 2m 2 hc3 as stated in 503 2d anisotropic case crystal anisotropy leads to a dispersion relation k that is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the isotropic case here the effect of elastic anisotropy is discussed in most detail other sources of anisotropy are the surface and wetting energies for example in 38 the surface energy density is orientation dependent which introduces a possible anisotropy in the dispersion relation possible sources of anisotropy are an anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor an orientation dependent surface energy or wetting potential or anisotropic diffusion as discussed below the form of anisotropy to linear order in the height fluctuation h is somewhat restricted results are presented for 4fold symmetric surfaces that is surfaces that have invariant dynamic evolution laws when rotated by 90 possible complications arising from 2fold symmetric anisotropic terms with 180 rotational symmetry are also discussed as for the isotropic case first the energetics are discussed then the dynamics and finally the expansion about the peaks in the dispersion relation k 221 energetics the discussion of energetics will first treat the effects of elastic anisotropy and then anisotropy resulting from surface or wetting like terms 3 this result from 50 corresponds to the choice f sw h h 1 h2 w h however the numerical model in 50 appears to use fsw h h 1 h2 h w h this difference should lead to a slightly different critical film height in their numerical model from the one that they predicted eq 21 figure 4 plot of ek m 2m for various materials symbols indicate values

596 1245 215 187 01302 2211 elastic anisotropy one would like to obtain a simple symbolic expression for the elastic energy density at the free surface k to first order in hk for the elastically anisotropic case similar discussions can be found in 25 26 for the isotropic case k 2m 1 2m hk for the anisotropic case k ek khk where the prefactor ek is the decrease in elastic energy at the surface per unit wave number k 1 and unit amplitude hk 1 it is not constant but instead depends on the k the angle that k makes with the xdirection the case of a cubesymmetry elastic stiffness tensor such as for si is considered where one must specify three elastic constants c11 c12 and c44 51 growth on a 100 surface will produce an elastic energy prefactor ek that is fourfold symmetric symmetric upon rotations by 90 a procedure similar to 25 26 based on a first order perturbation analysis is followed appendix c a relatively simple interpolation formula 24 is hypothesized and then verified numerically the interpolation procedure suggested in 24 uses the lowest possible order expansion in sink and cosk that has the appropriate fourfold symmetry and then interpolates between k 0 and k 45 thus ek e0 1 a sin2 2k where a e0 e45 e0 is an anisotropy factor this lowest order form turns out to be a very good fit to numerical calculations fig 4 table 2 gives values of e0 and a for some systems of interest in the elastically isotropic case e0 e45 2m 1 so that a 0 there are two important differences from the elastically isotropic case the first is obvious that ek depends on angular orientation k the second is that the peak value of k is not the same as that for the elastically isotropic case because in general e0 6 2m 1 in 24 where the purpose was simply to investigate the mechanism by which elastic anisotropy effects order this second difference was neglected 2212 surface and wetting energy anisotropy the surface energy and wetting potential can be additional sources of anisotropy if they depend on the surface orientation so that h or w h w h h for example 52 38 then to first order in h surfk k 2 k 00 k hk where 00 is the 2 2 matrix or hessian matrix that results from taking the second derivatives of h with respect to the two components of h appendix b1 similarly wetk w 20 k w02 k hk where w 20 and w02 are the second derivatives of w h h with respect to h and h appendix b1 for both surfk and wetk the first term is isotropic and the second term contains any possible anisotropy the rank of the 00 and w02 matrices greatly restricts the possible forms of the additional anisotropy these 2 2 matrices must be either twofold symmetric or perfectly isotropic thus if the surface energy and wetting potential are fourfold symmetric as ek is then 00 00 a scalar and w02 w 02 a scalar and neither one contributes any additional anisotropy they do however help to stabilize or further destabilize the 2d surface as they add terms proportional to k 2 the effect of these additional terms is indistinguishable from the effect of varying the value of the surface energy density 52 31 it should be noted that the 100 surface of a diamond or zincblend structures allows for anisotropy that is only 2fold symmetric rotations by 180 thus they could break the fourfold symmetry that occurs when one considers the elastic anisotropy alone however this broken symmetry is somewhat dubious because even the diamond and zincblend structures have a screw symmetry rotations by 90 and translation in the 100 direction by half a lattice vector thus if for example w h h is anisotropic with twofold symmetry to linear order there must be a fast oscillation with changes in the film height h in appendix d a similar term related to anisotropic diffusion is discussed there does not appear to be any evidence for this twofold symmetry in the case of 100 surfaces of iviv systems such as gesi but in iiiviiiv systems the fourfold symmetry of the 100 surface may indeed be broken in this way corresponding to either a surface energy anisotropy or a diffusional anisotropy 53 54 further analysis of such terms in any more detail would greatly complicate the present discussion so it is left for future work most of the modeling literature avoids this complication by not including the symmetrybreaking of the zincblend surface for example 25 26 38 one can perform a similar analysis of the combined surface and wetting potential fsw h h case b to linear order the resulting anisotropic diffusion potential is appendix b2 swk fsw  k f02 hk again fsw is a rank 2 tensor and all of the same symmetry considerations apply here as well because the twofold symmetry anisotropic terms are excluded from the current discussion and isotropic terms simply renormalize the effective of surface energy there will be no further consideration of anisotropy resulting from the surface energy or wetting potential in this discussion further calculations will proceed assuming that the surface energy density nor the wetting potential w h depend on h or similarly that fsw h h has a purely isotropic dependence on h this assumption can be made without affecting any of the qualitative results 2213 total diffusion potential having dispensed with the discussion of the various sources of anisotropy the total diffusion potential is stated for the case of 4fold symmetric

done for the surface energy and the wetting energies thus all anisotropy in the film evolution dynamics comes from elastic effects alone the possibility and effects of an anisotropic diffusion potential is discussed in appendix d also see 54 the time dependence of the surface perturbations simply follows eqs 13 and 14 but with eq 23 used for f k h as for the isotropic case appropriate characteristic wave numbers kc and time scales tc can be found for each of the three cases along with the associated dimensionless wave vector and dimensionless wetting parameter these are listed in

autocorrelation function is denoted c a x where x is the difference vector between two points in the xplane the spectrum function is a function of k and it is denoted cka the goal here is to be able

describe them quantitatively in a manner that can be used to characterize saqd order with just a few numbers the autocorrelation function is the result of a spatial average over one experiment or one simulation numerical experiment it is regular and repeatable because it is closely tied to the correlation function and spectrum function that results from an ensemble average eqs x and x these are denoted as cx and the spectrum ck respectively note that the ensemble averaged functions do not have a superscript a these ensemble average correlation functions are useful in the analysis of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations 55 56 from a strictly technical viewpoint the spatial average and the ensemble average are not exactly the same however they are closely enough connected that it is reasonable to use one as a substitute for the other sec 31 and appendix 3 in the following the analysis of saqd order via autocorrelation and correlation functions is discussed sec 31 then the stochastic initial conditions are discussed sec 32 then the prediction of the fourier transforms of the correlation functions is discussed sec 33 the realspace correlation functions are presented sec 34 finally there are some notes regarding generalizing the analysis method to any dispersion relation that has peaks sec 35 for example peaks related to broken fourfold symmetry or growth on a miscut substrate correlation functions and saqd order autocorrelation functions are wellsuited for investigating saqd order the autocorrelation function is defined as d2 x0 hx x0 hx0 c a x its fourier transform sometimes called the spectrum 56 spectrum function or power spectrum is cka d2 x eikx cx hk where a is the projected area of the film in the x yplane a periodic array of saqds leads to a periodic autocorrelation function a nearly periodic array leads to a rangelimited periodic autocorrelation function the ensemblemean of these autocorrelation functions can be calculated and it is a good predictor of a saqd order 311 periodic array consider a perfectly periodic height fluctuation corresponding to a perfect lattice of saqds hx h0 x exp ikn x xo n in plus higher order

higher order harmonics where d k kn a2d kkn 4 thus the order of the saqd lattice manifests itself as periodic functions in realspace eq 28 and sharp peaks in reciprocal space eq 30 312 nearly periodic array a nearly periodic arrays shows deviation from perfect order this deviation is shows itself by broadening of the peaks of the spectrum function cka and by range limited periodicity of the realspace autocorrelation function c a x these two measure of disorder are naturally related the disorder in lateral dot size size and spacing spacing are related to each other and to the broadening of the peaks in cka fig 6a and c prior to ripening the size and spatial order should be related as the volume of a dot should be proportional to the amount of nearby material if the saqds have nearly uniform size and spacing peaktopeak distance l0 the reciprocal space autocorrelation function will be tightly clustered around the wavenumber characterizing the dot spacing k0 2l0 there are a number of such peaks depending on the system symmetry fig 6a and c but consider just one since the order is not perfect the peak will have a finite width consequently there will be a scatter in the dot size since l0 2k0 the scatter in dot spacing spacing is related to the scatter in fourier components k taking the derivative of the spacingwavenumber relation and rearranging spacing it is reasonable to expect that the fractional disorder in size size lsize is given by a similar if not exactly the same number another way to view spatial order periodicity is not by dotdot distances but the distance over which the dot array can be considered periodic this limited periodicity is evident in the film height autocorrelation function eq 25 and figs 5b e and h consider two distant dots their position will be completely uncorrelated so it will be completely random as to whether one position corresponds to a peak or a valley thus for a large differences in position the autocorrelation function tends to zero c a xlarge 0 similarly the meansquare fluctuation of the film height can be large so that c a x 0 fl 0 the distance over which the autocorrelation function c a x decays to 0 is the correlation length lcor thus lcor is a reasonable measure of spatial order the two measures of order spacing and lcor are intrinsically linked the well known rule of fourier transforms states that the product of the realspace and reciprocal space widths must be greater than or equal to unity thus k lcor 1 or spacing 2l20 lcor similarly one can expect that size l2size lcor thus assuming that dot size is governed by the amount of nearby material small dispersions in dot size are only possible if there is long correlation length 313 ensemble correlation functions ergodicity saqds are seeded by random fluctuations consequently each experiment or simulation must be treated as just one possible realization and the autocorrelation function will be different for each realization thus for analytic 4 eq 29 has been used to help with summation predictions one must rely on ensemble averages in 24 it was assumed that the ensemble average correlation function was a good description of a saqd order an assumption that was born out by numerical calculations now this relation is put on a more solid ground in particular it is found that the ensemble correlation functions provide good estimates of the auto correlation function and spectrum function produced by any particular realization first it is shown that the mean value of the filmheight fluctuation is zero then the method to calculate the ensembleaveraged autocorrelation function and spectrum function is presented additional mathematical details are presented in appendix 3 3131 mean fluctuation it is fairly straightforward to show that the ensemble mean filmheight fluctuation is zero the governing dynamics eq 12 is invariant upon the substitution hx t hx t thus assuming that one does not bias the initial conditions the mean fluctuations must be zero for all time hhx ti hhx ti 0 and hhk ti 0 this is a common situation and it is most appropriate to characterize the film height fluctuations using the twopoint correlation function or simply the correlation function 55 3132 correlation function the autocorrelation function can be estimated by its ensemble average furthermore this ensemble average is equivalent to the correlation function that can be easily calculated analytically these relations are first discussed for the realspace correlation functions and then their fourier transforms first the statistical properties of the autocorrelation function are discussed then the statistical properties of the spectrum function finally the method to the main results are reported here and details of derivations are reported in appendix e first it is noted that the autocorrelation function averaged over all realizations is equal to the ensemble correlation function c a x cx where cx hhxh0i where h i indicate an ensemble average eq 31 assumes that the model of filmgrowth is translationally invariant5 this relationship is fortunate in that it allows one to predict the typical autocorrelation function using analytic tools that apply only to ensemble averages second it is noted that as the area that is used to calculate the autocorrelation function becomes large the autocorrelation function tends towards it mean value c a x cx oa12 where oa12 indicates statistical fluctuations about the mean value that become smaller and smaller as the area in an experiment or the simulation area in a numerical experiment becomes larger these fluctuations or noise die out as a12 for example the autocorrelation functions in figs 5e and h are very close to the ensemble average autocorrelation functions figs 5f and h but have random fluctuations that are most visible far from the origin this property that averaging over a parameter such as position is equivalent to averaging over all realizations is known as ergodicity individual realizations are tightly distributed about a typical behavior this tight distribution lends credibility to the notion that one can have representative experiments or simulations unfortunately the demonstration of eq 32 in appendix e is not as general as one might like rigorously it applies when the fourier components of film height hk are independent and normally distributed however it is reasonable to conjecture that a relationship like eq 32 holds whenever the statistical distribution of film heights is suitably bounded as the boundedness of cka plays an important role in the derivations in reciprocal space one finds that the ensemblemean spectrum function is cka ck where ck is defined as the prefactor appearing in the reciprocalspace twopoint correlation function ckk hhk hk i ck d k k0 ck kk0 quick survey of literature will find that virtually all published continuum models of saqd formation are translationally invariant where eq 29 has been used this form for the twopoint correlation function in reciprocal space occurs if and only if the system is translationally invariant eq 33 is valuable because one can solve for ck analytically in the linear case or using various analytic approximations in the nonlinear case unlike the autocorrelation function the spectrum function fluctuates greatly about its mean in fact the fluctuations are about 100 appendix e2 these large fluctuations result in the commonly observed speckle pattern for the spectrum function cka figs 6a and c contrast this pattern with ensemblemean spectrum function ck shown in figs 6b and d these speckles can be removed by a smoothing operation and a relation similar to eq 32 results appendix e22 finally it should be noted that just as cka is the fourier transform of c a x ck is the fourier transform of cx appendix e1 stochastic initial conditions to model or simulate the formation of saqds it is absolutely essential to include some sort of stochastic effect an initially flat film hx 0 0 is in unstable equilibrium thus to seed the formation of quantum dots it is necessary to perturb the flat surface the simplest method to do this is to use stochastic initial conditions with deterministic evolution one can tenuously suppose that white noise initial conditions do not bias the ultimate evolution of the film 57 thus the initial conditions are taken from an ensemble with zero mean hhx 0i 0 cx x0 0 hhx 0hx0 0 i 2 d x x0 and a spatial correlation function where the brackets h i indicate an ensemble average is the noise amplitude and d x is the ddimensional dirac delta function white noise conditions have an infinite amplitude which is not physical thus a minimum modification can be made to cut off the infinite fluctuations 0 2 exp cx x0 0 2b20 2b20 d2 in the limit

but the cutoff procedure ispuseful for choosing a reasonable value of 2 it seems reasonable to choose 2 so that the initial rms fluctuation c0 0 hh0 0h0 0 i is one monolayer 1 ml also choosing b0 1 ml as the atomic scale cutoff is 2 2d2 1 ml2d where the natural unit 1 ml is of course material dependent using stochastic initial conditions one can integrate individual initial conditions to obtain representative samples and then average over many realizations the monte carlo approach or one can calculate analytically the statistical measures of the ensemble the ensemble statistical measures are strongly related to the statistical measures of order for an individual realization so the second approach is opted for here thus the predicted saqd order is ultimately stated in terms of ensemble correlation functions reciprocal space correlation functions the reciprocal space correlation function ckk0 and spectrum function ck are calculated for the 1d and 2d isotropic case and then for the 2d

of c a x solid line iscx eq 46 loosely speaking one can argue that the isotropic case is similar to letting a 0 in eq 45 so that the perpendicular correlation length is always 0 regardless of time a more conservative approach would be to argue that l 2k0 for the isotropic model via inspection of figs 6a and b even still the more conservative result guarantees that the perpendicular correlation length will always be the same as the dot spacing thus it will always limit saqd order to the first nearest neighbor at best real space correlation functions the real space correlation functions cx

expand about the peaks to generate the peak values n and local hessian matrix ki kj kkn the spectrum function is then approximately ck t 2 x 2n t exp 22 n1 4 find the eigenvalues of the local hessian

order predictions the realspace correlation function formulas eqs 46 47 and 50 and correlation length formulas eqs 41 44 and 45 can now be used to estimate the order of saqds ge on si is chosen for this example because this system has received the most attention from theoretical work 58 38 31 18 39 41 27 25 26 and others and it is the simplest since it involves the diffusion of a single species the procedure described below tries to predict the amount of order when an initial atomicscale fluctuation becomes large large is taken to be greater than atomicscale beyond this point one would expect nonlinear terms to become important an example is presented for ge on si at 600k to compare and contrast the 2d anisotropic results with the 1d isotropic and 2d isotropic results the predictions are also compared with a linear numerical calculation on a discrete reciprocalspace grid to test the approximations made and to illustrate the relation between the surface profile hx the example autocorrelation functions c a x and cka and the ensemble correlation functions cx and ck figs 6 7 and 5 show these results finally the relation between average film height and order is investigated ge at 600k the formulations for the three discussed cases are implemented for gesi at 600k the correlation lengths are estimated for the end of the linear regime where fluctuations become large greater than atomic scale first appropriate physical constants are used to give the corresponding correlation length and correlation functions vs time these include an initial average film

vs for sige using the 2d anisotropic model as described in sec 4 units are normalize to characteristic time tc and predicted number of correlated dots n k0 l discussionconclusions the order of epitaxial selfassembled quantum dots during initial stages of growth has been studied using a common model of surface diffusion with stochastic initial conditions it has been shown that correlation functions of small surface height fluctuations can be predicted analytically using corresponding ensemble average correlation functions these correlation functions are characterized by correlation lengths that can be predicted by analytic formulas given certain reasonable assumptions about the diffusion potential and the height and lateral scale of initial atomic scale random fluctuations thus the linear model of film surface height evolution via surface diffusion has enabled analytic predictions of epitaxial saqd order that are valid for small film height fluctuations to what extent the initial degree of order persists into later stages of growth remains to be studied but the order of initial stages should certainly have a strong influence on final outcomes furthermore the linear analysis should provide insight into the less tractable nonlinear behavior these predictions of saqd order have been used to investigate the role of crystal anisotropy and initial film height crystal anisotropy has been shown to play an important role in enhancing saqd order as observed in previous numerical simulations continuum and atomistic numerical simulations 43 37 44 45 if a fourfold symmetry is assumed for the governing dynamics the effect of crystal anisotropy to linear order is felt through elastic anisotropy alone it is shown that elastic anisotropy is required to produce a latticelike structure of saqds the enhanced spatial order should in turn lead to enhanced size order a consequence that must be confirmed with nonlinear studies but appears to be true based on the present available literature the role of initial film height has been shown to greatly influence order growth near the critical film height for dot formation can enhance order this order enhancement comes from increasing the duration of the linear smallfluctuation stage of growth in fact the predicted correlation lengths diverge when the initial film height approaches the critical film height from above achieving large correlation lengths in this manor is of course practically limited by ability to control film heights to subatomic accuracy additionally one should be careful when interpreting the continuum model in such a context as the effect of atomic discreteness might be greater at the transition film height finally it is likely that additional randomizing effects of thermal activation will effectively cut off this divergence when the critical film height is approached from below during deposition finally the presented method may be useful as a first step in the analysis of methods to enhance saqd order it is reasonable to suppose that under some circumstances initial growth stages will be very important while for others they will not for example prior work on vertical stacking appears to confirm the presented ordering mechanism 44 vertical stacking not only achieves vertical correlation of dots but each layer is more ordered horizontally than the one below additionally a growth window was found whereby to achieve enhanced order the evolution of each layer be terminated before ripening begins the reported simulation 44 supports the following scenario for saqd order development order is enhanced during the small fluctuation stage as described here once the fluctuations are sufficiently large the seeded dots evolve towards their equilibrium shapes finally the dots begin to ripen and order diminishes order is transfered via strain to the next layer so that the next layer gets a head start on its initial ordering thus the multiple layers of dots effectively draws out the linear growth stage it may be possible to modify the present model to predict the correlation length of each saqd layer diffusion potential the diffusion potential is calculated in terms of the film height h that is a function of the in plane coordinates x xi yj the elastic and surface energy portions of the diffusion potential can be found in 15 elast x x and surf

general form fsw h h they are deferred to appendix b2 one finds that wetlink w 20 k w02 k m n where w mn h h w h hhhh0 is the mth and nth derivative of the wetting energy density with respect to h and h evaluated for a perfectly flat film of height h w mn is a tensor of rank n b11 isotropic case in the isotropic case 00 00 where is the identity operator and 00 is a scalar similarly w02 w 02 one thus gets for the combined surface and wetting parts of the diffusion potential swlink 00 w 02 k 2 w 20 hk thus in the isotropic case the linear order effect of introducing a surface orientation to either the surface energy or the wetting potential is simply to change the apparent surface energy density by 00 w 02 b12 anisotropic case the surface and wetting parts of the diffusion potential eqs 55 and 56 can admit only a limited anisotropy they both contain rank 2 symmetric tensors 00 and w02 in the xplane for a twodimensional surface this means that they can either have twofoldsymmetric rotations by 180 anisotropy or none at all thus for the case considered in sec 2212 fourfoldsymmetric anisotropy the surface and wetting parts of the diffusion potential must be completely isotropic as discussed in sec 2212 the 100 surface of zincblend structures such as the mentioned ge si inas and gaas present a rather complicated situation for simplicity it is assumed here that the surface and wetting energies are at least fourfold symmetric consequently they are completely isotropic finally it should be noted that if fsw depends on higher order derivatives then the discussion is greatly complicated and a larger class of anisotropic terms is admissible for example when fsw fsw h h h h is expanded about hx h to quadratic order in h it would contains tensors of rank 6 and maybe even higher linearizing the general model the elastic part of the linearized diffusion potential was discussed in sec 2211 and appendix c eq 56 can be found by using all of the following steps with the substitution fsw w the surfacewetting part of the diffusion potential x is found by expanding fsw to second order in the filmheight fluctuation h and then taking the variational derivative expanding fsw about h 0 and h 0 fsw h h h  fsw  fsw h f01 sw h hfsw h 1 20 2 1 02 h fsw hh oh3  fsw note that in this expansion all the fsw terms are constant with respect to h and depend implicitly on the average film height h the first index indicates the mth derivative with respect to h the second index indicates the nth derivative with respect to h the derivatives are evaluated for a perfectly flat surface of height h thus m n fsw h fsw h hhh h0 since r d h is a vector in the xplane fsw is1 a tensor of rank n taking the variational derivative of fsw d x fsw h h and keeping terms to order h  fsw  f01 note that the fsw term vanishes because it is constant and the fsw term vanishes upon simplification additionally the fsw can be neglected if one r enforces the condition that the filmheight fluctuations do not add or subtract material from the surface namely that dd x hx t 0 alternatively one can discard it in anticipation of taking the gradient of the diffusion potential since it is a constant the term fsw 0 for the same reasons or because fsw is a constant multiplying through by the atomic volume lin x fsw h f02 sw h b21 isotropic case in the isotropic case fsw must be proportional to the identity so that fsw fsw thus 02 2 swlin x fsw hx fsw  hx taking the inverse fourier transform of this equation 02 2 swlink fsw  fsw k hk this gives case b in eq 9 b22 anisotropic case if the surface is anisotropic then fsw in eq 57 is a rank 2 symmetric tensor in the xplane thus it can have two distinct eigenvalues and automatically has 2fold rotational symmetry rotations by 180 if any other symmetry is assumed such as 4fold symmetry rotations by 90 then fsw must be fully isotropic taking the inverse fourier transform swlink fsw  k f02 sw k hk in eq 23 case b it is assumed that there is fourfold symmetry resulting in a surfacewetting part of the diffusion potential that is completely isotropic elastic anisotropy in principal the anisotropic elastic energy k is found in the same fashion as the isotropic elastic energy 15 the flat film initially in a state of biaxial stress is perturbed by a small periodic surface fluctuation of amplitude h0 an appropriate elastic field is added to satisfy the perturbed tractionfree boundary condition at the free surface finally the elastic energy is evaluated at the free surface to first order in h0 the coefficient h0 is the sought after k the equations themselves are cumbersome and best solved using a numeric implementation so an abstract procedure for calculating k is outlined here k is found for k 1 but arbitrary k let the surface have a height variation hx h0 eikx to first order in h0 the surface normal is nx ikh0 eikx i k the elastic energy needs to be calculated to first order in h0 to find the elastic energy it is necessary to find the perturbing elastic field to first order in h0 the initial unperturbed stress state is m 0 0 m 0 m 0 0 0 where m c11 c12 2c212 c11 m note that this stress state is isotropic in the x yplane and thus independent of rotations about the vertical axis under this stress state a flat surface is tractionfree with the height perturbation the traction is tj n m j ikh0 m m j1 eikx next to find the perturbing elastic fields these are not isotropic in the x yplane and it is necessary to take into account the angle first the 3 3 3 3 elastic stiffness tensor cijkl is constructed for the cube orientation from the compact 9 9 matrix cij the tensor representation aids in rotation the stiffness tensor is then passively rotated in the x yplane by an angel k cijkl k rk im rk jn rk kp rk lq cmnpq mnpq1 where cosk rk sink sink cosk this passive rotation of cijkl is equivalent to actively rotating the wave vector k ki by k the appropriate form for the perturbing displacement field is found assume a displacement of the form ui x y z ui ekixz where can have a complex value the elastic equilibrium equations are ikl1 cijkl k ul 0 j 1 3 cjl k ul k 2 ekixz 0 where cjl k cijkl k ii1 i3 ik1 k3 ik1 factoring out k 2 ekixz the part in parenthesis must be identically zero to obtain a nontrivial solution the determinant of cjl k to zero six complex values of are found the values of with re 0 are discarded since the corresponding displacements blow up as z each of the remaining values p with p 1 3 is substituted back into cjl k and eq 59 is solved to find the corresponding eigenvectors ulp the total displacement is thus ul x y z im h0 ap ulp ekix where it is assumed that the perturbing elastic displacement field is proportional to h0 and m and the factor of i is put in for convenience the coefficients ap can be found from the tractionfree boundary condition at the free surface the traction formula is ikl1 ni cijkl k ul x y z ikm h0 ni cijkl k ap ulp ik1 p k3 ekix iklp1 the traction is already proportional to h0 thus all terms in the sum must be kept to zeroth order in h0 so that hx 0 and nx k thus plugging z 0 to eq 60 tj ikm h0 3 x ic3j1l k p c3j3l k ap ulp eikx p1 l1 since the total traction eqs 58 and 61 must be zero the coefficients ap are found from kjp ap rj where kjp ic3j1l k p c3j3l k ulp and rj m j1 for j 1 3 it is worth noting that only for the symmetry directions k 0 and k 45 is the strain purely planestrain as it is for the elastically isotropic case the elastic energy at the film surface is found to order

where ap and are implicitly functions of k this procedure has been used to find the values of e0 and e45 for table 2 and sec 4 diffusional anisotropy in general the surface diffusivity can depend on the film height hx and the surface orientation hx so that the surface current is js x dhx hx sx where s is the surface gradient and d is a rank 2 tensor in the twodimensional space tangent to the film surface at x linearizing the surface current about a flat surface js x dh lin x where the diffusivity must be evaluated for h 0 and h 0 since lin x is already proportional to hx the linearized diffusivity is a symmetric rank 2 tensor in the xplane thus it is similar to fsw discussed in appendix b22 it is automatically either twofold symmetry rotations by 180 or it is completely isotropic in eq 23 fourfold symmetry of the surface is assumed thus the diffusivity must be completely isotropic d d a scalar section 2212 and appendix b22 contain discussions of the symmetry properties of the various rank 2 tensors that appear in the linear evolution equations a limited case of diffusional anisotropy has been modeled via kinetic monte carlo technique 54 correlation functions mean values equations 31 and 33 are central to the presented analysis here they are derived the twopoint correlation functions for a stochastic system are introduced then the average of the autocorrelation function is taken and expressed in terms of the twopoint correlation functions finally this average is simplified using the translational invariance of the system governing equations and ensemble of initial conditions the twopoint realspace space correlation function is cx x0 hhxhx0 i and the reciprocal space correlation function is ckk0 hhk hk0 i these are related by the double fourier transform r d d 0 ikxik0 x0 d xd x e cx x0 ckk0 2 cx x0 dd kdd k0 eikxik x ckk0 these ensemble correlation functions can be used to give the ensemblemean autocorrelation function and spectrum function in real space c a x d2 x0 hhx x0 hx0 i d2 x0 cx x0 x0 hhk hk i ckk fortunately the translational invariance of the system simplifies these relations inspecting the governing equations and invoking the translational invariance of the stochastic initial conditions the resulting ensemble and its statistical measures must also be translationally invariant thus under the translation by x0 cka cx x0 x0 cx 0 cx so that the independent variable is reduced to just the difference vector x x x0 this relation can be used to simplify both the real and reciprocal space relations the real space relation simplifies as followsinserting eq 66 into eq 64 c a x d2 x0 cx 0 cx the reciprocal space relation eq 62 simplifies to ckk0 ck 2 k k0 ck where ck kk0 d2 x eikx cx one can see immediately from eq 67 that ck is the fourier transform of c a x cx or one can plug eq 68 into eq 65 to get cka ck variance and convergence the ergodic hypothesis is that an average with respect to a parameter such as position or time tends towards an ensemble average in this case cka cka ck and c x c x cx when the surface area is very large the ensemble average is a good substitute if the variance about the average vanishes as the substrate area a becomes large it is found that in reciprocal space 2 e varcka cka  cka ck2 thus the ergodic hypothesis does not hold for cka in practice cka is a speckled version of ck fig 6 however if one smooths cka by averaging over a small patch in reciprocal space of size ksmooth 1s so that cka s d2 z dd k0 e 2 s k k cka0 then var cka s diminishes as 1a for sufficiently large s cka s ck and  d2 ds 2 ck var cka s thus the ergodic hypothesis eq 69 only holds for a smoothed version of cka in real space 2 e var c a x c a x  c a x dd k e2ikx ck2 ck2 where the integral is bounded finite provided that either t 0 or the atomic scale cutoff b0 0 thus the ergodic hypothesis holds for the real space autocorrelation function e21 eq 70 first cka cka0 is calculated cka cka0 hhk hk hk0 hk0 i assume that he distribution of hk is gaussian also assume that hx is real so that hk hk hk then ck1 ck2 d k1 k4 d k2 k3 ck1 ck2 d k1 k3 d k2 k4 ck1 ck3 d k1 k2 d k3 k4 hk1

71 the mean value is cka s d2 z d2 z dd k0 e 2 s k k cka0 dd k0 e 2 s k k ck0 for sufficiently small ksmooth sufficiently large s eq 72 results 2 e the variance of cka s is now calculated first it is necessary to calculate cka s cka s 2 e d z dd k0 e 2 s k k dd k00 e 2 s k cka0 cka00 using eq 75 and eq 29 as needed 2 e cka s 2 o  ck2 d k0 k00 ck2 d k0 k00 ck ck0 d 0 dd k0 es k k ck20 e 2 s k k k k

thus s i a finite value that decreases as a1 as required for the ergodic hypothesis to hold for sufficiently small ksmooth large s i 2s d2 ck2 and eq 73 results it should also be noted that the large s required for this approximation also creates a more stringent requirement that a be large varcka s e23 eq 74 now consider the real space autocorrelation function first c a xc a x is needed c a xc a x dd kdd k0 eikk x cka cka0 proceeding in a fashion similar to the previous section making use of eqs 75 and 29 as needed c xc x 22d dd kdd k0 eikk x ck2 d k k0  ck2 d k k0 ck ck0 d 0 dd k e2ikx ck2 ck2 ikx d 0 ik0 x d ke d k e dd k e2ikx ck2 ck2 c a x thus eq 74 results for the variance to be vanishing the integral in eq 74 must be bounded finite if time t 0 the exponential in eq 77 guarantees that the integral is bounded for time t 0 the integral is only bounded if the atomic scale cutoff b0 0 atomic scale cutoff starting from eq 39 ck 2 2k t 1 b20 k2 the effect of the small scale cutoff is both small and shortlived as it only works to suppress fluctuations with large wavenumbers the most important fluctuations have wavenumbers between 0 and 2kc thus the typical size of the cutoff term is about b20 kc2 if a typical dot size or spacing size 10 nm and a typical atomic scale is 101 nm a typical value for this term is about 103 102 to calculate the effect of the cutoff it can absorbed into the timedependent part with the substitution bb 1 0 4bdt so that its effect lasts only as long as a perturbation with atomic scale curvature b0 thus eq 40 is a good approximation
