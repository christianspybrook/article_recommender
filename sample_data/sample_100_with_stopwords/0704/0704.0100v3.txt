arxiv07040100v3 grqc 31 oct 2007 april 1 2007 abstract the topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the morse theory the elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment it has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution i there are n kinds of handle attachments in n 1dimensional black hole spacetimes ii handles are further classified as either of black or white type and only black handles appear in real black hole spacetimes iii the spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected as a corollary it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an s n2 s 1 horizon from that with an s n1 horizon must be nonaxisymmetric in asymptotically flat spacetimes 1 introduction black holes in spacetimes of greater than or equal to five dimensions have rich topological structure according to the wellknown results of hawking concerning the topology of black holes in fourdimensional spacetime the apparent horizon or the spatial section of the stationary event horizon is necessarily diffeomorphic to a 2sphere 1 2 this follows from the fact that the total curvature which is the integral of the intrinsic scalar curvature over the horizon is positive under the dominant energy condition and from the gaussbonnet theorem alternative and improved proofs of hawkings theorem have been given by several authors 3 4 5 6 however in higher dimensional spacetimes an apparent horizon or the spatial section of the stationary event horizon may not be a topological sphere 7 8 9 10 because the gaussbonnet theorem does not hold in such cases nevertheless the positivity of the total curvature of the horizon still holds this puts certain topological restrictions on the black hole topology though they are rather weak for example the apparent horizon in fivedimensional spacetime can consist of finitely many connected sums of copies of s 3 and copies of s 2 s 1 in fact exact solutions representing a black hole spacetime possessing a horizon of nonspherical topology have recently been found in fivedimensional general relativity when such black holes with nontrivial topologies are regarded as being formed in the course of gravitational collapse questions regarding the evolution of the topology of black holes naturally arise our purpose here is to understand the time evolution of the topology of event horizons in a general setting the relation between the crease set where the event horizon is nondifferentiable and the topology of the event horizon is studied in refs 11 12 13 for fourdimensional spacetimes in the present work we carry out a systematic investigation and find useful rules to determine admissible processes of topological evolution for time slicing of a black hole our approach is to utilize the morse theory 14 15 in differential topology the morse theory is useful for the purpose of understanding the topology of smooth manifolds the basic tool used in this approach is a smooth function on a differentiable manifold the event horizon however is not a differentiable manifold but has a wedgelike structure at the past endpoints of the null geodesic generators of the horizon for this reason we first smooth the wedge then the smooth time function which is assumed to exist plays the role of the morse function on the smoothed event horizon according to the morse theory the topological evolution of the event horizon can then be decomposed into elementary processes called handle attachments in such a process starting with a spherical horizon one adds several handles each characterized by the index of the critical points of the morse function which is an integer ranging from 0 to n the dimension of the smoothed horizon as a differentiable manifold the purpose of the present article is to show that there are several constraints on the handle attachments for real black hole spacetimes 2 the morse theory for event horizons let m be an n 1dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime we require the existence of a global time function t m r that is smooth and has an everywhere timelike and futurepointing gradient the event horizon h is defined as the boundary of the causal past of the future null infinity h j i 2 we treat the event horizon defined with respect to a single asymptotic end unless otherwise stated in other words the future null infinity i is assumed to be connected the black hole region b is defined as the interior region of h specifically as b m j i and the exterior region e of the black hole region is its complement e intj i we refer to the intersection of the black hole region and the time slice t0 t t0 as the black hole bt0 b t0 at time t t0 the exterior region at time t t0 is accordingly written e t0 e t0 one of most basic properties of the event horizon is that it is generated by null geodesics without future endpoints in general the event horizon is not smoothly imbedded into the spacetime manifold m but it has a wedgelike structure at the past endpoints of the null geodesic generators where distinct null geodesic generators intersect we call the set of past endpoints of null geodesic generators of h from which two or more null geodesic generators emanate the crease set s 11 12 when no crease set s exists between the time slices t t1 and t t2 the null geodesic generators of h naturally define a diffeomorphism bt1 bt2 hence the topological evolution of a black hole can take place only when the time slice intersects the crease set s of course the event horizon itself is a gaugeindependent object nevertheless we often understand the dynamics of spacetime by scanning it along time slices thus the topological evolution of a black hole depends on the time function it is expected that morse theory 14 provides useful techniques to analyze such a process of topological evolution because the morse theory is concerned with functions on smooth manifolds we first regularize h around the crease set s the event horizon is not necessarily smooth even on h s in the case that the future null infinity i has a pathological structure 16 here it is assumed that h is smooth on h s then small deformations of h near the crease set s will make e 0 remains deformed in such a manner e in m while bt h a smooth hypersurface h that bt0 h t0 holds and bt0 remains homeomorphic to the original black hole for all t0 r this deformation is assumed to be such that the time vkog v v figure 1 an example in which no smoothing procedure makes e here the intersection of the crease set the a morse function on h s of the event horizon and t t0 hypersurface has an accumulation point e gives a morse function on h e that function the which is the restriction of t on h has only nondegenerate critical points where the gradient of the defined on h becomes zero and where also the hessian matrix i j the of the is nondegenerate though this assumption should hold for a wide class of systems it does not always hold figure 1 gives an example for which no smoothing procedure makes the e because the intersection of the induced time function the a morse function on h crease set s of the event horizon and the t t0 hypersurface has an accumulation point it is highly nontrivial to determine whether such a smoothing procedure is generically possible it is however not easy nor the primary purpose of this article to assertain the realm of validity of the assumption and therefore we make this assumption without inquiring into its validity according to the morse lemma there is a local coordinate system x1 xn e in the neighborhood of the critical point p h e such that the restriction t e on h e takes the form of the time function t on h the x1 xn tp x1 2 x 2 x1 2 xn 2 the integer ranging from 0 to n is called the index of the critical point p the topology of the black hole bt changes when t pass through critical points or equivalently when the time function t takes critical values this implies that critical points appears only near the crease set s the gradientlike vector field for the is defined to be the tangent vector field x e such that xt e 0 holds on h e except for critical points and has the form on h  2x 2x1 1 2xn n near the critical point of index in terms of the standard coordinate system appearing in the morse lemma we choose a gradientlike vector field x such that it coincides with the futuredirected tangent vector field of null geodesic generators of h except in a small neighborhood of the crease set s fig 2 the effect of a critical point p of index is equivalent to the attachment of a handle 14 15 the handlebody is just a topological ndisk dn i n i 0 1 but it is regarded as the product space dn d dn fig 3 the handle attachment to an ndimensional manifold n with a boundary consists of the set h d dn f where the attaching map f induces the imbedding of d dn dn into n fig 4 the new manifold obtained through the handle attachment to n is x 2x1 vkog figure 2 the smoothing procedure of the event horizon h the e can be constructed through a slight gradientlike vector field on h deformation of the null geodesic generators of h here the effect of the crease set s has been replaced by that of the critical points p1 p2 and p3 figure 3 the local structure around the critical point p of index e tp is homeomorphic to h e tp with a  it can be seen that h handle attached given by n h n d dn x f x x d dn e then h e tp 0 just above the e t0 the t t0 part of h let us denote by h critical point p of index is homeomorphic in fact diffeomorphic taking account e tp attached with a handle of the smoothing procedure to that just below p h e tp h e tp h if there are no other critical points satisfying tp t tp the handlebody itself is denoted by h as well let us consider several examples the 0handle attachment does not need an attaching map f it simply corresponds to the emergence of the n 1sphere s n1 dn as a black hole horizon bt a typical example is the creation of a black hole fig 5 a black hole always emerges as 0handle attachment the other 07j7j figure 4 the attachment of a 1handle and a 2handle to a 3manifold n creates a new 3manifold n h1 h2 vkog figure 5 the emergence of a black hole through a 0handle attachment vkog figure 6 the emergence of a bubble in the black hole region by 0handle attachment which does not occur in the real black hole spacetimes vkog figure 7 the collision of a pair of black holes creating a single black hole is realized through 1handle attachment possiblity is the creation of a bubble that is subset of j i in a black hole region fig 6 one might think that this corresponds to wormhole creation between the internal and external regions of the event horizon although in the framework of the e these two examples are indistinguishable we below standard morse theory on h see that the latter process is in fact impossible next we consider 1handle attachment a typical example is the collision of two black holes a 1handle serves as a bridge connecting black holes or it corresponds to taking the connected sum of each component of multiple black holes fig 7 vkog figure 8 the bifurcation of one black hole into two is represeted by an n 1handle attachment this however never occurs in real black hole spacetimes eqeqtg eqtg figure 9 the structure of handle the core d 0 corresponds to the stable submanifold with respect to the flow generated by the gradientlike vector field and the cocore 0 dn corresponds to the unstable submanifold the time reversal of the collision of black holes consists of the bifurcation of one black hole into two this would be realized through an n 1handle attachment if such a process were possible fig 8 it is however well known that such a process is forbidden 2 in general the time reversal of the handle attachment corresponds to n handle attachment before discussing general cases let us consider the structure of a handlebody recall that a handle consists of the product space d dn the subset d 0 d dn is called the core of the handlebody and 0 dn d dn is called the cocore the core and cocore intersect transversely at a point this point can be regarded as a critical point p let us refer to the subset ws p of h ws p q m lim expq tx p which consists of points that converge to p along the flow generated by the gradientlike vector field x as the stable manifold with respect to the critical point p the stable manifold ws p is homeomorphic to r if the index of p is given by 17 e consisting of points which converge similarly let us refer to the subset wu p h to p along the flow generated by x as the unstable manifold with respect to p for the unstable manifold wu p rn holds the portions of the stable and unstable manifolds in the handlebody can be regarded as corresponding to the core and cocore respectively e is to deform the null vector field the effect of smoothing the event horizon h to h generating h into a gradientlike vector field x the primary difference between the null geodesic generators and the flow generated by x is that the former does not have future endpoints but the latter can thus there are admissible and inadmissible processes for the smoothed manifold h an admissible process is e which is obtained from an in priciple realizable event horizon while an given by h inadmissible one is constructed from a spurious event horizon ie one that consists of the null hypersurface containing null geodesic generators with a future endpoint 3 the structure of the critical points the spatial topology of a black hole changes only when the time function takes a critical value the time evolution of the black hole topology can be understood by considering its local structure around critical points to determine whether a given topological change is admissible or inadmissible it is not sufficient to consider only the intrinsic structure of the event horizon rather it is required to take account of its imbedding structure relative to the spacetime e belongs to either of the black hole in a time slice any point separate from h or the exterior of the black hole region it is useful to consider the local behavior of the black hole region or the exterior region near the critical point p let us call the exterior e of the black hole region simply the exterior region for brevity the exterior region is slightly deformed by the smoothing procedure the deformed exterior region is denoted by ee and the deformed exterior region at the time t by eet ee t t bt the 0handle is placed at some t tp such an attachment describes the emergence of the black hole region at the critical point p and its expansion with time the emergence of a bubble which consists of a part of j i in the background of the black hole region would also be described by a 0handle attachment this however never occurs as we explain below in detail hence a 0handle attachment always describes the creation of a black hole homeomorphic to the ndisk an nhandle attachment corresponds to the time reversal of a 0handle attachement this process however never occurs in real black hole spacetime an nhandle is defined for t tp which means that it terminates at the critical point p the crease set is isolated into critical points during the course of the smoothing procedure the gradientlike vector field which can be regarded as being tangent e may have several inward conto the generator of the deformed event horizon h verging directions at the critical point due to this smoothing procedure while the original null generator of the event horizon does not have an inward direction at the crease set in the case of the nhandle all the directions become inward at the critical point this implies that the null generators of the event horizon h must have future endpoints at the critical point which is of course impossible it is thus seen that an nhandle attachment never occurs in real black hole spacetimes the remaining cases are handle attachments for 1 n 1 in these cases the handle lies on either side of the critical point p both in the future t tp and in the past t tp then we consider the case in which the handle exists during the sufficiently small time interval t tp tp 0 to understand the topological change of the black hole region at the critical point p figure 10 the neighborhood u of p is separated by h into the future region u and the past region u first we introduce a coordinate system t xi i 1 n in the neighborhood u of p where t is a given function of time and xi is the extension over u of the cannonical coordinate appearing in the morse lemma such that each curve x1 xn const is timelike p in u we assume that u is the solid cylinder given by t tp tp xi 2 in this coordinate system the handle h is given by the saddle surface t tp x1 2 x 2 x1 2 xn 2 in u which is an acausal set if the constant is taken sufficiently small since h is tangent to the spacelike hypersurface t tp at p therefore h separates u into two open subsets the future and past regions u and u of u where u and u are the subsets lying chronological future and past respectively of h u i h u explicitly the future and past regions u are the regions satisfying t tp x1 2 x 2 x1 2 xn 2 in u respectively fig 10 e one of u is because the handle is a subset of the black hole boundary h e and the other in the exterior region ee contained in the black hole region b however the future region u of u is always included in the black hole region ie e and hence we have u ee since the horizon is the boundary of the past u b set j i therefore the black hole region btp  u in u at the time t tp just before the critical time is given by x1 2 x 2 x1 2 xn 2 which is homotopic to the 1sphere s 1 for 1 s 0 simply consists of two points similarly btp  u just after the critical time is given by x1 2 x 2 x1 2 xn 2 which is homotopic to the ndisk in this way the black hole region restricted to the small neighborhood of the critical point p is initially homotopic to a sphere then the internal region of the sphere is filled up at the critical time t tp and eventually becomes homotopically trivial the exterior region eet u in u is initially homotopic to an ndisk for t tp then its n dimensional direction is penetrated by the black hole region at t tp and thus it becomes homotopic to an n 1sphere s n1 for t tp if the spurious event horizon is also taken into account the future region u might be a subset of ee and e then the black hole region in therefore the past region u might be a subset of b the handle might be homotopic to an ndisk initially and become homotopic to an n 1sphere finally and vice versa for the exterior region let us refer to such e u from a region homotopic to a a topological change of the black hole region bt sphere to a region homotopic to a disk as a black handle attachment and that from a region homotopic to a disk to a region homotopic to the sphere as a white handle attachment the above observation shows that only a black handle attachment occurs if a sufficiently small neighborhood of the critical point is considered for example a collision of black holes corresponds to a black 1handle attachment while the bifurcation of a black hole corresponds to a white n 1handle attachment in the sense that the homotopy type of the exterior region eet u changes from that of s n2 to that of dn this local argument also elucidates te reason that a black hole collision is admissible while a black hole bifurcation which is its time reversal is inadmissible we also note that the effect of time reversal is to convert a black handle attachment into a white n handle attachment it is appropriate to refer to the 0handle attachment corresponding to the creation of a black hole as a black 0handle attachment then the proposition above also applies to a 0handle attachment 4 connectedness of the exterior region there also exist processes that are unrealizable due to global conditions let us for a moment consider the event horizon in maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime though we are interested in the event horizon defined with respect to a specific asymptotic end for the purpose of explanation we examine the event horizon defined with respect to a pair of asymptotic ends in schwarzschild spacetime fig 11 let i1 and i2 be the pair of future null infinities of the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime the event horizon here is defined by h j i1 i2 which is nondifferentiable at the bifurcate horizon f j i1 j i2 let t be a global time function and be a global radial coordinate function such that each twosurface t const is invariant under the so3 isometry these coordinates are chosen such that the bifurcation surface f is located at t 0 and the event horizon h is determined by t around f the smoothed event e is also taken to be invariant under the so3 isometry due to the horizon h symmetry of the configuration the time function t has critical points of degenerate type in fact any point on bifurcate horizon f is critical here we are not interested in such a nongeneric situation instead we consider a slightly different time slicing determined by the new time function where 0 is a sufficiently small positive constant and which satisfies 0 is the usual polar coordinate of the 2sphere then there appears only a pair of isolated critical points at the north pole 0 and the south pole on the bifurcate horizon f and the time function t becomes the morse function on e at the time t 0 the black hole appears at the north pole this is the 0handle attachment the black hole formed there grows into a geometrically thick spherical shell with a hole at the south pole which is nevertheless a topological 3disk at the time t the puncture at the south pole is filled and the black e splits hole region becomes topologically s 2 0 1 the deformed event horizon h into a disjoint union of a pair of 2spheres this is the 2handle attachment this kind of 2handle attachment occurs because the event horizon is defined with respect to the two asymptotic ends which is in general inadmissible if the future null infinity is connected as we assume from this point to understand the above statement it should be noted that there is no process through which the several connected components of the exterior region eet ee t at time t merge together at a later time because such a handle attachment is not admissible it is also seen that no connected component of eet disappears because possible nhandle attachments are inadmissible these facts imply that the number of connected components of the exterior region eet cannot decrease with the time function t on the other hand there is only one connected component of the exterior region eet for sufficiently large t because of the connectedness of i this observation shows that the exterior region eet remains connected in any process the only possible process through which the number of connected components of the exterior region eet changes is an n 1handle attachment as constructed above in the schwarzschild spacetime this is because the subset d dn of t t sin2 111 b tp t t p figure 11 the figure on the left is a conformal diagram of the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime the structure of the event horizon defined with respect to the two asymptotic ends is depicted on the right with one dimension omitted the shaded region represents the black hole region at the critical time t tp this corresponds to the 2handle attachment where the exterior region is separated into a pair of connected components the boundary of the handle h d dn d dn namely the part of h which is the complement of the preimage of the attaching map f h d dn h is disconnected only when n 1 in this case the homotopy type of the exterior region eet changes from that of an ndisk to that of s 0 namely two points note however that this does not imply that the exterior region eet is always separated into two disconnected parts through the n 1handle attachment for example a transition from the black ring horizon s n2 s 1 to the spherical black hole horizon s n1 is realized through a black n 1handle attachment which pinches the longitude a point s 1 s n2 s 1 into a point the exterior region eet remains connected all the while thus there are both admissible and inadmissible processes for n1handle attachments an n1handle attachment is inadmissible if it separates the exterior region eet 5 concluding remarks the arguments given in this paper are summerized by the following rules assume that i an n 1dimensional spacetime m is asymptotically flat and the future null infinity i is connected or the event horizon h j i is defined with respect to a single asymptotic end ii the spacetime m admits a smooth global time function t iii the event horizon h can be deformed so that the black e deformed accordingly at each time t is smooth and homeomorphic to orighole bt inal one bt at each time t and the time function t becomes the morse function e then the topological evolution of the event horizon can be regarded as a on h handle attachment 0 n subject to the following rules 1 the nhandle attachment is inadmissible 2 only the black handle attachment 0 n 1 where the black hole region in the neighborhood of the critical point varies from the region homotopic to the sphere s 1 regarded as the empty set for 0 to the ndisk dn is admissible 3 the n 1handle attachment which separates the spatial section of the exterior region of the black hole is inadmissible the first rule simply states that no connected component of a black hole disappears it also implies that if a bubble of the exterior region forms within the black hole region it does not vanish the second rule is concerned with the imbedding structure of the event horizon relative to the spacetime manifold the neighborhood of the critical point is separated into two regions by the event horizon one changes homotopically from a sphere to a disk and the other from a disk to a sphere we call it a black handle attachment when the former corresponds to the black hole region and a white handle attachment otherwise then the second rule states that a white handle attachment never occurs the reverse process in which a black hole region homotopically changes from a disk to a sphere is ruled out a white 0handle attachment which czkuoogvtkertqeguu yjkvgjcpfngcvvcejogpv pqpuoogvtke2tqeguu dncemjcpfngcvvcejogpv figure 12 black ring formation from a spherical black hole must be nonaxisymmetric in real black hole spacetimes describes the emergence of the exterior region is also forbidden this gives another reason for the wellknown result that a black hole cannot bifurcate because it corresponds to a white n 1handle attachment the second rule applies to more general situations for example let us consider the topological evolution of the event horizon from s n1 to s n2 s 1 in n 1dimensional spacetime n 3 when it is realized with a single critical point it corresponds to a 1handle attachment here one might expect two possibilities if the second rule is not considered one possibility is that the 1handle is attached in the exterior region of the black hole this is locally equivalent to the merging of a pair of black holes where these two black holes are connected elsewhere irrelevant the other possibility is that it is attached from the inside such that the 1handle pierces the black hole region in asymptotically flat spacetimes only the latter includes axisymmetric configurations such that a spherical black hole is pinched out along the symmetric axis here the axisymmetric configuration is such that the spacetime possesses the son 1 isometry and the time slicing respects this symmetry however this latter possibility corresponds to a white 1handle attachment which is impossible and only the former which corresponds to a black 1handle attachment is possible in particular a transition from a spherical event horizon s n1 to a black ring horizon s n2 s 1 in asymptotically flat spacetimes is always nonaxisymmetric in the sense that such a configuration cannot possess son 1 symmetry fig 12 while the apparent horizon must be diffeomorphic to a twosphere in fourdimensional spacetimes under the dominant energy condition a torus event horizon may appear even under the dominant energy condition via a black 1handle attachment to the spherical horizon more generally an event horizon with an arbitrary number of genura may be formed by several black 1handle attachments the third rule is not directly determined by the local structure of the critical point it states that the exterior region e t e t at each time is always connected under the assumption that i is connected thus the possibility that there forms a bubble of the exterior region inside the black hole horizon is ruled out it should however be noted that such a process is possible if i consists of several connected components this may also be related to the topological censorship theorem 19 the topological censorship theorem states that all causal curves from i to i are homotopic under the null energy condition this also forbids the formation of a bubble of the exterior region inside the black hole because otherwise there would be two nonhomotopic causal curves from i to i one passing inside the horizon and the other outside our argument however does not depend on energy
