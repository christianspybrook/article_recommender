radio engineering research institute ukraine email kosovtsovescortlvivnet abstract in present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear pdes in closed form the method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders it is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedures each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary pdes systems for one dependent variable moreover we find on this way the explicit expression of the firstorder pdes for first integral of decomposable initial pde remarkably that this firstorder pde is linear if initial pde is linear in its highest derivatives the developed method is implemented in maple procedure which can really solve many of different order pdes with different number of independent variables examples of pdes with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear pdes introduction nonlinear partial differential equations pdes play very important role in many fields of mathematics physics chemistry and biology and numerous applications if for nonlinear ordinary differential equations odes one can observe incontestable progress in their automatic solving the situation for nonlinear pdes seems as nearly hopeless one despite the fact that various methods for solving nonlinear pdes have been developed in 1920 centuries as the suitable groups of transformations such as point or contact transformations differential substitutions and backlund transformations etc the most powerful method for explicit integration of secondorder nonlinear pdes in two independent variables remains the method of darboux 14 the original darboux method as already darboux stated in 1 is extendable in principle to equations of all orders in an arbitrary number of independent variables even to systems of equations however in 12 and subsequent papers by many authors the detailed calculations were performed only for a single secondorder equation with one dependent and two independent variables the darboux method was refined in recent years into more precise and efficient although not completely algorithmic form 58 and references therein nevertheless this approaches suffer from high complexity and necessitate to use some tricks there were some partially successful attempts to extend modern variants of the darboux method based on laplace cascade method on higherorder pdes and pdes in the space of more than two independent variables 1013 but they suffer from high complexity too there is an original approach to the problem based on the special type of local change of variables which leads to the order reduction of initial pde proposed in 14 which is suitable for high dimensions problems but of very special class though in present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear pdes in closed form the method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders it is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedures each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary pdes systems for one dependent variable moreover we find on this way the explicit expression of the firstorder pdes for first integral of decomposable initial pde remarkably that this firstorder pde is linear if initial pde is linear in its highest derivatives the developed method is implemented in maple procedure which can really solve many of different order pdes with different number of independent variables examples of pdes with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear pdes bases of the method decomposable pdes the simplest secondorder nonlinear pde for w wt x 1 w w w t x can be easily transformed to the following decomposed form 1 w  0 w x from which we can without difficulty obtain the general solution to pde 1 in two steps first step gives us 1 w d lngx w x where gx is an arbitrary function and then solving the equation 3 on the second step we obtain wt x f tgx where f t is one more arbitrary function the main observations on analyzing the grounds of solvability of the pde 1 by the above method are that 1 the pde 1 is decomposable ie it can be represented as a composition of successive differential operators of type 5 not necessarily linear it is clear that such type of decomposition can be done for some pdes of any order and with any number of independent variables in the following manner d1 w u1 d2 u1 u2 dn un1 0 where x x1 xm w wx ui ui x and di u vi x u assuming that vi are arbitrary functions and eliminating ui by successive substitutions in system 5 we get a family of pdes for w of nth order dn dn1 d1 w 0 which are decomposable and in principle their solutions general or particular can be obtained by integration of split system 5 the pde 6 is nonlinear if at least one of the operators di is nonlinear not all pdes admit such representation and in positive cases such representation is not unique in general note that as a matter of fact di need not be the firstorder differential operators so the composition procedure for nth order pde when n 2 can be as follows d1n1 w u d2n2 u 0 where n1 n2 are integers and n1 n2 n w wx u ux and k j dij u vi x u j u  k1 x1 xkmm k1 km kj xjm the late representation allows us to carry out the pdes decomposition or order reduction gradually bit by bit we have to stress here that in general representations 5 and 7 may have different meaning for example some pdes do not admit representation 5 but permit the form 7 with both solvable des 2 each step of the solving process for decomposed pde is faced with the necessity to solve differential equation di ui1 ui or dij ui1 ui so all such des must be solvable note that only first step dn un1 0 is free from arbitrary functions so one of the pdes solving strategies may be as follows first of all we try to decompose given pde in order to do so we have to solve corresponding auxiliary nonlinear pde system for unknown functions vi it is sufficient to find a particular solution here and if it is successful then deciding between the variants try to solve each arising de from the chain 5 main obstacle here beginning at the second step is just mentioned necessity to solve des with arbitrary functions there are sufficiently narrow circle of solvable in sense of the general solutions des with an arbitrary function as a parameter another classification approach can be based on the usage of only solvable des that is we can form a composition of successive solvable differential operators and as a result obtain a families of solvable pdes such a way leads to extensive nontrivial families for different types of nonlinear pdes which general solutions can be expressed in closed form but on this way we encounter a difficulty to circumscribe such families integrally and are forced to consider particular subfamilies nevertheless it yields extensive field of pdes for methods testing 15 decomposition algorithm for decomposable pdes for nth order pde when n 2 there are some slightly different approaches which are dictated by goals of the problem if the goal is to decompose given nonlinear operator then we have to use the scheme 7 with n1 1 n2 n 1 and conversely we have to use the scheme 7 with n1 n 1 n2 1 if the goal is to solve given pde the last procedure in some features resembles the wellknown technics of reducing odes order eg by first integral method of course it is possible to use intermediate cases all above cases can be treated by the same way as we consider below but each of them leads to auxiliary pdes systems of different order viz n2 1 with corresponding calculation complexity in sequel we will consider for shortness only the case with n1 n1 n2 1 as more practical for pdes solving let us consider the decomposition of type 7 with d1n1 w as a solution of the following equation with respect of u ux ju x w  n1 w  k1 n1 0 x1 xkmm k1 km kn1 and d2 u v x u if substitute u d1n1 w into 9 we obtain decomposable nth order pde v x u0 ux1 uxm 0 where we use below the following notation w w0 and x1 1 xk  wk1 km d1n1 w u0 wk1 km wk1 km  uxi i 1 m where kj kj 1 if j i and kj kj otherwise and it is supposed that differentiations in sum are carried out on all indexed w s which are involved in here we can introduce u0 and ux1 uxm as new independent variables if express m variables from the set wk1 km with k1 km n using linear system 12 assuming that given pde of order n f x w  k1  n 0 x1 xm k1 km kn is decomposable we receive that after substitution of the new variables lefthand side of given pde must turn into 10 with some v lefthand side of given pde expressed in new variables is the firstorder differential expression with respect to ju0 x w0 w100 wk1 km k1 km kn1 w00n1 and must not depend on all indexed w s that is derivatives of f expressed in new variables with respect to all indexed w s are equal to zero sequence of such derivatives of f equated to zero form a secondorder pde system for j so a solution particular as well the pde system gives possible expression of differential operator d1n1 w through 8 and differential operator d2 u by substituting the solution of j into lefthand side of given pde expressed in new variables of course there are problems where a operator decomposition is required only but in most cases obtained decomposition is intended for finding solutions for given pde if in obtained decomposition the corresponding pde d2 u 0 is solvable then substitution of obtained u into j expressed in original variables gives us a first integral see its definition in the next subsection of given pde it is easy to see that for decomposable pdes the first integral is a differential equation so we can try to solve it or to find a first integral for this new de or decompose it by the scheme described above until we come to the firstorder remarkably that in the approach under consideration the finding of first integrals can be done more directly and effectively differential equation for first integral of decomposable pdes the first integral i of the pde is an expression involving one arbitrary function which is equivalent in some sense to the given pde the first integral vanishes on the set of solutions of given pde and in accordance with 4 all differential consequences of the equation i 0 coincide with respective differential consequences of given pde eg elimination of the arbitrary function leads to the given pde our goal here is to find pde for first integral of a decomposable pde to do so we first of all have to take into account that ux is the solution of the corresponding pde v x u  0 so ux depends only on x but in no way on indexed w s secondly the dependent variable in this case namely jux x w0 w100 wk1 km k1 km kn1 w00n1 of given pde 13 expressed in new variables do not to depend on ux1 uxm and is a first integral of given pde if now consider ux as an unknown function we can denote the first integral ix w0 w100 wk1 km k1 km kn1 w00n1 jux x w0 w100 wk1 km k1 km kn1 w00n1 and instead of 12 in the form  ux wk1 km wk1 km i 1 m we arrive to the following system  0 wk1 km wk1 km i 1 m if express m variables from the set wk1 km with k1 km n at least one of which is actual for given pde note that there are some variants here as a rule so we can obtain some consistent pdes on this stage using linear system 14 and substitute them into given pde 13 we receive a firstorder even linear if pde 13 is linear in its highest derivatives pde with respect to first integral i and it remains only to solve this pdes to find a first integral of given pde note given pde is decomposable iff exists a solution of such firstorder pdes examples to facilitate necessary calculations in the process of finding first integrals i have implemented above described method in prototype of maple procedure reduce pde order see appendix the input data of the procedure are given pde of any order and dependent variable of the pde with any number of independent variables the procedure tries to find first integrals of the input linear or nonlinear pde the maple builtin procedure pdsolve is used inside my procedure to solve the firstorder pde for first integral as different maple versions have different pde solving abilities so the output depends on maple version in the following examples i refer to maple 11 the procedure reduce pde order is able to find first integrals for many known and unknown linear and nonlinear pdes here we give examples of pdes for which it is possible to find finally their general solutions more examples one can find in collection of solvable nonlinear pdes 15 secondorder pde with two independent variables for pde w wt x 2w a tx w 1 w c w c w kw  0 15 w t w x 2aw t 2a 4aw with a 6 0 and

2w tx2 x tx t x2 t x tx2 w 2 w  2 w w x tx x2 t with arbitrary function f 1 w 2t the wealth of first integrals here allows us to operate with them in many different ways apart from aforesaid subsequent order reduction we can for example from  f x  2w tx2 x tx t x2 t x and  2 w w w 2 w w 2 w3 x2 tx2 x tx x2 t w w  gx t x where f x and gx are arbitrary functions algebraically eliminate mixed derivative and obtain the following ode w 2  tf x gx w2 0 which gives the general solution to 18 wt x ht exp t xf x dx tx f x dx x gx dx xgx dx xkt where f x ht gx and kt are arbitrary functions conclusion the method have considered above is efficient enough for solving decomposable pdes of relatively high order with many independent variables the main limitation here is concerned with abilities to solve corresponding auxiliary firstorder pdes for first integrals an adaptability of the method to pdes which are not decomposable but which general solutions can be expressed in closed form remains unsolved yet but it can be shown on examples that there are some ways to extend the method for some types of such pdes these approaches deserve further thorough study in another
