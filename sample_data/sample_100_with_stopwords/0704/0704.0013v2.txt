gives a linear relation among fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight the remaining sections contain detailed proofs of the main theorems 3 linear relation among fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight let v n k n be the subspace of cn generated by the first n coefficients of the qexpansion of f at for f sk 0 n where sk 0 n denotes the space of cusp forms of weight k z on 0 n let ln k n be the orthogonal complement of v n k n the padic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms in cn with the usual inner product of cn the vector space l1 k dk 1 dk dimsk 1 was studied by siegel to evaluate the value of the dedekind zeta function at a certain point the vector space l1 k n is explicitly described in terms of the principal part of negative

any other modular form of the same level and weight furthermore let r4 z r12 z 16z8 12z12 2z2 and 6z6 4z4 8z4 for l n n define ml n and 4z8 8z8 2z4 4z4  2n 0 if l1  2n 1 if l1 1 mod 2 mod 2 l 1 2n l n n let 4n be the order of zero of r4n z at note that r4n z m2 0 4n has 1 q its only zero at so using the definition of z q 24 n1 1 q we find that 4 1 8 2 12 4 16 4 for each g mr 1 0 4n and e n let e4n b4n e g q o1 at r4n ze with these notations we state the following theorem theorem 31 suppose that 0 is an integer and 1 n 4 for each e n such that e 2 1 take r 2e 1 the linear map re 4n mr 1 0 4n d

cusps of 0 4n the residue resd gdz of gz at d x0 4n is welldefined since we have a canonical correspondence between a meromorphic modular form of weight 2 on 0 4n and a meromorphic 1form of x0 4n if res g denotes the residue of g at on h then resd gdz res g here l is the order of the isotropy group at the residue of g at each cusp t c4n is resdt gdz ht atg 0 now we give a proof of theorem 31 to prove theorem 31 take gz f z r4n ze where g mr 1 0 4n and f z n1 af nq m 12 0 4n note that gz is holomorphic on h since gz r4n z and f z are holomorphic and r4n z has no zero on h it is enough to compute the residues of gz only at all inequivalent cusps to apply the residue theorem the qexpansion of r4n f z at is e4n f z b4n e g q a gz e 0 oq af nq n r4n z r4n ze since r4n z has no zero at t we have f z t at gz 0af 0 oqt r4n ze r4n ze further note that for an irregular cusp t r4n ze 0af 0 0 the padic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms so the residue theorem and 33 imply that e4n ht

re 4n is surjective since the map re 4n is injective this completes our claim d choi and y choie 4 proofs of theorem 1 and 2 41 proof of theorem 1 first we obtain linear relations among fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight modulo p let op l is pintegral let f 1 0 4n hz  p ah nq n oppopq 1 q h h mod p for some h opq 1 q m 1 0 4n and se 1 p0 4n hz ah nq n oppopq 1 q

f 1 0 4n dim m 1 0 4n dim m  p and dim se 1 p0 4n dim s 1 0 4n proof let j4n z q 1 oq be a meromorphic modular function with a pole only at explicitly these functions are 4z12 j4 z 4z8 2z4 8z8  2 z8z 4z4 6z2 j12 z 2z2 12z4 2z 2 16z since the fourier coefficients of z and z are integral the qexpansion of j4n z has integral coefficients recall that 4n q 4n oq 4n 1 is the modular form of weight 21 on 0 4n such that the order of its zero at is higher than that of any other modular form the padic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms of the same level and weight denote the order of zero of 4n at by 4n then the basis of m 1 0 4n can be chosen as 4n zj4n ze 0 e 4n if 4n z is pintegral then 4n zj4n ze 0 e 4n also forms a basis of f 1 0 4n note that 4n dim m 1 0 4n 1 so from table 1 we have 4n z 4nj zr4n z where j mod 2 j 0 1 more precisely one can choose 4nj z as followings 40 z z 41 z z3 80 z z 81 z 41 z p z2z 3x 2y 2 z 2 yz 3x2 4y 2 4z 2 4yz 120 z z 121 z 61 xyzz xyzz 160 z 21 z 4z 161 z 18 z3 3z2 4z 3z4z2 4z3 since z 1 2 n1 q the coefficients of the qexpansion of 4nj z j 0 1 are pintegral this completes the proof remark 42 the proof of lemma 41 implies that the spaces of m 1 0 4n for n 1 2 4 are generated by etaquotients since z 2z5 z2 4z2 for 1 n 4 set fs 4n n af 1 af n fn f se 1 0 4n fp oppop fs 4n 1 n in fn fs 4n 1 n to be the orthogonal complement of v we define l using lemma 41 we obtain the following proposition proposition 43 suppose that is a positive integer and 1 n 4 for each e n e 2 1 take r 2e 1 the linear map re 4n mr 1 p0 4n ls 4n  e 4n defined by re 4ng b4n e g 1 bn e g e 4n is an isomorphism here b4n e g is defined in 32 proof note that dim s 3 4n 0 and that dim s 1 4n n 1  dim m 1 4n see 10 so from lemma 41 and table 1 it is enough to show that re 4n is injective if g is in the kernel of re 4n then r4n  r4n ze 0 mod p by sturms formula see 21 so we have gz 0 mod p since r4n ze 6 0 mod p this completes the proof d choi and y choie theorem 44 take a prime p n 1 2 4 and f z nn0 af nq n s 1 0 4n lq suppose that p ol is any prime ideal with pp and that af n is pintegral for every  or p 2 then there exists a positive integer n n0 if 2 or 2 n1 mod p1 integer b such that af npb 0 mod p n n proof of theorem 44 i first suppose that p 3 take positive integers l and b such that 3 2p 2b 1 mp  lp 1 2 p  12 pmp 2 then there note that if b is large enough that is b logp 32p exists a positive integer l satisfying 43 also note that atf 0 0 for every cusp t of 0 4n since f z is a cusp form so if r 2e p 1 then theorem 31 implies f 1 0 4n that for gz m e4n b4n e g af p2bmp 0 mod p since r4n ze p2b f zp ep1 e4n b4n e g q p a af nq np r4n ze r4n ze mod p so proposition 43 implies that a p2bmp a 2p2bmp a e 4np2bmp fs 4n p 1 n if p 2 or 2  then dim sp 1 0

for an integer b 22 2 let 4n1 z 12b gz f j4n z f zz2 23 r4n z since z 1 mod 2 theorem 31 implies that af 2b n 0 mod p to apply theorem 44 we need the following two propositions proposition 45 proposition 32 in 22 suppose that p is an odd prime k and n are integers with n p 1 let f z anq n m 1 0 4n a b suppose that cp2 d with ac 0 then there exist n0 h0 n with h0 n a sequence a0 nnn0 and r0

suppose further that p ol is any prime ideal with pp and that an is pintegral for every integer n 1 then there exists gz s 1 0 4n ol q such that gz gz mod p where  12 pj pe p 1 with en large remark 47 proposition 46 was proved for p 5 in 1 one can check that this holds also for p 3 now we prove theorem 1 proof of theorem 1 take gp z 8z48  m12 0 16 16z24 z27  m12 0 9 9z3  m p2 1 0 p2 4p2 z if p 2 if

proposition 45 implies that there exist positive integers l m k such that if p 2 f upm zgp zl sk 1 0 16 f upm zgp zl sk 1 0 4p2 n if p 3 note that k mod p 1 using proposition 46 we can find f z sk 1 0 4n such that f z f zupm gp zl f upm z mod p and k k mod p 1 theorem 44 implies that there exists a positive integer b such that f up2b z 0 mod p thus we have shown so far that if p p2 all the fourier

take a positive integer l and a positive even integer u such that 3 2p u 1 mp  lp 1 2 p 4n3p z p and gz ep1 zl f zp  since ep1 z 1 let f z r4n z mod p we have f zgz a 4n3p z nq np mod p af nq nmp r4n

atf zgz 0 at4n3p z 0atf 0 mod p r4n z r4n z for t for large u the residue theorem implies theorem 2 by letting u 2b therefore it is enough to check a pintegral property of fourier coefficients of f z at each cusp take a positive integer e such that ze f z is a holomorphic modular form where the padic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms n 24 z q n1 1 q note that the qexpansions of j4n z and

that if at z for all t then cm z for all m n proof of theorem 6 from theorem 63 we can take f z cnq n sk 1 0 4 zp q such that f z at q t 0 trt z t 0 aft dt a t c q trt z by theorem 1 there exists a
