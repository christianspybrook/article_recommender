becchirouetstoratyutin brst and antibrst symmetry invariance of the lagrangian densities of the four 3 1dimensional 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism in particular we provide the geometrical interpretations for i the above nilpotent symmetry invariance and ii the above lagrangian densities in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism some of the subtle points connected with the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4d ordinary gauge theories are considered on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x with 0 1 2 3 and a pair of grassmannian variables and one of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry invariance pacs numbers 1115q 1220m 0370k keywords superfield formalism nonabelian 1form gauge theories antibrst symmetries symmetry invariance horizontality condition geometrical interpretations 1 introduction the geometrical superfield approach 18 to becchirouetstoratyutin brst formalism is one of the most attractive and intuitive approaches which enables us to gain some physical insights into the beautiful but abstract mathematical structures that are associated with the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations and their corresponding generators the latter quantities play a very decisive role in i the covariant canonical quantization of the gauge theories ii the proof of the unitarity of the quantum gauge theories at any arbitrary order of perturbative computations for a given physical process that is allowed by the theory iii the definition of the physical states of the quantum gauge theories in the quantum hilbert space and iv the cohomological description of the physical states of the quantum hilbert space wrt the conserved and nilpotent brst charge to be specific in the superfield formulation 18 of the 4d 1form gauge theories one defines the super curvature 2form f 2 d 1 i 1 1 in terms of the super exterior derivative d dx d d with d 2 0 and the super 1form connection 1 on a 4 2dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the usual spacetime variables x with  0 1 2 3 and a pair of anticommuting ie 2 2 0 0 grassmannian variables and the above super 2form is subsequently equated due to the socalled horizontality condition 18 to the ordinary curvature 2form f 2 da1 ia1 a1 defined on the ordinary 4d flat minkowski spacetime manifold in terms of the ordinary exterior derivative d dx with d2 0 and the 1form connection a1 dx a the above super exterior derivative d and super 1form connection 1 are the generalization of the 4d ordinary exterior derivative d and 1form connection a1 to the 4 2dimensional supermanifold because d d 1 a1 in the limit 0 the above horizontality condition hc has been referred to as the soulflatness condition in 9 which amounts to setting equal to zero all the grassmannian components of the antisymmetric secondrank super tensor that constitutes the super curvature 2form f 2 on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold the key consequences that emerge from the hc are i the derivation of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the gauge and antighost fields of a given 4d 1form gauge theory ii the geometrical interpretation of the antibrst symmetry transformations for the 4d local fields as the translation of the corresponding superfields along the grassmannian directions of the supermanifold iii the geometrical interpretation of the nilpotency property as a pair of successive translations of the superfield along a particular grassmannian direction of the supermanifold and iv the geometrical interpretation of the anticommutativity property of the antibrst symmetry transformations for a 4d local field as the sum of a the translation of the corresponding superfield first along the direction followed by the translation along the direction and b the translation of the same superfield first along the direction followed by the translation along the direction it will be noted that the above hc ie f 2 f 2 is valid for the nonabelian ie a1n a1n 6 0 1form gauge theory as well as the abelian ie a1 a1 0 1form gauge theory as expected for both types of theories the hc leads to the derivation of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the gauge and antighost fields of the respective theories we lay emphasis on the fact that the hc does not shed any light on the derivation of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations associated with the matter fields of the interacting 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories in a recent set of papers 1017 the above hc condition has been generalized in a consistent manner so as to compute the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations associated with the matter fields of a given 4d interacting 1form gauge theory along with the wellknown nilpotent transformations for the gauge and antighost fields without spoiling the cute geometrical interpretations of the antibrst symmetry transformations and their corresponding generators that emerge from the hc alone the latter approach has been christened as the augmented superfield approach to brst formalism where the restrictions imposed on the 4 2dimensional superfields are i the hc plus the invariance of the super matter noether conserved currents 1014 ii the hc plus the equality of any super conserved quantities 15 iii the hc plus a restriction that owes its origin to the gauge invariance and the super covariant derivatives on the matter superfields 1617 and iv an alternative to the hc where the gauge invariance and the property of a pair of super covariant derivatives on the super matter fields and their intimate connection with the super curvatures play a crucial role 1820 in all the above approaches 120 however the invariance of the lagrangian densities of the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories under the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations has not yet been discussed at all some attempts in this direction have been made in our earlier works where the specific topological features 2122 of the 2d free nonabelian 1form gauge theories have been captured in the superfield formulation 2325 in particular the invariance of the lagrangian density under the nilpotent and anticommuting antibrst and anticobrst symmetry transformations has been expressed in terms of the superfields and the grassmannian derivatives on them these are however a bit more involved in nature because of the existence of a new set of nilpotent anticobrst symmetries in the theory the geometrical interpretations for the lagrangian densities and the symmetric energymomentum tensor for the above topological theory have also been provided within the framework of the superfield formulation the purpose of our present paper is to capture the antibrst symmetry invariance of the lagrangian density of the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield approach to brst formalism and to demonstrate that the above symmetry invariance could be understood in a very simple manner in terms of the translational generators along the grassmannian directions of the 4 2dimensional supermanifold on which the above 4d ordinary gauge theories are considered in addition the reason behind the existence or nonexistence of any specific nilpotent symmetry transformation could also be explained within the framework of the above superfield approach we demonstrate the uniqueness of the existence of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the lagrangian density of a u1 abelian 1form gauge theory we go a step further and show the existence of the nilpotent brst symmetry transformations for the specific lagrangian densities cf 41 and 44 below of the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory and clarify the nonexistence of the antibrst symmetry transformations for these specific lagrangian densities within the framework of the superfield formulation cf section 5 below finally we provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the offshell nilpotent and anticommuting antibrst symmetry transformations and their corresponding generators for the specifically defined lagrangian densities cf 47 andor 48 below of the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory in the feynman gauge the motivating factors that have propelled us to pursue our present investigation are as follows first and foremost to the best of our knowledge the property of the symmetry invariance of a given lagrangian density has not yet been captured in the language of the superfield approach to brst formalism second the above antibrst invariance of the theory has never been shown in as simplified fashion as we demonstrate in our present endeavour the geometrical interpretations for i the existence of the above nilpotent antibrst symmetry invariance and ii the onshell conditions of the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetries turn out to be quite transparent in our present work third we establish the uniqueness of the existence of the antibrst symmetry invariance in their various forms the nonexistence of the specific symmetry transformation is also explained within the framework of the superfield approach to brst formalism finally our present investigation is the first modest step in the direction to gain some insights into the existence of the nilpotent symmetry transformations and their invariance for the higher form eg 2form 3form etc gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formulation the contents of our present paper are organized as follows in section 2 we recapitulate some of the key points connected with the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the free 4d abelian 1form gauge theory having no interaction with matter fields in the lagrangian formulation the above symmetry transformations as well as the symmetry invariance of the lagrangian densities are captured in the geometrical superfield approach to brst formalism in section 3 where the hc on the gauge superfield plays a crucial role section 4 deals with the bare essentials of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory in the lagrangian formulation the subject matter of section 5 concerns itself with the superfield formulation of the symmetry invariance of the appropriate lagrangian densities of the above 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory finally in section 6 we summarize our key results make some concluding remarks and point out a few future directions for further investigations 2 antibrst symmetries in abelian theory lagrangian formulation let us begin with the following antibrst invariant lagrangian density of the 4d abelian 1form gauge theory in the feynman gauge 26279 lb f f b a b 2 i c c where f a a is the antisymmetric f f curvature tensor that constitutes the abelian 2form f 2 da1 21 dx dx f b is the nakanishilautrup auxiliary multiplier field and cc are the anticommuting ie c 2 c 2 0 c c cc 0 antighost fields of the theory the above lagrangian density respects the offshell nilpotent s2ab 0 antibrst symmetry transformations sab with sb sab sab sb 0 sb a c sab a c sb c 0 sab c 0 sb c ib sab c ib sb b 0 sab b 0 sb f 0 sab f 0 it is clear that under the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations sab the curvature tensor f is found to be invariant in other words the 2form f 2 owing its origin to the cohomological operator d dx is an antibrst invariant object for the abelian u1 1form gauge theory and is therefore a physically meaningful ie gaugeinvariant quantity these observations will play an important role in our discussion on the horizontality condition that would be exploited in the context of our superfield approach to antibrst invariance of the lagrangian densities in sections 3 and 5 see below a noteworthy point at this stage is the observation that the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms can be written modulo a total derivative in the following fashion sb i c a b h i sb sab a a c c sab i c a the above equation establishes in a very simple manner the antibrst invariance of the 4d lagrangian density 21 the simplicity ensues due to i the nilpotency s2ab 0 of the antibrst symmetry transformations ii the anticommutativity property ie sb sab sab sb 0 of sab and iii the invariance of the f term under sab as a side remark it is interesting to note that the following onshell ie c c 0 nilpotent s2ab 0 antibrst symmetry transformations with sb sab sab sb 0 sb a c sab a c sb c 0 sab c 0 sb c i a sab c i a sb f 0 sab f 0 we adopt here the notations and conventions such that the flat minkowski metric in 4d is diag 1 1 1 1 so that a b a b a0 b0 ai bi for two nonnull 4vectors a and b the greek indices 0 1 2 3 and latin indices i j k 1 2 3 stand for the 4d spacetime and 3d space directions on the 4d minkowski spacetime manifold respectively and the symbol 0 2 i 2 we follow here the notations and conventions adopted in 27 in its full blaze of glory the nilpotent antibrst transformations ab are a product of an anticommuting spacetime independent parameter  and sab ie ab sab where the nilpotency property is encoded in the operators sab are the symmetry transformations for the following lagrangian density lb f f a 2 i c c the above transformations 24 and the lagrangian density 25 have been derived from 22 and 21 by the substitution b a an interesting point connected with the onshell nilpotent symmetry transformations is to express the analogue of 23 as h i sab c a i a c h i sb c a i a c sb sab a a c c it should be noted that in the above precise computation one has to take into account the onshell c c 0 conditions so that for all practical purposes sab a 0 the above nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations ie sr sr with r b ab are connected with the conserved and nilpotent generators ie qr qr with r b ab this statement can be succinctly expressed in the mathematical form as sr i qr sr i qr r b ab where the subscripts with the signatures on the square bracket stand for the bracket to be an anticommutator for the generic fields a c c b and a c c of the lagrangian densities 21 and 25 being fermionicbosonic in nature the above charges qr qr are found to be anticommuting ie qb qab qab qb 0 qb qab qab qb 0 and offshell as well as onshell nilpotent q2ab 0 q2ab 0 in nature respectively 3 antibrst invariance in abelian theory superfield formalism in this section we exploit the geometrical superfield approach to brst formalism endowed with the theoretical arsenal of the horizontality condition to express the antibrst symmetry transformations and the lagrangian densities cf 21 and 25 in terms of the superfields defined on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold the latter is parametrized by the spacetime coordinates x with 0 1 2 3 and a pair of grassmannian variables and as a consequence the generalization of the 4d ordinary exterior derivative d dx and the 1form connection a1 dx a x on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold are d 2 0 d d dx d d a1 1 dx b x d f x d f x where the mapping from the 4d local fields to the superfields are a x b x cx f x and cx f x the superexpansion of the superfields in terms we lay emphasis on the fact that 26 cannot be derived directly from 23 by the simple substitution b a one has to be judicious to deduce the precise expression for 26 the logical reasons behind the derivation of 26 are encoded in the superfield formulation cf 39 below of the basic fields as well as the secondary fields are see eg 47 1012 b x a x r x r x i s x f x cx i b1 x i b1 x i sx f x cx i b2 x i b2 x i sx it can be readily seen that in the limiting case of 0 we get back our 4d basic fields a c c furthermore on the rhs of the above super expansion the bosonic ie a s b1 b1 b2 b2 and the fermionic r r c c s s fields do match at this juncture we have to recall our observations after equation 22 the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations basically owe their origin to the cohomological operator d this is capitalized in the horizontality condition where we impose the restriction d 1 da1 on the super 1form connection 1 that contains the superfields defined on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold the latter condition yields the following relationships see eg for details in our earlier works 2125 b1 b2 s s 0 b1 b2 0 where we are free to choose the secondary fields b2 b1 ie b2 b b1 b in terms of the nakanishilautrup auxiliary field b of the brst invariant lagrangian density 21 the other relations that emerge from the above hc ie d 1 da1 are r c r c s b  b b a a at this stage the supercurvature tensor f b b is not equal to the ordinary curvature tensor f a a as the former contains grassmannian dependent terms the substitution of the above values cf 3334 of the secondary fields in terms of the basic and auxiliary fields of the lagrangian density 21 leads to bh x a c c i b f h x c i b f h x c i b where the superscript h has been used to denote that the above expansions have been obtained after the application of the hc it can be seen that due to 35 we get  bh bh a a where there is no grassmannian and dependence on the lhs in the language of the geometry on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold the expansions 35 imply that the antibrst symmetry transformations sab and their corresponding generators qab for the 4d local fields cf 27 are connected with the translational generators because the translation of the corresponding 4 2dimensional superfields along the grassmannian directions of the supermanifold produces it thus the grassmannian independence of the super curvature tensor f  bh bh implies that the 4d curvature tensor f is an antibrst ie gauge invariant physical quantity in terms of the superfields equations 23 can be expressed as i f h bh b  h lim0  if b b 2 i i h h b b f h f h  2 these equations are unique because there is no other way to express the above equations in terms of the derivatives wrt grassmannian variables and thus besides 23 there is no other possibility to express the gaugefixing and the faddeevpopov ghost terms in the language of the offshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations 22 the superfield approach to brst formulation therefore establishes the uniqueness of 23 to express 26 in terms of the superfields one has to substitute b a in 35 thus the expansion 35 in terms of the transformations 24 becomes lim0 bo x fo x fo x a c c i a a sab a sb a sb sab a c i a c sab c c i a c sb c we note that 35 and 38 are the super expansions after the application of the hc which lead to the derivation of the offshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations sab as well as the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations sab respectively for the basic fields a c and c of the theory the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms of the lagrangian density 25 can also be expressed in terms of the superfields 38 in other words visvis 37 we have the following equations that are the analogue of 26 namely  h i h  fo a i bo fo  h 2 i h lim0  fo a i bo fo i h h 1 h h bo bo fo fo  2 we know that for all practical computational purposes it is essential to take into account sab a 0 because of the onshell conditions c c 0 the logical reason behind such a restriction ie sab a 0 in 26 is encoded in the superfield approach to brst formalism as can be seen from a close look at 39 the lagrangian density 21 can be expressed in terms of the 4 2dimensional superfields in the following distinct and different forms lim0 1 h h lb f  lim0 i f h bh b 310 the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations sab can also be obtained by invoking the antichiral superfields on the appropriately chosen supermanifolds see eg 23 for details 1 h h lb f  lim0 1 h h lb f i f h bh b h i  bh bh f h f h 311 312 h h it would be noted that the kinetic energy term 14f is independent of the variables and because f f in exactly similar fashion the lagrangian density of 25 can be expressed with the help of the super expansion 38 as 1 h h  h i h lb fo fo lim0  fo a i bo fo 313 i h 1 h h 314  fo a i b0 fo lb fo fo lim0 1 h h  h i h h 1 h h i 315 lb fo fo  bo bo fo fo the form of the lagrangian densities eg from 310 to 315 simplify the proof for the antibrst invariance of the lagrangian densities in 21 and 25 in the above forms eg from 310 to 312 of the lagrangian density the brst invariance sb lb 0 and the antibrst invariance sab lb 0 become very transparent and simple because the following equalities and mappings exist namely sb lb 0 lim0 l 0  b sb lim0 s2b 0 316  2 lb 0 sab lim0  0 317 s2ab 0 similarly the most beautiful relation 312 leads to the antibrst invariance together here one has to use the anticommutativity property sb sab sab sb 0 in the language of the translational generators ie along the grassmannian directions of the supermanifold for its proof this statement can be mathematically expressed as sab lb 0 lim0 sab lb 0  3 l 0  b sb sab sab sb 0  318 in exactly similar fashion the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry invariance ie sab lb 0 of the lagrangian density 25 can also be captured in the language of the superfields if we exploit the expressions 313 to 315 for the lagrangian density in the latter case the onshell nilpotent antibrst invariance turns out to be like 316 317 123 123 and 318 with the replacements sab sab lb lb lb  lb mathematically the antibrst invariance of the lagrangian density 21 is captured in the equations 316 to 318 in the language of geometry on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold the antibrst invariance corresponds to the grassmannian independence of the supersymmetric versions of the lagrangian density 21 in other words the translation of the super lagrangian densities ie 310 to 312 along the directions of the supermanifold is zero this observation captures the antibrst invariance of 21 4 antibrst symmetries in nonabelian theory lagrangian approach we begin with the following brstinvariant lagrangian density in the feynman gauge for the four 3 1dimensional nonabelian 1form gauge theory see eg 26279 lb f f b a b b i c d c where the curvature tensor f is defined through the 2form f 2n da1n ia1n a1n here the nonabelian 1form gauge connection is a1n dx a t and the exterior derivative is d dx the nakanishilautrup auxiliary field b b t is required for the linearization of the gaugefixing term and the antighost fields cc are essential for the proof of the unitarity in the theory the latter fields are fermionic ie c a 2 0 c a 2 0 c a c b c b c a 0 c a c b c b c a 0 etc in nature the above lagrangian density respects the following offshell nilpotent sb 2 0 brst symmetry transformations sb namely sb a d c sb b 0 sb c c c sb f if c sb c ib it will be noted that i the curvature tensor f t transforms here under the brst symmetry transformation however it can be checked explicitly that the kinetic energy term 14f f remains invariant under the brst symmetry transformations ii the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations corresponding to the above brst symmetry transformations 42 cannot be defined for the lagrangian density 41 and iii the onshell nilpotent version of the above brst symmetry transformations is also possible if we substitute in the above symmetry transformations b a the ensuing onshell ie d c 0 nilpotent brst symmetry transformations sb are sb c c c sb c i a sb f if c sb a d c the above onshell nilpotent transformations leave the following lagrangian density lb f f a a i c d c for the nonabelian 1form gauge theory the notations used in the lie algebraic space are a b a b a a ba f abc ab b c d c a c a if abc ab c c c a ia ca f a a ia a a a t t a t b f abc t c where the latin indices a b c 1 2 3n are in the su n lie algebraic space the structure constant f abc can be chosen to be totally antisymmetric for any arbitrary semi simple lie algebra that includes su n too see eg 27 quasiinvariant because it transforms to a total derivative the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms of the lagrangian densities 41 and 44 can be written modulo a total derivative as a brstexact quantity in terms of the offshell and onshell nilpotent brst symmetry transformations 42 and 43 this statement can be mathematically expressed as follows 1 i i c a b b a b b i c d c  c a i a c a a i c d c it will be noted that one has to take into account sb a d c 0 in the above proof of the exactness of the expression in 46 the lagrangian densities that respect the offshell nilpotent ie sab 2 0 and n n n n anticommuting sb sab sab sb 0 antibrst symmetry transformations are  f f b a b b b b i c d c  f f b a b b b b id c c here auxiliary fields b and b satisfy the curciferrari condition b b c c 2829 it is also evident from this relation that b a i c d c b a id c c furthermore it should be reemphasized that the lagrangian densities 41 and 44 do not respect the antibrst symmetry transformations of any kind the brst and antibrst symmetry transformations for the above lagrangian densities are sb a d c sb b sab a d c sab b 0 sb c ib sb c c c sb f if c sb b ib c sab c ib sab c c c sab f if c sab b ib c 410 the above offshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations leave the lagrangian densities 47 as well as 48 quasiinvariant as they transform to some total derivatives the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms of the lagrangian densities 47 and 48 can be written in a symmetrical fashion with respect to sb and sab as n n sb sab a a c c  b a b b b b i c d c  b a b b b b id c c 411 this demonstrates the key fact that the above gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms are antibrst invariant together because of the nilpotency and anticommutativity of the antibrst symmetry transformations sab that are present in the theory 5 antibrst invariance in nonabelian theory superfield approach to capture i the offshell as well as the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations and ii the invariance of the lagrangian densities in the language of the superfield approach to brst formalism we have to consider the 4d 1form nonabelian gauge theory on a 4 2dimensional supermanifold as a consequence we have the following mappings d 2 0 d d  dx d d a1n 1n dx b t x df t x df t x where the 4 2dimensional superfields b t f t f t are the generalizations of the 4d basic local fields a t c t c t of the lagrangian density 41 47 and 48 these superfields can be expanded along the grassmannian directions of the supermanifold in terms of the basic 4d fields auxiliary fields and secondary fields as 41619 b t x a t x r t x r t x i s t x f t x c t x i b1 t x i b1 t x i s t x f t x c t x i b2 t x i b2 t x i s t x to determine the exact expressions for the secondary fields in terms of the basic and auxiliary fields of the theory we have to exploit the hc the horizontality condition for the nonabelian gauge theory is the requirement of the equality of the maurercartan equation on the super manifolds in other words the covariant reduction of the super 2form curvature f 2n to the ordinary 2form curvature ie d 1n i1n 1n da1n ia1n a1n leads to the determination of the secondary fields in terms of the basic and auxiliary fields of the theory the ensuing expansions in terms of the basic and auxiliary fields lead to i the derivation of the antibrst symmetry transformations for the basic fields of the theory and ii the geometrical interpretations of the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations and their corresponding nilpotent generators for the basic fields of the theory as the translations of the corresponding superfields along the grassmannian directions of the 4 2dimensional supermanifold see eg 1619 with the identifications b2 b and b1 b the following relationships emerge after the application of the horizontality condition k see eg 16 r d c r d c b b c c s ib c s d b d c c d b d c c b2 c c s ib c b1 c c in the rest of our present text we shall be using the shorthand notations for all the fields eg a t a c t c b t b etc for the sake of brevity the substitution of the above expressions which are obtained after the application of the horizontality condition leads to the following expansions bh x a d c d c i d b d c c f h x c i b c c b c f x c c c i b b c the above expansions see eg our earlier works 1619 can be expressed in terms of the offshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations 49 and 410 with the above expansion at our disposal the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov terms of the lagrangian density 41 can be written modulo a total ordinary derivative as lim0 if h bh f h b b a b b i c d c furthermore it can be seen that due to the validity and consequences of the horizontality condition the super curvature tensor f has the following form 164  f if c if c f b f c c it is clear from the above relationship that the kinetic energy term of the present 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory remains invariant namely 1 h  f h f f the grassmannian independence of the lhs of 57 has deep meaning as far as physics is concerned it implies immediately that the kinetic energy term of the nonabelian gauge theory is an antibrst ie gauge invariant physical quantity at this juncture it is worthwhile to point out that one can also capture the equation 46 in the superfield approach to brst formalism where the onshell nilpotent version of the brst symmetry transformations ie sb plays an important role for this purpose we have to express the superfield expansion 54 for the onshell nilpotent brst symmetry transformation where one has to exploit the replacement b a with this substitution the equation 54 for the superfield expansion becomes bo x a d c d c i d a d c c fo x c i b c c b c fo x c c c i a a c now the equation 46 can be expressed in terms of the above superfields as lim0  h i h fo a i bo fo a a i c d c  2 furthermore it will be noted that the analogue of 56 for the onshell nilpotent brst symmetry transformation ie fo can be obtained by the replacement b a once again the equality 57 would remain intact even if we take into account the onshell nilpotent brst symmetry transformations thus we note that the kinetic energy term ie 14f f 14fo fo of the nonabelian gauge theory remains independent of the grassmannian variables and after the application of the hc this statement is true for the offshell as well as the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations physically it implies that the kinetic energy term for the gauge field of the nonabelian theory is an antibrst ie gauge invariant quantity the above key observation helps in expressing the lagrangian density 41 and 44 in terms of the superfields obtained after the application of hc as 1 h  f h lim0 if h bh f h b lb f  h 510 1 h  i h lb fo fo lim0 f a i bo fo  2 o this result in turn simplifies the brst invariance of the above lagrangian density 41 and 44 describing the 4d 1form nonabelian gauge theory as follows n n n n 511 lb 0 sb lb 0 lim0 lb 0 sb lb 0 this is a great simplification because the total super lagrangian densities 510 remain independent of the grassmannian variable this key result is encoded in the mapping n n sb sb lim0 and the nilpotency sb 2 0 sb 2 0 2 0 it can be readily checked that the analogues of 55 and 59 cannot be expressed as the derivative wrt the grassmannian variable to check this one has to exploit the super expansions 54 and 58 obtained after the application of the hc in the context of the derivation of the offshell as well as the onshell nilpotent brst symmetry transforn mations sb and sb it can be clearly seen that the operation of the derivative wrt the grassmannian variable on any combination of the superfields from the expansions 54 and 58 does not lead to the derivation of the rhs of 55 and 59 in the language of the superfield approach to brst formalism this is the reason behind the nonexistence of the antibrst symmetry transformations for the lagrangian densities 41 and 44 the form of the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov terms 411 expressed in terms of the brst and antibrst symmetry transformations together can be represented in the language of the superfields obtained after the application of hc as lim0  h i h h  b a b b b b i c d c b b  f h f h  2 512 as a consequence of the above expression the lagrangian densities 47 as well as 48 can be presented in terms of the superfields as 12n  h i h h  f h f b b  f h f h  2 513 the brst and antibrst invariance of the above super lagrangian density and that of the ordinary 4d lagrangian densities 47 and 48 is encoded in the following simple equations that are expressed in terms of the translational generators along the grassmannian directions of the 4 2dimensional supermanifold namely  12n  12n n 1n n 2n  0 sb l b  0 lim0 lb  0 sab lb 514 this is a tremendous simplification of the antibrst invariance of the lagrangian densities 47 and 48 in the language of the superfield approach to brst formalism in other words if one is able to show the grassmannian independence of the super lagrangian densities of the theory the antibrst invariance of the 4d theory follows automatically in the language of the geometry on the supermanifold the antibrst invariance of a 4d lagrangian density is equivalent to the statement that the translation of the super version of the above lagrangian density along the grassmannian directions of the 4 2dimensional supermanifold is zero thus the super lagrangian density of an antibrst invariant 4d theory is a lorentz scalar constructed with the help of 4 2dimensional superfields obtained after the application of hc such that when the partial derivatives wrt the grassmannian variables and operate on it the result is zero the nilpotency and anticommutativity properties that are associated with the conserved antibrst charges and antibrst symmetry transformations are found to be captured very naturally cf 316318 when we consider the superfield formulation of the antibrst invariance of the lagrangian density of a given 1form gauge theory we mention in passing that one could also derive the analogue of the equations 316 317 and 318 for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory in a straightforward manner lim0 6 conclusions in our present investigation we have concentrated mainly on the antibrst invariance of the lagrangian densities of the free 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories having no interaction with matter fields within the framework of the superfield approach to brst formalism we have been able to provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the antibrst invariance in the above 4d theories to be more specific we have been able to show that the grassmannian independence of the 4 2dimensional super lagrangian density expressed in terms of the appropriate superfields is a clearcut proof that there is an antibrst invariance cf 316 317 318 511 514 in the 4d theory if the super lagrangian density could be expressed as a sum of i a grassmannian independent term and ii a derivative wrt the grassmannian variable then the corresponding 4d lagrangian density will automatically respect brst andor antibrst invariance in the latter piece of the above super lagrangian density the derivative could be either wrt or wrt or wrt both of them put together more specifically i if the derivative is wrt the nilpotent symmetry would correspond to the brst ii if the derivative is wrt the nilpotent symmetry would be that of the antibrst type and iii if both the derivatives are present together both the nilpotent antibrst symmetries would be present together and they would turn out to be anticommuting for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories that are considered on the 4 2dimensional supermanifold it is the hc on the 1form super connection 1 that plays a very important role in the derivation of the antibrst symmetry transformations the cohomological origin for the above hc lies in the super exterior derivatives dd this point has been made quite clear in our discussions after the offshell as well as the onshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations 22 24 42 43 49 and 410 in fact it is the full kinetic energy term of the above theories owing its origin to the cohomological operator d dx that remains invariant under the above onshell as well the offshell nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations the hc produces specifically the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations for the gauge and antighost fields because of the fact that the super 1form connection 1 1n cf 31 and 51 is constructed with a super vector multiplet b f f which is the generalization of the gauge field a and the antighost fields cc of the ordinary 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories to the 4 2dimensional supermanifold as a consequence only the nilpotent and anticommuting antibrst symmetry transformations for the 4d local fields a c and c are obtained when the full potential of the hc is exploited within the framework of the above superfield formulation it is worthwhile to point out that geometrically the super lagrangian densities expressed in terms of the 4 2dimensional superfields are equivalent to the sum of the kinetic energy term and the translations of some composite superfields obtained after the application of the hc along the grassmannian directions ie andor of the 4 2dimensional supermanifold this observation is distinctly different from our earlier works on the superfield approach to 2d nonabelian 1form gauge theories 242523 which are found to correspond to the topological field theories in fact for the latter theories the total super lagrangian density turns out to be a total derivative wrt the grassmannian variables andor that is to say even the kinetic energy term of the latter theories is able to be expressed as the total derivative wrt the variables andor in our present endeavour within the framework of the superfield approach to brst formalism we have been able to provide i the logical reason behind the nonexistence of the antibrst symmetry transformations for the lagrangian densities 41 and 44 for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory ii the explicit explanation for the uniqueness of the equations 23 and 26 for the 4d abelian 1form gauge theory iii the convincing proof for the onshell nilpotent antibrst invariance of the gaugefixing term ie sab a 0 sab a 0 for the nonabelian 1form gauge theories and iv the compelling arguments for the nonexistence of the exact analogues of 23 and 26 for the nonabelian 1form gauge theory to the best of our knowledge the logical explanations for the above subtle points connected with the 1form gauge theories are completely new thus the results of our present work are simple beautiful and original it is worthwhile to mention that our superfield construction and its ensuing geometrical interpretations are not specific to the feynman gauge which has been taken into account in our present endeavor to corroborate this assertion we take the simple case of the 4d abelian 1form gauge theory and write the lagrangian density 21 in the arbitrary gauge  f f b a b 2 i c c where is the gauge parameter it is elementary to check that in the limit 1 we get back our lagrangian density 21 for the abelian theory in the feynman gauge the analogue of the equation 23 for the gaugefixing and faddeevpopov ghost terms in the case of the arbitrary gauge can be expressed as sb i c a b h i sb sab a a c c sab i c a the above expression can be easily generalized to the analogues of the equations 310 312 in terms of the superfields by taking the help of 38 thus the geometrical interpretations remain intact even in the case of the arbitrary gauge in a similar fashion for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory the equations 45 46 and 411 can be generalized to the case of arbitrary gauge and subsequently can be expressed in terms of superfields as the analogues of 55 59 and 512 finally we can obtain the analogues of 57 510 and 513 which will lead to the derivation of the analogues of 511 and 514 thus we note that geometrical interpretations in the arbitrary gauge remain the same for the 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theory within the framework of our superfield approach to brst formalism our present work can be generalized to the case of the interacting 4d nonabelian 1form gauge theories where there exists an explicit coupling between the gauge field and the matter fields in fact our earlier works 1418 might turn out to be quite handy in attempting the above problems it seems to us that it is the combination of the hc and the restrictions owing their origin to the super covariant derivative on the matter super fields and their intimate connection with the super curvatures that would play a decisive role in proving the existence of the antibrst invariance for the above gauge theories it is gratifying to state that we have accomplished the above goals in our very recent endeavours 3032 in fact we have been able to provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the antibrst invariance in the context of the interacting nonabelian 1form gauge theories with dirac as well as complex scalar fields within the framework of the augmented superfield approach to brst formalism as it turns out here too the super lagrangian density is found to be independent of the grassmannian variables in our earlier works 3335 we have been able to show the existence of the nilpotent antibrst and anticobrst symmetry transformations for the 4d free abelian 2form gauge theory we have also established the quasitopological nature of it in 35 in a recent work 36 the nilpotent antibrst symmetry transformations have been captured in the framework of the superfield formulation it would be a very nice endeavour to study the antibrst and anticobrst invariance of the 4d abelian 2form gauge theory within the framework of superfield formulation at present this issue and connected problems in the context of the 4d free abelian 2form gauge theory are under intensive investigation and our results would be reported in our forthcoming future publications 37 acknowledgement financial support from
