14 2013 lattice contribution to the electronic selfenergy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions expectations of electronphonon selfenergy effects for simpler materials such as pd and al have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain selfenergy effects seen in hightc cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments arpes including the temperature dependence doping dependence of the renormalization effects the interband scattering in the bilayer systems and impurity substitution we show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations these arguments are not well founded pacs numbers valid pacs appear here introduction the microscopic pairing mechanism of the hightc superconductivity remains an unsolved question even after twenty years of its discovery observations of a kink at around 4070 mev in the band dispersion along the diagonal of the brillouin zone nodal diection and a peakdiphump pdh structure at the zone boundary by angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes12345678910111213 have drawn a great deal of recent attention as they may shed some light on this problem although an agreement has been established that the kink and pdh structure are signatures of the electrons coupled to a sharp bosonic mode it is still strongly debated about the origin of this bosonic mode influenced by the fact that the hightc cuprate is a doped antiferromagnetic insulator a common belief is that this bosonic mode has a magnetic origin23456789 however an alternative view is that the electronphonon coupling in such a dopedinsulator can be very strong and anomalous because of a number of unusual effects such as poor screening complex structure as well as the interplay with correlations indeed oxygen related optical phonons have been invoked to explain the temperature and doping dependence of the renormalization effects1011121314 this idea of phonons being mainly responsible for this low energy band renormalization effect observed by arpes has stimulated intense debate there is currently no consensus whether a phonon a set of phonons or a magnetic mode is the primary cause of the band renormalization as mentioned some important reasons to invoke phonon interpretation of the arpes data are the presence of an universal energy scale in all materials at all doping1015 particularly in the normal state of very low tc materials16 the strong inferred momentum dependence1114 the existence of multiple bosonic mode couplings12 and the decrease in the overall cou pling strength with increased doping interpreted as a screening effect especially for phonons with eigenvectors along the caxis13 yet there is still a widespread belief that phonons are not responsible for the kink features in the following sections with a comprehensive look at all experimental data as well as some recent simulations we address some of the criticisms that have been commonly used to argue against the phonon interpretation these include the temperature and doping dependence of the renormalization effects interband scattering for bilayer system and the arpes experiments on impurity substituted bi2212 crystal bi2 sr2 cacu2x mx o8 with m  zn or ni our goal is to clarify these misconceptions as being due to oversimplifying the effects of electronphonon coupling in cuprates as well as other strongly correlated transition metal oxides aspects of the electronphonon selfenergy temperature dependence in the standard treatment of electronphonon coupling effects the debye temperature sets a characteristic temperature scale which is well above tc in conventional superconducting materials however in the cuprates and other low fermi energy systems these two energy scales can be comparable as a result the temperature dependence of phonon induced selfenergies can be very different from that of conventional superconductors according to the arpes measurements on bi2212 system the band renormalization in the antinodal region peakdiphump structure shows a dramatic superconductivityinduced enhancement when the system goes through a phase transition from the normal state to the superconducting state it has been argued that only a mode which emerges in the superconducting state and vanishes in the normal state can explain this temperaturedependent renormalization effect2345 phonons are thereby excluded the sharpness of the renormalization effects due to electronphonon coupling is strongly temperature dependent given by the fact that tc of optimallydoped bi2212 is close to 100k to demonstrate this temperature dependence we consider the normal state 120 k and superconducting state 10 k of a dwave superconductor coupled to a 36 mev b1g 55mev oxygen a1g and 70 mev breathing phonons1417 the electronphonon coupling for the b1g and breathing phonons are those used in ref 14 the a1g modes involve caxis motions of both planar and apical oxygens and have two branches around 55 and 80 mev the apical electronphonon coupling derived in ref 17 involves a chargetransfer from the apex oxygen into the cuo2 plane via the cu 4s orbital the same pathway that gives rise to bilayer splitting however for simplicity the apical electronphonon coupling is treated as a constant in the calculations presented in this paper the reason to include three modes in the calculation was inspired by the earlier success of the twomode calculation11 as well as the recent discovery of multiple mode coupling1213 for this calculation the tightbinding band structure described in ref 19 has been used the real part and imaginary part of the selfenergy k and the spectral functions ak at k 0 are then obtained within weak coupling eliashberg formalism14 and plotted in fig 1 details of the calculations are presented in the appendix at high temperature both rek and imk do not exhibit a sharp renormalization feature as shown by the dashed curves in fig 1 a and fig 1b respectively this demonstrates that the thermal broadening effect smears out the sharp renormalization features in addition broadening effects due to additional many body effects would smear out the renormalization features further thus one should not expect to observe any sharp renormalization features at k 0 in the normal state  100k from the electronphonon coupling in the superconducting state the renormalization features of the selfenergy become much sharper due to smaller thermal broadening effect as well as the opening of a superconducting gap consistent with the optimallydoped bi2212 and bi2223 measurements241118 the pdh structure of the spectral function at k 0 emerges at low temperature and disappears at high temperature normal state as illustrated in fig 1c and fig 1d respectively while this behavior is generally expected for any phonon we note that in addition the selfenergy from electronphonon couplings which involve momentum transfers within and between antinodal regions of the fermi surface such as the apex a1g and b1g phonons are greatly enhanced for all kpoints due to the large density of state enhancements in these regions via the opening of a dwave gap a detailed momentum dependence of the renormalization effects in the normal state and superconducting state due to the coupling to the b1g fig 1 the calculated a real part re b imaginary part of the selfenergy im and the corresponding spectral functions ak in c normal state and d superconducting state an extra 5 mev is added to the imaginary part of the self energy in 120k simulation to account for the thermal broadening of the quasiparticle life

normal state 120k and superconducting state25k18 respectively phonon has been discussed in ref 11 and ref 14 furthermore both the dispersion kink and the pdh structure in the nodal region have been clearly observed in the normal state when measured at a low temperature on samples with a lower tc 16 this lends further support to the strongly temperature dependent renormalization features due to electronphonon coupling doping dependence another problematic statement against the phonon scenario stems from the apparent strong doping dependence of the kink position and strength based on the wisdom for conventional good metals phonons should not have a strong doping dependence either in frequency of the mode or in strength of the coupling this is not necessary valid for layered doped insulators with strong correlation effects such as cuprates where doping dramatically changes the metallicity and the ability of electrons to screen charge fluctuations we first note that many experiments on various cuprates have reported strongly doping dependent anomalies for several phonons which implies a strongly doping dependent ep coupling for these phonons for example from inelastic neutron scattering measurements the breathing mode halfbreathing mode and the bondstretching modes exhibit prominent doping dependence of dispersion and energy renormalizations2021 in raman and infrared spec fig 2 the intensity plots of the a spectral functions without resolution convolution and b resolution convoluted spectral functions in the superconducting state 10k along the nodal direction as indicated in the inset of b by the blue line black curves are the band dispersion extracted from the maximum positions of the momentum distribution curves which cut the spectral functions at a fixed energy the mdcderived dispersions in a exhibit three sharp subkinks due to the coupling to the three phonon modes used in the model while in b the subkinks are washed out by the finite instrument resolution effect leaving an apparent single kink in the band dispersion the white dashed line illustrates the bare band for extracting re shown in fig 3 a troscopy the fano lineshapes of phonon modes in b1g and b1u symmetry show strong doping dependences22 furthermore the strength of the phonon energy shift and linewidth variation across tc also changes strongly with doping23 second the doping dependence of the renormalization effects to the electronic selfenergy is sophisticated as inferred by two recent arpes studies one is the observation of multiple bosonic mode couplings along the nodal direction12 the other is the doping dependence of the caxis screening effect to the coupling between the electron and caxis phonons as proposed by meevasana et al1324 and devereaux et al17 for electronphonon coupling at long wavelengths the screening becomes more effective at reducing the coupling strength when the caxis conductivity becomes more metallic given these two results plus the variation of the superconducting gap magnitude with doping the doping dependence of the kink energy is highly convoluted in bi2212 whose superconducting gap has an energy comparable to some of the phonons in fig 2 we present the intensity plot of calculated spectral functions demonstrating a doping dependence of the dispersion kink in the superconducting state the superconducting gap size was set to be 40 20 and 10 mev for the optimallydoped and more overdoped systems in addition the coupling strength of the breathing mode whose appreciable coupling is only for short wavelengths and large momentum transfers2021 remains un fig 3 a the re extracted from fig 2a dashed lines and fig 2b solid lines by subtracting a linear bare band dashed line in fig 2a from the band dispersion the arrows indicate the maximum positions of the re where the single apparent kink in the band dispersion is usually defined b summary of the doping dependence of the apparent kink energy and the apparent mode energy extracted by assuming a single mode scenario changed for our doping dependence simulation while a filter function 2 2 sc  with different value of caxis screening frequency sc is applied to the caxis phonons b1g and a1g to simulate the dopingdependent coupling strength due to the change of the caxis screening effect1324 we note that although this is a simplification it represents the general behavior of screening considerations for phonons involving small inplane momentum transfers full consideration of screening has been given in ref 17 and ref 24 in addition a component 0005 2 ev is added in the imaginary part of the selfenergy to mimic the quasiparticle life time broadening due to electronelectron interaction as shown in fig 2a the coupling to multiple phonon modes induces several subkinks in the dispersion the positions of these subkinks mostly correspond to the energies of phonons plus the maximum dwave sc gap 0 even through there is no gap along the nodal direction this is because when calculating the selfenergy one needs to integrate the contributions from the entire zone which makes the electrons in the nodal region feel the presence of the gap furthermore revealed by the extracted realpart of the selfenergy re dashed curves in fig 3 a the dominant feature in re for the op case is induced by 36 mev b1g mode while for the od1 and od2 case the features of the 55 mev a1g mode and 70 mev breathing mode gradually outweight the contribution from the b1g mode this demonstrates that the change of the sc gap magnitude and the increasing screening effect to these phonons because of increased doping alters the relative strength of the subkinks caused by different modes to simulate the experimental data we convoluted the spectral functions shown in fig 2a with a typical arpes instrumental resolution 125 mev in energy resolution and 0012 a in momentum resolution as illustrated in fig 2b and the extracted re solid curves in fig 3a the subkinks are less obvious and become a broadened single kink in the dispersion which is located at roughly the energy of the dominant phonon feature determined by the maximum position of the re the arrows in fig 3a the doping dependence of the kink position is summarized as the solid symbols in fig 3b assuming a single mode scenario one can obtain the doping dependence of the mode energy by subtracting out the sc gap size however we note that this extracted apparent mode energy does not match any of the modes used in the model instead it is a average between the dominant features open symbols in fig 3b clearly since the kink energy is a sum of the superconducting gap and a spectrum of bosonic modes it should not be taken as a precise measurement of the energy of any particular bosonic mode this casts doubts to the analysis of the doping dependent properties of the kink in the nodal band dispersion based on the single bosonic mode coupling scenario78 more importantly this illustrates the complex nature of lattice effects in these oxides interband scattering borisenko et al89 observed that the scattering rate of the bonding and antibonding bands along the nodal direction cross each other near the energy of the van hove singularity suggesting a strong interband scattering between the bonding and antibonding bands they argued that only a mode with odd symmetry such as first we note that recent high energy and momentum resolution arpes experiments on bi2212 using low energy photons 10 ev have better resolved the bilayer splitting at the nodal point25 however as shown in fig 2 of ref 25 the scattering rate of the bonding and antibonding band does not exhibit a crossover behavior as reported by borisenko at al the inconsistency of the data between the two groups implies that more experiments and better analysis are needed to verify whether this interband scattering effect is genuine second empirically it has been known for over 15 years that interband electronphonon coupling in the cuprates is very large the evidence comes from the strong resonance profiles of many raman active phonons which display large intensity variations26 this is generally understood as a result of strong interband coupling whereby phonons can be brought in and out of resonances via tuning of the incident photon energy27 since in general phonons can also provide momentum to scatter electrons along the caxis direct inter bilayer scattering can occur which involves mixing of different symmetries of phonons this can be viewed in a simplified way even if we first neglect direct interband scattering and consider a bilayer system coupled to caxis phonons for qz 0 a simple classification of caxis modes is possible t k ck1 ck2 hc g k q ckq ck a q a q hc  kck ck k12 spin resonance mode can mediate such interband scattering the question whether phonons can induce such interband scattering has also been raised by these authors kq12 where is the index for the electronic states of different layers 1 k 2 k t k describes the hopping of electrons between two layers and the index can be either gerade or ungerade active caxis modes with symmetry classification with respect to the displacement eigenvectors to the inversion center of the cell depicted in fig 4 after diagonalizing the first two terms by canonical transformation the electronphonon coupling can be recast as heph ggu k q agu q agu q  ckq ck ckq ck hc 2 we have used the c and c for the even and odd linear combination of c1 and c2 and subscript g and u for the gerade and ungerade mode respectively thus for qz 0 where this classification is possible gerade phonons induce intraband scattering even channel while the ungerade phonons mediate the interband scattering process odd channel even without direct electronphonon coupling across the layers yet for qz c the classification inverts where gerade modes become ungerade and viceversa as illustrated in fig 4 thus even in this simple case modes at different qz contribute both to intra and interband scattering and the net weight of the coupling appearing in the self energy is then largely determined by the specific momentum structure gk q since the selfenergy generally involves sums over qz and coupling directly of electrons in adjacent layers via phonons are nonnegligible clearly the interband scattering phenomena can not be used to argue against fig 4 the illustration of the gerade and ungerade caxis phonons the eigenmode of the gerade ungerade phonons is even odd with respect to the mirror plane between two cuo2 layers at qz 0 while their definition swapped at qz c the black grey and white circles represent the cu ca and o atoms respectively the phonons being important to the electronic states we also add a remark concerning the electronphonon coupling derived from raman measurements28 in yba2 cu3 o7 and bi2212 compared to that obtained from arpes while one might naively expect the couplings to be comparable from raman and arpes we remark that this situation is remarkably different if the coupling is strongly moment dependent and whenever correlations are appreciable since raman measures phonons with net zero momentum transfer and arpes involves a sum over all transfers a sizeable coupling difference may be discernable this is specifically the case for the b1g phonon where scattering involving momentum transfers across the necks of the fermi surface near 014 further enhanced via correlations29 yields a strong contribution to the electron selfenergy that is absent in phonon selfenergies moreover a sum rule analysis presented in ref 30 highlights in general how electron and phonon selfenergies may be qualitatively different in strongly correlated systems arpes experiments on zn and ni substituted bi2212 in this section we comment on recent experiments about the renormalization effects in zn and ni substituted bi2212 crystal3132 the strength of sharp renormalizations in these substituted crystals is found to be weakened compared to the pristine crystals since the magnetic properties are expectedly modified due to the cu substitution by these impurities the authors concluded that the sharp renormalization effects are induced by magneticrelated modes not phonons in fact a close examination of the data published by v b zabolotnyy et al31 and k terashima et al32 implies that the magnetic property is not the only modification due to the substitution by zn and ni first although both sets of data are consistent in the antinodal region where the strength of the band renormalization is reduced they are inconsistent with each other on the kink strength along the nodal direction in the data set of v b zabolotnyy et al the kink strength is weaker in the zn or ni doped samples whereas there is no detectable change in the data set reported by k terashima et al second the data from k terashima et al fig 1df in ref 32 suggest that the bilayersplitting structure is much clearer in the pristine crystals than in the zn and ni doped crystals since the authors have ruled out the possibility of a significant doping level difference between pristine and impuritydoped crystals the distinct visibility variation of the bilayer structure implies a impurityrelated change in the electronic structure from these two observations on their data it implies that not only the magnetic properties could change the band structure and scattering behaviors could also be affected due to these impurities it is possible that these changes of the electronic structures could weaken the renormalizaton features observed in the arpes spectrum furthermore we note that the strength of electronphonon coupling could also be modified by the substituted impurities this can be inferred from the change of the fano spectra lineshape of the b1g 340 cm1 phonon in raman spectral for zndoped ybco33 and thdoped ybco34 resulting from an increase in the phonon linewidth due to impurity scattering therefore the experiments on ni and zn substituted bi2212 crystals are inconclusive experiments to distinguish phonon and magnetic modes as the origin of the renormalization effects iii conclusion we have shown that the temperature and doping dependence of the renormalization effects interband band scattering and the results of zn and ni doped materials can be understood in the framework of electronphonon coupling on the other hand the issues that make it not plausible for the sharp kink being of spin origin especially the spin resonance mode remain i the nearly constant energy scale as a function of doping in small gap system12 ii the multiple modes12 iii the presence of clear kink in the normal state41316 iv the detailed agreement between b1g phonon based explanation of the mode coupling as a function of momentum1114 while the spin resonance with tiny spectral weight 2 is unlikely to give an explanation for both nodal and antinodal renormalization v the accumulated evidence for lattice polaron effect in underdoped and deeply underdoped systems3536 with these weaknesses of the spin resonance interpretation lattice effect is a more plausible explanation of the renormalization effects it remains a possibility that the spinfluctuation and other strong correlation effects are also very important to determine the electronic structure of cuprates they likely contribute to a smooth renormalization of the band and may be more relevant to the higher binding energy however optical phonons are the most probable origin for the renormalization effects due to sharp modes near 4070 mev which is also supported by the recent finding of stm experiments3738 contract deac0276sf00515 t p devereaux would like to acknowledge support
