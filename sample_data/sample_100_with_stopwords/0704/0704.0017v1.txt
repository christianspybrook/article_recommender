polar ip ex hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented spinmodulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an ip the spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near 500 600 km s1 these velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the roche lobe radius furthermore spin doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of 500 km s1 to 1000 km s1 these findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of king wynn 1999 belle et al 2002 and norton et al 2004 for ex hya which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the roche lobe radius in this system evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed confirming the result of belle et al 2005 that disc overflow in ex hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst it appears that the h and h spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge while those of h were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf narrow component and close to the white dwarf broadbase component in agreement with the accretion curtain model key words accretion discs binary stars cataclysmic variables 1 introduction ex hya is an intermediate polar ip a subclass of magnetic cataclysmic variable stars mcvs where a latetype main sequence star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as the two stars orbit each other under the influence of their mutual gravitation unlike in polars another subclass of mcvs where the white dwarf is in synchronous rotation with the binary rotation pspin porb the white dwarf in an ip is in asynchronous rotation with the orbital motion of the system ex hya however is nearer synchronism than the majority of ips as it has a spin period 6703 min which is about 23 its orbital period 9826 min mumford 1967 hellier et al 1987 and is one of only six out of thirty nine confirmed ips with its orbital period below the 23 h cv period gap norton et al 2004 it has an inclination i 78 1 recent studies have shown that ex hya does not conform to the traditional ip model king wynn 1999 wynn 2000 belle et al 2002 norton et al 2004 belle et al 2005 this sys email ncebacircinusastuctacza c 0000 ras tem has a large pspin porb ratio 068 implying that it cannot be in the usual spin equilibrium rotation since most ips have been shown to attain spin equilibrium near pspin porb 01 king wynn 1999 wynn 2000 this further implies that the corotation radius is far greater than the circularisation radius rco rcir and that ex hya cannot possess a keplerian disc systems with keplerian discs are expected to have rco rcir and thus a smaller pspin porb these factors have prompted theorists to suggest that the spin equilibrium state in ex hya is determined by rco b where b is the distance to the inner lagrangian point l1 king wynn 1999 wynn 2000 norton et al 2004 in this model the accretion curtains extend to near the l1 point and ex hya resembles an asynchronous polar where most of the material accretes via the stream king wynn 1999 wynn 2000 and via both the ring of material near the roche lobe radius of the primary and the stream norton et al 2004 depending on the orbital and spin periods of the system and the magnetic field strength in the later publication it was shown that material in ex hya is fed from a ring of

21 1991 observations ex hya was observed in april of 1991 by buckley et al 1991 using the saao 19m telescope with the reticon photon counting system rpcs detector on the cassegrain spectrograph a grating with a resolution of 1200 mm1 was used and a wavelength range of 4000 5080 was covered at a spectral resolution of 12  and at a time resolution of 100 120 s the spectrograph slit width was 250

the exposure times during observations were 60 s the observations covered the period 24 april 26 april 2001 and in total 262 spectra were obtained table 1 the extraction and reduction of the data were performed the standard way using the image reduction and analysis facility iraf1 package and the iraf is a software package for the reduction and analysis of astronomical data distributed by national optical astronomy observatory noao 3 the radial velocities it is widely accepted that in a canonical cv the high velocity emission line wings are formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc orbiting close to the white dwarf and thus should reflect its orbital motion shafter 1983 shafter szkody 1984 shafter 1985 in ips however high velocity emission line wings are formed in the gas streaming towards the white dwarf at high velocities hellier et al 1987 ferrario wickramasinghe 1993 the radial velocities were determined by measuring the wings of the h and h emission lines from the 1991 data 24 and 250491 the data obtained on the 29th was not added since ex hya had not fully recovered from outburst and the wings of h h and h emission lines from the 2001 data using the gaussian

present in h and h radial velocities of 2001 the amplitude of relative to was found to be 81 for h 64 for h and 18 for h 4 orbital variations of the emission lines the data were phasebinned on the orbital ephemeris of hellier sprouts 1992 teclipse 243769994179 00682338464e where e is the number of orbital cycles and t is the time of mideclipse this ephemeris is defined by the zero point of mideclipse where minimum intensity is at phase 00 this means that for the radial velocities maximum blueshift is perpendicular to the line of centres at phase 075 meaning that spectroscopic phase zero occurs at the bluetored crossing of the emission line radial velocity curve 40 phase bins were used to produce the radial velocities 41 orbital tomograms and trailed spectra figure 2 radial velocity amplitude spectra shown for the h line from 2001 for 3500 km s1 and 1200 km s1 the vertical dashed line shows the expected position of the orbital and spin period peaks the data were prewhitened by and are shown in the third panel from the top a window spectrum is shown at the bottom scheme gcs schneider young 1980 shafter szkody 1984 shafter 1985 the gcs method convolves each spectrum with two identical gaussian one in the red wing and one in the blue wing the separation between the two gaussians is 2 care was taken not to include regions far out in the wings where the continuum begins to dominate by choosing reasonable values of the width of the gaussians and twelve standard gaussian bandpasses were used with values ranging from 3500 to 100 km s1 and corresponding width values from 1200 to 100 km s1 31 period searches the radial velocities were fourier transformed using the discrete fourier transform dft algorithm to search for any periods in the data deeming 1975 kurtz 1985 the h and h amplitude spectra from 1991 24 and 25 april are shown in figure 1 and the h amplitude spectra from 2001 are shown in figure 2 a prominent peak at a frequency corresponding to the 98minute orbital frequency is observed in all the emission lines second in strength to the orbital frequency is the spin frequency  of the narrow swave component nsc 900 1200 km s1 figures 1 and 2 the third panels from the top in figures 1 and 2 show the data after prewhitening by power at is clearly present the spin frequency was not detected at high values of  3000 3500 km s1 where it is most expected since at these velocities the material is quite close to the white dwarf and its emission is expected to be modulated at the white dwarf spin period c 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 the h h and h doppler tomograms were computed using the back projection method bpm with the application of a filter and the maximum entropy method mem marsh horne 1988 marsh 1988 horne 1991 spruit 1998 the bpm doppler maps are shown in figure 3 and those constructed using mem are shown in figure 4 error in ephemerides both orbital and spin is sufficiently small to phase all of our data accurately on the orbital and spin cycles a velocity amplitude of the primary k1 74 2 km s1 from our radial velocity measurements and that of the secondary k2 360 35 km s1 taken from vande putte et al 2003 and beuermann et al 2003 were used to fix the positions of the roche lobe and the stream trajectories on the tomograms a secondary mass m2 010 001 m for ex hya was derived from the uptodate secondary massperiod relation of smith dhillon 1998 the mass of the primary m1 was then determined from the above values using k k2 m1 and was found to be 050005 m the h h and hei 4471 doppler tomograms figure 3 and 4 show strong emission at the bright spot some at the roche lobe and the stream and some from the disc those of h also show strong bright spot emission but less or no emission from the stream disc emission is diminished in h when compared to other emission lines especially at higher velocities this is more obvious in the bpm tomogram the bright spot emission falls near the region 100 350 km s1 averagesubtracted trailed spectra figure 4 show the corresponding nsc 1 1011 ergs cm2 s1 6070 of the original line fluxes is contained in the averagesubtracted profiles of h and h and 1 1012 ergs cm2 s1 8090 is contained in h and hei 4471 this flux is mainly due to the bright spot and the stream the trailed spectra have been repeated over 2 cycles for clarity the trailed spectra of 2001 have revealed two interesting features the first one is the asymmetry in the intensity of the swave figure 4 in h the red wing of the nsc is brighter at 98 01 03 and seems to reach maximum brightness near 98 025 whereas the blue wing is dimmer in the range 98 07 09 and seems to reach minimum brightness near 98 075 a similar effect is seen in the h and the h lines and to a lesser extent in hei 4471 the second feature is redshifted emission extending from the nsc to high velocities 1000 km s1 at early binary phases 98 00 02 n mhlahlo dah buckley vs dhillon sb potter b warner and pa woudt figure 3 the panels show the h

line profile bottom panels the positions of the roche lobe and stream trajectories are shown velocity amplitudes of k1 74 km s1 and k2 360 km s1 for the primary and secondary stars respectively were used the two curves with marked intervals represent the gas stream velocity upper curve and the keplerian velocity along the stream lower curve the circles on all tomograms represent 01 of the distance from the l1 point to the primary the three crosses are centres of mass of the secondary system and primary from toptobottom the asterisk represents the velocity of closest approach all the maps are plotted on the same velocity scale the lookup table of this figure is such that the brightest emission features appear with decreasing intensity from yellowgreen to light blue in the online edition or white to grey in the printed edition the reconstructed trailed spectra suggest that this latter feature is another swave which we shall refer to as the high velocity component hvc crossing the nsc near 98 02 03 the doppler tomograms show emission extending from the bright spot position passing along the stream path to the bottomleft quadrant at high velocities near 1000 km s1 which is responsible for the hvc most of this emission does not fall within the disc and gas stream velocities on the map suggesting that there was small or no overlap of the stream component with the disc the 1991 tomograms showed similar results it is worth noting that most of the disc emission in 1991 came from the outer disc than in 2001 even though the mem and bpm pick out the same features in the bp tomograms some features are more prominent than in the mem tomograms while the reconstruction obtained using the mem reproduces the observed data well the advantage of bpm over mem is that it is faster and it is easier to get a consistent set of maps of different emission lines in terms of the apparent noise in the images for this reason both methods have been used 5 spin variations of the emission lines 51 the spin radial velocity curve the radial velocities were phasefolded using 30 bins on the quadratic spin ephemeris of hellier sproats 1992 where spin maximum was defined as 67 0 figure 5 shows the variation of the h h and h narrow components with maximum blueshift is seen at 67 079 for h and at 67 077 for h whereas for h maximum blueshift is seen at 67 090 it should be noted that h and h h have not been observed simultaneously and so both data sets probably sample the spin phases at different orbital phases figure 6 shows the h narrow component 1200 km s1 and the broadbase component 3500 km s1 overplotted the two components are in phase the radial velocity variation with the spin period of the h and h broadbase component could not be detected possibly due to velocity cancellation we discuss this in section 6 52 spin tomograms and trailed spectra spin tomograms of ex hya were constructed by hellier 1999 but revealed little information also belle et al 2005 observed no coherent emission sites on their tomograms folded on the spin phase the h and the h bpm and mem spin tomograms from 2001 however have revealed a coherent emission site between vx 500 km s1 and 1000 km s1 which is evidence of emission from the accretion curtains figures 7 and 8 but it is a well known fact that since the spin period is 23 of the orbital period in ex hya orbital cycle variations do not smear out when folded on the spin phase but repeat every 3 spin cycles hellier et al 1987 this is thought to be the origin of most of the structure in the emission lines at velocities 1000 km s1 hellier 1999 to address this problem phaseinvariant subtraction is performed where emission that does not vary with the spin cycle is subtracted from the data this is achieved by measuring minimum flux at each wavelength and subtracting this value the results are shown in the second panels from the top of figure 8 it should be mentioned though that even subtracting the invariant part of the line profiles does not guarantee that the influence of the orbital period variations has been completely removed c 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 spectroscopic study of the ip ex

bottom panels are the reconstruction of the averagesubtracted data the fourth and bottom panels are also plotted on the same scale except for h panels the lookup table of this figure is such that the brightest emission features appear with decreasing intensity from black to light grey a spinwave to differentiate it from the swave which is normally caused by the bright spot in the h trailed spectra figure 8 was detected from the data after the phaseinvariant subtraction was performed this is the first detection of modulation over the spin cycle in the optical emission line data of ex hya this spinwave can be seen in the trailed spectra before but hard to see and after subtraction of the phaseinvariant line profile the narrow peak component is responsible for this spinwave which is shown exc 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 panded in the second column of panels in figure 8 the narrow peak component was selected by hand over a velocity range of 500 km s1 the spinwave shows maximum blueshift near phase 10 and maximum redshift near phase 05 and has an amplitude of 500 km s1 the h tomogram shows corresponding emission near the 3 oclock position blob of emission right at the edge of the map around 500 km s1 dfts show lower amplitude 40 km s1 for h and 130 140 km s1 for h and h probably due to dilution by stationary material also the h mem tomogram shows stronger emission that peaks in a broad structure at lower velocities vx 200 km s1 200 km s1 around the 56 oclock position circular motion gives rise to low or zero radial velocities when the motion is perpendicular to the line of sight and the emission seen around the 56 oclock position could not be from such velocities since it shows maximum blueshift at 67 02 025 similar emission was observed in a polar and was thought to be due to material that has just been decelerated after having attached to the magnetic field lines schwarz et al 2005 we discuss an alternative explanation in section 6 the emission near the edge n

spectra are shown at the second panels doppler maps constructed from the phaseinvariant subtracted spectra are shown in the bottom panels the doppler maps were constructed using the bpm and are shown on the same velocity scale with the trailed spectra the lookup table is as in figure 3 of the tomogram at 500 km s1 shows maximum blueshift at 67 10 and therefore cannot be due to motion perpendicular to the line of sight either the h trailed spectra also show emission coupled to the spinwave near 67 01 06 that extends to high velocities in the red a similar situation to that seen the in orbital tomograms due to the hvc section 41 the corresponding emission in the h tomograms extending to higher velocities in the red spectral region is not clear both the h and h phaseinvariant subtracted trailed spectra show three weakintensity spinwaves the most clearly visible of the three is phased with maximum redshift near 67 03 04 with an estimated velocity amplitude of 900 km s1 and corresponds to the emission near the 3 oclock position in the tomogram figure 8 the reconstructed trailed spectra reproduce the observed data the h and h trailed spectra in figure 7 seem to support these results the emission observed near the 3 oclock position in the tomograms has also been seen in other ips such as ao psc and fo aqr hellier 1999 and was interpreted as emanating from the upper accretion curtain the spinwaves are weak in intensity though and more data are needed to support these results 6 discussion of the orbital and spin data the generally accepted model of ex hya has the material leaving the secondary star through the l1 point passing via a stream of material which orbits about the white dwarf to form an accretion figure 8 h h and h trailed spectra of 2001 folded on the spin period are shown in the top panels and the phaseinvariant subtracted trailed spectra are shown in the second panels from the top mem spin doppler tomograms constructed from the phaseinvariant subtracted spectra are shown in the third panels with the reconstructed spectra in the bottom panels the spin wave observed in the h phaseinvariant subtracted trailed spectra which was caused by the h narrow component is shown expanded on a smaller velocity scale the first column of panels are plotted between 1500 km s1 and 1500 km s1 and the last two column are plotted between 2000 km s1 and 2000 km s1 the lookup table is as in figure 4 disc the magnetic field lines of the white dwarf which form accretion curtains above and below the orbital plane channel the material from the disc starting from the corotation radius rco where the disc is truncated by the field lines to the surface of the white dwarf hellier et al 1987 rosen et al 1991 king wynn 1999 challenged this model by arguing that systems with pspin porb 01 cannot possess keplerian discs since this implies rco rcir they showed that the spin equilibrium state in ex hya is determined by rco b where b is the distance to the l1 point in this model the accretion curtains extend to near the l1 point and ex hya resembles an asynchronous polar where most of the material accretes via the stream king wynn 1999 wynn 2000 belle et al 2002 revised the model of ex hya after they showed that their euv data support the model of king wynn c 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 spectroscopic study of the ip ex hydrae in quiescence 1999 their revised model suggested that the magnetic field in ex hya forms a large accretion curtain extending to the outer edge of the roche lobe causing  part or all of the nonkeplerian disc hereafter the ring of material or the ring to rotate with the white dwarf  an extended bulge later belle et al 2005 showed that there was vertically extended material vem obscuring the swave emission during 98 057 087 and evidence for overflowing stream accretion in ex hya and  the ring of material to feel magnetic force at the regions of the ring close to the poles causing the ring material at these locations to be controlled by the magnetic field forming two chunks along the accretion ring that rotate with the white dwarf recently norton et al 2004 2004a have shown that for systems with pspin porb 072 when the mass ratio is smaller at q 02 the material forms a ring near the edge of the primary roche lobe from where accretion curtains funnel down to the white dwarf surface in agreement with king wynn 1999 and belle et al 2002 the material is fed from the ring ringfed accretion and channeled along the magnetic field lines when the angle between the white dwarf spin axis and magnetic dipole axis is small ie 30 which is true for ex hya the discussion by eisenbart et al 2002 on the iruv flux distribution in ex hya implies a disc isobaric and isothermal with an outer radius of 161010 cm and a thickness of 2108 cm and an assumed central hole of 6109 cm but eisenbart et al 2002 suggested that the structure could also be a ring with a larger inner radius in line with the suggestion of king wynn 1999 belle et al 2002 and norton et al 2004 they found that the disc component contains about 16 of the total flux which is a bit more than expected from gravitational energy release at the inner radius rin 6 109 cm our spectroscopic data support both the model of belle et al 2002 and norton et al 2004 in which material from a ring circling the white dwarf and corotating with the magnetic field lines at the outer edge of the roche lobe is accreted by the white dwarf the presence of the bright spot revealed by the trailed spectra the dfts of the radial velocities and the doppler maps figures 3 and 4 suggest the presence of a disc or ring of material extending to near the roche lobe radius around the white dwarf when comparing the 1991 and 2001 tomograms for the h they appear to be in the same state or similar given the fact that they are ten years apart it is reassuring that the fact that the two groups of lines have not been measured simultaneously is not a significant problem in the analysis more importantly a spin pulse modulated at velocities consistent with those of the material circulating at the outer edge of the disc 500 600 km s1 figures 1 and 2 was detected and provides evidence for corotation of the extended accretion curtains with the ring material as discussed in section 52 these low radial velocities mentioned above were not caused by motion perpendicular to the line of sight near the white dwarf neither were they caused by velocity cancellation as will be shown later a spin wave was detected in the spinfolded trailed spectra of h figure 8 with a velocity semiamplitude of 500600 km s1 the spin wave shows maximum blueshift near phase 67 10 when the upper magnetic pole is pointed away from the observer and maximum redshift near phase 67 05 the h equivalent widths show maximum flux near 67 10 this picture is consistent with the accretion curtain model of ips and is possible if accretion occurs via a discring the spin tomograms figures 7 c 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 and 8 show evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from 500 km s1 to high velocities 1000 km s1 suggesting that material is channeled along the field lines from the outer ring the h narrow and broad base components show similar phase variation suggesting same position of maximum radial velocity as shown in figures 6 and 9 line oa this indicates that material is channeled from the ring at low velocities to high velocities along the field lines a mass ratio of q 02 was measured from our data and so the period ratio pspin porb 068 is consistent with the ring accretion model of norton et al 2004 decreased prominence of the narrow swave component around 98 057 087 figure 3 and 4 was observed and suggests the presence of vem at the outer edge of the ring of material obscuring the emission at these phases the presence of the overflow stream may be infered from this observation belle et al 2005 but direct evidence comes from orbital doppler tomograms which show an asymmetry in the emission where more emission is observed from the secondary roche lobe to the lower left quadrant than from the opposite side averagesubtracted orbital tomograms show this emission at higher velocities 9001000 km s1 figures 3 and 4 and it corresponds to the hvc observed in the trailed spectra which is modulated with a velocity semiamplitude of 1000 km s1 this hvc is reminiscent of that detected by rosen et al 1987 in the trailed spectra of the am her system v834 cen their hvc was blueshifted with a velocity of 900 km s1 and was said to be produced in the stream close to the white dwarf the only difference is that there was no evidence of the hvc emission when it was expected to be seen redward of another component mediumvelocity component in their data whereas in ex hya the evidence of the hvc emission is missing between 98 03 085 the hvc emission is maximally blueshifted at 98 03 04 this phasing is consistent with the expected phase of impact of a stream of material from the secondary with the disc or of the overflow stream material freefalling onto the magnetosphere of the primary hellier et al 1989 support for overflow stream is also provided by spin tomograms where emission is observed on the upper accretion curtain with velocities consistent with stream velocities this suggests that this emission site may also have resulted due to impact of overflow stream with the magnetosphere the resulting emission is receding from the observer at maximum redshift near 67 04 figure 8 in agreement with the accretion curtain model the model of king wynn 1999 is not fully supported by our observations since it predicts direct accretion via a stream our observations however fit the models of norton et al 2004 and belle et al 2002 2005 there is evidence for strong h emission of the narrow swave component in the spin tomograms centred around 100 km s1 figure 8 that is not accounted for by these models this emission shows maximum blueshift at phase 67 02 suggesting that these are rotational velocities or a combination of streaming and rotational velocities of the antiphased motion of a source locked to the white dwarf one possible explanation is that this emission comes from the opposite pole of the white dwarf at a radial distance of 6109 cm 8rwd siegel 1989 found that the eclipsed optical source in ex hya is centred at a radial distance of 15109 cm 2rwd which is about four times closer to the white dwarf compared to our result this could be the same emission region but in our observations the emission is spread out possibly due to the quality of the data and this could account for the difference in the radial distance values quoted above but we cannot imagine a geometry where such low

to be substantially expanded by 10 62 the revised model of ex hya observer figure 9 a depiction of the regions where h was formed both the narrow and broad base components fall along the same radial direction oa resulting in similar phase variation locities can dominate over streaming velocities along the field lines near the white dwarf we therefore suggest that this is evidence for material that is diverted out of the orbital plane since one of the assumptions of doppler tomography is that everything lies on the plane it is not possible to locate the exact position of this emission relative to the white dwarf 61 white dwarf and secondary masses hellier et al 1987 showed that maximum line widths of 3500 km s1 constrain the mass of the white dwarf and a freefall velocity of this magnitude could be achieved for white dwarf masses greater than 048 m we found m1 050 005m in good agreement with the results obtained from recent studies by hoogerwerf et al 2004 beuermann et al 2003 and vande putte et al 2003 for the secondary we derived m2 010 001 m from the secondary massperiod relation of smith dhillon 1988 and this value agrees with that obtained by vande putte et al 2003 we propose a model where one of the two chunks alluded to by belle et al 2002 which are formed by the magnetic pull along the accretion ring corotates with the accretion curtains at the outer edge of the roche lobe at 500600 km s1 giving rise to the pulsation of emission at the spin period which we observe in our data while the other is hidden by the accretion curtain below the ring of material the resulting emission is maximally blueshifted near 67 08 figure 5 in the accretion curtain model at 67 05 in the spin cycle minimum flux due to higher opacity is observed when the upper accretion pole of the white dwarf is pointed towards the observer hellier et al 1987 and so the phasing mentioned above is compatible with the motion of a rotating accretion funnel this is illustrated in figure 10 where the position of the observer at pulse maximum is indicated and the axis of the magnetic pole is shown the disruption of the disc by the magnetic field at the outer disc is illustrated and part of the disc corotating with the magnetosphere is shown at a corotation radius rc b a0500 0227 log m  3 1010 cm the material is ro1 tating at a velocity of v gm b 500 km s in good agreement with the observations also a rotation velocity of 600 km s1 was measured from the spectra and the radial distance from the star to the ring of material was found to be 3 1010 cm which is similar to b for a white dwarf mass of 05 m keplerian motion about the white dwarf had to be assumed in these calculations at this radius the accretion curtain is also rotating at a velocity of 2rco pspin 500 km s1  6 1012 ergs cm2 s1 64 integrated over one spin cycle of the original line fluxes that is contained in the averagec 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 spectroscopic study of the ip ex hydrae in quiescence subtracted profile of h shows radial velocity variations with the spin period assuming that h and h also show a similar flux variation h and h spin tomograms also show a lowvelocity swave but this result is not secured due to poor quality of data the total line fluxes showing radial velocity variations with the spin period can be estimated to be 2 1011 ergs cm2 s1 for the three emission lines this is 210 of the total disc flux eisenbart et al 2002 suggesting that only part of the ring corotates with the white dwarf while the rest of the material may be involved in a near keplerian motion this is a rough comparison since the flux is integrated over one spin cycle for h h and h in our data whereas eisenbart et al 2002 derived their total flux values from one spectrum over the wavelength range 912 24000 while some of the ring material corotates with the accretion curtains ie remains in the disc rather than being immediately channeled along the field lines some is channeled along the field lines at 500 km s1 towards the white dwarf there is also some material that overflows the ring and attaches onto the magnetic field lines the overflow stream hits the magnetosphere probably causing a second bright spot on the slowly rotating magnetosphere figure 10 the overflow stream is irradiated by the white dwarf in its inner regions close to the white dwarf the regions facing the white dwarf this results in the hvc emission being obscured at 98 04 09 which are phases where the stream is viewed from behindopposite the side facing the white dwarf hiding the irradiated inner regions hvc emission from the stream is blueshifted when that from the narrow swave component shows maximum redshift near 98 025 the two swaves intersect explaining the asymmetry in the brightness of the swave seen near 98 025 figure 4 the overflow stream curls nearly behind the white dwarf and it is truncated by the field when the upper magnetic pole is facing the stream ferrario wickramasinghe 1993 and ferrario wickramasinghe king 1993 showed that in ips the accretion curtain below the orbital plane can contribute in the radial velocities of a system if it can be seen either through the central hole of the truncated disc or from below the disc or both this effect will result in velocity cancellation due to nearly equal quantities of material that are blueshifted and redshifted on the accretion curtains ferrario wickramasinghe king 1993 in ex hya where the inclination is high 78 and the disruption radius is large 40 rw d for a white dwarf mass of 05 m as proposed in figure 10 it is clear that we see spinvarying emission from two opposite magnetic poles producing a fairly symmetric structure in the spinfolded line profiles hellier et al 1987 rosen et al 1991 if emission from these opposite poles is cancelling out then the sum will have a much lower velocity this could explain the near zero and low amplitude of the radial velocity variation at the spin period of the h and h and h 6 40 km s1 broadbase component respectively see also hellier et al 1987 and ferrario wickramasinghe king 1993 one could take this argument further by suggesting that the spin modulation we observe in our data at velocities near 500 km s1 figures 1 and 2 is just the slight asymmetries between the two poles the resulting velocity could just be a measure of the degree to which the poles cancel their velocities near 3500 km s1 coel hellier private communication this however cannot be the case for h and h since these two emission lines show motion that is consistent with that of a rotating object suggesting that the line profiles are not dominated by the infall velocities at the two opposite accretion poles if they were produced close to the white dwarf then maximum rotational velocity near 3500 km c 0000 ras mnras 000 000000 s1 would be 2rpspin 30 km s1 which is much smaller than  500 km s1 however rotional velocities close to the ring are  500 km s1 for h however we observe maximum blueshift at 67 10 and so velocity due to cancellation anywhere between 0 and 3500 km s1 are expected depending on how much the two poles cancel if both accretion curtains are still visible and symmetric at large radii which is possible as suggested by ferrario wickramasinghe king 1993 and our model velocity cancellation will still result in smaller amplitudes than those of  500 km s1 observed in our data this would then count against the argument above furthermore h orbital doppler tomograms show strong emission at the bright spot if our model is correct the field lines should also attract this h dominated material which is chanelled along the field lines as already shown above the velocity of this material due to streaming motion near the outer ring is less than that of the h broadbase component close to the white dwarf as expected a strong constraint on our model is that the disruption radius of ex hya has been shown to be at 59109 cm hellier et al 1987 beuermann et al 2003 which implies a white dwarf magnetic moment of 7 1031 g cm3 for our model this would imply that the accretion curtains do not extend to near the roche lobe radius the theoretical analysis of king wynn 1999 and wynn 2000 however has shown that equilibrium rotation is possible if the magnetic moment in ex hya falls within the range of 1033 6 6 1034 g cm3 these are comparable to weakest field am hers below the period gap and that ex hya could possess such magnetic moments is supported to a certain extent by the averagesubtracted trailed spectra of ex hya that are reminiscent of emission lines seen in some polars eg v834 cen as discussed above ef eri crampton et al 1981 cowley et al 1982 qs tel romerocolmenero et al 2003 and vv pup diaz 1994 furthermore cumming 2002 raised the possibility that the magnetic fields in ips are buried by the material due to high accretion rates and so are not really as low as they appear the ring structure in ex hya could imply higher accretion rates in ex hya than previously thought since the capacity of the ring of material to store matter may be low when compared to that of a classical disc resulting in the accretion of more material than in a classical disc case 7 summary optical observations of ex hya and the analysis have suggested that large accretion curtains extending to a distance close to the l1 point exist in this system the dfts and spin tomograms have for the first time provided evidence for corotation of the field lines with the ring material near the roche lobe also tomography and the phasing of the spin waves have suggested that feeding by the accretion curtains of the material from the ring ringfed accretion takes place these findings support the models of belle et al 2002 and norton et al 2004 for ex hya and the simulations done by norton et al 2004a which have shown that for systems with the parameters of ex hya the accreting material forms a ring at the outer edge of the primary roche lobe from where accretion curtains funnel down to the white dwarf surface evidence for stream overflow accretion has been observed the hvc caused by the overflow stream disappeared at 98 04 09 due to obscuration by the stream obscuration of the nsc at 98 057 087 suggested the presence of the vem which was irradiated by the white dwarf in its inner regions the h broadbase component shows a radial velocity variation with the spin period whereas that of h and h could not be n mhlahlo dah buckley vs dhillon sb potter b warner and pa woudt detected the lowamplitude velocity variations modulated at the spin period for h and for h and h is explained in terms of velocity cancellation effects we have provided an explanation for the asymmetry in the intensity of the narrow swave component seen in ex hya trailed spectra in the optical the narrow swave component and the hvc cross at 98 025 resulting in the asymmetry in brightness that we observe at these phases the spinfolded trailed spectra are not of good quality and more data are needed to confirm these results acknowledgments nm would like to acknowledge financial support from the sainsburylinsbury fellowship trust and the university of
