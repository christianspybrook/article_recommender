arxiv07040011v3 mathnt 20 aug 2008 computing genus 2 hilbertsiegel modular forms over q 5 via the jacquetlanglands correspondence clifton cunningham and lassina dembl abstract in this paper we present an algorithm for computing hecke eigensystems of hilbertsiegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number  one we give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field q 5 in those examples we identify hilbertsiegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from hilbert eigenforms introduction let f be a real quadratic field of narrow class number one and let b be the unique up to isomorphism quaternion algebra over f which is ramified at both archimedean places of f and unramified everywhere else let gu2 b be the unitary similitude group of b 2 this is the set of qrational points of an algebraic group gb defined over q the group gb is an inner form of g resfq gsp4 such that gb r is compact modulo its centre these notions are reviewed at the beginning of section 1 in this paper we develop an algorithm which computes automorphic forms on gb in the following sense given an ideal n in of and an integer k greater than 2 the algorithm returns the hecke eigensystems of all automorphic forms f of level n and parallel weight k more precisely given a prime p in of the algorithm returns the hecke eigenvalues of f at p and hence the euler factor lpf s for each eigenform f of level n and parallel weight k the algorithm is a generalization of the one developed in d1 2005 to the genus 2 case although we have only described the algorithm in the case of a real quadratic field in this paper it should be clear from our presentation that it can be adapted to any totally real number field of narrow class number one the jacquetlanglands correspondence of the title refers to the conjectural map jl gb g from automorphic representations of gb to automorphic representations of g which is injective matches lfunctions and enjoys other properties compatible with the principle of functoriality date june 11 2013 1991 mathematics subject classification primary 11f41 hilbert and hilbertsiegel modular forms key words and phrases hilbertsiegel modular forms jacquetlanglands correspondence brandt matrices satake parameters clifton cunningham and lassina dembl in particular the image of the jacquetlanglands correspondence is to be contained in the space of holomorphic automorphic representations if we admit this conjecture then the algorithm above provides a way to produce examples of cuspidal hilbertsiegel modular forms of genus 2 over f and allows us to compute the lfactors of the corresponding automorphic representations for arbitrary finite primes p of f in fact we are also able to use these calculations to provide evidence for the jacquetlanglands correspondence itself by comparing the euler factors we find with those of known hilbertsiegel modular forms obtained by lifting this we do in the final section of the paper where we observe that some of the euler factors we compute match those of lifts of hilbert modular forms for the primes we computed although this does not definitively establish that these hilbertsiegel modular forms are indeed lifts in principle one can establish equality in this way using an analogue of the sturm bound the first systematic approach to siegel modular forms from a computational viewpoint is due to skoruppa sk 1992 who used jacobi symbols to generate spaces of such forms his algorithm which has been extensively exploited by ryan r 2006 applies only to the case of full level structure more recently faber and van der geer fvdg1 2004 and fvdg2 2004 also produced examples of siegel modular forms by counting points on hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 again their results are available only in the full level structure case the most substantial progress toward the computation of siegel modular forms for proper level structure is by gunnells gu 2000 who extended the theory of modular symbols to the symplectic group sp4 q however this work does not see the cuspidal cohomology which is the only part of the cohomology which is relevant to arithmetic geometric applications to the best of our knowledge there are no numerical examples of hilbertsiegel modular forms for proper level structure in the literature with the exception of those produced from liftings of hilbert modular forms the outline of the paper is as follows in section 1 we recall the basic properties of hilbertsiegel modular forms and algebraic automorphic forms together with the jacquetlanglands correspondence in section 2 we give a detailed description of our algorithm finally in section 3 we present numerical results for the quadratic field q 5 acknowledgements during the course of the

thank the pims institute for their postdoctoral fellowship support and the university of calgary for its hospitality computing hilbertsiegel modular forms 1 hilbertsiegel modular forms and the jacquetlanglands correspondence throughout this paper f denotes a real quadratic field of narrow class number one the two archimedean places of f and the real embeddings of f will both be denoted v0 and v1 for every a f we write a0 resp a1 for the image of a under v0 resp v1 the ring of integers of f is denoted by of for every prime ideal p in of the completion of f and of at p will be denoted by fp and ofp respectively let b be the unique up to isomorphism totally definite quaternion algebra over f which is unramified at all finite primes of f we fix a maximal order ob of b also we choose a splitting field kf of b that is galois over q and such that there exists an isomorphism j ob z ok m2 ok m2 ok where m2 a denotes the ring of 2 2matrices with entries from a ring a for every finite prime p in f we fix an isomorphism bp  m2 fp which restricts to an isomorphism from ob p onto m2 ofp the algebraic group g resfq gsp4 is defined as follows for any qalgebra a the set of arational points of g is given by j2 t g j2 ga gl4 a q f g a q f where j2 12 0 this group admits an integral model with arational points for every zalgebra a given by j2 t g j2 gz a gl4 a z of g a z of for any qalgebra a the conjugation on b extends in a natural way to the matrix algebra m2 b q a the algebraic group gb q is defined as follows for any qalgebra a the set of arational points of gb is given by  t gb 12 g a m2 b q a gb a q f this group also admits an integral model with arational points for every zalgebra given by  t gb 12 gz a m2 ob z a gb a z of the group gb q is an inner form of gq such that gb r is compact modulo its center combining the isomorphism j see above with con jugation by a permutation matrix we obtain an isomorphism gb z ok clifton cunningham and lassina dembl gz ok which we fix from now on for every prime ideal p in f the splitting of gb at p amounts to the splitting of the quaternion algebra b at p we refer to d1 2005 for further details by the choice of the quaternion algebra b we have gb q  gq we denote the finite adles of q resp z by q resp 11 hilbertsiegel modular forms we fix an integer k 3 and for simplicity we restrict ourselves to hilbertsiegel modular forms of parallel weight k the real embeddings v0 and v1 of f extend to gq gsp4 f in a natural way we denote by gsp 4 f the subgroup of elements with totally positive similitude factor g we recall that the siegel upperhalf plane of genus 2 is defined by h2 gl2 c t and im is positive definite we also recall that gsp 4 f acts on h2 by a b 0 1 a0 0 b0 c0 0 d0 1 a1 1 b1 c1 1 d1 1 c d this induces an action on the space of functions f h22 c by a b c d f k g i k2 f detci i di k let n be an ideal in of and set a b 0 n  gsp4 of c 0n c d a hilbertsiegel modular form of level n and parallel weight k is a holomorphic function f h22 c such that  0 n f k f the space of hilbertsiegel modular forms of parallel weight k and level n is denoted mk n each f mk n admits a fourier expansion which by the koecher principle takes the form  h22 f aq e2itrq where q m2 f runs over all symmetric totally positive and semidefinite matrices a hilbertsiegel modular forms f is a cusp form if for all gsp 4 f the constant term in the fourier expansion of f k is zero the space of hilbertsiegel cusp forms is denoted sk n computing hilbertsiegel modular forms 12 the hecke algebra the space sk n comes equipped with a hecke action which we now recall take u gsp 4 f m4 of and write the finite disjoint union 0 n u0 n 0 n ui then the hecke operator 0 n u0 n on sk n is given by 0 n u0 n f f k ui let p be a prime ideal in of and let p be a totally positive generator of p let t1 p and t2 p be the hecke operators corresponding to the double 0 n cosets of the symplectic similitude matrices 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p 0 and 0 0 p2 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 p respectively we remind the reader of the symplectic form j2 fixed at the beginning of section 1 the hecke algebra tk n is the zalgebra generated by the operators t1 p and t2 p where p runs over all primes not dividing n 13 algebraic hilbertsiegel autormorphic forms we only consider level structure of siegel type namely we define the compact open subgroup u0 n of gq by u0 n gsp4 ofp u0 pep pep and a b u0 p  gsp4 ofp c 0 mod p c d where n the weight representation is defined as follows let lk be the representation of gsp4 c of highest weight k 3 k 3 we let vk lk lk and define the complex representation k vk by k gb r glvk where the action on the first factor is via v0 and the action on the second one is via v1 the space of algebraic hilbertsiegel modular forms of weight k and level n is given by mkb n f gb qu0 n vk gb q f k f clifton cunningham and lassina dembl where f k x f x for all x gb qu0 n when k 3 we let ikb n f gb qgb qu0 n c f is constant then the space of algebraic hilbertsiegel cusp forms of weight k and level n is defined by if k 3  mkb n sk n mkb n ikb n if k 3 the action of the hecke algebra on skb n is given as follows for any u gq write the finite disjoint union u0 n uu0 n ui u0 n and define u0 n uu0 n skb n skb n f 7 f k u0 n uu0 n f k u0 n uu0 n x f xui x gq for any prime p n let p be a local uniformizer at p the local hecke algebra at p is generated by the hecke operators t1 p and t2 p corresponding to the double u0 n cosets 1 p and 2 p of the matrices 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0  and 0 p 02 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 p respectively we let tb k n be the hecke algebra generated by t1 p and t2 p for all primes p n 14 the jacquetlanglands correspondence the hecke modules sk n and skb n are related by the following conjecture known as the jacquetlanglands correspondence for symplectic similitude groups conjecture 1 the hecke algebras tk n and tb k n are isomorphic and there is a compatible isomorphism of hecke modules sk n skb n it is common but perhaps not entirely accurate to attribute this conjecture to jacquetlanglands to the best of our knowledge the correspondence in this form was first discussed by ihara ih 1964 in the case f q in ib 1984 ibukiyama provided some numerical evidence on the other hand it is appropriate to refer to conjecture 1 as the jacquetlanglands correspondence for gsp4 since it is an analogue of the jacquetlanglands computing hilbertsiegel modular forms correspondence for gl2 which relates automorphic representations of the multiplicative group of a quaternion algebra with certain automorphic representations of gl2 see jl 1970 both correspondences are in turn special consequences of the principle of functoriality as expounded by langlands finally it appears that conjecture 1 may soon be a theorem due to the work of so 2008 and the forthcoming book by james arthur on automorphic representations of classical groups 2 the algorithm in this section we present the algorithm we used in order to compute the hecke module of algebraic hilbertsiegel modular forms the main assumption in this section is that the class number of the principal genus of gb is 1 we refer to d3 2007 to see how one can relax this condition on the class number we recall that since b is totally definite gb satisfies proposition 14 in gross gr 1999 thus the group gb r is compact modulo its centre and gb zof is finite for any prime p in f let fp of p be the residue field at p and define the reduction map m2 ob p m4 fp g 7 g where we use the splitting of obp that was fixed at the beginning of section 1 now choose a totally positive generator p of p and put 1 p u m2 ob ut p12 and rankg 2 2 p u m2 ob ut p2 12 and rankg 1 we let h02 n gu0 n then the group acts on h02 n thus on the space of functions f h02 n vk by x h02 n f k x f x theorem 2 there is an isomorphism of hecke modules mkb n f h02 n vk f k f where the hecke action on the right hand side is given by f k t1 p f k u u1 p f k t2 p u2 p f k u proof the canonical map  gb zgb u0 n gb qgb qu0 n is an injection making use of the fact that the class number in the principal genus of gb is one gb q gb qgb z we see that is in fact a clifton cunningham and lassina dembl bijection since each element f mkb n is determined by its values on a set of coset representatives of gb qgb qu0 n the map induces an isomorphism of complex vector spaces mkb n f h02 n vk f k f f 7 f we make this into a hecke module isomorphism by defining the hecke action on the right hand side as indicated in the statement of the theorem in the rest of this section we explain the main steps of the algorithm provided by theorem 2 21 the quotientq h02 n keeping the notations of the previous section we recall that n pn pep let p be a prime dividing n and consider the rank 4 free ofp pep module l ofp pep endowed with the symplectic pairing h i given by the matrix j2 12 0 where 12 is the identity matrix in m2 ofp pep let m be a rank 2 ofp pep submodule which is a direct factor in l we say that m is isotropic if hu vi 0 for all u v m we recall that gsp4 ofp acts transitively on the set of rank 2 isotropic ofp pep submodules of l and that the stabilizer of the submodule generated by e1 1 0 0 0t and h02 pep gsp4 ofp u0 pep e2 0 1 0 0t is u0 pep the quotient is the set of rank 2 isotropic ofp pep submodules of l via the reduction map f of n the quotient gz u0 n can be identified with the product h02 n h02 pep the cardinality of h02 n is extremely useful and is determined using the following lemma lemma 1 let p be a prime in f and ep 1 an integer then the cardinality of the set h02 pep is given by h02 pep np3ep 1 np 1np2 1 proof for ep 1 the cardinality of the lagrange variety over the finite field fp of p is given by np 1np2 1 proceed by induction on ep we have more to say about elements of h02 pep in subsection 25 computing hilbertsiegel modular forms 22 brandt matrices let f x1 xh be a fundamental domain for the action of on h02 n and for each i let i be the stabilizer of xi then every element in mkb n is completely determined by its values on f thus there is an isomorphism of complex spaces mkb n vki vki 7 f xi where is the subspace of i invariants in vk for any x y h02 n we let 1 x y p u 1 p ux y 2 x y p u 2 p ux y proposition 3 the actions of the hecke operators ts p s 1 2 are given by the brandt matrices bs p bsij p where bsji p vk j  vki v 7 v us xi xj p u1 u proof the proof of proposition 3 follows the lines of d1 2005 3 23 computing the group gb z it is enough to compute the subgroup  consisting of the elements in gb z with similitude factor 1 but it is easy to see that ff u 0 0 u u v ob u v ob 0 v v 0 1 is the group of norm 1 elements where ob 24 computing the sets 1 p and 2 p let us consider the quadratic form on the vector space v b 2 given by v f a b 7 a b nra nrb where nr is the reduced norm on b this determines an inner form v v f u v 7 hu vi an element of 1 p resp 2 p is a unitary matrix m2 ob with respect to this inner form such that the norm of each row is p resp p2 and the rank of the reduced matrix is 1 so we first start by computing 2 such that u resp u 2 and all the vectors u a b ob 2 of the same for each such vector u we compute the vectors v c d ob clifton cunningham and lassina dembl a b belongs c d to 1 p resp 2 p when its reduction mod p has the appropriate rank we list all these matrices up to equivalence and stop when we reach the right cardinality norm such that hu vi 0 the corresponding matrix 25 the implementation of the algorithm the implementation of the algorithm is similar to that of d1 2005 however it is important to note how we represent elements in h02 n so that we can retrieve them easily once stored as in d1 2005 we choose to work with the product h02 pep h02 n using pluckers coordinates we can view h02 pep as a closed subspace of p5 ofp pep we then represent each element in h02 pep by choosing a point x a0 a5 u v p5 ofp pep such that the submodule m generated by u and v is a lagrange submodule and the first invertible coordinate is scaled to 1 remark 1 in lp 2002 lansky and pollack describe an algorithm which computes algebraic modular forms on the same inner form of gsp4 q that we use we would like to note that there are some differences between the two algorithms although lp 2002 also uses the flag variety h02 n in order to determine the double coset space gb qgb qu0 n it later returns to the adelic setting in order to compute the brandt matrices in contrast theorem 2 and proposition 3 allow us to avoid that unnecessary step by describing the hecke action on the flag variety h02 n directly as a result we get an algorithm that is more efficient 3 numerical examples f q 5 and b 1f1 in this section we provide some numerical examples using the quadratic field f q 5 it is proven in k hashimoto and t ibukiyama hi 1980 that for the hamilton quaternion algebra b over f the class number of the principal genus of gb is one we use our algorithm to compute all the systems of hecke eigenvalues of hilbertsiegel cusp forms of weight 3 and level n that are defined over real quadratic fields where n runs over all prime ideals of norm less than 50 we then determine which of the forms we obtained are possible lifts of hilbert cusp forms by comparing the hecke eigenvalues for those primes 31 tables of hilbertsiegel cusp forms of parallel weight 3 in table 1 we list all the systems of eigenvalues of hilbertsiegel cusp forms of weight 3 and level n that are defined over real quadratic fields where n runs over all prime ideals in f of norm less than 50 here are the conventions we use in the tables computing hilbertsiegel modular forms 1 for a quadratic field k of discriminant d we let d be a generator of the ring of integers ok of k 2 the first row contains the level n given in the format normn for some generator f of n and the dimensions of the relevant spaces 3 the second row lists the hecke operators that have been computed 4 for each eigenform f the hecke eigenvalues are given in a row and the last entry of that row indicates if the form f is a probable lift 5 the levels and the eigenforms are both listed up to galois conjugation for an eigenform f and a given prime p n let a1 p f and a2 p f be the eigenvalues of the hecke operators t1 p and t2 p respectively then the euler factor lpf s is given for example in as 2001 34 by lpf s qpq s 1 where qpx 1 a1 p f x b1 p f x2 a1 p f q 2k3 x3 q 4k6 x4 b1 p f a1 p f 2 a2 p f q 2k4 q np 32 tables of hilbert cusp forms of parellel weight 4 in table 2 we list all the hilbert cusp forms of parallel weight 4 and level n that are defined over real quadratic fields with n running over all prime ideals of norm less than 50 they are computed by using the algorithm in d1 2005 we use this data in order to determine the forms in table 1 that are possible lifts from gl2 33 lifts there are two types of lifts from gl2 to gsp4 the first one corresponds to the homomorphism of lgroups determined by the long root embedding into gsp4 and the second one by the short root embedding see lp 2002 for more details let f be a hilbert cusp form of parallel weight k and level n with hecke eigenvalues ap f where p is a prime not dividing n let be the lift of f to gsp4 via the long root and the one via the short root then the hecke eigenvalues of are given by a1 p ap f np a2 p ap f np  np2 np np 1 np2 1 and the hecke eigenvalues of are given by a1 p ap f 3 np 63k  2 ap f np a2 p ap f 4 np42k 3 ap f 2 np3k np2 1 the second lift is the socalled symmetric cube lifting clifton cunningham and lassina dembl n 4 2 dim m3b n 2 dim  s3 n 1 t1 2 t2 2 t1 5 t2 5 n 5 2 5 t1 2 dim m3b

algorithm has been implemented only for congruence subgroups of siegel type we intend to improve the implementation in the near future so as to include more additional level structures such as the klingen type indeed ramakrishnan and shahidi rs 2007 recently showed the existence of symmetric cube lifts for noncm elliptic curves eq to gsp4 q and their result should hold for other totally real number fields with the level structures of the lifts being of klingen type unfortunately clifton cunningham and lassina dembl those lifts cannot be seen in our  current tables for example there are modular elliptic curves over q 5 whose conductors have norm 31 41 and 49 but the corresponding symmetric cubic lifts do not appear in table 1 we would like to remedy that in our next implementation
