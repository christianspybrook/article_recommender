earthmoon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model with a nonnewtonian approach proposed in the meeting of division of particle and field 2004 american physical society the current behavior of the earthmoon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the moonearth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence the closest distance of the moon to earth was about 259000 km at 45 billion years ago which is far beyond the roches limit the result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the earthmoon system the average dark matter field fluid constant derived from earthmoon system data is 439 1022 s1m1 this model predicts that the marss rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about 438 1022 rad s2 key words dark matter fluid evolution earth moon mars 1 introduction the popularly accepted theory for the formation of the earthmoon system is that the moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the earth at the close of the planetforming period hartmann and davis 1975 since the formation of the earthmoon system it has been evolving at all time scale it is well known that the moon is receding from us and both the earths rotation and moons rotation are slowing the popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the earthmoon system the situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the earthmoon system because the moon is moving away from us and the earth rotation is slowing this means that the moon was closer and the earth rotation was faster in the past creationists argue that based on the tidal friction theory the tidal friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the moon should be greater in the past the distance of the moon would quickly fall inside the roches limit for earth 15500 km in which the moon would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago however geological evidence indicates that the recession of the moon in the past was slower than the present rate i e the recession has been accelerating with time therefore it must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of presentday observations stacey 1977 this was called geological time scale difficulty or lunar crisis and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the tidal friction theory brush 1983 but we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects one possible scenario is that the earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since its inception the geological and physical conditions such as the continent positions and drifting the crust surface temperature fluctuation like the glacialsnowball effect etc at remote past could be substantially different from currently in which the tidal friction could be much less therefore the receding rate of the moon could be slower various tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the earthmoon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the moon at quite a comfortable distance from earth at 45 billion years ago hansen 1982 kagan and maslova 1994 ray et al 1999 finch 1981 slichter 1963 the tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean brush 1983 kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models kagan 1997 those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past and many parameters such as phase lag angle multimode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes etc have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence however those assumptions and parameters are still challenged to certain extent as concoction the second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the earthmoon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant in the meeting of division of particle and field 2004 american physical society university of california at riverside the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model pan 2005 with a nonnewtonian approach the current moon and earth data agree with this model very well this paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of moonearth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions about past geological and physical conditions although the subject of the evolution of the earthmoon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically to the authors knowledge there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model 2 invisible matter in modern cosmology it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy such invisible matter has an antigravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster if the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis then the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current newtonian physics and einsteinian physics and the newtonian physics and einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics if the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis then it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter if the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis then the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the detection limit of the current technology otherwise it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount with such invisible matter in mind we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with nonnewtonian approach for simplicity all invisible matter dark matter dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here 3 the dark matter field fluid model in this proposed model it is assumed that 1 a celestial body rotates and moves in the space which for simplicity is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body the dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore it can have energy exchange with the celestial body and affect the motion of the celestial body 2 the fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics the dark matter field fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i e ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid thus the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid in the manner of a sponge moving thru water the nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown it is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body the dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter the nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown with the assumptions above one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations the common shape of celestial bodies is spherical according to stokess law a rigid nonpermeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low reynolds number experiences a resistance force f f 6rv where v is the moving velocity r is the radius of the sphere and is the fluid viscosity constant the direction of the resistance force f in eq 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v for a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere the force f may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere also f may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction therefore with the combined effects of both fluid and field the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form f 6r 1n mv where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid the r1n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r m is the mass of the sphere and is the dark matter field fluid constant which is equivalent to the direction of the resistance force f in eq 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v the force described by eq 2 is velocitydependent and causes negative acceleration according to newtons second law of motion the equation of motion for the sphere is  6r 1 n mv v v0 exp 6r 1n vt then where v0 is the initial velocity t 0 of the sphere if the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center 1 the gravitational force 2 the centripetal acceleration force and 3 the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid the drag force in eq 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center however if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force then the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center this is the case of interest here if the velocity change in eq 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow therefore the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time the pseudo equilibrium equation is gmm mv 2 where g is the gravitational constant m is the mass of the gravitational center and r is the radius of the orbit inserting v of eq 4 into eq 5 yields exp12r 1 n t r r0 exp12r 1 n t where r0 v02 r0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center note that r exponentially increases with time the increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive force of dark matter field fluid the recessional rate of the sphere is  12r 1 n r the acceleration of the recession is d 2r  12r 1 n r the recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the gravitational center so the recession is faster and faster according to the mechanics of fluids for a rigid nonpermeable sphere rotating about its central axis in the quiescent fluid the torque t exerted by the fluid on the sphere t 8r 3 where is the angular velocity of the sphere the direction of the torque in eq 11 is opposite to the direction of the rotation in the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent dark matter field fluid with angular velocity similar to eq 2 the proposed t exerted on the sphere is t 8 r 1 n m the direction of the torque in eq 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation the torque causes the negative angular acceleration t i where i is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid m r 1 n therefore the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is  20r 1 n solving this equation yields  0 exp 20r 1 n t where 0 is the initial angular velocity one can see that the angular velocity of the sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to its angular velocity for the same celestial sphere combining eq 9 and eq 15 yields 1 d  dt 5 167 1 dr r dt the significance of eq 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and undetermined parameters therefore it is a critical test for this model for two different celestial spheres in the same system combining eq 9 and eq 15 yields 1 d 1  1 dt 1 dr2 r2 dt  r2  r1  167 this is another critical test for this model 4 the current behavior of the earthmoon system agrees with the model the moonearth system is the simplest gravitational system the solar system is complex the earth and the moon experience not only the interaction of the sun but also interactions of other planets let us consider the local earthmoon gravitational system as an isolated local gravitational system ie the influence from the sun and other planets on the rotation and orbital motion of the moon and on the rotation of the earth is assumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other in addition the eccentricity of the moons orbit is small enough to be ignored the data about the moon and the earth from references dickey et al 1994 and lang 1992 are listed below for the readers convenience to verify the calculation because the data may vary slightly with different data sources moon mean radius r 17380 km mass m 73483 1025

of earth 55 05 1022 rad s2 the moons angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the earth receding rate were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the apollo program dickey et al 1994 by inserting the data of the moons rotation and recession into eq 17 the result is  126 10 23 392509 10 8  154 0039 121 10 9 2662 10 6 the distance r in eq 19 is from the moons center to the earths center and the number 384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the moons surface to the earths surface eq 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 167 the result is in accord with the model used here the difference about 78 between the values of 154 and 167 may come from several sources 1 moons orbital is not a perfect circle 2 moon is not a perfect rigid sphere 3 the effect from sun and other planets 4 errors in data 5 possible other unknown reasons the two parameters n and in eq 9 and eq 15 can be determined with two data sets the third data set can be used to further test the model if this model correctly describes the situation at hand it should give consistent results for different motions the values of n and calculated from three different data sets are listed below note the mean distance of the moon to the earth and mean radii of the moon and the earth are used in the calculation the value of n n 064 from the moons rotation 427 1022 s1 m1 from the earths rotation  426 1022 s1 m1 from the moons recession 464 1022 s1 m1 one can see that the three values of are consistent within the range of error in the data the average value of 439 022 1022 s1 m1 by inserting the data of the earths rotation the moons recession and the value of n into eq 18 the result is  55 10 22 392509 10 8 1738000 729 10 5 121 10 9 6371000 1 064  153 014 this is also in accord with the model used here the dragging force exerted on the moons orbital motion by the dark matter field fluid is 111 108 n this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between the moon and the earth 190 1020 n and the torque exerted by the dark matter field fluid on the earths and the moons rotations is t 549 1016 nm and 115 1012 nm respectively 5 the evolution of earthmoon system sonett et al found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was about 192 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the earth sonett et al 1996 according to the model presented here back in that time the length of the day was about 192 hours this agrees very well with sonett et als result another critical aspect of modeling the evolution of the earthmoon system is to give a reasonable estimate of the closest distance of the moon to the earth when the system was established at 45 billion years ago based on the dark matter field fluid model and the above result the closest distance of the moon to the earth was about 259000 km center to center or 250900 km surface to surface at 45 billion years ago this is far beyond the roches limit in the modern astronomy textbook by chaisson and mcmillan chaisson and mcmillan 1993 p173 the estimated distance at 45 billion years ago was 250000 km this is probably the most reasonable number that most astronomers believe and it agrees excellently with the result of this model the closest distance of the moon to the earth by hansens models was about 38 earth radii or 242000 km hansen 1982 according to this model the length of day of the earth was about 8 hours at 45 billion years ago fig 1 shows the evolution of the distance of moon to the earth and the length of day of the earth with the age of the earthmoon system described by this model along with data from kvale et al 1999 sonett et al 1996 and scrutton 1978 one can see that those data fit this model very well in their time range fig 2 shows the geological data of solar days year1 from wells 1963 and from sonett et al 1996 and the description solid line by this dark matter field fluid model for past 900 million years one can see that the model agrees with the geological and fossil data beautifully the important difference of this model with early models in describing the early evolution of the earthmoon system is that this model is based only on current data of the moonearth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier earth rotation and continental drifting based on this model the earthmoon system has been smoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate of the moon has been gradually increasing however this description does not take it into account that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly significant changes in the motions of the earth and the moon such as strong impacts by giant asteroids and comets etc because those impacts are very common in the universe the general pattern of the evolution of the moonearth system described by this model agrees with geological evidence based on eq 9 the recessional rate exponentially increases with time one may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become very large the increase is in fact extremely slow the moons recessional rate will be 304 109 m s1 after 10 billion years and 764 109 m s1 after 20 billion years however whether the moons recession will continue or at some time later another mechanism will take over is not known it should be understood that the tidal friction does affect the evolution of the earth itself such as the surface crust structure continental drifting and evolution of biosystem etc it may also play a role in slowing the earths rotation however such role is not a dominant mechanism unfortunately there is no data available for the changes of the earths orbital motion and all other members of solar system according to this model and above results the recessional rate of the earth should be 686 107 m s1 216 m year1 216 km century1 the length of a year increases about 68 ms and the change of the temperature is 18 108 k year1 with constant radiation level of the sun and the stable environment on the earth the length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80 of the current length of the year however much evidence growthbands of corals and shellfish as well as some other evidences suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the year over the billion years and the earths orbital motion is more stable than its rotation this suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around sun with the same direction and similar speed of earth at least in the earths orbital range therefore the earths orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter field fluid however this is a conjecture extensive research has to be conducted to verify if this is the case 6 skeptical description of the evolution of the mars the moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface even there is no air therefore there is no oceanlike tidal friction force to slow its rotation however the rotation of the moon is still slowing at significant rate of 1260 0024 1023 rad s2 which agrees with the model very well based on this one may reasonably think that the marss rotation should be slowing also the mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted humans great attention since ancient time the exploration of the mars has been heating up in recent decades nasa russian and europe space agency sent many space crafts to the mars to collect data and study this mysterious planet so far there is still not enough data about the history of this planet to describe its evolution same as the earth the mars rotates about its central axis and revolves around the sun however the mars does not have a massive moon circulating it mars has two small satellites phobos and deimos and there is no liquid fluid on its surface therefore there is no apparent oceanlike tidal friction force to slow its rotation by tidal friction theories based on the above result and current the marss data this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the mars should be about 438 1022 rad s2 figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the solar daysmars year the vertical dash line marks the current age of the mars with assumption that the mars was formed in a similar time period of the earth formation such description was not given before according to the authors knowledge and is completely skeptical due to lack of reliable data however with further expansion of the research and exploration on the mars we shall feel confident that the reliable data about the angular rotation acceleration of the mars will be available in the near future which will provide a vital test for the prediction of this model there are also other factors which may affect the marss rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season change winds possible volcano eruptions and mars quakes therefore the data has to be carefully analyzed 7 discussion about the model from the above results one can see that the current earthmoon data and the geological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the earthmoon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional parameters this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and receding eq 17 and eq 18 of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in the same gravitational system such relationship is not known before such success can not be explained by coincidence or luck because of so many data involved current earths and moons data and geological and fossil data if one thinks that this is just a ad hoc or a wrong model although the chance for the natural happening of such coincidence or luck could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery the future marss data will clarify this otherwise a new theory from different approach can be developed to give the same or better description as this model does it is certain that this model is not perfect and may have defects further development may be conducted james clark maxwell said in the 1873 the vast interplanetary and interstellar regions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe which the creator has not seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of his kingdom we shall find them to be already full of this wonderful medium so full that no human power can remove it from the smallest portion of space or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite continuity it extends unbroken from star to star the medium that maxwell talked about is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation the michelsonmorley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not depend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar space in fact the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically recently such as the dark matter dark energy cosmic fluid etc the dark matter field fluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and precisely described by maxwell 7 conclusion the evolution of the earthmoon system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model with nonnewtonian approach and the current data of the earth and the moon fits this model very well at 45 billion years ago the closest distance of the moon to the earth could be about 259000 km which is far beyond the roches limit and the length of day was about 8 hours the general pattern of the evolution of the moonearth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the earthmoon system the marss rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
