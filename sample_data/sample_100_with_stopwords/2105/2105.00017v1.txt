negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side arxiv210500017v1 cscg 30 apr 2021 mamoru doi abstract in our previous two papers we studied positive 3d gadgets in origami extrusions which create a top face parallel to the ambient paper and two side faces sharing a ridge with two simple outgoing pleats then a natural problem comes up whether it is possible to construct a negative 3d gadget from any positive one having the same net without changing the outgoing pleats that is to sink the top and two side faces of any positive 3d gadget to the reverse side without changing the outgoing pleats of course simply sinking the faces causes a tear of the paper and thus we have to modify the crease pattern there are two known constructions of negative 3d gadgets before ours but they do not solve this problem because their outgoing pleats are different from positive ones in the present paper we give an affirmative solution to the above problem for this purpose we present three constructions of negative 3d gadgets with a supporting triangle on the back side which are based on our previous ones of positive 3d gadgets the first two are an extension of those presented in our previous paper and the third is new we prove that our first and third constructions solve the problem our solutions enable us to deal with positive and negative 3d gadgets on the same basis so that we can construct from an origami extrusion constructed with 3d gadgets its negative using the same pleats if there are no interferences among the 3d gadgets we also treat repetitiondivision of negative 3d gadgets under certain conditions which reduces their interferences with others 1 i ntroduction as in our previous two papers 2 3 we are concerned with 3d gadgets in origami extrusions where an origami extrusion is a folding of a 3d object in the middle of a flat piece of paper and 3d gadgets are ingredients of origami extrusions which create faces with solid angles in particular we focus on 3d gadgets with two simple outgoing pleats which create a top face parallel to the ambient paper and two side faces sharing a ridge where a simple pleat is one that is formed by a mountain and a valley fold parallel to each other there are two known constructions of such 3d gadgets one is developed by carlos natan 4 as a generalization of the conventional cube gadget and these conventional 3d gadgets have a supporting pyramid on the back side the other newer one is presented in our previous papers 2 3 our new 3d gadgets which have flat back sides above the ambient paper are completely downward compatible with the conventional ones in the sense that any conventional one can be replaced by ours with the same outgoing pleats but the converse is not always possible also there are several advantages of our new 3d gadgets over the conventional ones in particular we can change angles of the outgoing pleats under certain conditions let us call the above 3d gadgets positive 3d gadgets for the development of a given positive 3d gadget if we forget the crease patten and only consider the net with the same orientation we may expect as the resulting 3d object not only the original one extruded with the 3d gadget but also its negative that is the 3d object which is constructed by sinking all faces of the original one to the reverse side we shall say that a 3d gadget is a negative one if it extrudes the negative of the 3d object which a positive one does then the following problem naturally comes up mamoru doi problem 11 we focus on positive 3d gadgets with two simple outgoing pleats which creates a top face parallel to the ambient paper and two side faces sharing a ridge which are all presented in 3 then for any given positive 3d gadget is it possible to construct a negative one with the same net as the positive one without changing the outgoing pleats for an individual positive 3d gadget there may be a desirable negative one for example let us consider a simple case of cube gadgets as shown in figure 12 where cp stands for crease pattern throughout this paper then there correspond negative 3d gadgets of two types as shown in figure 13 although there are two known constructions of negative 3d gadgets before ours which apply to any net of positive 3d gadgets these constructions do not solve problem 11 indeed negative cube gadgets constructed by the two known constructions which are shown in figure 14 have different outgoing pleats from those of the original ones in these figures the faces of the outgoing simple pleats bounded by a mountain and a valley fold are shaded f igure 12 cps of a cube extruded with the conventional and our cube gadgets f igure 13 cps of a negative cube extruded with the conventional and our negative cube gadgets in the present paper we give affirmative solutions to problem 11 for this purpose we present three constructions of negative 3d gadgets with a supporting triangle on the back side these constructions are based on those presented in 2 and 3 with a major difference that two supporting flaps on the back side in the positive cases which are called ears and overlap with the side faces form a single triangle and do not generally overlap with the side faces in the negative cases among our three constructions the first two are an extension of those presented in 2 section 9 and the negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side f igure 14 cps of a negative cube extruded with negative cube gadgets by two known constructions before ours third is new we will see that our first construction produces infinitely many negative 3d gadgets for any positive one in problem 11 while our third one gives a unique negative 3d gadget our solutions to problem 11 enables us to deal with positive and negative 3d gadgets on the same basis thus from an origami extrusion constructed with 3d gadgets may they be a mixture of positive and negative ones we can construct its negative if there are no interferences among the 3d gadgets we will also review two known constructions of negative 3d gadgets before ours because they are useful in their own right the first is wellknown and the second is presented by cheng in 1 for which we shall give an extension corresponding to the changes of the angles of the outgoing pleats convention 15 for the later convenience we will hereafter adopt the following convention on the standard orientation of the development for both positive and negative 3d gadgets for a given 3d gadget we determine the standard side from which we see the development so that the extruded faces lie above the ambient paper in other words for a negative resp positive 3d gadget we consider its development seen from the back resp front side we add subscripts l and r which stand for left and right respectively to the points lines angles etc of the 3d gadget according to this orientation one advantage of the above convention is that a positive and a negative 3d gadget constructed from the same development engage with each other we have another advantage when we consider both positive and negative 3d gadgets if a positive and a negative 3d gadget share a side face then the top edge of one gadget is the bottom edge of the other however if we see either gadget from its standard side then the subscripts l and r of the other gadget are consistent with the orientation also note that to construct the negative 3d gadget corresponding to a given positive one in problem 11 we have to begin with the horizontally flipped development of the positive one notation and terminology to keep consistency with the previous papers 2 and 3 we will use the same notation and terminology as possible as we can for example we use subscript for l and r which stands for left and right respectively and 0 to indicate the other side of that is r if l l if r also we will denote a simple pleat as m where is either a mountain or a valley fold and m is the reverse fold mamoru doi to fix the conditions and the construction of typical points lines and angles common to most of the later constructions of negative 3d gadgets we prepare the following f igure 16 net of a 3d object which we want to extrude with a 3d gadget construction 17 we consider a net on a piece of paper as in figure 16 we require the following conditions i l r l r and r l ii l r 2 to construct a negative gadget from the above net we prescribe its simple outgoing pleats by in troducing parameters for their changes from the direction of ab for l r for which we further require the following conditions iiia l r 0 where we take clockwise resp counterclockwise direction as positive for  l resp r iiib and 2 for l r iiic l r l r or equivalently l r in particular if l r 0 then conditions iiiaiiic are simplified as iii l r or equivalently then we construct creases l ml and r mr resp 0l ml and 0r mr which we prescribe as the outgoing pleats of a negative 3d gadget in section 3 resp in section 22 as follows where we regard as taking both l and r 1 draw a ray l starting from bl and going to the direction of abl followed by a clockwise rotation by l also draw a ray r starting from br ang going to the direction of abr followed by a counterclockwise rotation by r 2 draw a perpendicular to through b for both l r letting c be the intersection point 3 draw a perpendicular bisector m to segment b c for both l r letting p be the intersection point 4 draw a ray 0 parallel to and going in the same direction as and m starting from c the resulting creases are shown as solid lines in figure 18 the following result will be crucial in chengs construction of negative 3d gadgets given in section 22 proposition 19 segment ap bisects bl abr also we have abl p abr p 2 l r negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side l l l r f igure 18 construction of creases of prescribed pleats for a 3d gadget proof since p is the excenter of 4cbl br segment ap is a perpendicular bisector of side bl br of 4abl br with abl abr and thus ap bisects this proves the first assersion for the second assersion see 3 lemma 35 we end this section with the organization of this paper in section 2 we review two known constructions of negative 3d gadgets before ours section 21 gives a wellknown construction of negative 3d gadgets with one simple outgoing pleat and section 22 gives an extension of chengs construction in section 3 we present our three constructions of negative 3d gadgets where the first two are an extension of those presented in 2 section 9 and the third is new in particular we give a solution to problem 11 in sections 31 and 33 section 34 discusses the condition that there are no interferences between two 3d gadgets which share a side face and include at least a negative one section 4 deals with repetitiondivision of negative 3d gadgets under certain conditions finally we give our conclusion in section 5 2 k nown constructions of negative 3d gadgets in this section we review two known constructions of negative 3d gadgets a basic idea common to both constructions is to extend one side face by swinging the flap resulting from bisecting to the other side face it turns out that we can swing the flap to either side face and obtain two negative 3d gadgets for each choice of the angles the resulting 3d gadgets are never symmetric even when both l r and l r hold 21 construction with one simple pleat this construction is simple but the resulting pleat is easy to loosen thus to stabilize the resulting extrusion we may need to combine it with additional folds such as twists also the resulting 3d gadget has a large interference distance to other 3d gadgets for a development as in figure 18 precreasing as in figure 21 and swinging the resulting flap formed by bl ab and br ab to either side face until it extends the other side face and the connected pleat overlaps with the ambient paper we obtain the following construction mamoru doi f igure 21 precreasing for a negative 3d gadget with one pleat construction 22 consider a net as in figure 18 for which we conditions i ii and iii of construction 17 then the crease pattern of the negative 3d gadget with one simple outgoing pleat is constructed as follows 1 draw a ray b starting from a which bisects 2 choose l or r and extend k so that k starts from a point b0 in b 3 draw a ray c 0 starting from b 0 parallel to b and going in the same direction as b 4 the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in figure 23 and the assignment of mountain folds and valley folds is given in table 24 f igure 23 cps of two possible negative 3d gadgets with one simple outgoing pleat therefore we obtain two crease patterns according to the choice of in procedure 2 note that for the choice of in 2 the extended length of k which may cause an interference on the side of  0 is calculated as sin2 bl b0 br b0  ab sin 2 note also that there is no interference on the side of 0 negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side mountain folds jl jr b b0 b 0 valley folds kl kr c 0 ab 0 table 24 assignment of mountain folds and valley folds to a negative 3d gadget with one simple outgoing pleat 22 chengs construction with prescribed outgoing pleats 0l ml and 0r mr this construction is originally given in 1 but only for l r 0 here we extend the result for general l r 0 satisfying conditions iiiaiiic of construction 17 for a development as in figure l l l r f igure 25 precreasing for a negative 3d gadget by chengs construction 18 precreasing as in figure 25 and swinging the resulting the flap formed by bl ap and br ap to either side face and at the same time the two simple pleats to the side of 0l and 0r until the flap extends the other side face and the two pleats overlap with the ambient paper we obtain the following construction construction 26 consider a development as in figure 18 for which we require condition iii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 then the crease pattern of the negative 3d gadget with prescribed simple outgoing pleats 0l ml and 0r mr is constructed as follows 1 choose l or r and extend k so that k starts from a point b0 in polygonal chain ap m 2 if b0 lies in m p or equivalently if 2 l r then draw a line which is a reflection of b0 c across segment p c letting b0 0 be the intersection point of the line and m 0 if b0 lies in ap or equivalently if 6 2 l r then we set b0 0 b0 3 draw a ray parallel to ap from b 0 and let q 0 be the intersection point of the ray and m 0 4 the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in figure 27 for 6 2 l r and figure 28 for 2 l r and the assignment of mountain and valley folds is given in table 29 mamoru doi blbr l r l l f igure 27 cp of a negative 3d gadget by chengs construction for l with  6 2 l r l l l r f igure 28 cp of a negative 3d gadget by chengs construction for r with  2

0 q 0 are parallel to each other with the same length also note that if l r 0 then 2 always holds and thus the case b0 ap in 2 does not occur proposition 211 for our choice of in 2 we have ab 0 b0 0

table 29 assignment of mountain and valley folds to a negative 3d gadget with prescribed outgoing pleats 0l ml and 0r mr proof if b0 ap then 4ab b0 and 4ab 0 b0 0 are congruent by proposition 19 where b0 b0 0 thus we have ab 0 b0 0 ab b0 also if b0 m p then we have p b b0 p cb0 p cb0 0 p b 0 b0 0 so that by proposition 19 again we have ab 0 b0 0 ab 0 p p b 0 b0 0 ab p p b b0 this completes the proof for the choice of in 2 the extended length of the base k of the side face which may cause 0 where b b 0 for l r an interference on the side of 0 is given by maxbl bl0 br br are calculated as sin2 if 6 l r  sin 2 ab b b0 cos cos  ab if l r 2 sin l r sin note that the extended length in the first case is the same as construction 22 note also that there is no interference on the side of now let us check the flatfoldability around p and c around p noting that ap m cp m ap b for l r we have the flatfoldability condition ap mr cp mr cp ml ap ml ap br ap bl 0 as desired to prove the flatfoldability around c first suppose b0 m p then we calculate as p cb0 p b b0 ab b0 ab p 2 l r b0 0 cq 0 b0 0 b 0 q 0 ab 0 q 0 ab 0 b0 0 2 0l c0r l r so that we have p cb0 b0 0 cq 0 0l c0r p cb0 0 q

3 c onstructions of negative 3d gadgets with prescribed outgoing pleats l ml and r mr in this section we shall give three constructions of negative 3d gadgets which all use the prescribed two simple pleats l ml and r mr in particular we will prove that our first and third constructions solve problem 11 we will also discuss in section 34 the interferences between two adjacent 3d gadgets at least one of which is negative 31 first construction this is an extension of our first construction of negative 3d gadgets given in 2 section 9 and similar to constructions 22 and 26 in that we swing the supporting triangle to either side face until it overlaps with the other we can construct an infinite number of negative 3d gadgets with the same outgoing pleats for each l r construction 31 consider a development as in figure 18 for which we require condition i ii iiiaiiic of construction 17 then the crease pattern of our first negative 3d gadget with prescribed simple outgoing pleats l ml and r mr is constructed as follows 1 choose l or r also choose a point e in m so that ab e satisfies ab e l r l r for a practical choice of ab e see remark 310 also redefine m to be a ray starting from e and going in the same direction as ray 2 let d be the point in the circular arc bl br with center a such that b ad 2b ae 3 let g be the point in segment ae such that ab g if we choose ab e  in 31 then we have g e 4 let e 0 be the intersection point of m 0 and a bisector of dab 0 also redefine m 0 to be a ray starting from e 0 and going in the same direction as ray 0 5 let g 0 be the intersection point of a ray starting from g through d and segment ae 0 if we choose ab e 2 l r in 31 then we have g 0 e 0 6 let p be a point in m such that e b p if 0 then we have p e 7 let p 0 be the intersection point of a ray starting from p through c and ray m 0 8 if ab e then determine a point q in m such that q b also determine a point r in segment e p such that r b e q b e in particular if ab e then we have e g r for the existence of q and r see proposition 39 then draw segments b q b r cq and cr 9 if ab e 0 then determine a point q 0 in 0 0 such that q 0 b 0 0 0  0 0 also determine a point r 0 6 e 0 in segment e 0 p 0 such that r 0 b 0 e 0 q 0 b 0 e 0 for the existence of q 0 and r 0 see proposition 39 then draw segments b 0 q 0 b 0 r 0 cq 0 and cr 0 10 if ab e 0 then the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in figure 32 if not then the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in figure 33 the assignment of mountain and valley folds to the additional creases is given in table 34 where takes both l and r the following result is immediate lemma 35 for the choice of in 1 we have adg 0 ab 0 g 0 thus for the choice of in 1 and also in 2 the extended length of the base k of the side face which may cause an interference on the side of 0 is given by dg 0 which is calculated as dg 0 b 0 g 0 sin tan 0 2 cos negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting

on the other hand an interference occurs on the side of within the length dg given by dg b g sin tan 2 cos the above constuction of negative 3d gadgets leads to the following two results where the validity of the construction and the foldability of the crease patterns are verified below theorem 36 for any positive 3d gadget with l r l r satisfying conditions i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 we can apply construction 31 to obtain an infinite number negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side of negative 3d gadgets for each l r with the same net and prescribed outgoing pleats as the positive one in the development all of these negative 3d gadgets engage with the original positive one also if we consider the horizontally flipped crease pattern of each negative 3d gadget resulting in theorem 36 we have the following result which solves problem 11 corollary 37 for any positive 3d gadget with l r l r satisfying conditions i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 we can apply construction 321 to obtain an infinite number of 3d gadgets for each l r with the same outgoing pleats such that the top and two side faces are negatively extruded or in other words sunk to the opposite direction now let us see where condition 31 in 1 of construction 31 comes from we will follow the discussion and terminology in 3 section 4 in particular we set b ac b ad and  ace dce for l r so that we have l r and l r l r 0 for simplicity we denote below b k etc by b k etc and b 0 k 0 0 0 etc by b 0 k 0 0 0 etc with an exception that we denote l r by to avoid confusion also we denote l r by firstly for the existence of point g we need abg 6 abe which is equivalent to  6 by 3 lemma 44 secondly it follows from and 0 0 2 2 that  0 thirdly for the existence of point g we need adg0 6 ade 0 then from lemma 35 and  0 0  0 0  0 ade ab e we see that  6 fourthly for the existence of point p we need cee 0 ee 0 p 0 cp e p ee 0 ee 0 p 0 2 if 0 so that p e if 0 the lefthand side of the second inequality of 35 is calculated as cp e p ee 0 ee 0 p 0  cp e cep cee 0 ce 0 e ce 0 p 0  0  0 0   0 thus the second inequality of 35 is rewritten as  0 mamoru doi in a similar way we see that the first inequlity of 35 is included in 37 therefore we obtained four inequalities 32 33 34 and 37 which are arranged into the following inequalities for abe 2 2 2  6 abe 6  abe which is the same as condition 31 where the left resp the right equality of the first inequality of corresponds to g e resp g0 e 0 this explains how we find point e in construction 31 1 note that the range of abe determined by 38 is nonempty because of  and which come from conditions i and iiic of construction 17 respectively now we have the following results proposition 38 for the choice of l r in construction 31 1 we have the following relations e b g e 0 b 0 g 0 l r e 0 b 0 p 0 0 310 e p p ab e e p p ab e l r so that e p p 0 e 0 p 0 p l r in particular we have e 0 6 p 0 also we have  l r ab e ab 0 e 0 l r ab e p 0 b 0 0 ab e l r e 0 b 0 g 0 311 proof first we will prove 310 using ebg e 0 b 0 g0 edg e 0 dg0  ede 0 ece 0  ecp e 0 cp 0 ebp e 0 b 0 p 0 and  ece cee ce e  0 which follows from the calculation of 36 we obtain the first equation in the first line and also the second equation by ebp for the second line the first equation is easy and the second follows from the calculation of 36 which leads to the third line next we will prove 311 using the first line of 310 we calculate as e 0 b 0 g0 2 ebg  2 abe abg 2 abe so that using lemma 35 we have ab 0 e 0 ab 0 g0 e 0 b 0 g0 2 abe thus using the above equations and the first line of 310 we have p 0 b 0 0 0 ab 0 e 0 e 0 b 0 p 0 abe as desired this completes the proof of propositon 38 negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side proposition 39 if ab e then we have e b p p b k b 0 where equality holds for ab e or equivalently e g thus there exist points q and r in 8 of construction 31 if ab e 0 2 l r then we have e 0 b 0 p 0 k 0 b 0 0 p 0 b 0 0 0 thus there exist points q 0 and r 0 in 9 of construction 31 such that r 0 6 e 0 proof first suppose abe then we have p b kb abe abe 0 so that ebp kb p b abe abe 0 where equality holds for abe this proves the first assertion next suppose abe 0 2 then by proposition 38 we have p 0 b 0 0 k 0 b 0 0 abe 0 0 abe 0 0 so that by proposition 38 again we have e 0 b 0 p 0 p 0 b 0 0 k 0 b 0 0 2 0 abe 0  0 3 2 abe 0 3 2 2  0 0 as desired this proves the second assertion remark 310 here we discuss a practical choice of abe not to say the best although we can construct a negative 3d gadget under 38 we need additional creases if we have kb p b or k 0 b 0 0 p 0 b 0 0 which are equivalent to abe and abe 0 respectively this is because if so the face bounded by polygonal chain b p m overlaps with the side face for and particularly with k for either l or r thus it is practical to assume 312 ab e min l r 0 l r instead of 31 the range determined by 312 is still nonempty because of 0 2 and 0 coming from conditions i and iiib respectively of construction 17 as well as 39 also so as not to make ep p 0 and e 0 p 0 p too small we should take abe well over  and well below by the second line of 310 in proposition 38 in particular by the fourth line of 310 we have ep p 0 e 0 p p 0 if we can take abe satisfying 31 as abe 2 even if we can not it is practical to take abe as close to 2 as possible to end this subsection we check the foldability of the resulting crease patterns  flatfoldability around b this holds without the creases made with k and thus we will forget them the creases starting from b except for those made with k are ab and if 0 ab be bp and if 0 mamoru doi the flatfoldability in the first case is trivial because ab and form a straight line and that in the second case holds because we have ebp ab abe p b  flatfoldability around g and p this is obvious except for g e or p e which is included in the flatfoldability around e below  flatfoldability around e as with b the creases from e except for those made with k are ae ee 0 ep 0 and m if 0 ae be ee 0 and m if 0 then we can check the flatfoldability in the respective cases as aee 0 e 0 ep 0 p 0 em aem  aed dee 0 cee 0 cem aeb bem 0 aee 0 e 0 em bem aeb  aed dee 0 cee 0 cem bem aeb 0 using aeb aed cee 0 dee 0  flatfoldability around p 0 this is obvious

in table 311 while the assignment for e 0 6 g 0 is the same as tables 34 to verify this suppose 0 note that we have ab 0 g0 ab 0 k 0 0 so that 314 ab 0 g0 ab 0 k 0 thus if g0 6 e 0 then summing up 313

construction of negative 3d gadgets given in 2 section 9 suppose either l r 6 2 or l r 2 holds here we consider a development as in figure 312 with prescribed simple outgoing pleats l ml and r mr instead of figure 18 then we consider the crease pattern as in figure 313 where we take gl gr pl0 pr0 so that segments gl gr and pl0 pr0 are parallel to segment el er since 4agl gr does not face the correct direction this is not the correct crease pattern and thus 4agl gr has to be rotated with a rotation of crease pl0 pr0 let b 0 be the intersection point of a perpendicular through bl to kl and a perpendicular through br to kr in the crease pattern also let be the angle such that if ac rotates counterclockwise around a by 2 2 then ac overlaps with an extension of ab 0 to be more precise we define b00 as b 0 if l r and the antipodal point of b 0 in the circle with center a and radius ab 0 if l r 6 we see easily that b00 lies strictly inside bl abr if l r 2 or l r 2 and in ab if 2 and 0 6

negative 3d gadget where crease pl0 pr0 is to be rotated let us define proja0 to be the projection of the resulting extrusion to the crease pattern in the bottom plane z 0 with proja0 a a then we have proja0 b b 0 since gl gr in the bottom plane z 0 must be perpendicular to ab in the resulting extrusion and also perpendicular to ab 0 in the crease pattern we have to rotate gl gr counterclockwise around d by with a rotation of crease pl0 pr0 in the crease pattern let us observe how a rotation of crease pl0 pr0 in the crease pattern affects the resulting extrusion as in figure 313 suppose we use instead of pl0 pr0 a new crease pl pr made with a counterclockwise rotation of pl0 pr0 by and accordingly b p instead of b p0 for l r then in the negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a

need 318 kl dgl jl ab00 2 l l 2 kl dgr jr ab00 2 r r 2 hence comparing 316 and 317 with 318 we conclude that 2 however we have some constraints on the range of p and thus on that of firstly let 1 and 2 for l r be the angles shown in figure 313 which are calculated as 1 p0 0 c00 p0 0 b0 0 0 ab0 e0 e0 b0 p0 0 0 0 2 e cp ce e0 where we used 3 lemma 44 for 0 then pl ml and pr mr imply l2 6 r1 and  l1 6 r2 respectively which we arrange into l1 r1 and l2 6 6 r2 319 320 secondly we have k dg 0 for l r it follows from 316 and 317 that 2 l l 6 2 6 r r 2 321 thus letting 3 be the angles shown in figure 313 we have 3 k b p0 b 0 2 so that 321 becomes 322  l3 6 2 6 r3 lemma 314 suppose l r 2 or l r 6 2 and either l 6 2 or r 6 2 so that  is welldefined for 2 conditions 320 and 322 hold automatically proof condition 320 and condition 322 for l r 2 are obvious because we have l 6 6 r suppose l r 6 2 in condition 322 for l r let p be a ray starting from a which is parallel to b 0 b and going to the side of b as shown in figure 315 then it follows from 323 l bl ab00 bl apl b00 apl 2 l b00 apl 2 l mamoru doi we have the left inequality of 322 also it follows from 324 l bl abr b00 apr br apr r 2 b00 apr 6 r 2 we have the right inequality of 322 equality in the left resp the right inequality of 322 holds if b00 apl 0 resp b00 apr 0 or equivalently l 2 and r 2 resp r 2 and l 2 because b00 ap 0 2 can be determined by tan b00 ap 325 sin cos cos 0 cos cos this completes the proof of lemma 314 f igure 315 construction of rays pl and pr lemma 316 suppose l r 6 2 and either l 6 2 or r 6 2 so that b00 6 a for  l r let p be a ray starting from a which is parallel to b 0 b and going to the side of b as shown in figure 315 then we have 326 2 6 b00 ap for l r where equality holds if 2 proof if cos

325 by the assumption we see that 327 holds because 327 sin cos sin cos 0 cos cos cos  sin sin cos 0 cos cos cos  cos cos 0 cos  0  0  2 sin sin cos 0 where equality holds if 2 this completes the proof negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side proposition 317 suppose l r 2 or l r 6 2 and either l 6 2 or r 6 2 so that the angle is welldefined also suppose satisfy conditions 319 320 and 322 for  2 then for this we have k b p b for l r thus in our second construction there appear no creases like b q or b r in construction 31 which are made with k proof since we have 328 kl bl l pl bl l l l 2 2 kr br r pr br r r r 2 2 by a calculation similar to 316 it is sufficient to prove that the righthand sides are positive first suppose l r 2 then using 320 for 2 we have l 2 l 2 l 0 r 2 r 2 r 0 from which follows the positivity of the righthand sides of 328 next suppose l r 6 2 then we calculate the double of the first line of 328 as 2l 2l l l 2 l l 2  b00 apl l l 2 l 0 where we used 323 and lemma 316 in the second line also we can use 324 and lemma 316 to prove that the second line of 328 is positive this completes the proof of proposition 317 hence setting 21 we see from 319 320 322 and lemma 314 that our second construction is possible if 2 satisfies l r note that the flatfoldability around p is obvious and that around e is verified in the same way as in section 31 now our second construction is summarized as follows construction 318 consider a development as in figure 312 for which we require condition i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 suppose either l r 6 2 or l r 2 holds let b 0 be the intersection point of a perpendicular through bl to kl and a perpendicular through br to kr also let b00 be b 0 if l r and the antipodal point of b 0 in the circle with center a and radius ab 0 if l r 6 so that b00 lies inside bl abr if either l 6 2 or l 6 2 then define an angle numerically by 315 or geometrically in figure

l r if l r 2 then the crease pattern of our second negative 3d gadget with prescribed simple outgoing pleats l ml and r mr is constructed as follows where we regard as taking both l and r 1 let e be the intersection point of m and a bisector of b ac also redefine m to be a ray starting from e and going in the same direction as 2 let d be the intersection point of ac and the circular arc bl br

by our third construction before finding l or l in 1 of the above construction we check the foldability of the gadget proposition 324 regardless of the position of d in the circular arc bl br with center a we have e b g e b p for l r proof for any l bl ad bl ac we have e b g e dg de e0 e b p e dp ce e0 which are equal because el er is a perpendicular bisector of cd and mamoru doi thus in the resulting extrusion using 3 lemma 44 we have for both l r that 329 k bp k b p b  ab e e b p   on the other hand since p p0 overlaps with g g0 k bp must be equal to the angle formed by the extensions of j and g g0 which is calculated as  adg j ad 330  hence we see from 329 and 330 together with the flatfoldability around e and p for  l r that we can construct successfully the supporting flap 4agl gr on the back side of the negative gadget if there exists an appropriate choice of l or l now let us find an equation which l or l satisfies in the resulting extrusion noting that ridge ab overlaps with ad we need adgr abgr 331 this is rewritten as 332 eda eel er eba eel er where where e v denotes a unit direction vector of v ie e v v v and ba is a 3d vector in the resulting extrusion while da is a 2d vector in the development suppose ab 1 and the unit direction vectors of kr and kl are 1 0 0 and cos sin 0 respectively using eca cos r sin r 0 where so that l r we have that eda cosr l sinr l 0 eel er cos r l  sin r l  sinr r l cosr r l 0 cos cos r cos l  l r eba cos r sin where l r is the height of the extrusion for ab 1 which is given in 2 lemma 22 but we will not need its explicit value also tan and tan are given in 2 lemma 41 and 3 equation 421 respectively as 1 cos sin tan 0 sin cos tan 0 tan sin tan r cos tan 333 where r is given in 2 proposition 52 as 334 cos sin tan negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side thus we calculate as 335 336 eda eel er sin sinl r sinl l eba eel er sin cos r cosl l l cos l cosr r l now define a function 0 by  0 tan1 1 cos sin tan 0 sin cos tan 0 tan then we can write l and r as l l r 337 r r l therefore r is considered as a function r 0 defined by r 0 cos 0 sin 0 tan which satisfies rl r rr l 338 let us return to equations 335 and 336 using the second expression of 333 we have that cos l cos sin tan l cos l sin l sin cos tan l cos l consequently we calculate 336 as 339 sin eba eel er cos l cos l cos l sin l tan l sin l sin l cos l tan l cos r  cos r cos r sin r tan l sin r sin r cos r tan l cos l  cos l sin l sin l cos l cos r cos r sin r sin r cos r cos l tan l  cos l cos l sin l sin l cos r cos r cos r sin r sin r cos l also since it follows from the second expression of 333 that sinl l  sin l cos l tan l cos l  r cos l tan l cos l tan l r tan l we calculate 335 as 340 sin eda eel er  r sinl r tan l cos l equating 339 and 340 we finally obtain an equation 341 v1 l l r r rl r v2 l r tan l w l l r r mamoru doi which is equivalent to 332 where v1 cos l sin l sin l cos l cos r cos r sin

from 342 and 337 that v1 l l r r v1 r r l l v2 l r v2 r l 343 w l l r r w r r l l along with 338 as l moves in the range r l l moves in the range l r r l l 2 2 theorem 325 suppose l r l and r satisfy conditions i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 then there exists a unique solution l r r 2 2 l l of equation 341 which is given by l tan v1 rv2 where v1 v2 w and r are given by 342 thus there exists a unique solution l r l of equation 331 which is given by l sin1 r sin l l before proving the theorem we begin with the following two lemmas lemma 326 define l l l r r by l l l r r v1 rv2 tan l w then we have 344  l l l l r r 2 sin2  sin l tan l cos l sin r sin l cos l tan l proof of lemma 326 using 1 tan l tan l cos l sin l tan l tan  l l tanl l tan l tan l sin l cos l tan l we have sin l cos l tan l thus we can calculate sin l cos l tan l as sin l cos l tan l  l l l l r r 345  v1 cos l sin l tan l v2 w sin l cos l tan l r tan  l l  v1 cos l v2 w sin l v1 sin l w cos l tan l negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side to simplify the expression we set cc cos l cos r sc sin l cos r c cos s sin for l r cs cos l sin r ss sin l sin r then v1 v2 and w are written as v1 ccsl sr scsl cscr v2 cc sin sc cos cs cos ss sin w cccl cr scsl cssr so that we have v1 cos l w sin l cccl sr sl cr scc2l s2l cscl cr sl sr  cc sin sc cs cos v1 cos l w sin l v2 sc1 cos ss sin  sin l cos r 1 cos sin r sin v1 sin l w cos l ccsl sr sl cl cr cl cssl cr cl sr  cc1 cos cs sin  cos l cos r 1 cos sin r sin consequently the righthand side of 345 is calculated as sin l cos l tan l cos r 1 cos sin r sin  2 sin sin l cos l tan l sin r which is positive because of 0 2 2 0 l l and r 2 this completes the proof of lemma 326 lemma 327 we have  r r l l r r 346 2 sin2  sin r cos r tan r sin l sin r cos r tan r proof of lemma 327 we see immediately from the definition of 338 342 and 343 that  r r l l r r  r r r r l l and the righthand side of 346 is obtained by interchanging the suffices l and r in 344 proof of theorem 325 by the intermediate value theorem we see from the above two lemmas that there exists l r r 2 2 l l such that 0 which is a desired solution of 341 also we see that v1 rv2 0 so that v1 rv2 tan l is monotonically increasing with respect to l from which follows the uniqueness of the solution l corollary 328 for any positive 3d gadget with l r l r satisfying conditions i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 we can apply construction 321 to obtain a unique negative 3d gadget with the same net and prescribed outgoing pleats as the positive one in the development this negative 3d gadget engages with the original positive one if we consider the horizontally flipped crease pattern of the negative 3d gadget resulting in corollary 328 we have the following result which solves problem 11 mamoru doi corollary 329 for any positive 3d gadget with l r l r satisfying conditions i ii and iiiaiiic of construction 17 we can apply construction 321 to obtain a unique negative 3d gadget with the same outgoing pleats such that the top and two side faces are negatively extruded or in other words sunk to the opposite direction now we set  l r  r l and  r then a straightforward calculation gives an alternative expression of v1 v2 and w as v1 sin  cos sin cos sin sin sin cos sin sin sin  sin cos sin v2 sin sin 347 w sin sin cos sin  cos sin sin  sin sin cos sin  cos sin sin for an alternative expression of r we observe from 334 that 1r is written in two ways as 348 cos  sin  tan l cos  sin  tan r multiplying the left and the righthand side of 348 by sin2 and sin2 respectively and adding the resulting terms together we have  2 sin cos sin cos cos 2tan l tan r so that 2 sin2 cos 349 sin 1 cos 2 cos2 tan l tan r consequently we can use 347 and 349 to obtain an expression of tan l without arc tangents as follows  l proposition 330 in theorem 325 we can express tan l in terms of t tan as tan l v1 rv2 sin sin t  cos sin2 0 2 2 sin sin  cos t sin sin2 sin 1 cos 2 11 t2 tan l tan r where t is given by tan r tan l t tan 2 tan l tan r tan2 then the following result is immediate by a straightforward calculation proposition 331 suppose l r 0 then we have sin tan l 0 cos2 cos cos negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side in particular if l r then we have l r l 2 as in the previous sections the triangular flap 4agl gr may interfere with adjacent 3d gadgets within the length kneg b on the side of which are calculated as cosl l tanl 2 sinl l knegr b dgr cosl l tanr 2 sinl l knegl b dgl 350 where we used adgl 2 l l adgr 2 l l in particular if l r and l r then l l 0 so that we have knegl knegr ab tan which do not depend on either or remark 332 as with our first construction we see from lemmas 326 and 327 that we can also include the case l r or equivalently l r 2 in construction 321 because in those lemmas do not vanish and thus l takes a value strictly between 0 and in this case the resulting negative gadget is flat and we have the flatfoldability condition around b ab g e b p k b e b g p b ab k which is rewritten as 351 ab e k b ab k e b by proposition 324 on the other hand there is a unique positive flat gadget with the same and for both l r where the assignment of mountain and valley folds is given in table 333 for this positive gadget it follows from 3 section 3 that b ae with l r 2 where is given geometrically in definition 32 and numerically in proposition 36 of 3 this also satisfies the flatfoldability condition 351 around b thus we must have b ae for the negative flat gadget which does not hold if l r where there are an infinite number of positive 3d gadgets mountain folds j ab b e valley folds k m ae el er table 333 assignment of mountain and valley folds to a unique positive flat gadget for l r 34 interferences caused by negative 3d gadgets here we only consider flatback positive 3d gadgets given in 2 and 3 and negative ones by our third construction but other cases are similar as discussed in 2 section 5 and 3 section 5 for two positive 3d gadgets sharing a side face an interference may occur in the bottom edge however since our negative 3d gadgets have a supporting triangle which does not necessarily overlap with their side faces an interference between two adjacent negative ones may occur at the intersection point of the extentions of the bases of their supporting triangles suppose two negative 3d gadgets share a side face a1 a2 b2 b1 where a1 and a2 may be identical and b1 is located to the left of b2 we will add subscripts 1 and 2 to the quantities mamoru doi and points belonging to the left and the right gadget respectively set 1r b2 b1 g1r and 2l b1 b2 g2l in the resulting extrusion which are calculated using 329 as 1r 1r 1r 1l 2 2l 2l 2l 2l 2 then the minimum length knegmin b1 b2 of b1 b2 such that no interference occurs is given by if 1r 2l mink negr b1 sin 1r knegl b2 sin 2l knegmin b1 b2 if 1r 2l tan 1r tan 2l where knegr b1 and knegl b2 are given by 350 hence there are no interferences between the two negative 3d gadgets if and only if b1 b2 knegmin b1 b2 of course we have to consider another minimum of b1 b2 which is given by the length of b1 b2 when we set a1 a2 for 1l 2r interferences caused by a flatback positive 3d gadget given in 3 and a negative one which share a side face may be rather complicated to treat example 334 as an example let us consider the resuting extruded prism of the crease pattern shown in figure 335 where the divided parts of the top face and the side faces are lightly and dark shaded respectively in the figure we set 1 2 3 1l 1r 2l 2r 2 so that 1 2 23 1l 1r 2l 2r 0 1l 2l 0 and a1 b1r a1 b2l so that a1 b2l a2 b1r is a square then we see that there are no interferences however let us see how interferences occur if we make a1 b2l and accordingly a2 b1r shorter suppose a1 b1 1 so that a2 b2 1 then we have the following  the flap formed by kite a1 b 1r g1r d1 of the positive 3d gadget collides with a2 if a2 b1r b1r g1r 1 3  the flap formed by kite a2 b 2l g2l d2 of the negative 3d gadget collides with j1l if a1 b2l b2l g2l 1 3  the crease which is the reflection of j1l across 2l collides with the flap formed by kite a2 b2l g2l d2 of the negative 3d gadget if a1 b2l b2l g2l 1 3  the crease which is the reflection of j2r across 1r collides with the flapformed by kite a2 b2l g2l d2 of the negative 3d gadget if a2 b1r b1r g1r 1 3 thus in any of the above four cases there  are no interferences if and only if a1 b2 1 3 we show the crease pattern for a1 b2 1 3 in figure 336 thus in the presence of both positive and negative 3d gadgets there may be not only interferences between a 3d gadget and another one or a side face which is not necessarily adjacent to the first one but also ones beween a 3d gadget and an edge of a side face reflected by an outgoing pleat as in the third and fourth cases of example 334 using the repeating gadgets given in 3 section 7 for positive ones and those given in the next section for negative ones or changing the angles of the outgoing pleats we may be able to avoid these interferences however the more 3d gadgets we have the more difficult it becomes to handle their interferences for the treatment of intersections of outgoing pleats see 2 section 9 negative 3d gadgets in origami

of 3d gadgets are the same but the gadget we start from the repeating 3d gadgets presented in 3 which have flat back sides can also be used for negative 3d gadgets with a little modification the creases of the negative 3d gadget does not affect on those of the repeating gadgets in the resulting crease pattern because the supporting mamoru doi triangle overlaps with the repeating gadgets only at the ridge as in 2 and 3 we shall treat the cases with l r 0 the general cases with l r 0 are rather complicated and thus will be treated elsewhere in the construction below we will use a negative 3d gadget by our third construction as the lowest gadget however we can use any of our constructions as long as it is applicable construction 41 consider a development as shown in figure 42 for which we require conditions i ii and iii of construction 17 suppose p1 pd 0 with p1 pd d satisfy  pn 6 qn for n 2 d where qn p1 pn the meaning of 41 will be explained in remark 45 in particular in the case of equal division p1 pn 1 41 holds if and only if  6 2 cos1 13 2 tan1 2 2 14106 then the crease pattern of the proportional division of a negative 3d gadget by our third construction into d gadgets in the ratio p1 pd from the bottom with p1 pd d is constructed as follows where we regard as taking both l and r 1 divide segment ca not ac into d parts proportionally in the ratio p1 pd letting a1 ad1

negative 3d gadget by construction 321 for l r inside polygonal chain 1 1 1 1 l bl a1 br r where we add the supersctipt 1 to the resulting points and lines in the crease pattern 4 for n 2 d 1 we choose l 2 2 such that 1 r2 1 pn r2 1  pn 6 qn or equivalently  1 6 cos l 2r cos 1 where r is given by r 1 cos2 note that we can always take l 0 for n 2 d by 41 also if we have p1 pd 1 equal division and l l l then 42 is simplified as r2 3 6 cos l n1 n for n 1 d draw a perpendicular bisector m of b b in which we detern n n n mine a point e so that b a e 2 where we set l 2 l r 2 l ad a a0 b c and b

overlaps with both l and r dn f 0 n glues l and r together which ruins construction 321 note that 41 is a necessary and sufficient condition such that there is at least one l satisfying 42 this is why we require 41 for n 2 in construction also we saw in 3 proposition 78 that there exist g and g0 n1 321 7 and 8 if and only if tan2  p n 6 qn tan 2 tan thus to avoid the appearance of g for both l r it is better to choose l so that for both l r tan2 pn tan tan 2 if such l exists in particular for p1 pd equal division and l l l there appear no g for both l r and all n 2 if we can choose l so that for both l r tan 2 tan2 tan where l 2 l and r 2 l 5 c onclusion in this paper we studied fives constructions of negative 3d gadgets whose features are listed in table 5 in particular we saw in section 33 that our first and third constructions solve problem negative 3d gadgets in origami extrusions with a supporting triangle on the back side 11 these solutions enable us to treat positive and negative 3d gadgets on the same basis as long as there are no interferences among the 3d gadgets and also broaden the range of 3d objects which can be folded in origami extrusions although it is still limited and to be further broadened each of the two constructions has its own merits and we can select them interchangeably for our purpose our first construction produces an infinite number of negative 3d gadgets for any positive 3d gadget in problem 11 but choosing ab e in construction 31 1 is a little troublesome on the other hand our third construction gives a unique solution for which we do not need to care about the choice to prove the existence and uniqueness of the desired negative 3d gadget by our third construcion for any given positive 3d gadget in problem 11 we solved equation 332 numerically and found rather complicated formulas for the unique solution in theorem 325 and proposition 331 however we still do not either know how to construct d geometrically except for some cases such as l r or understand the geometric meaning of the formulas for the solution which may possibly explain the existence and uniqueness of the desired gadget more naturally and easily also it is still a major problem in origami extrusions to handle outgoing pleats and various interferences which increase as the extruded object becomes more complex although we have many ways of handling an individual difficulty such as changing the angles of the outgoing pleats composing their intersections and using repeating 3d gadgets at this point we depend more or less on our skills in designing the whole crease pattern of an origami extrusion which is to be further developed in future researches section outgoing number of symmetry1 remark pleats possible cps of cp b cl or l and r are many
