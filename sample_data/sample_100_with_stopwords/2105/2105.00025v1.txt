which are driven by quantum fluctuations mark a frontier between distinct quantum phases of matter however our understanding and control of such phenomena is still limited here we report an atomic scale control of quantum phase transition between two different topological quantum classes of a welldefined conjugated polymer controlled by their length we reveal that a pseudo jahnteller effect is the driving mechanism of the phase transition being activated above a certain polymer chain length in addition our theoretical calculations indicate the presence of longtime coherent fluctuations at finite temperature between the two quantum phases of the polymer near the phase transition this work may pave new ways to achieve atomic scale control of quantum phase transitions in particular in organic matter onesentence summary atomic scale control and visualization of topological quantum phase transition in conjugated polymers activated by their length main text in general a phase transition represents a transformation process between two states of matter with distinct internal order involving longrange fluctuations across the entire system classical phase transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations being well understood within the frame of landauginzburgwilson theory 1 however at zero temperature where no thermal fluctuations occur a quantum phase transition qpt 2 may happen being driven by quantum fluctuations imposed by the principle of uncertainty whenever a nonthermal parameter like pressure magnetic field or chemical composition is modified 3 4 such quantum phase transitions are the subject of an intensive research nowadays in order to shed light into the fundamental mechanisms behind them and due to their relevance in complex phenomena in solid state physics 57 typically continuous qpts take place in the proximity of the socalled avoided level crossing see fig 1 whenever the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest excited state diminishes and becomes comparable to the quantum energy fluctuation in principle under such circumstances only the quantum fluctuations may cause the phase transition into a new phase of matter at zero kelvin in the absence of any thermal fluctuation 8 9 importantly near the critical point at finite but very low temperature both thermal and quantum fluctuations are equally important giving rise to the socalled quantum criticality phenomenon the quantum critical state cannot be described within the conventional quasiparticle picture of the fermi liquid theory 10 11 this exotic quantum state plays significant role in our understanding of eg high temperature superconductivity 1215 ferroelectricity 16 17 or strange metals featuring nonfermi liquid behavior 12 from this perspective control and understanding of qpt represent one of the biggest challenges of contemporary science due to their complexity and the inherent quantum character 18 as a result it is commonly perceived that a detailed knowledge may allow to design new quantum materials with unforeseen properties in condensed matter physics a lot of the attention has been paid to qpt between phases featuring strongly correlated states of matter with complex spin and charge pattern frequently manifested by spin and charge density waves cdw 19 20 however it is precisely the presence of strongly correlated phases which makes it significantly more difficult to gain a deeper understanding of the phase transition mechanism itself therefore there is a quest to search for novel materials where qpt takes place between two phases of matter with only moderated correlation since such systems could be well described within mean field approximations in addition there is a growing interest in controlling the proximity to the quantum critical point by harnessing designer parameters with great precision in order to enable the direct observation of the quantum phase transition in onedimensional conjugated polymers the peierls instability 21 results in an alternation of bond lengths between carbon atoms accompanied by variation of corresponding bond charges which gives rise to the conjugation 22 23 the conjugation can also be viewed as cdw phase driven by a fermi surface nesting and complex interplay between electronic and lattice degree of freedom 24 25 remarkably even very simple polymers such as polyacetylene may feature distinct quantum topological phases as demonstrated by the celebrated ssh model 26 where one hallmark of the nontrivial topology of the electronic structure is the presence of ingap energy edge states recent progress in the field of onsurface synthesis 27 28 supported by highresolution imaging by scanning probe microscopy 29 30 has brought a new chemical strategy to synthesize organic hydrocarbon materials with atomistic control 31 and inspect their inherent electronic magnetic and topological properties 3235 following these onsurface synthetic protocols in a recent study we demonstrated that distinct conjugation resonance forms and corresponding topological phases can be tuned in acenebridged conjugated polymers by a proper choice of acene units ie the monomer constituents of the polymer 36 the change of quantum class from topologically trivial to nontrivial polymers was accompanied not only by significant reduction of the electronic band gap but also by a rearrangement of bonds and the emergence of zeroenergy edge states as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the electronic band structure 37 in this work we reveal that the length of a 1d polymer can act as a nonthermal parameter to trigger a topological quantum phase transition to exemplify experimentally this strategy we employ pentacene bridged polymers 36 as archetypes such polymers belong to the topologically nontrivial quantum phase in the limit of infinite length we carried out a systematic study of the evolution of the conjugation resonance form and level crossing of frontier orbitals see schematic view in fig 1 accompanied by the emergence of the edge states upon increasing of polymer length by means of scanning probe microscopy spm complemented by theoretical simulations our results reveal that the topological phase transition is driven by the length of the polymer such findings are rationalized by a multiorbital pseudo jahnteller effect 38 triggered by the length dependent vibronic coupling between frontier occupied and unoccupied orbitals in addition our density functional theory dft molecular dynamics simulations indicate the presence of longtime coherent fluctuations at finite temperature between the two distinct conjugatedtopological phases of the polymers situated near the topological phase transition pentacene polymers 36 39 were grown by deposition of precursor 4brpn 613bisdibromomethylene613dihydropentacene on au111 surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and subsequent annealing of the surface at 500k this promotes homocoupling of the 4brpn molecules leading to the formation of the pentacene polymers in order to control the final length of our polymers we intentionally varied the initial coverages of the precursor molecules for coverages below 15 finite polymers could be found see fig s1 for representative scanning tunneling microscopy stm images of 4 12 and 15 coverage and the resulting polymers obtained after annealing following this protocol we were able to produce a broad variety of pristine defectfree polymers with lengths ranging from 2 monomers up to 50 monomers in a recent previous study 36 we investigated very long pentacene polymers in range of 50100 nm grown on au111 showing the appearance of ingap edge states as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of their electronic band structure herein there is a question if the length of a polymer could influence its topological quantum class to explore such hypothesis we employed the modified synthetic protocol discovering the absence of ingap edge states for chains shorter than 26 monomers such finding indicates that there is a critical length for the pentacene chains to exhibit the nontrivial topology figs 2ab display simultaneously acquired highresolution atomic force microscopy afm and stm images taken with cotip 29 of two different defectfree chains made of 24 and 26 monomers respectively we have deliberately chosen these two chains of a given length for which a visible change in the electronic structure takes place if we take a look to low bias stm image near the fermi level stm images at 3 mev shown in figs 2ab we observe that the chain made of 26 monomers and longer features the ingap edge states while the chain of 24 monomers and shorter does not the ingap edge state is also presented in didv spectrum acquired at the end of the nontrivial chains as a conductance peak around the fermi energy see fig s2 fig 2c represents selected didv spectra of defect free polymers of different lengths with welldefined increase in the conductance corresponding to homolumo orbitals which determines the electronic band gap of the polymer a systematic evolution of the homolumo bandgap as function of their length is shown in fig 2d as it can be seen the bandgap of the 1d polymer varies continuously from 12 ev for a dimer chain down to 350mev 150 mev for the homo energy and 200 mev for the lumo for the decamer for longer polymers the value remains constant however the saturation of the bandgap does not seem to be directly related with the trivialnontrivial transition of the polymers since the qpt happens somewhere between 24 and 26 monomers fig 2e also shows representative didv maps obtained at the homolumo energies of the chains for different topological phases interestingly the features observed for the homo orbital of trivial polymers are found in the lumo orbital of the nontrivial chains and vice versa nonetheless this behavior has been observed when comparing the cbvb of anthracene vs pentacene polymers in previous works 36 and it is responsible for the change of zak phase 40 and thus of the topological quantum class of the polymer it is appropriated to note that fig 2d directly represents an avoided level crossing scheme associated with continuous quantum phase transition this points out that the homolumo crossing level plays a decisive role in the topological phase transition as we will elaborate below the change of topological state of these polymers is also accompanied by a variation of the inherent conjugation ie the resonance forms going from ethynylenearomatic topologically trivial in acene polymers to cumulenequinoid topologically nontrivial in pentacene polymers such a change in the character of the conjugation considered as well as transition between two distinct cdw phases can be directly observed in highresolution afm images obtained with co functionalized tips in fig 2f we present two highresolution afm images of central part of trivial and nontrivial chains respectively together with a profile along the line marked in red and blue the presence of a protrusion in the bridging unit is associated with the triple bond of the ethynylene link of the topologically trivial chains see red line profile in fig 2f while the bright protrusions and corresponding peaks in the red line profile can be observed throughout the trivial polymer the nontrivial chain shows a disappearance of the protrusions and a decay in intensity of the peaks as we get closer to the central part of the chain see blue line profile in fig 2f this variation demonstrates an ethynylene to cumulenelike transition along the topologically nontrivial polymer in order to improve the experimental capabilities of controlling the phase transition in conjugated polymers we have developed a novel protocol employing atomic manipulation such strategy consists of two step process hydrogenation of the pentacene polymers to afterwards selectively remove those extra hydrogen atoms from the desired part of the chain using the stm tip an exposure of pentacene polymers to atomic hydrogen in uhv chamber leads to highly selective adsorption of two hydrogens atoms on one of the benzene rings close to the central one see figs 3ab and details of hydrogenation process in methods fig 3b shows an experimental and theoretical afm image of the hydrogen defects with excellent agreement between both images notably such highly siteselective adsorption is dictated by the formation of a new resonance form with two clars sextets with higher stabilization of the chemical structure therefore the hydrogenation process increases substantially the electronic band gap 18 ev see fig s3 of the polymer establishing an ideal template for an artificial formation of large segments of pristine pentacene polymers of different lengths the hydrogen pair defects can be removed in a controlled way by placing the stm tip on top of one of them a red dot in fig 3c and performing a distance versus voltage curve ramping the voltage from 15 v up to 2530 v while keeping a constant current 10 pa in the plot in fig 3c we can observe a sudden jump around 25 v pointing to a successful removal of the extra hydrogen atoms see fig s4 for snapshots of a hydrogen removal process following this protocol we can selectively engineer regions of the pristine pentacene polymer with a desired topological phase which depends on the length of such region as an example in fig 3d we show an afm image of a long fully hydrogenated pentacene polymer before our manipulation experiment the afm image from fig 3e displays the chain after multiple manipulations extrahydrogen removals where a trivial chain consisting of 16 monomers left part of the chain and a nontrivial chain made of 31 monomers right part of the chain have been created the low bias stm image of the modified polymer shown in fig 3e reveals the existence of the edge state in the nontrivial part in opposition to the trivial chain at the same time didv maps acquired at the homo and lumo energies 150 mev and 200 mev respectively prove once again the inversion of the orbitals between the trivial and nontrivial polymers see two bottom panels of fig 3e importantly the artificially formed pentacene polymers exhibit the same behavior as the finite pristine chains previously described to summarize the experimental observations the quantum topological phase transition is accompanied by the avoided level crossing of frontier homolumo orbitals and the transformation of conjugation resonance form as shown schematically on fig 1 polymers found in topologically nontrivial phase feature zeroenergy edge states due to the bulkboundary correspondence moreover we also observe a significant renormalization of the electronic band gap for very short chains while from a certain polymer length the energy band gap remains almost constant even in the phase transition see fig 2d to get more insight into the underlying mechanism we carried out total energy dft calculations 41 42 of freestanding pentacenebridged polymers of various lengths fig 4a displays evolution of the frontiers orbitals of polymers of different length forming the conduction and valence band in the limit of an infinite polymer the red and blue color denotes bonding b and antibonding a character of given frontier orbital on the triple bond of the bridging unit see fig 1 the phase transition occurs between polymers of 10 and 11 units and it is marked by the emergence of ingap edge states see black dots in fig 4a and unification of the bonding red and antibonding blue character of empty and occupied states respectively the spin restricted dft calculations capture most of the experimental observations including i the presence of the phase transition accompanied by the avoided level crossing of frontier orbitals see fig 4a ii the transformation of the conjugation at a certain critical length fig 4a and iii the presence of the ingap energy edge states as hallmarks of the topologically nontrivial phase see fig s5 in addition calculated didv images 43 of single particle frontier homolumo orbitals are in excellent agreement with the experimental evidence as shown on fig 2e the only discrepancy we note is a shorter theoretical polymer length 11 units as compared to the experimental results in which the phase transition takes place such deviation could be attributed to limited precision of single particle dft calculations as the precise position of the transition depends on employed exchangecorrelation functional andor absence of metallic substrate in our simulations despite this minor deficiency we consider that the dft calculations provide a reliable qualitative description of the underlying phase transition mechanism interestingly the frontier electronic orbitals involved in the avoided level crossing have an opposite bondingantibonding character on the triple bond see figs 1 and 4b therefore the level crossing is directly related to the debilitation and elongation of the triple bond observed during the phase transition driven by the occupancy of antibonding frontier orbitals this suggests that phonon softening could be responsible for the phase transition often spontaneous symmetry breaking in molecular systems with nondegenerate electronic states is caused by pseudo jahnteller mechanism 38 driven by vibronic coupling of lowlying excited states to vibrational modes of particular symmetry to establish a new ground state at zero temperature in next we will show that indeed the pseudo jahnteller is the driving mechanism of the phase transition in the pentacene polymers the total vibronic coupling tot corresponding to a given soft phonon mode q which is a source of the phonon softening of the system consist of sum of individual vibronic couplings ij between ij frontier orbitals written as i hq j ej ei  where i j ei ej are wavefunctions and eigen energies of ith occupied and jth unoccupied electronic states respectively numerator i hq j represents off diagonal vibronic coupling constant 38 between the occupied and unoccupied electronic states mediated by vibrational mode q the presence of the energy difference ej ei in denominator in eq 1 has two important consequences i only lowenergy excitation electronic states have significant contribution to the vibronic coupling and ii a diminishing band gap enhances the vibronic coupling the second consequence is often considered as a decisive factor in most of the spontaneous symmetry breaking processes however this argument cannot be fully adopted in our system as the experimental band gap remains almost constant near the critical point as shown in fig 2d thus our findings indicate that the numerator in eq 1 plays a decisive role in the phase transition to understand the role of such term we carried out an analysis of a pentacene dimer to identify a suitable coupling between vibrational modes and frontier orbitals involved in the pseudo jahnteller 38 44 our calculations show that two highest occupied frontier orbitals homo1 and homo have an opposite bonding b and antibonding a character on the triple bond of the bridging unit respectively and the same holds for the two lowest frontier unoccupied orbitals lumo and lumo1 as shown in fig 4b moreover we found that an inplane stretching vibrational mode q of the triple bond in the bridging unit see inset of fig 4c has a suitable symmetry that allows significant vibronic coupling between the frontier electronic orbitals with the same bonding b or antibonding a symmetry on the other hand the term diminishes for two frontier orbitals of the opposite symmetry namely in the case of the dimer chain shown in fig 4b we found that the vibronic coupling mediated by the stretching vibrational mode q between orbitals of the same symmetry is qbb qaa 073 ev while for orbitals of different symmetries vanishes qab 103 tables s1s3 summarize calculated vibronic coupling between occupied and unoccupied frontier orbitals for dimer trimer and pentamer chain whose total sum increases with the length of the chain thus the longer polymer is also the number of electronics states belonging to emerging valence and conduction bands see fig 4a as well as the number of the stretching vibrational modes q of the bridge unit see figs s67 linearly increase consequently the vibronic coupling steadily increases with the chains longitude as shown on fig 4c till it reaches a critical value and the system undergoes a phase transition the phase transition from topologically trivial to nontrivial is accompanied by the crossing of the homo and lumo frontier orbitals of distinct bonding character this level crossing causes that the set of orbitals forming the valence band has the same antibonding character on the triple bond while the conduction band is entirely formed by wavefunctions with the same bonding character see figs 4ab and figs s589 consequently the vibronic coupling via the stretching mode vanishes as the occupied orbitals of the valence band have antibonding symmetry the character of the triple bond debilitates which causes the conjugation transformation from ethynylenearomatic to cumulenequinoid character accompanied by the topological transition our analysis shows that systems with conduction and valence bands composed by a mixture of wavefunctions of different symmetries are more prone to vibronic instabilities we believe that this paradigm could be extended to other conjugated systems such as acenes or graphene nanoribbons 45 fig s5 displays realspace wavefunctions of the pentacene polymer made of 15 units which is found in topologically nontrivial phase featuring the ingap edge states interestingly we observe that the exchange bonding b and antibonding a g orbitals take place mostly in the central part of the polymer while at the edges the frontier orbitals preserve their original electronic character of short topologically trivial polymers this finding matches well to experimental data acquired on topologically nontrivial polymers see fig s10 revealing a conservation of triple bond character on bridge units seen in highresolution afm images and reverse contrast of didv maps of homolumo frontier orbitals at the ends of the polymers with respect to its central part see fig 3e the extension of qpt to finite temperatures gives rise to the quantum criticality phenomenon which is subject of an intensive research due to its exotic state of matter there is a question if the quantum criticality may emerge also in the pentacene bridged polymer therefore it would be interesting to see how the polymers of the critical lengths behave at elevated temperatures thus we carried out qmmm md simulations 42 46 of polymers made of 15 units qm region on the au111 substrate md region at temperature of 100 kelvin for details see materials and methods interestingly we observe cyclic reappearance of the ingap edge states e black accompanied by level crossing of bonding a red and antibonding b blue frontier orbitals in energy as shown in fig 4d and supplementary video s1 this indicates continuous fluctuation of the polymer between two topological phases at finite temperature such fluctuations are driven by presence of a new stable vibrational mode with time oscillation period of 1ps this vibrational mode has a character of a breathing mode continuously varying the total length of the polymer on the contrary the level crossing and cyclic reappearance of the edge state is completely absent in md simulations of a topologically trivial chain made of 5 units see fig s11 despite we are aware of the limitations of the correct description of the electronic structure using the dft method we consider that the coherent evolvement on time scale of at least tens of picoseconds between the two topological phases may indicate the existence of the quantum criticality in conjugated polymers located near the topological phase transition we believe that these findings will motivate further research with appropriated experimental techniques unfortunately such quantum coherent evolvement cannot be directly inspected by lowtemperature microscopy which operation at elevated temperatures causes significant loss of the spatial and energy resolution instead for example conductance measurements through single chains 47 48 near the quantum phase transition could explore the possible critical behavior the conductivity of the polymers at finite temperature we anticipate that our results could give rise to fluctuating quasimetallic entangled phase within the polymer we envision our observations will stimulate more elaborated studies of the electronic structure of conjugated polymers and the role of the size dimensions of such polymers regarding topological quantum classes and emergence of complex quantum ground states in the quantum criticality regime in addition our new recipe based on extra hydrogenation and atomic manipulation provides avenues to engineer polymer segments with different topological phases or two separated segments of the same topology whereby to study quantum phenomena emerging from trivialnontrivial interfaces as well as the interaction of two topologically protected edge states and their protection from disorder or

resolution ncafm images were obtained at constantheigh operating the qplus sensor in the frequency modulation mode using a constant amplitude oscillation of 50 pm the metal tip apex was prepared by gentle indentation 1 nm on the clean au111 substrate and functionalized with a co molecule dosed at lowtemperature conductance didv spectra and maps were taken using a lockin technique with an ac voltage frequency 700800 hz amplitude 110 mv rms added to the dc sample bias didv maps were recorded in constant current mode the data were processed using the wsxm software 49 all images and spectroscopy plots presented corresponds to raw data with only slope and gaussian corrections au111 substrate was prepared by standard ar sputtering at energies from 10 to 15 kv and annealing at 800 k afterwards the 4brpn molecules were deposited from a tantalum crucible at 450 k on the fresh cleaned au111 crystal held at rt hydrogenation of the pentacene polymers was achieved by placing the sample out from the cryostat and increasing the molecular hydrogen partial pressure of the stm chamber while keeping the ion gauge filament on the molecular hydrogen in the residual gas was then cracked by the filament and adsorbed by our polymers control experiments where the polymerdecorated sample was left out with the ion gauge off showed no hydrogenation of the chains even after long periods of time theoretical methods our qmmm simulations were performed using fireballamber method 46 that combines interface force field 50 for the au surface with fireball local orbital dft 42 for the molecule

off radii h s542 au and c sp595 au 54 the qmmm md simulation for the 5 15 and 20 chains were performed at 100k with a langevin thermostat for 10 ps with a time step of 05 fs vibronic couplings were calculated using formalism for calculations of nonadiabatic couplings in numerical local basis set described in 44 using fireball code for all freestanding finite and infinite chains dft calculations were done using fireball code with parameters described above we also obtained very similar results using fhiaims 41 where the geometry optimizations and electronic structure analyses were performed using b3lyp 55 exchangecorrelation functional systems were allowed to relax until the remaining atomic forces reached below 102 ev 1 to sample the brillouin zone for the infinite system with a periodic boundary condition a monkhorstpack grid of 18 1 1 was used and for the finite systems one kpoint at the gamma point theoretical didv maps were calculated from electronic structure obtained from the dft fireball 42 program package and with probe particle scanning probe microscopy ppspm code for an slike orbital tip 43 56 the afm simulations of the hydrogenated pentacene were performed by
