experimental investigation of thermal conductivity in indiumtinoxide ito thin films with various ga concentrations 030 at deposited by spray pyrolysis technique xray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy have shown a structural transformation in the range 1520 at ga from the nanocrystalline to the amorphous phase room temperature femtosecond time domain thermoreflectance measurements showed nonlinear decrease of thermal conductivity in the range 2005 wm1k1 depending on ga doping level comparing density functional theory calculations with xrd data it was found that ga atoms substitute in atoms in the ito nanocrystals retaining ia3 space group symmetry the calculated phonon dispersion relations revealed that ga doping leads to the appearance of hybridized metal atom vibrations with avoidedcrossing behavior these hybridized vibrations possess shortened mean free paths and are the main reason behind the thermal conductivity drop in nanocrystalline phase an evolution from propagative to diffusive phonon thermal transport in itoga with 1520 at of ga was established the suppressed thermal conductivity of itoga thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis may be crucial for their thermoelectric applications keywords thermal transport indiumtinoxide thin film thermoelectrics 1 introduction indium oxide based compounds and composites with high thermal stability have been intensively investigated as perspective semiconducting materials for hightemperature thermoelectric applications additives or supplement oxides of different metallic nature like zn sn ge ga y nb ni etc were used 17 in such compounds and composites to improve their thermoelectric and optical properties some of these materials retained the lattice structure of the host oxide at large amounts of additives the specifics of in2o3 lattice is its complexity and large number of atoms in the primitive cell 40 as a consequence one could expect the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity pph due to the trapping of heat energy by numerous optical modes and flattening of their energy dispersions 8 leading to lower phonon group velocities the structural complexity of ia3 space group impedes investigations of various defect complexes in in2o3 and their impact on electronic phononic and thermoelectric properties in ref 9 some of us has reported on theoretical investigations of electronic properties of in2o3 with sn ga and obased point defect complexes employing density functional theory it has been shown that defect complexes strongly influence the electronic band structure and position of indium and oxygen atoms 9 defect complex driven deviation in both atomic masses and crystal lattice strain results in enhancement of phonon scattering by point defects and may affect the lattice thermal conductivity impact of different defect complexes and structural vacancies on thermal properties of in2o3 requires additional investigations the strong improvement of specific electronic thermal and thermoelectric properties could be reached when the material is in nanocrystalline form recent theoretical results demonstrated that enhanced electrical conductivity and thermopower s providing an elevated power factor pppp ss 2 can be achieved in ito nanofilms 10 due to the filtering effect 1011 of low energy conduction electrons at grain boundaries the pf values of around 3 mwmk2 were reported for thermally aged ito films with an optimal sn content 1213 thorough independent experimental study 14 confirmed the presence of potential barrier in the vicinity of grain boundaries which are responsible for the filtering of electrons despite the degeneracy of ito conduction band ito nanofilms have also demonstrated reduced values of thermal conductivity as compared with bulk ito 15 the drop of thermal conductivity was explained by strong phonon scattering on grains reduction of electronic part eeee of thermal conductivity due to the filtering of low energy conduction electrons and porosity of ito films 15 due to the geometric complexity of the nanograin network the trapping of heat carrying vibrational modes leading to the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity pph is also possible reduction of thermal conductivity without degradation of electronic parameters s radically improves the thermoelectric efficiency determined by figure of merit zzzz ss 2 tttttttt looking for compounds with low tttttt and high enough and s is a mainstream in thermoelectric material science our experiments with itoga thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis have shown quite large values of pf 13 however an influence of deposition parameters like as pyrolysis temperature on electric and thermal properties of such films require further investigations and optimization ito films remain totally nanocrystalline up to 50 at sn 12 while nanocrystalline to amorphous phase transition in itosn10 at gabased films occurs at ga content 2030 at and may lead to a sharp drop in thermal conductivity thereby in this work we focus on experimental and theoretical investigations of thermal conductivity in itoga thin films with widely varying ga content and almost constant amount of sn 6 at such concentration of sn 1213 is optimal in terms of pf and zt the experiments were performed by an ultrafast femtosecond laserinduced time domain thermoreflectance method tdtr 1617 it is a powerful and versatile technique for thermal properties investigations of a large variety of bulk and nanoscale systems within the many advantages of tdtr in comparison with conventional thermal conductivity measurements is an excellent spatial resolution at a length scale below tens of micrometers tdtr also requires minimal sample preparation for the measurements using density functional theory dft and linearized boltzmann transport equation bte for phonons we investigate in detail how changes in phonon energy spectra affects both phonon scattering mechanisms and lattice thermal conductivity in itoga films at different ga concentrations the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss sample preparation and characterization section 3 describes tdtr technique of thermal conductivity measurements our theoretical model of phonon modes and lattice thermal conductivity in itoga films is presented in section 4 discussions of results are provided in section 5 conclusions are given in section 6 2 sample preparation and characterization ito films 6 at of sn content in sprayed solution were deposited at t350360 oc by spray pyrolysis method on polished silicon substrates 1x1 cm2 additionally within the same deposition procedure several films were doped by ga at various concentrations in the range up to 30 at hereinafter under ga concentration we refer to the following ratio gainsnga where corresponding partial concentrations of compound are indicated in parentheses the sprayed solution was prepared as a mixture of 02m precursors of incl3 sncl45h2o and gacl3 by dissolving in the dimethylformamide dmf the required film thickness around 200 nm was roughly monitored during the deposition of the film by its color and by sprayed solution volume and then was measured by f20 filmetrics instrument all experimental samples were annealed for a stabilization of film structural parameters at tan 500 oc during half an hour other details of our preparation method are provided in ref 18 the deposited films were characterized for their structural properties by an empyrean xrd system from malvern panalytical using cu k 15405 radiation within a diffraction angle range of 1570 in mode the surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy afm using a park xe7 instrument average surface roughness of deposited films did not exceed 10 nm surface images of the films were obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem using the hitachi s4700 instrument the films were monitored by using conventional secondary electrons mode at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv figure 1ad presents sem images for itoga films with ga content of 0 5 10 and 15 at at ga concentrations more than 15 at the films demonstrated totally amorphous structure the xrd summary pattern for all samples with tested ga contents shown in figure 2 confirms this conclusion the in2o3 characteristic peaks practically disappear at 20 at ga at the range 015 at of ga xrd 2 diffractograms show the existence of in2o3 nanocrystalline phase although it does not imply the absence of finely dispersed ga2o3 phase figure 1ad sem images of itoga films with 0 5 10 and 15 at ga figure 2 xrd intensity pattern for itoga films these two methods allow to compare polycrystalline effective grain sizes in crossplane extracted from xrd pattern by scherrer formula and inplane extracted from sem images directions respectively in figure 3 we show corresponding values of average grain sizes versus ga content in the measured films the difference in grain sizes extracted from xrd and sem patterns for pure ito film reflects the anisotropy growth during deposition that is peculiar for large enough grains with surface faceting the ga additive manifests in smaller roundshaped nanocrystallites and in a tendency to their agglomeration the position of dominated xrd in2o3 peaks and their shift with ga content allowed us to calculate the changes in the lattice constant figure 3 average grain size in itoga thin films squares and circles denote sem and xrd data respectively 3 tdtr measurements the thermal transport properties were examined by femtosecond laserinduced time domain thermoreflectance method an al film was predeposited on the itoga films and it was used as the thermal transducer of femtosecond laser pulses the pump beam was modulated by an electrooptic modulator at 10 mhz and illuminated the transducer with a gaussian radius of 59 m the pumpinduced reflectivity change was monitored by the probe beam of which amplitude is collected with a fast amplified silicon detector connected to a lockin amplifier we obtained inphase vin and outphase vout profiles of the pumpbeaminduced reflectivity variation of which phase is compared to the internal sinusoidal reference signal of the lockin amplifier we fitted the tdtr signal of vinvout in a temporal range between 100 ps and 375 ns by considering the thermal transport model in multilayered geometry based on the fouriers law 16 we set the boundary conductance across the alito interface and thermal conductivity of ito films as two adjustable parameters heat capacities of al cal242 jcm3k1 si 164 jcm3k1 and ito cito278 jcm3k1 were taken from the literature 1920 the thermal conductivity of al transducer was obtained from the direct current electric conductivity by using a wiedemannfranz law the al film thickness tal was estimated to have an average thickness of 10036 nm by taking the position of an acoustic echo peak in the tdtr signal the oscillating thermal wave cannot reach the bottom silicon substrate because of the very low thermal diffusivity of itoga thin films the average oscillating heat penetration depth is estimated to be within 3465 of itoga thickness because the lockin amplifier independently captures and separates the oscillating thermal responses from steadystate heating the thin films investigated here can be considered to be semiinfinite to check the validity and credibility of obtained thermal boundary conductance and thermal conductivity we examined how the final modeling results are sensitive to those parameters in the given measurement configuration the sensitivity is determined as the relative change of tdtr signal with respect to the relative change of the parameter of interest we found that our tdtr results are highly sensitive to ito but not to the other parameter galito the latter is attributed to the very low thermal diffusivity of ito samples so that the thermal gradient of oscillating heat is mostly given in ito despite the low sensitivity to galito we could successfully determine the quantity since the covariance between the two fitting parameters is small as about 0205 except for the ga content of 20 at having the value close to 06 in the error estimation we considered the sensitivity results uncertainties in the preparameters used in the thermal transport model and the positiondependent inhomogeneity after merging all these factors we estimated the final error by minimizing kullback6 leibler divergence 21 the obtained parameters of galito and ito are presented in figures 4a and b respectively at 20 at of ga the error bar of ito is relatively small while that of galito is much larger than error bars for other ga content the latter is attributed to the large covariance between ito and galito and to the high thermal resistivity of the amorphous phase which allow us to determine ito more reliably than galito figure 4 a thermal boundary conductance across the alito interface galito b thermal conductivity of ito thin films ito 4 theoretical methods all electronic calculations were performed within density functional theory formalism as implemented in the siesta code 22 a generalized gradient approximation gga for exchangecorrelation functional of perdew burke and ernzerhof pbesol 23 was used scalarrelativistic normconserving pseudopotentials for core states 24 generated with pseudodojo 25 and doublezeta basis set for localized atomic orbitals were employed with the following valence configurations for atoms in 4s24p64d105s25p1 sn 4s24p64d105s25p2 ga 3s23p63d104s24p1 and o 2s22p4 a realspace mesh with energy cutoff of 300 ry and 3x3x3 reciprocalspace mesh of the monkhorstpack type 26 were found sufficient to perform structure optimizations and calculate the secondorder interatomic force constants the force and stress convergence criteria were set to 0001 ev and 0005 gpa respectively for relaxed in2o3 with 40atom primitive cell in16o24 we have obtained a lattice constant of 10048 and volumetric density of 727 gcm3 which are close to experimental values of 10117 27 and 718 gcm3 28 the ito with various ga doping concentrations was simulated by adding removing a certain number of ga in atoms in a 40atom primitive cell of bixbyite crystal structure an example of which is shown in figure 5 in all cells one indium atom at bsite was replaced by a tin atom which corresponds to ito with 625 at sndoping the harmonic force constants were calculated using the finite difference method as implemented in the phonopy package 29 the displacement length of each atom from its equilibrium position was set to 0015 figure 5 example of itoga crystal structure two octahedra denote sn green and ga blue substitutional defects surrounded by six nearest oxygen atoms once the interatomic force constants were obtained the dynamical matrix was constructed and diagonalized thus obtaining phonon dispersions ss qq where s is phonon branch number and q is phonon wavevector based on the phonon dispersion data the phonon thermal conductivity was calculated using the linearized boltzmann transport equation pph nnnn qqss ss qqssxx qqss qq in equation 1 summation is performed over entire brillouin zone mesh and all phonon branches t is the temperature n is the number of qmesh points v is the unit cell volume and xx ddddddqqxx are the phonon frequency and group velocity along the thermal gradient is the phonon lifetime and f is the boseeinstein distribution function converged results for thermal conductivity were achieved for a dense 20x20x20 qpoint mesh n8000 points it is implied in equation 1 that thermal flux is directed along the temperature gradient that is along x cartesian axis the choice of the latter is formal since thermal conductivity tensor in bixbyite crystals is isotropic in case of crystalline nanocrystalline structures the phonon scattering rate was calculated according to the matthiessens rule 1 1uu 1gggg where 1uu bbbbss2 qqee 1tt is the threephonon umklapp scattering rate 30 and 1gggg ss qqllgg is the phonon scattering rate on grain ie nanocrystal boundaries with the average grain size llgg the scattering on grains is assumed to be diffusive so all incident phonons completely lose their momenta after they reach the grain boundary parameter b1018 sk of the umklapp scattering was found from the comparison between calculated and experimental 7 thermal conductivities of pure in2o3 ie without phonon scattering on grains in case of amorphous structures the dominant mechanism of heat transport is diffusion between localized atomic vibrations 31 in contrast to the wavelike phonon transport in crystals in order to model the diffusive character of thermal transport in amorphous itoga we employ here an approach developed by some of us in ref 32 comparing equations for lattice thermal conductivity within linearized bte see equation 1 and within a randomwalk diffusion theory of heat conduction 33 and can obtain the following expression for the rate of diffusion of lattice vibrations in an amorphous material 3ss2 qqss qq vv0 where vv0 is the volume per atom and is the mean vibrational frequency which we have estimated from the condition that is the frequency at which integrated phonon density of states dos equals onehalf 0 ggdddd 12 in this way we avoided using any free parameters in our thermal conductivity model for itoga films the electronic part eeee was estimated according to the filtering model 101134 necessary parameters of ito used in the calculations were taken from 35 electron scattering on polar optical phonons and ionized impurities were taken into consideration the total thermal conductivity was obtained as a sum of the phononic and electronic parts tttttt pph eeee also the porosity is an inevitable structural factor for spraypyrolyzed structures the effect of porosity on thermal conductivity of itoga was accounted according to the effective medium theory 3637 the porosity of our films was estimated in the range 2535 by comparing the real refractive index of the films measured by laser ellipsometry with the same one for the bulk material 38 this porosity is within a reasonable range since 44 porosity of in2o3 39 was reported for samples synthesized at 100 c we note here that we do not clarify an influence of pore ordering and their geometry on tttttt since currently we have no technological control over these factors this question requires an additional investigations and remains to be addressed in the future thereby for all calculated structures the porosity was constant and fixed to 30 to facilitate the theoretical analysis and rather to focus on understanding how changes in phonon dispersion and scattering mechanisms affect the thermal transport at various ga concentrations it is worth noting that higher porosity means lower thermal conductivity thus providing another way for phonon engineering 4043 and tuning the thermoelectric performance of indium oxide based material 5 results and discussions for accurate modeling of the thermal conductivity in our structures we should determine which position of the ito lattice tend to occupy ga atoms for this purpose we have extracted the lattice constants at different ga concentrations from our xrd measurements and compared them with theoretical values calculated from dft relaxation procedure figure 6 shows the evolution of the ito lattice constant as a function of ga content figure 6 lattice constant of itoga as a function of ga content squares denote xrd data red and blue circles denote theoretical calculations with ga atoms placed in different positions interstitial csite and substitutional dsite according to our previous work on in2o3 point defect formation energies 9 there are in general two possible scenarios for ga atoms in the first scenario all ga atoms occupy substitutional positions figure 6 blue circles which are the most energetically favorable here the theory predicts the compression of ito crystal structure with a linear decrease of lattice constant given by the law aaxx aa0 00085xx where aa0 1006 in the second scenario which is less likely from energetical point of view ga atom is placed at an intersite csite ie structural vacancy specific for ia3 space group in this case calculations predict an expansion of the crystal structure with an increase of the lattice constant from 1006 at 0 at ga to 1016 at 625 at ga however introduction of additional ga atoms in substitutional positions results again in the lattice compression figure 6 red circles according to experimental data figure 6 squares the lattice constant decreases when ga content increases from 0 at to 15 at thus supporting the first theoretical scenario with all ga atoms forming substitutional point defects our study of itoga system demonstrates that within the given technological conditions the bixbyite lattice structure is maintained until a quarter of in atoms is substituted by guest atoms and no secondary oxide phases sno2 ga2o3 appear with nonbixbyite crystallographic symmetries that confirms the high stability of cubic in2o3 structure on the other hand such substitution value 025 also means a high solubility limit of ga atoms in ito system further increase of ga doping dramatically changes the crystal structure xrd and sem measurements see figures 12 show that the structures become amorphous and lose the longrange atomic order nevertheless it means that formation of insngao compound occurs even with increased ga content in the deposited precursor otherwise traces of the bixbyite structure should have been preserved on the xrd spectra figure 7a shows the room temperature total thermal conductivity in itoga films as a function of ga content squares denote experimental data while circles represent theoretical calculations of tttttt with ga atoms in substitutional positions calculation of eeee within filtering model 101134 is also presented for comparison triangles intending to elucidate how the changes in crystalline structure affect the thermal conductivity at different ga concentrations we have performed two calculations of pph i with phonon lifetime for crystalline films according to equation 2 blue circles in figure 7a and ii with phonon lifetime for amorphous films according to equation 3 green circles in figure 7a in general the experimental results reveal a decreasing trend in tttttt for increasing ga doping up to 1520 at which reasonably agrees with calculations employing phonon lifetimes for crystalline films as the level of disorder increases further 20 at and 30 at ga the thermal conductivity saturates around value 0506 wm1k1 which is close to the theoretical predictions with phonon lifetimes for the amorphous case thus our theoretical results suggest that in the range 1520 at ga there is an evolution from propagative ie crystalline to diffusive ie amorphous phonon thermal transport in itoga films which is in a good agreement with xrd and sem measurements showing crystaltoamorphous structural transition at the same time our estimation of the electronic thermal conductivity demonstrates reduction of eeee from 028 wm1k1 at 0 at ga down to 019 wm1k1 at 1875 at ga amplification of electron scattering arises from reduction of the grain size with the rise of ga content the electron concentration in the conduction band remains unchanged because of isovalent nature of ga impurity the obtained values of eeee are in the same range as pph in amorphous calculation while they are several times lower than pph in crystalline calculation it is clear from figure 7a that decreasing of total thermal conductivity of itoga films as ga concentration increases up to 1520 at is mainly due to suppression of the phononic contribution specifically there are two responsible factors i reduction of the average grain size llgg see figure 3 with the corresponding increase of the phonon scattering rate and ii modification of the phonon energy spectra accompanied by diminution of the average group velocity of phonons see figure 8b below these are the main factors behind the thermal conductivity drop in the nanocrystalline itoga films figure 7 a total thermal conductivity of itoga films at 300 k as a function of ga content squares represent experimental data while circles denote theoretical calculations with phonon lifetimes for crystalline blue circles and amorphous green circles materials electronic thermal conductivity is denoted with red triangles b spectral phonon thermal conductivity in ito with 0 at ga red lines and 1875 at ga blue and green lines as a function of phonon energy calculations with crystalline and amorphous phonon lifetimes are presented a useful quantity that reveals the contribution of phonons at various energies into heat conduction is the spectral phonon thermal conductivity pph ee determined by pph pph eedddd figure 7b shows pph ee in crystalline and amorphous calculations for ito with 0 at ga red line and 1875 at ga blue and green lines the largest contribution to pph comes from phonons with energies in the range 035 mev the contribution of higher energy modes 40 mev in the amorphous case green line is 25 of pph while it is almost negligible in the crystalline case red and blue lines due to an enhanced phononphonon umklapp scattering characterized by a quadratic dependence on phonon frequency 1uu 2 moreover it is obviously seen that suppression of thermal conductivity with increasing ga content in the crystalline case is due to the weaker contribution from lowenergy 035 mev vibrations in case of amorphous films 15 at ga the pph ee dependence is almost insensitive to the amount of ga since according to equations 1 and 3 pph ee while mean vibrational frequency deviates very weakly for different ga concentrations eg 46 mev at 0 at ga and 45 mev at 1875 at ga we now turn to a more detailed analysis of the phonon properties and associated effects behind the thermal conductivity suppression in our itoga films the phonon dispersion and projected density of states pdos in ito with 1875 at ga is shown in figure 8a the pdos curves are presented per one atom of the respective specimen the maximum energy of optic phonons is 80 mev and is only weakly dependent on ga doping three acoustic branches light green curves one longitudinal acoustic la and two transversal acoustic ta demonstrate a linear dispersion near the brillouin zone center with sound velocities llll47 kms and tttt 29 kms at 0 at ga llll48 kms and tttt 30 kms so one can conclude that rise of ga content results in a weak softening of the acoustic branches figure 8 a phonon dispersion and pdos in ito with 1875 at ga the green curves in phonon spectra highlight acoustic branches the orange circle designates the region with a clear avoided crossing b average phonon group velocity as a function of phonon energy in ito with 0 at ga red line and 1875 at ga blue line c avoidedcrossing behavior of phonon dispersion in itoga d phonon mean free paths at 300 k according to the dispersion and pdos data it is natural to split the whole energy range into the lower part 035 mev which is dominated by the vibrations of the metal atoms and the upper part 40 mev in which the vibrations of lighter oxygen atoms determine the vibrational spectrum these two parts are separated by an energy gap in the range 3540 mev which slightly narrows as ga concentration increases the lowenergy part of the spectra is characterized by hybridization mixing of metaltype vibrational modes mixed insn inga and snga modes these hybridized modes are accompanied by the appearance of multiple avoidedcrossing points throughout the brillouin zone see figure 8c for an example resulting in the flattening of the dispersion law and a corresponding decrease of the average group velocity at phonon energies between 10 and 30 mev see figure 8b this effect is more pronounced for higher ga concentrations and it plays an important role in the suppression of the phonon heat conduction in nanocrystalline itoga films the similar avoided14 crossing behavior was found in hostguest type materials such as ba8ga16ge30 clathrate 44 and ybfe4sb12 skutterudite 45 an analytical model describing the phonon dispersion relation of hostguest lattices with heavy guest atoms was recently proposed in ref 46 it is insightful to separate between the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the pph of itoga at different gadoping the intrinsic element is the modification of phonon dispersion and group velocities related to the changes in the atomic composition and interatomic forces from the extrinsic factors we can distinguish the variation in average grain size which directly affects the phonon scattering rate on the grain boundaries it should be noted that extrinsic factors usually could be tailored within a certain limit by the technological conditions thus providing additional way for managing the thermal flux in itobased structures in order to quantify the influence of the above factors on pph we show in figure 8d the mean free paths mfps of phonons calculated taking into account umklapp processes and phonon scattering on the grain boundaries red and blue triangles it can be seen that mfp of lowenergy phonons 10mev in nanocrystalline itoga is limited merely by the scattering on grains with an average grain size llgg 24nm for 0 at ga and llgg 15nm for 1875 at ga as was determined from our xrd measurements presented in figure 3 for higher energies the phononphonon umklapp scattering prevails and the phonon mfp quickly drops nevertheless according to the boseeinstein distribution the population factors of the lowenergy modes are smaller than of higher energy modes as a result the overall contribution to the heat flux from the energy range 010 mev does not exceed 30 as determined from the spectral pph data see figure 7b at the same time phonons with energies 1035 mev are the main heat carriers at room temperature transferring more than 23 of the total thermal flux therefore the drop in thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline itoga films as the ga content increases is primarily due to the redistribution of the vibrational spectrum in this energy range leading to diminution of the average group velocity and mfps of phonons finally in the upper part of the spectra 40 mev all modes possess mfps below 1 nm owing to the low group velocities and enhanced umklapp scattering resulting in an almost negligible contribution to the thermal conductivity as follows from pph ee on figure 7b in contrast the phonon mfps in an amorphous calculation gray triangles in figure 8d are almost uniformly distributed over entire energy range and this picture is independent of ga content it explains the relatively high contribution of highenergy phonon modes in the amorphous case as well as the much weaker dependence of phonon thermal conductivity on ga amount in comparison with nanocrystalline itoga films 6 conclusions thermal properties of ito thin films with ga concentrations up to 30 at deposited by spray pyrolysis were investigated both experimentally and theoretically xrd and sem spectra showed the existence of in2o3 nanocrystalline phase in the range 015 at ga while for higher ga concentrations the films demonstrated an amorphous structure the incorporation of ga atoms into the host lattice during the growth in given technological conditions is an important finding regarding the high ga solubility limit in ito tdtr measurements revealed a decreasing of room temperature thermal conductivity with increase of gacontent from 20 wm1k1 at 5 at ga down to 08 wm1 k1 at 15 at ga while for higher ga concentrations thermal conductivity saturates 0506 wm k1 theoretical modelling within dft and bte approaches demonstrated that this drop of thermal conductivity is primarily due to the redistribution of the metal atoms vibrations in the energy range 1035 mev accompanied by the appearance of multiple avoidedcrossing modes throughout the brillouin zone with decreased group velocity and shortened phonon mfps in the range 1520 at ga both experimental and theoretical results confirm the evolution from propagative to diffusive phonon thermal transport in itoga nanofilms the obtained results demonstrate the practical possibility of engineering the thermal conductivity in ito films by ga doping and may lead to their thermoelectric applications author contributions conceptualization vb dgj and dln software ac and dgj validation vb gk sv jsl and dln visualization ac and
