dwarf carbon dc stars main sequence stars showing carbon molecular bands are enriched by mass transfer from a previous asymptoticgiantbranch agb companion which has since evolved to a white dwarf while previous studies have found radialvelocity variations for large samples of dcs there are still relatively few dc orbital periods in the literature and no dc eclipsing binaries have yet been found here we analyze photometric light curves from the zwicky transient facility for a sample of 944 dc stars from these light curves we identify 24 periodically variable dc stars remarkably of the periodic dcs 80 have periods less than a day we also provide spectroscopic followup for four of these periodic systems measuring radial velocity variations in three of them shortperiod dcs are almost certainly postcommonenvelope binary systems since the periodicity is most likely related to the orbital period with tidally locked rotation and photometric modulation on the dc either from spots or from ellipsoidal variations we discuss evolutionary scenarios that these binaries may have taken to accrete sufficient crich material while avoiding truncation of the thermally pulsing agb phase needed to provide such material in the first place we compare these dcs to commonenvelope models to show that dc stars probably cannot accrete enough crich material during the commonenvelope phase suggesting another mechanism like windroche lobe overflow is necessary the periodic dcs in this paper represent a prime sample for spectroscopic followup and for comparison to future models of

carbon c stars are those that show molecular absorption bands of c such as c2 cn and ch in their optical spectra secchi 1869 intrinsic c stars have experienced c enrichment via dredgeup of fusion products from their cores during the thermally pulsing tp phase of the asymptotic giant branch agb shell he flashes cause strong convection in the shell regions bringing c into the atmosphere the third dredgeup corresponding author benjamin roulston broulstoncfaharvardedu sao predoctoral fellow if the co ratio increases above unity a giant c star is formed since c preferentially binds with oxygen to form co leaving excess c to form the c molecules of c2 cn and ch thus it was long thought that all c stars were giants on the tpagb this made it quite surprising when dahn et al 1977 found the first mainsequence c star g7761 this dwarf carbon dc star cannot have yet experienced fusion to create c enhancement or the third dredgeup as it is a mainsequence star dahn et al 1977 put forth a few explanations of this c enhancement on the mainsequence with the favored being that g7761 was in a binary system and had experienced c enhanced mass transfer from a previous agb companion this former agb companion would since have become a white roulston et al dwarf wd and cooled until no longer detectable alongside the dc indeed this seemed to have been confirmed when dearborn et al 1986 found g7761 to be a radial velocity rv binary with an orbital period of 2455 d today g7761 is no longer the only known dc with close to 1000 known in the literature the majority of these dcs come from the green 2013 and si et al 2014 samples which were found from allsky spectroscopic surveys this has included almost a dozen smoking gun systems in which the wd companion is sufficiently hot to be visible in the optical spectra as a spectroscopic composite heber et al 1993 liebert et al 1994 green 2013 si et al 2014 these samples have shown that the dc stars are actually the most common type of c star in the galaxy their carbonenriched atmospheres make dcs the most likely progenitors of the carbonenhanced metalpoor ch and possibly the ba ii stars all showing carbon and sprocess enhancements jorissen et al 2016 de marco izzard 2017 these stars being more luminous than dcs have been studied via rv campaigns which have shown increased binarity compared to normal orich stars indicating they have likely also experienced mass transfer from an unseen companion sperauskas et al 2016 barium dwarfs and ch subgiants show periods from rv analysis of 120 years escorza et al 2019 blue straggler stars are another class similar to dcs in that they may have experienced mass transfer from a previous agb companion as discussed by gosnell et al 2019 blue straggler stars in a cluster colormagnitude diagram are more luminous and bluer than the main sequence turnoff while some are likely formed in mergers or collisions most blue straggler stars are thought like dc stars to be the result of mass transfer from a giant to a main sequence dwarf most blue straggler stars are found in wide binaries with periods of order 1000 days consistent with expectations of mass transfer from an agb star onto a mainsequence companion chen han 2008 gosnell et al 2014 which leaves a cocore wd remnant paczyski 1971 those blue straggler stars that form after mass transfer from an red giant branch star yields a blue straggler in a shorter binary period of order 100 days chen han 2008 leaving a hecore wd companion the salient point relevant to dc stars is that significant mass is typically gained in these encounters while dc stars are now known to be numerous details of their properties remains sparse this is especially true of their orbital properties currently there are only six orbital periods for dcs in the literature the first is of the dc prototype g7761 found to be a singleline spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 2455 d dearborn et al 1986 the central source of the necklace nebula was found to be a binary with a dc which has a photometric period of 116 d corradi et al 2011 miszalski et al 2013 the three longest period dcs in the literature are those from harris et al 2018 who found astrometric binaries with periods of 123 yr 321 yr and 1135 yr the most recent dc period to be found was from margon et al 2018 who found a photometric period of 292 d and confirmed this as the orbital period with spectroscopic followup there have also been large sample fewepoch spectroscopy campaigns of dcs whitehouse et al 2018 conducted a fewepoch survey of 28 dcs finding rv variability in 21 of them implying a high binary fraction roulston et al 2019 conducted a larger survey of 240 dcs using fewepoch spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey sdss blanton et al 2017 they found that dcs are consistent with 100 binarity with separations of order 1 au and periods of order 1 yr both the whitehouse et al 2018 and roulston et al 2019 surveys lacked enough spectral epochs to fit individual orbits and instead relied on statistical analysis to describe the dc population as a whole de kool green 1995 modeled the space density of dcs and they predicted the dc period to be bimodal with peaks near 102 103 d and 103 105 d consistent with the known periods listed above de kool green 1995 also found that the production of dcs is strongly dependent on metallicity finding no dcs should be formed in systems with initial metallicity greater than half of solar ie feh 03 this is in agreement with metallicity measurements of g7761 where plez cohen 2005 found feh 40 making g7761 one of the lowest metallicity stars known this also has been supported by farihi et al 2018 who found 3060 of dcs to be halo objects which are metal poor the known dc periods span from 1 d to 4100 d likely indicating different formation pathways the longest dc periods that are of order 10s of years likely experienced only standard rochelobe overflow rlof or windrlof wrlof these periods are consistent with other types of postmasstransfer systems such as the blue straggler stars the dcs with periods 1 d would have likely experienced commonenvelope ce evolution paczynski 1976 ivanova et al 2013 since the tpagb envelope expands to several 100s of solar radii of interest is how ce evolution affects dc formation from the known dc periods it is very likely that dcs with periods near a few days or less will experience some form of ce during the agb phase of the evolved companion ztf variability in dwarf carbon stars once the ce phase has started the plungein of the lowermass companion in our case the future dc could truncate the evolution of the agb by ejection of its envelope if this happens before the tpagb phase and the third dredgeup it is likely that the c enhancement needed for dc formation will not occur however if the ce begins after the agb companion has already become a cgiant then it may be possible for the mainsequence companion to accrete enough crich material from the ce to become a dc depending on the accretion efficiency if the accretion efficiency is not high enough however the mainsequence companion will not accrete enough material from the ce alone requiring some combination of ce evolution with efficient mass transfer before the ce phase that is sufficient to transform an orich mainsequence star into a crich dc significant accretion of mass and angular momentum from the agb companion could result in significant spinup and subsequent activity in some dcs green et al 2019 if there are dcs left in very tight orbits with the wd remnant they may show tidally locked rotation periods synchronous rotation as well as tidal distortions causing ellipsoidal variations a search for periodicity in photometrically variable dcs could reveal some systems useful for constraining their evolution another motivation to study variability in dcs is that no dc masses have yet been measured because there are no known eclipsing dc systems we can estimate dc masses from optical or infrared ir colors see section 62 but these estimates have uncharacterized systematics due to differences between normal orich stars and c stars in the optical and ir regions this lack of eclipsing dc systems highlights the importance of photometric surveys to search for the first wellcharacterized eclipsing dc systems these systems could when combined with rv followup provide the first reliable dc mass measurements and help us understand more about the amount and composition of accreted mass needed to form a dc margon et al 2018 conducted a search for periodic dcs using the palomar transient factory ptf law et al 2009 rau et al 2009 finding just one periodic dc however they clearly highlighted the potential for large photometric surveys to find periodic dcs particularly dcs with short periods that should have experienced the strongest phases of ce mass transfer in this paper we report on a unique sample of close binary dcs implicating them as postcommon envelope binaries pcebs and likely precvs discovered from their periodic photometric variability in the zwicky transient facility in section 2 we describe the sample of dcs we selected to search and in section 3 we de tail our process for cleaning and preparing the raw light curves in section 4 we describe our process for finding which dcs have detected periodic signals in section 5 we present spectroscopic followup for four of the periodic dcs in this paper finally in section 6 we present comparisons of these short period dcs to binary population synthesis models to understand how a commonenvelope phase relates to dc formation 2 sample selection to search for variability in as many dcs as possible we compiled a list of all dcs from the current literature the largest contributor is the green 2013 sample of carbon stars from the sdss we also selected a smaller number of dcs from si et al 2014 who found dcs using a label propagation algorithm from sdss dr8 yielding 96 new dc stars and from li et al 2018 who selected carbon stars from the large sky area multiobject fiber spectroscopic telescope survey lamost cui et al 2012 using a machine learning approach our resulting final sample consists of 944 dcs with our compiled sample to ensure that any periodic candidate was indeed a dwarf carbon star we used gaia dr2 parallaxes proper motions gaia collaboration et al 2018 and distances bailerjones et al 2018 we required that each periodic c star had mg 5 mag from gaia dr2 based either on 1 significant parallax err 5 1824 periodic dcs or 2 a significant proper motion 5 which sets an upper limit on the dc distance by limiting its transverse velocity to be less than an assumed galactic escape velocity smith et al 2007 of about 600 kms 624 periodic dcs 3 light curve processing using our list of dcs we crossmatched our sample to the zwicky transient facility dr3 ztf bellm et al 2019 masci et al 2019 graham et al 2019 we required a match to be within 200 of our target coordinates and each star having 10 epochs in the available ztf filters from the resulting matches we grouped all sources detected within the match distance to our dc sample to ensure all epochs for each dc were included the final sample of light curves resulted in 668 dcs with ztf g light curves 712 dcs with ztf r light curves and 406 dcs with ztf i light curves we summarize the light curve sample for each filter in table 1 for each light curve we only used epochs for which the ztf flag catflags 0 no ztf flags ensuring every epoch is of a high quality we checked for any epochs which appear to be discrepant by performing an outlier removal on all the roulston et al table 1 light curve statistics ztf filter nstars ztf g ztf r ztf i 668 712 406 n epochs 111 151 nepochs 118 144 mag magerr 1936 1846 1815 010 006 006 notestatistics of the light curves in the three ztf filters for each filter we report the number of stars the mean number of epochs the standard deviation of the number of epochs the mean magnitude and the mean magnitude error light curves we first select from the raw light curve the brightest and faintest 5 of epochs within these brightest and faintest 5 we calculate the median magnitude of each ie the median of the 5 brightest and 5 faintest and the mean error of that same brightest and faintest 5 we then removed any outliers that were 2 brighter than the median of the brightest 5 and removed those 2 fainter than the median of the faintest 5 if this selection dropped the number of epochs below 10 we removed that light curve from our analysis this treament rejects most artifacts without removing genuine astrophysical variability we checked the light curves for each dc in each filter to determine if each dc had detected variability by examining how the mean magnitude changed across the observed light curve time span a number of dcs which show no periodic variability in our analysis in section 4 and a few periodic dcs show signs of nonperiodic variability as well as secular longterm trends these nonperiodic but variable dcs are of interest and may be signs of flaring variable obscuration or perhaps accretion onto the wd companion they warrant further investigation but we do not discuss them further in this paper the light curves that show longterm trends of brightening or dimming on 100s of days timescales cause the mean magnitude to vary over the entire time span of the light curve this variable mean magnitude can cause issues with our period search therefore we removed these long term trends by fitting out a thirdorder polynomial to the raw light curve 4 periodic variability for each light curve we searched for periodic signals down to a minimum period of 01 d using the the lombscargle periodogram lomb 1976 scargle 1982 we selected the highest peak and if this peak corresponds to an instrumental alias 1d 295d 1yr etc or a harmonic of one of these aliases 12 13 14 15 2 3 4 5 we removed that signal from the light curve and re calculated the periodogram until the highestpower frequency was not an alias we counted a frequency not as an alias if it was more than 150 frequency bins away from the pure alias frequency ie more than 0005 d1 away from an alias for the highest remaining peak we calculated the falsealarm probability vanderplas 2018 we required that log fap 5 in at least one filter for us to select a specific dc as a periodic candidate more conservative than eg the log fap 3 used in the recent ztf periodic variable catalog of chen et al 2020 for the dcs which have light curves selected as periodic candidates we checked for any possible harmonic confusion in the found period for each dc in each filter we plot a power spectrum from the ls analysis this is used to determine how strong the highestpower frequency is compared to the log fap limit and the background peaks figure 1 shows an example power spectrum for an object with a very strong periodic signal and shows clear peaks with 1d aliasing above the background in some cases the strongest peaks were aliases typically harmonics of 1 month that overwhelmed the power spectrum for these dcs we inspected each power spectrum in conjunction with phased light curves if another nonalias peak ie with a frequency more than 0005 d1 away from an alias was found in the power spectrum meeting our fap limit that new peak was selected as the period for that dc if no nonalias peaks could be found the dc candidate was removed from our sample some dcs show strong periodic signals in one filter but do not reach our fap limit in the other available filters for these dcs if one filter has a period that meets our fap limit and that period is visible in the other filter we include that second filter even if its fap does not meet our limit this makes it possible for some dcs to have a log fap 5 in a filter if they have log fap 5 in another filter for all periodic dc candidates selected after inspection of their power spectra we plotted phased light curves folded on the highest selected peak period in addition we plotted 8 different harmonics of that period 12 13 14 15 2 3 4 5 to check for aliases caused by gaps in the observational coverage using this plot we calculated modelfit statistics eg 2 and selected which period harmonic has the best model fit we used the best period to phase the light curve to which we fit the final periodic model figure a1 appendix shows the phased light curves for all of the periodic dc candidates each light curve is plotted twice in phase to

our analysis is marked by an arrow the highest significance peak is used to fold the observed light curve yielding the phasefolded light curve in the top panel the best fitting model see section 4 is marked by the red solid line ability the red line in each plot represents the bestfit model as described below and the residuals are shown below each light curve our bestfit models were computed using the automatic fourier decomposition afd method as detailed in torrealba et al 2015 we set an upper limit on the number of fourier series terms of nmax 6 to reduce overfitting no significant nonharmonic terms were included though one dc lamost j062558330230194 showed different peaks in its power spectrum between the g and r filters with the second highest peak in each filter being the highest peak in the other the best afd model was used to calculate the amplitude and epoch of brightest time t0 for each light curve we removed any dc for which the folded light curve shows no clear periodic signal or for which the amplitude of the variability was less than 0005 mag table 2 contains the properties for this final periodic dc sample we estimated errors for the best found period using a markovchain monte carlo mcmc method for each dc in each filter with a detected period we started 50 mcmc walkers in a gaussian around the detected period we sampled the walkers for 10000 steps each at each step using the phase dispersion minimization technique stellingwerf 1978 to calculate the likelihood at each walker position we used the 1 of the marginalized period distribution as the photometric period error for that dc however this is only a statis tical error and does not account for the possibility that we have selected an alias rather than the true period our final dc sample contains 24 individual dcs that are periodic in at least one ztf filter given the wide initial orbits necessary for progenitor dc systems to avoid truncation of the tpagb phase before enough crich material can be transferred it is remarkable that 19 80 of these dcs have periods 1 d indicating they should have experienced a commonenvelope ce phase the likely origins of the variability in these dcs include spot rotation on the dc or tidal distortion of the dc atmosphere from being in a close orbit with a wd since many of these dcs have short periods we assume that these systems would have experienced a ce phase and have circularized and synchronized hurley et al 2002 however if the light curve variability is from the dc being tidally distorted our detected period would be half the orbital period even with 2 longer true orbital periods these systems should still have experienced a ce phase tidal distortion should introduce a nonsinusoidal shape to the light curves however there is little evidence of this in our sample lending some evidence that most of the detected variability is probably from spot rotation therefore the origin of the variability in these dcs is not yet fully known without comparison to spectroscopic rv followup 01h31m1905s 02h35m3065s 02h35m3065s 04h16m0511s 05h02m4082s 06h25m5834s 06h25m5834s 12h23m5763s 12h30m4552s 12h30m4552s 12h58m2952s

used the 08500 slit and were reduced using the mage reduction pipeline2 chilingarian 2020 the reduced spectra cover from about 3200 to 10000 with r4500 observations for sbss 1310561 were acquired at the 15m fred lawrence whipple observatory flwo telescope with the fast spectrograph fabricant et al 1998 using the 600 l mm1 grating and the 1500 slit which provides wavelength coverage from 6000 to 8000 at 15 spectral resolution 52 sdss j151905965007029 one of the more interesting dcs in our periodic sample with photometric periodicity detected with highest significance is sdss j151905965007029 also known as cbs 311 we use j1519 in the rest of this paper a dcda spectroscopic composite binary j1519 was discovered by liebert et al 1994 and has been studied on numerous occasions farihi et al 2010 green 2013 whitehouse et al 2018 ashley et al 2019 roulston et al 2019 green et al 2019 however this is the first reporting of its periodic variability j1519 r 173 mag has four epochs of optical spectra in the sdss with the most recent spectrum shown in the top panel of figure 2 the spectrum of j1519 shows a dc with a hot da wd companion as well as h emission whitehouse et al 2018 and roulston et al 2019 httpsbitbucketorgchil saibinospecwikihome httpsbitbucketorgchil saimagepipelinesrcmaster found rv variability using fewepoch spectroscopy with rvmax of 468 158 km s1 and 44 20 km s1 respectively farihi et al 2010 conducted a study of wdred dwarf systems including j1519 using the hubble space telescope they found j1519 to be unresolved placing the constraint on its separation of 10 au 521 j1519 wd model fits since j1519 is a spectroscopic dcda composite we can fit wd model atmospheres to the wd component to fit teff and logg using the sdss spectra bdard et al 2020 fit wd models and found fit values of 31233213 k and 797005 respectively farihi et al 2010 found that spectroscopically fit wd parameters are often biased due to a cool companion to update the fits of bdard et al 2020 we performed our own model atmosphere fits to the da component of j1519 using the synthetic wd model atmospheres of levenhagen et al 2017 we first fit the late type dc dcm template of roulston et al 2020 to the sdss spectrum of j1519 by finding the bestfit velocity shifting the template and then scaling it to the flux near h we then removed the dc spectrum from the total spectrum leaving just the wd component we then fit the visible balmer lines from h and blueward to the entire grid of wd model spectra we interpolated the grid of wd model spectra to include halfsteps in the model space our bestfitting model parameters for teff and logg were 31000500 k and 785005 respectively and can be seen in figure 2 the black line is the single sdss spectrum with the highest sn shifted to the restframe and the blue line is the best fit wd model spectrum we did not use h for the wd fit as the dc component contributes most to the spectrum in emission in addition we did not use the h9 line as only half of the line is visible in the sdss spectrum the wd temperature of our fit is in good agreement with that of bdard et al 2020 however our logg is 012 dex lower resulting in both our wd mass and cooling age being lower than those in bdard et al 2020 for the purposes of this paper we adopt our fit values of logg and teff the wd properties we use can be found in table 3 with the mass radius and cooling age coming from the models of fontaine et al 2001 522 j1519 radial velocities although rv variability has been detected in j1519 there are no published rv orbital fits for this system based on our photometric analysis we found a period of 030237 000070 d 7 hr for j1519 therefore we conducted a spectroscopic monitoring of j1519 using roulston et al table 3 j1519 wd

parameter lists the source used 1 this paper 2 from evolutionary models of fontaine et al 2001 the mmt spectroscopic setup as was described in section 51 on the nights of 2020 august 19 and 20 we observed a sequence of 21200 s exposures on the night of 2020 august 22 we observed 27200 s exposures and on the nights 2021 april 21 and 23 we observed 24230 s exposures the exposures on each night were then coadded in threes resulting in seven final epochs on the first two nights nine epochs on the third night and eight on each of the last two nights for a combined total of 39 epochs with about 600 s total exposure each with an average sn 5 for all epochs in the continuum region near h since the full spectrum includes both stellar components we measured the rv from the h emission line presumed to come from the dc atmosphere alone first for each epoch we rescaled the latetype dcm dc template of roulston et al 2020 to the flux in our mmt spectrum in the region of 63006500 we then used this as the model for the dc continuum level of that epoch which was used to calculate the h emission line center equivalent width and associated errors the rv measurements have an average error of approximately 5 km s1 and the equivalent width measurements have an average error of approximately 018 figure 2 shows the measured rv middle and h equivalent widths bottom for j1519 to fit the rv curve we used the rvfit program which uses a simulated adaptive annealing procedure the details of which can be found in iglesiasmarzoa et al 2015 we left all parameters free to be fit with the solution quickly converging to a circular orbit we therefore refit the rv curve leaving all parameters free again except for the eccentricity which we fix to e 00 the resulting bestfit model can be seen in figure 2 red curve and the fit parameters can be found in table 4 the best fitting orbital period from the rvs 0327526 0000012 d is longer than the best photometric period by 002516 000070 d about 36 minutes fixing the period in the rv fitting procedure to that of the photometric period results in a poorer model fit with the longer period model being a better fit at the 32 level the bestfit semiamplitude of k2 33314 km s1 rvmax 2k 666 km s1 is in agreement with the rv variations found by whitehouse et al 2018 and roulston et al 2019 as their random epochs likely did not catch the true rv amplitude however the low measured semiamplitude suggests an extremely low inclination of this system with i 10 if we take our estimated dc mass of 04 m from section 62 one possible explanation for a longer orbital period than photometric period is that j1519 was spun up by the accretion that it experienced and has not yet synchronized the rotation and orbital periods in the approximate 8 myr since mass transfer stopped assuming the mass transfer ceased at the same time the wd formed green et al 2019 analyzed chandra observations of j1519 as well as five other h emission dcs and found it to show xray emission consistent with having a short rotation period which would lend support to the accretion spinup scenario deeper photometric imaging and rv followup particularly of the wd component could even better characterize this system it is clear however that this dc has both photometric and rv variability on a 033d timescale indicating it most likely has a short orbital period and formed through a ce event 53 sdss j123045534109438 another interesting dc is sdss j123045534109438 j1230 whose sdss spectrum is shown in figure 3 j1230 shows the c2 and cn lines typical of late type dc stars but also shows strong absorption lines of k and a strong cah band near 6800 additionally this dc shows strong emission lines of h h h h and ca h and k unlike j1519 there is no visible wd component in the spectrum of j1230 we observed j1230 r 166 mag with the binospec spectrograph on the 65m mmt using the setup described in section 51 we took 6266 s spectra on the nights of 2021 february 3 5 7 8 9 11 and 15 this resulted in a total of 42 spectra with an average sn of 13 in the continuum region near h we measured the line center and equivalent widths of the h line as well as for the two k lines visible in our mmt spectra of j1230 the emission and absorption lines have the same velocities indicating the are coming from the same region we average these velocities to measure the rv for each of the 42 epochs in the same method as j1519 we used the rvfit program to fit the rv curve of j1230 for this dc we left all parameters free for fitting with the resulting best 5000 cn cn 6000 7000 wavelength cncncn 8000 9000 10000 150 75 normalized flux 125 100 50 h 4000 150 km s1 flux density 1017 erg s1 cm2 1 ztf variability in dwarf carbon stars 000 025

the best fitting model atmosphere to the da component of the dcwd composite j1519 is shown in blue with the inset to the right showing a zoomedin stacked view of the balmer lines used in the model fit the black lines are the normalized flux of the wd component and the blue lines are the best fitting model atmosphere dashed grey lines means that that balmer line was not used in the fit due to poor quality the resulting dc component simply the observed spectrum with the wd model subtracted is shown in red middle rv as measured from the h line for j1519 phased on the time of periastron passage from the rv fit and the fit rv period of 0327526 d the red solid line represents the best fitting model bottom equivalent widths measured from the h line phased on the fit rv period of 0327526 d the blue curve is the bestfit model to the data of a single sinusoid the yaxis has been inverted so that smaller equivalent width values more emission are up period fit matching that of the photometric light curve p 08826 00014 d we therefore fix the period to the photometric period and the eccentricity to 00 and refit the rvs the resulting best fit can be found in table 4 and the phased rv curve in figure 3 as with j1519 we find the parameter errors using a mcmc method centered around the best fit parameters the best fit gives a circular orbit with a semiamplitude of k2 1230 07 km s1 if we use our estimated dc mass from section 62 025 m and an assumed wd mass of 06 m the implied inclination of this system is around i 55 the presence of multiple emission lines of h and ca may suggest that the photometric variability of j1230 may be coming from reprocessing of the wd flux on the surface of the dc even though the wd companion to j1230 is not hot enough to be seen in the optical spectrum it may be warm enough to still heat the surface of the dc if this is true we could expect the dc to be at maximum brightness when the wdfacing side is pointed toward us maximally ie when the dc is moving transversely on the sky between the ascending and descending nodes comparing the light curve of j1230 to the rvs however shows this is not the case as if it were we would expect the rv to be moving to the descending node after the photometric maximum which the rv curve for j1230 is 033 out of phase with this suggests that the photometric variability may not be coming from reprocessing but rather from spot rotation on an active dc with the emission lines indicating chromospheric activity we do note that the uncertainties on our epoch of maximum brightness and period make it difficult for such precise comparison so many cycles after our light curve t0 which could cause us to incorrectly predict the phase when our spectroscopy was collected in 2021 february by up to 075 cycles followup photometry should improve the ephemeris and allow a more confident comparison 54 sbss 1310561 we observed sbss 1310561 r 141 mag using the fast spectrograph on the 15m telescope at flwo using

continuum region near h unlike with our mmt and magellan observations because of observing time constraints on our awarded fast time these spectra were only observed close to the quadrature phases based on the ztf photometry p 083867 000066 d we assumed that the photometric period corresponds to the orbital period and used t0 from the light curve to calculate the expected times that sbss 1310561 should be at the quadrature phases 025 and 075 our actual observations were taken at phases 059002 and 083001 these uncertainties only take into account the span of phases the spectra were taken and not the uncertainty from the light curve t0 which may be substantial up to 05 in phase after the approximately 460 orbits between the light curve observations and the spectroscopy from these spectra we measured the rv at 059 to be vr 319 75 km s1 and the rv at 083 to be vr 83 11 km s1 taking the difference in these two velocities for this system rv 115 13 km s1 can place a lower limit on the semiamplitude of k2 57 7 km s1 using our estimated mass from section 62 034m and an assumed wd mass of 06 m this constrains the inclination to i 24 if i 60 then we would expect k2 122 km s1 since the phase difference between our two epochs is quite small this rv suggests that sbss 1310561 is in a tight orbit and is very likely a pceb 55 lamost j062558330230194 the dc lamost j062558330230194

reduced spectra consists of 30 epochs with an average sn of 22 each in the continuum region near h using the h emission line we measured the rv of j0625 for each epoch we found no evidence for rv variability nor any variability in h equivalent width we found the rv to vary with only a standard deviation of 39 km s1 and with a maximum rv 121 32 km s1 in addition crosscorrelation of the spectra

is not related to the orbital period in this system since such a low inclination and low semiamplitude is unlikely if the photometric period of 75942 d represents the orbital period hence this system adds weight to the evidence that the photometric variability in dcs may often be due to spot rotation 6 common envelope connection for the progenitor of the dc companion to become a c giant it must enter the thirddredge up phase iben 1974 agb stars have a degenerate co core with a doubleshell moving outward from the core of helium and hydrogen as the hydrogen shell which produces most of the energy continues to fuse h into he the helium shell surrounding the core continues to grow eventually the helium shell experiences runaway fusion driving expansion of the envelope material above this heshell flash and expansion means the star is now in the thermally pulsing agb tpagb phase helium shell fusion causes the intershell region to become strongly convective dredging helium fusion products to the surface ie the third dredgeup as the expansion continues the pressure in the helium shell will drop eventually stopping its energy production the layers contract again with hydrogen shell fusion resuming and the cycle repeats each successive thermal pulse becomes stronger reaching deeper into the intershell zone and the stellar radius increases iben renzini 1983 as helium shell fusion products are brought to the surface it is possible that the envelope carbon abundance increases until co 1 since c preferentially binds with o c2 and cn bands only appear when co 1 forming a c giant star agb stars going through the tpagb phase can reach radii of 800 r 37 au as they experience successively stronger thermal pulses marigo et al 2017 assuming an agb mass of 25 m agb radius of 800 r and a dc mass of 04 m this system would experience the beginning of a commonenvelope ce with an initial period of 42 yr if the dc mass is 10 m instead then p 38 yr therefore dcs with initial periods  4 yr 1500 d or less will very likely have experienced a ce phase corresponding to the shorterperiod peak modeled by de kool green 1995 the dcs in this paper with p 1 d are most certainly the result of a ce spiralin of the six dc periods in the current literature two of them have p 3 d so have likely experienced a ce it seems then that many dcs may have experienced a ce phase dellagli et al 2021 recently studied the extreme agb stars those agb stars which have extremely red midir colors eg gruendl et al 2008 and showed that the the excess dust and outflow densities of these stars may be explained by envelope stripping in a ce event their models suggest that these extreme agb stars are actually postcommonenvelope binaries pcebs with orbital periods of order 1 d matching the periods for dcs in our sample dellagli et al 2021 also found that the ce in their models starts after the rapid growth of the agb radius once the co ratio increases past unity which corresponds well with the requirements for producing the shortperiod dcs we find this makes these extreme agb stars potential progenitors systems of the dcs that are in the ce phase currently however is mass accretion during a ce phase the most likely mass transfer mechanism to form dcs we can address this question by looking at our periodic dc sample in the context of models that simulate expected binary populations 61 binary population synthesis models we used the binary population synthesis bps models of toonen nelemans 2013 to see if the observed population of dcs can be reproduced by theory the full details of the bps models can be found in toonen  nelemans 2013 and are briefly described here these bps models were created using the seba portegies zwart verbunt 1996 nelemans et al 2001 toonen et al 2012 toonen nelemans 2013 population synthesis code this code generates an initial pop roulston et al ulation of binaries and simulates their evolution taking into account processes such as stellar winds magnetic breaking mass transfer commonenvelope and angular momentum loss the initial stellar population is generated from the classical bps distributions found in toonen nelemans 2013 via a monte carlo method the resulting binaries are then convolved with a galactic model including a star formation history that depends on time and location in the milky way based on boissier  prantzos 1999 so that the simulated binaries can be compared to our observed sample for the synthetic populations used here the commonenvelope phase is modeled on the basis of the energy budget ie the classical formalism of tutukov yungelson 1979 we discuss the results of two different models here that account for two different ce efficiencies model and 2 which have of 2 and 025 respectively the parameter is the structure parameter of the envelope to calculate the envelope binding energy paczynski 1976 webbink 1984 de kool et al 1987 livio soker 1988 de kool 1990 xu li 2010 the parameter describes the efficiency with which orbital energy is consumed to unbind the ce a smaller value of implies less efficient usage of orbital energy and therefore a stronger shrinkage of the orbital period during the cephase we do not consider the orbital angular momentum method of nelemans et al 2000 as this model does not reproduce the observed characteristics of the general pceb wdmain sequence population toonen nelemans 2013 furthermore the bps models here allow for accretion during the commonenvelope phase the accretion rate is limited by the thermal timescale of the accretor times a factor that is dependent on the stellar radius and the corresponding roche lobe portegies zwart verbunt 1996 toonen et al 2012 following kippenhahn  meyerhofmeister 1977 neo et al 1977 packet  de greve 1979 pols marinus 1994 the total accreted mass is then given by the integral of the accretion rate times the timescale of the ce event which here is taken to be 100 yr this timescale is consistent with hydrodynamical simulations ricker taam 2008 ivanova et al 2013 and observations of hot subdwarf binaries igoshev et al 2020 although cataclysmic variables may suggest a longer ce timescale up to 104 yr michaely perets 2019 igoshev et al 2020 62 bps comparison to observed dc sample we use the resulting model population for a direct comparison to our observed sample of shortperiod dcs assuming the photometric period is the current orbital period to do this we estimated dc masses based on their infrared absolute magnitude mk in the k band comparisons of m dwarf spectra ivanov et al 2004 to c star spectra tanaka et al 2007 reveal them to be much more similar in the infrared than in the optical region we used ks band 2159 m magnitudes from the two micron allsky survey 2mass skrutskie et al 2006 six of our periodic dcs do not have ks band magnitudes for these we first fit gaia absolute g band mg to the dcs that do have ks band magnitudes this fit was then used to convert the gaia mg into mks for the dcs lacking ks band magnitudes we then fit mks for our dcs to stellar masses using data from kraus hillenbrand 2007 this fitting also provides us with bolometric luminosities for the dcs in our sample comparing our bolometric luminosities to those provided in green et al 2019 who used a spectral energy distribution method fitting 035 125 m for the four dcs that overlap we find our luminosities agree within 3 indicating our dc mass estimates should be reliable our mass estimates can be found in table 5 we find that none of our dcs are fit with masses 1 m or  02 m in agreement with the range for which detectable c2 cn and ch bands are expected we note that some of the lowest mass dcs may have been brown dwarfs or even planets before they accreted significant cenriched material from their former agb companion using the massradius relationship for mainsequence stars of eker et al 2018 we estimate the radius for these periodic dcs as well which are included in table 5 using these estimated radii we calculate the rochelobe filling factor rlff using the equation of eggleton 1983 to find the roche radii three out of 24 of our periodic dcs may be experiencing rlof back onto the wd all have a rlff 1 in table 5 however we caution that physical parameters are derived from orich mainsequence models which may not accurately represent all dcs for example 1 we do not know the mass of the unseen wd companion and assume it is 06 m 2 we assume these massradius and mk mass relations hold for dcs as they do for normal orich stars 3 dcs are thought to be of a lower metallicity population and studies have found that low metallicity m dwarfs may have smaller radii kesseli et al 2019 and 4 since dcs may have increased activity and magnetic fields due to their mass accretion their radii may be inflated kesseli et al 2018 we see no obvious evidence of flickering or accretion outbursts in any of our ztf light curves that might indicate current rlof back onto the

054 161 a from gaia collaboration et al 2020 b from bailerjones et al 2021 k interpolated from mg notedistances and magnitudes for the periodic dcs in our sample we use the gaia distances colors and magnitudes as well as the 2mass absolute k magnitudes to estimate masses and bolometric luminosities for our dcs for the solar bolometric luminosity we adopt the value log10 l 3358 we also calculate the rochelobe filling factor rlff under the assumption of a 06 m wd companion we calculate the mass errors to be of order 005 m the log10 lbol l errors to be of order 01 and the radius errors to be of order 005 r however we caution that physical parameters are derived from orich mainsequence models which may not accurately represent all dcs to compare the bps models directly to our observed dc sample we applied a series of cuts and selection effects to the models as follows 1 p 100 d 2 r mag  195 3 mdc 1 m 4 10 mzams 4 m 5 the initial primary must be a tpagb star at the onset of the ce phase here mdc is the current mass of the main sequence companion in the bps models and mzams is the initial mass of the primary at the beginning of the models which will become the agb donor we show the resulting bps models in figure 4 and figure 5 models 2 and respectively in both figures the bps models are shown as the colored 2d histogram in mass and period note that the histogram color scale is logarithmic and its range is different for each plot and the periodic dc stars from this paper represented as the red scatter points with kde contours the dashed black line represents the rlof boundary with systems occupying the region to the left shaded in grey filling their roche lobes under the assumption of a 06 m wd companion both figures also show a histogram of the estimated mass accreted during the ce phase assumed to last 100 yr figure 4 shows model 2 025 and includes three different magnetic braking prescriptions panel a uses the magnetic braking of rappaport et al 1983 panel b that of ivanova taam 2003 and panel c that of knigge et al 2011 again the color scale is logarithmic and its range is different for each subfigure model 2 however does not reproduce the mass distribution of our dcs very well generating low mass systems than observed still under the assumption that our physical parameters derived from orich mainsequence models apply to dcs while it may be that model 2 does not produce low mass dcs we have not considered our sample selection effects in this comparison our observed sample is likely biased toward lower mass dcs as roulston et al 101 m m

magnetic braking from ivanova taam 2003 c magnetic braking from knigge et al 2011 the red plus scatter markers are our observed short period dc sample without h emission while the purple triangles are dcs which show h emission the red contours are a kde contour for the entire periodic dc sample the dashed black curve represents the boundary for current dc systems to be experiencing rlof where systems to the left in the grey shaded region may be experiencing rlof the bottom panel shows a histogram of the estimated mass accreted by the secondary during the ce phase while this model 2 reproduces the period distribution better than model see figure 5 the estimated accreted mass is even lower than that of because of the lower ce efficiency since 003 m of mass transfer is likely required to create a dc a ce is not likely to be the primary mechanism for accretion to form a dc 1 they have stronger c2 and cn bands and 2 their variability is fractionally larger and so easier to detect model figure 5 uses a higher ce efficiency 2 similar to classical bps studies and includes the standard magnetic braking of rappaport et al 1983 from figure 5 it is seen that this model is unable to reproduce the short periods of our observed dc sample this is in agreement with the conclusions based on the sdss pcebs wdms systems zorotovic et al 2010 toonen nelemans 2013 camacho et al 2014 where toonen nelemans 2013 found that standard efficiency  2 ce was also unable to reproduce the observed periods as it generated too many longperiod pcebs a crucial shortfall is that the estimated mass accreted for all models is too small to convert a mainsequence star into a dc see section 7 for a discussion miszalski et al 2013 suggest that to shift the secondary envelope from approximately solar coi 13 to the observed cof 1 requires m2 003035 m for m2 1004 m the predicted mass accretion in our bps models is lower than this by 23 orders of magni tude together with the strong mismatch between the modeled and observed dc periodmass distributions it seems clear that there must be further mass accretion outside the brief ce phase qualitatively it is also possible to argue that accretion during ce evolution is rarely significant for nondegenerate companions the common envelope itself typically possesses much higher specific entropy than the surface of the accretor with the consequence that matter accreted by the companion star reaches pressure equilibrium at the surface of that star with much higher temperature and vastly lower density than the accretors initial surface layer a temperature inversion or roughly isothermal layer is expected to bridge this entropy jump with the result that over the duration of the ce evolution which is much shorter than the thermal time scale of the accretor the accretor is thermally isolated from the common envelope while the common envelope itself becomes increasingly tenuous a solution to the underprediction of accreted mass may be that more mass accretion may take place be number of systems 103 number of systems 102 number of systems m m 103 number of objects m m ztf variability in dwarf carbon stars 103 m

represents the boundary for current dc systems to be experiencing rlof where systems to the left in the grey shaded region may be experiencing rlof the bottom panel shows a histogram of the estimated mass accreted onto the secondary during the ce phase this model does not reproduce our observed dc period distribution as it does not produce periods below 1d as well as not being able to accrete enough mass 003 m we expect necessary to form dcs fore the ce phase but during the tpagb phase by wind accretion during windrlof wrlof mohamed  podsiadlowski 2007 wrlof is a mass transfer state that lies between standard wind mass transfer and standard rlof where the wind of the primary star is focused toward the secondary star this results in increased mass transfer efficiency as compared to the standard bondihoylelyttleton case hoyle lyttleton 1939 bondi hoyle 1944 in the wrlof regime the primary is technically not filling its roche lobe however lowvelocity wind matter is funneled through the roche lobe to the companion allowing for mass transfer to take place in binaries with wider orbits than the classical rlof case wrlof would boost dc formation since if the initial orbital separation is too small the expanding agb atmosphere can cause a ce before the third dredgeup can turn the agb into a c star a variety of simulations abate et al 2013 saladino et al 2018 2019 saladino pols 2019 have shown that wrlof in binaries with agb primaries can have masstransfer efficiencies of 4050 for an average agb wind mass loss rate of 107 104 m yr1 hfner 2015 a main sequence companion could accrete enough material 035m in only 103 106 yr within the time an agb star is expected to stay a c star 106 yr marigo et al 2017 wrlof has also been shown to efficiently tighten the orbit saladino et al 2018 chen et al 2018 so that more systems could be driven towards orbits with the periods we find indeed it appears the wrlof may be the dominant mass transfer mechanism for many chemically peculiar stars abate et al 2013 showed that simulations of agb binaries with wrlof were better able to reproduce the observed formation rates of the cemps stars saladino et al 2019 and saladino pols 2019 also performed simulations finding agb binaries with wrlof were consistent with the observed properties of the cemps ch and ba stars this further strengthens the connection between dcs wrlof and the other chemically peculiar stars however detailed modeling of the wrlof in the specific case of the tpagb phase with a c star is needed to understand how the larger stellar radii of agbc stars and the increased dust formation often found in their winds affect the wrlof mass transfer efficiencies the periodic dcs in this paper represent a prime sample that is ready for spectroscopic followup and for comparison to future models of wrlof mass transfer 7 summary we searched ztf light curves of a sample of 944 dcs for signs of periodic signals we found 24 dcs with signs of significant photometric variability with 80 having p 1 d the most likely origins of this periodicity is either from spot rotation or surface heating of the dc from the close wd companion even if the detected ztf periods arise from ellipsoidal variations and represent half the orbital period such short periods are sur roulston et al prising for dc stars which require significant accretion to turn them into the cenriched dwarfs we see today spectroscopic followup is needed to determine the source of the variability in each of these periodic dcs especially to ensure for the case of spot rotation that the system is circularized and tidally locked so that the rotation period can be assumed to equal the orbital period ie that our reported photometric periods correspond to both rotational and orbital periods the periodic dcs in this paper provide a rich new sample to target for spectroscopic followup as well as to study dc formation and properties we have confirmed the photometric period as the orbital period for one dc for which we have obtained spectroscopic followup in two other dcs we have confirmed that they must have short orbital periods from their rvs not confirming the photometric period as the orbital period however in all three cases these short p 1 d orbits indicate these dcs have indeed experienced a ce phase these short periods indicate that at least some dcs will experience a ce at some point in their formation with the dcs having p 1 d experiencing substantial plungein we used binary population synthesis models to show that the observed sample of dcs is not wellreconstructed by mass transfer during the commonenvelope phase alone since the dcs in our sample require at least 003 m of mass accretion but our models predict 23 orders of magnitude less transfer during the ce phase suggesting mass accretion before the ce phase however some systems such as cataclysmic variables indicate ce timescales an order or two longer michaely perets 2019 igoshev et al 2020 than our assumed 100 yr based on ricker taam 2008 igoshev et al 2020 which may substantially increase the amount of accreted material to the point that the ce alone could provide enough mass to form a dc hydrodynamical simulations of ce evolution typically find that accretion onto a nondegenerate companion is not common because of the entropy barrier between the companion and the surrounding material eg ivanova et al 2013 for a review in fact even in the case of neutron star companions which can accrete more efficiently due to neutrino cooling accretion is limited to 01m macleod ramirezruiz 2015 further modeling of the ce phase involving cagbs may provide further insight dc systems that begin as very wide binaries would experience stable mass transfer and a widening of the orbit systems that initially are close would begin a ce phase either during the red giant branch or during the agb before the tpagb and without experiencing the third dredgeup during the tpagb would not produce dcs therefore it seems that the most likely mass transfer mechanism to form dcs is wrlof further modeling of wrlof in binaries with a tpagb star are needed to fully test this formation pathway of dcs additionally further work is needed to understand the relationship between initial dc metallicity and mass to constrain the amount and composition of material that needs to be accreted to form a dc this would be an important step in constraining the masstransfer efficiency in the wrlof case facilities flwo15m fast magellanbaade mage mmt binospec software astropy
