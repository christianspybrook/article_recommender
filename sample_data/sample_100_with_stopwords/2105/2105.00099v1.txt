on the annihilator ideal in the bt algebra of tensor space arxiv210500099v1 mathrt 30 apr 2021 steen ryomhansen a bstract we study the representation theory of the braids and ties algebra or the bt algebra en q using the cellular basis m st for en q obtained in previous joint work with j espinoza we introduce two kinds of permutation modules m and m for en q we show that the tensor product module v n for en q is a direct sum of m s we introduce the dual cellular basis n st for en q and study its action on m and m we show that the annihilator ideal i in en q of v n enjoys a nice compatibility property with respect to n st we finally study the quotient algebra en qi showing in particular that it is a simultaneous generalization of hrterichs generalized temperleylieb algebra and juyumayas partition temperleylieb algebra keywords hecke algebra cellular algebra bt algebra mcs2010 33d80 i ntroduction in this paper we study the representation theory of the braids and ties algebra en q or the btalgebra for short it was introduced by aicardi and juyumaya in aicarjuyu1 via an abstraction of the presentation for the yokonumahecke algebra yrn q of type a n1 the bt algebra carries a diagrammatics consisting of braids and ties as illustrated below where braids are black and ties are dashed red the study of en q has attracted much attention recently both from knot theorists and from representation theorists see for example arcisjuyu aicarjuyu2 aicarjuyu3 aicarjuyu4 ban chloupou espryflo jacoan juyu mar ry and the references therein interesting enough even though en q is derived from yrn q both the knot theory and the representation theory of en q are almost completely independent from those of yrn q in the sense that almost no statement in the literature about en q is obtained directly from a corresponding statement about yrn q in our paper ry we constructed a tensor space module v n for en q extending jimbos classical tensor space module for the iwahorihecke algebra hn q of type a n1 and showed that it is faithful when the dimension of v is large enough although not in general using this we obtained a basis for en q which involves set partitions  supported in part by fondecyt grant 1171379 on n 1 2 n in particular we found that the dimension of en q is b n n where b n is the nth bell number that is the number of set partitions on n in the present paper we develop methods that allow us to treat the en qstructure on v n when v n is not a faithful and in particular to determine the annihilator ideal i for the en qaction on v n in all cases our methods rely on cellular algebra theory in particular on the cellular basis m st for en q that was introduced in espry in joint work with j espinoza and hence they are independent of the ground ring we acknowledge that the construction of the m st basis for en q is combinatorially much more involved than the construction of the e a g w basis or other similar noncellular bases but throughout our arguments rely crucially on the compatibility between the multiplicative structure and the order relation on en q given by the cell datum in fact it appears to be very difficult to obtain the results of our paper without using an appropriate order relation even for the ground field c and generic q the basis m st is a generalization of murphys standard basis x st for hn q in the classical representation theory of hn q see for example dipperjames and dipperjammathas an important application of x st is to introduce permutation modules m for hn q where runs over integer partitions of n and to realize jimbos tensor space module v n as a direct sum of these m s the m s have many important properties but for us it is of special relevance that they are endowed with canonical symmetric bilinear forms that satisfy a certain nonvanishing property with respect to the dual basis y st of x st in the paper we generalize the m s to en qpermutation modules m for  running over multipartitions and show in our theorem 17 that the en qtensor module v n from ry is a direct sum of these m s in analogy with the hn qcase the m s are endowed with bilinear forms in analogy with the m s but the parametrizing poset ln for en q is a combinatorial object which is more complicated than multipartitions and so the m s are not sufficient for our determination of the annihilator ideal i to solve this problem we introduce via m st another kind of permutation modules that we denote m we show in a series of lemmas culminating with lemma 14 that the canonical bilinear form on m indeed satisfies the nonvanishing property with respect to the dual basis n st the above results constitute the bulk of work of our paper the situation is not completely analogous to the situation for hn q but in general there is an inclusion m m and this is in fact enough to execute hrterichs wonderful argument see hrterich for the determination of the annihilator ideal of the action of hn q in jimbos tensor space v n but in the en qsetting we do so in theorem 18 when working over a ground field k theorem 18 gives a kvector space basis for i in terms of an explicit subset of n st thus generalizing hrterichs compatibility result note that hrterichs compatibility result is the starting point for the authors joint work with d plaza on klrgradings on the temperleylieb algebras of type a and b see plary note also that other compatibility results for m st were obtained in espry in the final paragraphs of the paper we introduce and study the quotient algebra et lnn q en qi it is a simultaneous generalization of hrterichs generalized temperleylieb algebra and of juyumayas partition temperleylieb algebra pt ln q that themselves are generalizations of the original temperleylieb algebra our theorem 18 allows us to determine the dimension of et lnn q as the cardinality of an explicit subset of n st let us now indicate the layout of the paper in the next section we introduce the basic notation that shall be used throughout the paper it is mostly concerned with combinatorial notions related to the symmetric group sn that is partitions young diagrams young tableaux etc throughout the paper sn is viewed as a coxeter group and we only consider subgroups of sn that are parabolic subgroups in the sense of coxeter groups it is well known that parabolic subgroups of coxeter groups give rise to distinguished coset representatives throughout we need these distinguished coset representatives and their associated decompositions of the group elements and we therefore briefly explain why they exist but from an algorithmic point of view which is possibly less known in the final paragraphs of this section we recall the definition of en q together with its e a g w basis in section 3 we first recall from espry the ideal decomposition en q en q p ar n that reduces the study of en q to the study of its summands en q we next recall from espry the construction of the cellular basis m st for en q and at the same time we introduce the new dual cellular basis n st by making the appropriate adaptions it is a generalization of murphys dual standard basis y st for hn q the cell poset ln for both bases consists of pairs of multipartitions satisfying certain conditions in section 4 we first introduce the permutation module m in lemma 10 we describe a basis xs for m together with its en qaction we next introduce for  ln the permutation module m we describe in the lemmas 11 and 12 a basis ms together with the en qaction on it we then introduce the bilinear form  on m and show that it is symmetric and invariant finally in lemma 14 we prove the following crucial property alluded to above m t n t0 s0 m s 6 0 in section 5 we obtain the main results of our paper we first give the decomposition of v n corresponding to 2 and then the decomposition in terms of the m s finally in the main theorem 18 we give the description of i proving that a subset of n st induces a basis for it it is a great pleasure to thank j espinoza for many useful discussions related to the contents of the paper for sending us comments on preliminary versions of it and for sharing with us his formula for dim pt ln q we also also thank j juyumaya for communicating to us his and p papis magma calculations and for pointing out an error in a preliminary version of the paper finally it is a special pleasure to thank m hrterich for introducing us to murphys standard basis and all its deep properties n otation and b asic c oncepts we fix the ground ring s zq q 1 where q is an indeterminate let sn be the symmetric group consisting of bijections of n 1 2 n throughout we consider the natural action of sn on n as a right action as is well known sn is a coxeter group on n s 1 s n1 with relations si s j s j si s i s i 1 s i s i 1 s i s i 1 s i2 for i j 1 for i 1 2 n 2 for i 1 2 n 1 where s i i i 1 we denote by the bruhatchevalley order and by the length function on sn let n denote the set of natural numbers a composition 1 2 l of n n written n is a sequence in n0 with sum n the i s are called the parts of an integer partition of n written n or simply a partition of n is a composition whose parts form a nonincreasing sequence if n we define n and denote by min i k 0 for k i the length of suppose that 1 2 l n of length l the set of all compositions of n is denoted comp n and the set of all partitions of n is denoted p ar n we set comp n comp n and p ar n p ar n if 1 2 l n we define the young diagram of as the subset of n n0 given by y i j 1 j i and i 1 the elements of y are the nodes of we represent y by an array of boxes in the plane using matrix convention for the placement of the nodes for example if  4 4 0 3 then if p ar n we denote by 0 the conjugate partition which is the one obtained from by interchanging rows and columns that is y0 i j j i y suppose that n then a tableau is a bijection t y n if t is a tableau we identify it with a labelling of the nodes of y using the elements of n for example if 4 4 4 1 then 1 4 3 13 t 2 6 10 8 5 7 11 9 is the tableau t that satisfies t1 1 1 t1 2 4 t1 3 3 etc if t is a tableau we define shapet the set of tableaux is denoted tab a tableau t is row standard if the entries in t increase from left to right in each row and it is standard if the entries also increase from top to bottom in each column the set of row standard tableaux is denoted rstd and the set of standard tableaux is denoted std for n we denote by t resp t the standard tableau in which the integers 1 2 n are entered in increasing order from left to right along the rows resp columns of y for example if 4 3 then t 15 26 37 4 resp t 12 34 56 7 if  p ar n and t is a tableau we denote by t0 the conjugate tableau it is the 0 tableau defined via t0 i j t j i sn acts naturally on the right on tab via composition of a function t tab with an element sn viewed as a bijection of n for t tab we denote by d t the unique element of sn such that t t d t we set w d t sn then for any t tab we have that d td t0 1 w and d t d t0 w see for example the proof of lemma 22 of murphy92 the young subgroup s associated with is the row stabilizer of t it isa a parabolic subgroup of sn in the sense of coxeter groups the set d t t rstd is a set of distinguished right coset representatives for s in sn that is w 0 d t w 0 d t for w s in other words for any w sn there is a unique decomposition w w 0 d t where w 0 s and t rstd see proposition 33 of mathas and chapter 110 of hump the determination of w 0 and t can be realized in an algorithmic way that we now explain define first s tab via w d s let next s j 1 s j 2 s j k be a sequence of elements in s such that when setting s0 s s1 s0 s j 1 s2 s1 s j 2 sk sk1 s j k we have that i j appears strictly below i j 1 in s j and that sk is equal to s modulo a permutation of the row elements such a sequence always exists then w 0 d sk and t t s j k s j k1 s j 1 that is d t s j k s j k1 s j 1 note that although w 0 and d t are unique the sequence s j 1 s j 2 s j k is in general not unique here is an example of this algorithm using  2 3 2 and w d s where 2 6 s 3 5 1 7 4 then a possible sequence of s j i s is given as follows 2 6 1 6 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 3 5 1 3 5 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 3 7 4 7 4 7 5 7 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 and so d t s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 4 s 1 whereas w 0 d t s 4 s 3 s 6 note that 2 6 t t s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 4 s 1 1 3 5 4 7 which is also the tableau obtained from s by ordering the rows let comp we write e if for all i 1 we have j 1 j 1 where if necessary we add zero parts at the end of and so that the sums are defined this is the dominance order on compositions it is extended to row standard tableaux as follows suppose n and that t rstd we then define tm to be the tableau obtained from t by deleting all nodes with entries strictly greater than m then for row standard tableaux s and t we write set if shapesm e shapetm for all m 1 n we write sct if set and s 6 t this defines the dominance order on the set of all row standard tableaux we have that t resp t is the unique maximal resp minimal row standard tableau under the dominance order an r multicomposition or just a multicomposition if confusion is not possible of n is an r tuple 1 2 r of possibly empty compositions k such that ri1 i n we call k the kth component of an r multipartition is an r multicomposition whose components are all partitions the nodes y of an r multicomposition are labelled by triples x y p with p giving the component number and x y the node of that component this is the young diagram for and is represented graphically as the r tuple of young diagrams of the components for example the young diagram of 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 is the set of r multicompositions of n is denoted by c omp rn and the subset of r multipartitions of n is denoted by p ar rn if c omp rn then a multitableau t is a bijection t y n it is identified with a labelling of y using the elements of n the restriction of t to i is the i th component ti of t and we write t t1 t2 tr we say that t is row standard if all its components are row standard and standard if they are all standard if t is a multitableau we write shapet the set of all tableaux is denoted by tab the set of all row standard tableaux is denoted by rstd and the set of all standard multitableaux by std in the following examples  7 s 2 7 8 5 6 3 4 5 1 4 t is a standard multitableau whereas s is only a row standard multitableau we denote by t resp t the multitableau in which 1 2 n appear in order along the rows resp columns of the first component then along the rows of the second component and so on for example in 15 we have t t with 3 2 1 1 1 for each multicomposition we define the young subgroup s as the row stabilizer of t it is a parabolic subgroup in the sense of coxeter groups for s a row standard multitableau we denote by d s the unique element of sn such that s t d s the set d s s rstd is a set of distinguished right coset representatives for s in sn that is w 0 d s w 0 d s for w s suppose that 1 r p ar rn and that t t1 tr tab then we define the conjugation of and t componentwise that is 0 1 0 r 0 and t 0 t1 0 tr 0 similarly to 11 there is for any w sn a unique decomposition w w 0 d t where w 0 s and t rstd suppose that w d s then applying the algorithm in 11 on the tableau s obtained from s s1 s2 sr by concatenating all its components with s1 on top followed by s2 just below s1 and so on we obtain w 0 and t in 17 suppose that c omp rn and that t tab is row standard then for j 1 n we set pt j k if j appears in tk we call pt j the position of j in t when t t we write p j for pt j we say that t is of the initial kind if pt j p j for all j 1 n suppose that c omp rn we write e if i e i for all i 1 n this is the dominance order on c omp rn if s and t are row standard multitableaux and m 1 n we define s m and t m as for usual tableaux and write s ett if shapes m e shapet m for all m note that our dominance order e is different from the dominance order on multicompositions and multitableaux that is used sometimes in the literature for example in dipperjammathas to an r multicomposition 1 r we associate a composition kk of length r in the following way  3 1  r let skk be the associated young subgroup then w skk iff t w is of the initial kind for t t1 tr tab we define kt k tabkk via kt k t1 tr where ti is the row reading of ti for the multitableaux t and s in 15 we have for example 2 7 8 1 4 1 2 3 4 5  ks k 5 6 kt k 6 7 8 3 9 skk is yet another parabolic subgroup of sn with corresponding distinguished right coset representatives t tab kt k rstdkk hence for any w sn there is a unique decomposition w w 0 d t where w 0 skk and t tab with kt k rstdkk we define s 0 tab via w 0 t d s 0 it is of the initial kind we obtain s 0 and t concretely by applying the algorithm given in 13 with respect to w and kk for example if w d s where 2 3 6 5 1 4 then the calculations in 13 give us s0 1 4 2 5 3 6 t 2 1 3 5 it follows from the algorithm that s 0 is row standard  if s is row  standard suppose that s rstd s 1 rstd1 with 1 let w d s w 1 d s 1 and let w w 0 d t w 1 w 1 0 d t 1 be the decompositions of w and w 1 as in 21 suppose furthermore that d t d t 1 then we have that s ess1 if and only if s 0 e s 1 0 for any r multipartition we define w sn via w d t suppose now that s tab and let s 0 be the conjugate multitableau set w d s and w 0 d s 0 with decompositions w w 0 d t and w 0 w 0 0 d t 0 as in 21 then it follows from the algorithm described above that d t d t 0 and that w 0 0 d t 00 where w 0 d t 0 moreover since t 0 is of the initial kind we get via 10 that d s d s 0 1 w and d t 0 d t 00 w note that we cannot here replace d t 0 and d t 00 by d s and d s 0 let us now recall the bt algebra of the title of the paper it was originally introduced by aicardi and juyumaya in aicarjuyu1 definition 1 let n be a positive integer the braids and ties algebra en en q or the bt algebra is the associative salgebra generated by the elements g 1 g n1 and e 1 e n1 subject to the following relations gi g j g j gi for i j 1 gi ei ei gi for all i gi g j gi g j gi g j for i j 1 ei g j gi g j gi e j for i j 1 ei e j g j ei g j ei g j ei e j for i j 1 ei e j e j ei for all i j gi e j e j gi for i j 1 for all i for all i e i2 g i2  ei  1 q q e i g i there is a diagrammatic interpretation of these relations that explains the name of en q and that we now briefly indicate even though it only plays a minor role in the present paper it uses n strands connecting a northern and a southern border under the interpretation the g i s correspond to usual simple braids involving the i th and the i 1st strand and the e i s correspond to ties involving the i th and i 1st strands the relations 29 and 30 are for example visualized as follows if k is a commutative ring containing an invertible element that we also denote q then we define the specialized algebra enk q via enk q en q s k where k is made into an salgebra by mapping q s to q k the concept of set partitions is important in the study of en q recall that a set partition a i 1 i 2 i r of n is a set of nonempty and disjoint subsets of n whose union is n in order words a is the set of classes of an equivalence relation on n we refer to the i i s as the blocks of a we denote by sp n the set of all set partitions of n there is a canonical poset structure on sp n defined as follows suppose that a i 1 i 2 i k b j 1 i 2 j l sp n then we say that a b if each j j is a union of some of the i i s returning to en q for 1 i j n we define e i j en q by e i j e i if i j 1 and recursively downwards on i via e i j g i e i 1 j g i1 note that g i is invertible with inverse g i1 g i q 1 qe i as follows from 34 so that 37 makes sense for a sp n we define e a en q as e a e i j where the product runs over pairs i j such that i j and such that i and j belong to the same block of a one checks that the e i j s commute and so the product is independent of the order in which it is taken for w s i 1 s i k sn a reduced expression for w we define g w g i 1 g i k en q by the relations it is independent of the choice of reduced expression we have the following relations in en q e a g w g w e aw and e a e b ec for w sn a b sp n where c sp n is minimal with respect to a c b c moreover a it was shown in ry that en q has an sbasis of the form e a g w a sp n w sn and so in particular the dimension of en q is nb n where b n is the bell number that is the cardinality of sp n c ellular basis for en q in the paper espry a cellular basis m st for en q was constructed moreover it was shown that m st induces cellular bases for interesting subalgebras of en q and via this an isomorphism between en q and a direct sum of matrix algebras over certain wreath products of hecke algebras was established in this section we first recall the construction of m st and at the same time we introduce a new dual cellular basis for en q that we denote n st we next prove in a series of lemmas certain compatibility properties between the dominance order associated with en q and the multiplication of elements from the two bases these compatibility properties are known in the hecke algebra setting and our proofs are essentially reductions to that setting let us first recall the formal definition of cellular algebras as introduced in graleh definition 2 let r be an integral domain suppose that a is an ralgebra suppose that p is a poset and that for each p there is a finite indexing set t the tableaux and elements c st  a such that c c st  p and s t t is an rbasis of a the pair c p is a cellular basis for a if i the rlinear map a a determined by c st  c ts for all p and all s t t is an algebra antiautomorphism of a ii for any p t t and a a there exist elements r v r such that for all s t c st r v c sv mod a vt where a is the rsubmodule of a with basis c uv p and u v t if a has a cellular basis we say that a is a cellular algebra and p t c is called the cell datum for a we now recall the somewhat lengthy construction of the cell datum for en q for more details on this construction the reader should consult espry we first consider a certain ideal decomposition of en q let sp n be the mebius function for the lattice sp n it is given by q 1 r i 1 1r s ir1 if a b sp n a b otherwise where r and s are the number of blocks of a and b respectively and where r i is the number of blocks of b containing exactly i blocks of a using it we define for a sp n orthogonal idempotents e a en q via e a a b e b b ab for example e123 e 123 e 123 e 123 e 132 2e 123 the following is proposition 39 in espry proposition 3 the following properties hold 1 e a a sp n is a set of orthogonal idempotents of en q 2 for all w sn and a sp n we have e a g w g w e aw e a if b a 3 for all a sp n we have e a e b if b 6 a let p ar n a set partition a i 1 i k of n is said to be of type if there exists a permutation such that i i 1 i i k we write a if a sp n is of type  and we let sp n be the set of set partitions of type for p ar n we define the following element e of en q ea asp n a then the e s form a family of central orthogonal idempotents in en q such that p ar n e 1 as a consequence we have the following decomposition of en q into a direct sum of twosided ideals en q en q p ar n where en q e en q each ideal en q is an salgebra with identity e and the set e a g w w sn a is an sbasis for en q in particular the dimension of en q is n times the fa di bruno coefficient that is b n n where by definition the fa di bruno coefficient b n is the number of set partitions of n of type for k an arbitrary field with a nonzero element we have a specialized version of en q enk q en q s k in view of the decomposition in 44 in order to give the cell datum for en q it is enough to give the cell datum for each en q the antiautomorphism is relatively easy to define since one checks on the relations for en q that en q is endowed with an slinear antiautomorphism satisfying e i e i and g i g i using the formula for g i1 one checks that e a e a and then ea e a hence induces an antiautomorphism on en q next we explain the poset denoted p in definition 2 we first describe p as a set for 1 r c omp rn we define sets i i via i 1 1 2 1 i 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 and so on leaving out the empty i i s we obtain a set partition in sp n that we denote a for p ar n we say that is of type if a is of type an r multipartition 1 r is said to be increasing if i j iff i j where is any fixed extension of the dominance order c to a total order for p ar n we now define ln to be the set of pairs where 1 r is an increasing r multipartition of n of type let i 1 i s be the distinct i s and let m j be the multiplicity of i j in 1 r then we require that be an smultipartition 1 s of r where j m j for p we choose ln we next describe the poset structure on ln suppose that and  are elements of ln such that 1 r and 1 r then we write c1 if there exists a permutation such that 1 r c1 r where c is the dominance order on r multipartitions introduced above we then write of c if c1 or if and c as usual we set e if c or if this is the description of ln as a poset for ln as above we now define the concept of tableaux suppose that t is a pair t t u then t is called a tableau if t is a multitableau and u is a multitableau of the initial kind if t is a tableau we define shapet we let tab denote the set of tableaux we say that t t u tab is row standard if its ingredients are row standard multitableaux in the sense of the previous section and if moreover t is an increasing multitableau by increasing we here mean that whenever i j we have that i j if and only if minti mint j where mint is the function that reads off the minimal entry of the tableau t we say that t t u tab is standard if it is row standard and if its ingredients t and u are standard multitableaux and we define std to be the set of all standard tableaux note that our notation is here deviating slightly from the one used in espry where the condition on t to be increasing was required for standardness of t but not for row standardness of t in the following examples  5 6 3 9 27 4 2 4 3 5 6 9  23 4 s is not row standard but t is we fix the following combinatorial notation suppose that ln with  1 r and 1 s by construction the numbers m i i are the multiplicities of equal i s let s sn be the stabilizer subgroup of the set partition a i 1 i 2 i m then the multiplicities give rise to the subgroup sm  of s consisting of the order preserving permutations of the blocks of a that correspond to equal i s we have sm  s and as an abstract group  sm 1 sm s for example if 12 12 12 2 2 13 13 13 2 1 then t 20 21  34 56 7 8 9 10 12 15 18 a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 and so sm  s3 s2 s3 s1 for i i and i i 1 two consecutive blocks of a such that i i 1 we let b i sn be the element of minimal length in the sense of coxeter groups that interchanges i i and i i 1 for example in the above example we have b 1 1 32 4 b 2 3 54 6 and so on s is generated by the b i s such that i i 1 in fact it is a coxeter groups on these b i s it is important that the group algebra s sm  can be realized as a subalgebra of en q for this we need to describe b i concretely in terms of the coxeter generators s i for sn let a i i then there is a c such that i i c 1 c 2 c a and i i 1 c a 1 c a 2 c 2a hence b i is a product of transpositions as follows b i c 1 c a 1c 2 c a 2 c a c 2a for i j we set s i j s i c s i 1c s j c and can then write b i in terms of the s i j s and therefore in terms of simple transpositions s i as follows b i s a1 s a12 s 2a1a the complete expansion of b i in terms of s i s is a reduced expression for b i inspired by this formula for b i we define bi en q in the following way bi e g a1 g a12 g 2a1a where g i j g i c g i 1c g j c the following lemma was proved in espry lemma 4 suppose that ln then we have an salgebra embedding i 1  s sm  en q given by b i 7 bi where we are now ready to recall the construction of the basis elements m st of the cell datum for en q and at the same time we introduce the new basis elements n st for en q for each ln we first define elements m and n that act as starting points for the bases suppose that is as above with 1 r and  1 s we then define m en q and n en q as follows m e x b n e y c let us explain the factors of these products the idempotent e has already been introduced the factors x en q and y en q are defined as x w x g w and y qw g w note that e commutes with x and y and that for w s we have that e x g w g w e x q l w e x and e y g w g w e y ql w e y in the hecke algebra case corresponding to r 1 the elements defined in 54 are the elements denoted x and y in murphy95 there is an automorphism of the hecke algebra denoted in loc cit that interchanges x and y with our choice of quadratic relation 34 the corresponding automorphism of en q interchanging x and y is given by e a g w 7 1w e a g w in order to define the factors b and c we recall from 48 the decomposition sm sm1 sm s let x 1 sm and the specializations the elements given in 56 corresponding to the multipartition that is x 1 g w and y 1 1w g w then b en q and c en q are defined via b x 1 and c y 1 where s sm  en q is the embedding from lemma 4 let t resp t be the tableau given by t t t resp t t t let now s s u be an arbitrary tableau then we set d s d s d u where d s sn satisfies t d s s and d u sm  satisfies t d u u for simplicity we write d s d u instead of d s d u note that since u u1 us is of the initial kind we have a decomposition d u d u1 d us according to the decomposition in 48 and so bd u bd u1 bd us we can now finally introduce m st and n st for s s u t t v row standard tableaux we define m st e g ds x bd u b bd v g d t n st e g ds y bd u c bd v g d t we set b uv bd u b bd v and c uv bd u c bd v and have then also m st e g ds x b uv g d t n st e g ds y c uv g d t in the case where s t we write for simplicity m t m t t and n t n t t in espry the following theorem was proved theorem 5 en q is a cellular basis with cell datum ln std m st making the straightforward adaptations of the proofs given in espry we also have the following theorem theorem 6 en q is a cellular basis with cell datum ln std n st by general cellular algebra theory specialization induces a cell datum on enk q as well we shall denote it the same way in particular m st and n st may refer to elements of both en q and enk q the definition of cellular basis does not stipulate a partial order on the tableaux but in our setting there is a natural such order that we shall need it was already introduced in espry for t t1 tr and t t1 t r row standard r multitableaux we define t c1 t if there exists a permutation such that t1 tr c t1 tr suppose now that t t u tab and t t u tab then we say that t ctt if t c1 t or if t t and u c u as usual we set t e t if t c t or t t we now introduce the concept of conjugation of the elements of ln and of their tableaux this concept is also not present in general cellular algebras suppose that  ln with 1 r and 1 s then we define the conjugate of via 0 0 0 note that 0 ln similarly if t t u tab we define the conjugate tableau t0 tab0 by conjugating all the components of t mimicking what we did for we have the following compatibility between the dominance orders and conjugation e iff e 0 and s e t iff t0 e s0 the following simple lemma shall be used repeatedly lemma 7 let p ar n suppose that a sp n is of type and that i and i 1 are in distinct blocks of a then in en q and enk q the generator g i verifies the symmetric group quadratic relation when acting on e a that is e a g i2 e a p roof by relation 34 we have that e a g i2 e a 1 q q 1 e i g i e a q q 1 e a e i g i e a where we used 3 of proposition 3 for the last equality for ln and tableaux s s u and t t v we define elements of en q or enk q xst g ds e x g d t yst g ds e y g d t we also need the following lemma lemma 8 suppose that ln that 1 1 1 ln and that s t std and s 1 t 1 std1 suppose moreover that xst ys 1t 1 6 0 then t ess01 p roof for usual integer partitions this result is wellknown and as we shall see the proof can be reduced to that case without loss of generality we may assume that s t and t 1 t 1 and so we have that xst ys 1t 1 xt t ys 1t 1 e x g d t g ds e y x g d t g ds e a e y for the last step we used that x e e x together with part 2 of proposition 3 and the fact that e e since and 1 are both of type now by hypothesis 67 is nonzero and so e a d t d s 1 1 e 6 0 hence using the orthogonality of the e a s we get that a d t a d s 1  d t d s 1 we now choose decompositions with respect to skk s as in 21 d t d t 0 wt and d s 1 d s 1 0 ws 1 clearly sn acts transitively on sp n with s as the stabilizer group of a and so we have an identification sp n from 68 we have that s wt s ws 1 and so w t w s1 hence 67 becomes e x g d t 0 g wt g w y xt t e g wt g w t d t 1 0 1 t s1 0 t1 we can now use lemma 7 repeatedly on the simple transpositions that appear in a reduced expression for wt and hence 70 becomes e xt t y s t 1 1 0 in view of 24 and the fact that t 0 and s 1 0 are both of the initial kind the lemma now follows from the similar result in the hecke algebra setting we wish to generalize the lemma to a statement involving m st and n st for this we need to recall from espry some of the commutation relations between the various factors of m st and n st as defined in 59 and 60 the commutation relations involving e and x resp y are easy to describe since e and x resp y commute with all the factors of 59 resp 60 except the ones on the extreme left and right the commutation relations between bd v and g d t are more complicated to describe but we shall here only need the case when t is of the initial kind that is t t 0 combining lemma 21 and lemma 22 of espry we get in that case that e bd v g d t 0 e g d t 0 bd v and similarly for the two factors on the left of 59 and 60 we can now prove the following statement lemma 9 suppose that and that 1 1 1 ln and that s t std and s1 t1 std1 if in en q or enk q we have m st n s1 t1 6 0 then t e s01 p roof let s s u t t v s1 s 1 u1 and t1 t 1 v1 as in the proof of lemma 8 we can without loss of generality assume that s t and t1 t1 and so we have that m st n s1 t1 e x b bd v g d t g ds 1 bd u1 c 1 y 1 e1 we now argue largely as in lemma 8 we first observe that e e since both and 1 are of type using the commutation rules involving e see the paragraph prior to 72 and part 3 of proposition 3 we get that 73 is equal to x b bd v g d t g ds 1 bd u1 e a  d t d s 1 e c 1 y 1 by hypothesis 73 is nonzero and so e a d t d s 1 e which implies that a d t a d s 1 as in lemma 8 we have decompositions d t d t 0 wt and d s 1 d s 1 0 ws 1 and so a wt a ws 1 and wt ws 1 hence 74 becomes e x b bd v g d t 0 g wt g w b c y t d s 1 0 d u1 1 1 e xt t b bd v g wt g w b c y t d u1 1 s 1 0 t 1 xt t b bd v e g wt g wt bd u1 c 1 y s t 1 1 0 out using lemma 7 repeatedly on a reduced expression for wt we may cancel g wt g w and so 75 becomes e xt t b bd v bd u1 c 1 y s t1 e xt t 0 y s 1 0t 1 b bd v bd u1 c 1 1 0 where we used that y is of the initial kind we now argue once again as in s 1 0t 1 lemma 8 we know that 76 is nonzero since t 0 and s 1 0 are of the initial kind we deduce from lemma 8 that t ess01 but since 76 is nonzero we also get that b bd v bd u c 1 is nonzero moreover v and u1 are of the initial kind as well this time by construction and so we conclude that v e u01 this proves the lemma p ermutation modules suppose that c omp rn is of type then we define the en qpermutation module m as the following right ideal of en q m e x en q en q we also have a specialized version of the permutation module that we denote the same way m e x enk q enk q m is a generalization of the permutation modules that appear in the representation theory of the symmetric group the hecke algebra the cyclotomic hecke algebra and so on see dipperjammathas and the references therein for any s rstd we introduce xs e x g d s m and define r i r is c i c is p i p is via s r i c i p i i we then have the following lemma which describes the en qmodule or enk qmodule structure on m lemma 10 1 the set xs s rstd is a basis for m over s or k 2 let s rstd then xs s i q xs xs g i  xs s i  q q 1 x x s si xs e i if p i p i 1 otherwise if p i if p i if p i if p i 6 p i 1  p i 1 and r i r i 1  p i 1 and r i r i 1  p i 1 and r i r i 1 p roof using 45 we get that the set e g w w sn generates m over s on the other hand for w sn we have the decomposition w w 0 d s with w 0 s and s rstd and from this it follows via 55 that e x g w q w 0 e x g s q w 0 xs hence in fact xs s rstd generates m over s in the expansion of xs in terms of e g w s we know that e g d s appears exactly once since the d s s are distinguished coset representatives for s in sn whereas the other terms are of the form e g d s g w for w s these elements all belong to the basis for en q given in 45 and are all distinct and so the xs s are linearly independent proving 1 we next prove 2 where we first consider xs e i here we have that xs e i e g d s e i g d s e a d s e i and so the formula for xs e i follows from proposition 3 let us then consider xs g i when p i p i 1 if r i r i 1 then we have d s s i s j d s for some s j s and so xs g i q xs via 80 if r i r i 1 then d s s i d s and so xs g i xs si from the definition of xs si if r i r i 1 then d s s i d s we can then choose a reduced expression for d s ending in s i and so xs g i e g d s g i e g d s si g i2 e g d s si 1 q q 1 e i g i xs si q q 1 xs 82 where we used the quadratic relation 34 for the third equality and the formula for x s e i for the last equality finally if p i 6 p i 1 then either d s s i d s or d s s i d s and so we can repeat the previous arguments with the only difference that the second term in 82 disappears these arguments work over k as well and so the lemma is proved there is another kind of permutation module that we shall need suppose that  ln then we define the permutation module m as the following right ideal of en q m e x b en q en q once again there is a specialized version of m obtained by replacing en q with enk q the only difference between m and m is the factor b and so we have m m with the inclusion being strict in general for m we have the following lemma lemma 11 let ln let m t be as in 63 then the set m t t rstd is an sbasis or a kbasis for m p roof for w sn we have the decomposition w w 0 d t with w 0 s and t rstd and hence arguing as in 80 we get e x b g w e x b g w 0 g t e x g w 0 b g t q w 0 e x b g t hence e x b g t t rstd generates m over s but the appearing t may not be increasing in the sense of the definition of rstd on the other hand if t is not increasing we can find b u sm such that the multitableau u t rstd defined by d u t b u d t becomes increasing here sm  sm 1 sm s is the subgroup of sn introduced in 48 we then get e x b g t e x b b1 u bu g d t e x b bu g b u d t e x b bu g ut where we for the second equality used lemma 54 of espry suppose 1 s  s1 ss the corresponding diagonal young subgroup and denote by sm of sm  it gives rise to a diagonal decomposition of b u that is b u b u 0 d u where b u 0 s and u is a row standard multitableau of the initial kind setting t u t u ln we can now rewrite 86 as e x b bu g ut e x b bu g ut m t thus we have proved that the set m t generates m to show that it is linearly independent we argue as follows suppose that s s u that is m s e x b bd u g d s we know that u is row standard of the initial kind and therefore b bd u expands as a sum of terms of the form bu d u where u 0 sm  but using lemma 54 of espry we get that bu0 d u g d s g b u d ud s we now note that the multitableau v corresponding to b u0 d ud s in other words v given by d v b u0 d ud s is a row standard tableau since it is obtained from t by permuting components with equal i s and so m s expands as a sum of terms of the form e g xb d ud s where u 0 sm  and x s these expansions are distinct for distinct pairs s u and so the set m s is linearly independent as claimed hence it is an sbasis and therefore also a kbasis for m we next give a description of the action of en q on m s we first introduce the following useful notation let s rstd and let let s i n sn be a simple transposition then we define s s i via if r i r i 1 s s i s s i if r i 6 r i 1 this extends to an action of sn on rstd that we denote s w 7 s w we extend this further to ln as follows let s s u ln and suppose that shapetp i shapetp i 1 then we define a transposition i sm  via i p i p i 1 for s rstd we set m i minshapetp i using the notation i s introduced in 85 we then define s s i u  s s u ss i s s i u  s u if p i p i 1 or otherwise if shapetp i 6 shapetp i 1 if shapetp i shapetp i 1 and m i m i 1 6 i i 1 if shapetp i shapetp i 1 and m i m i 1 i i 1 one checks that these formulas extend to an action of sn on rstd they have their origin in the straightening procedure that carries s s i to an increasing row standard tableaux here are two examples corresponding to the last case in 91  1 2  1 2  s1 1 5 2 6 3 4 1 6 2 5 3 4  1 3  2 3  s2 1 5 2 6 3 4 1 5 2 4 3 6 lemma 12 suppose that s s u rstd then qm ssi if p i p i 1 and r i r i 1 m ssi if p i p i 1 and r i r i 1 1 m s g i  q q 1 m s m ssi if p i p i 1 and r i r i 1 if p i 6 p i 1 ssi 2 m s e i if p i p i 1 if p i 6 p i 1 p roof the proof of 2 is analogous to the corresponding statement for xs e i in lemma 10 in detail m s e i e x b bu g d s e i x b bu g d s e a d s e i and we conclude via proposition 3 we therefore consider 1 where we first focus on the case p i p i 1 if r i r i 1 we have d s s i s j d s for some s j s and so m s g i e x b bu g d s g i e x b bu g j g d s but s j is of the form s j d t where t is a multitableau of the initial kind and so 95 becomes x g j b bu g d s q x b bu g d s qm s as claimed the two other cases when p i p i 1 that is r i r i 1 or r i r i 1 are proved the same way as in lemma 10 we then finally consider the case p i 6 p i 1 arguing as in lemma 10 we have here m s g i e x b bu g d s g i e x b bu g d s si which is equal to m ssi in all cases except m i m i 1 i i 1 where t is not increasing but in that case arguing as we did for 86 and 87 we can rewrite 97 as follows e x b bu g d s si e x b bu bi bi g d s si e x b bui g d i s si m ssi as claimed given the basis for m we now introduce a bilinear form on m as follows 1 if s t m s m t 0 otherwise it is a generalization of the bilinear forms on the classical permutation modules see for example dipperjammathas lemma 13 the following statements hold 1 is symmetric and nondegenerate 2 is invariant in the sense that for all m m 1 m and a en q or a enk q we have that ma m 1 m m 1 a p roof 1 follows from the fact that m s is an orthogonal basis for m to show 2 we may assume that m m s m 1 m t and a g i or a e i and must check m s a m t m s m t a for all possibilities of r sj c sj p sj r tj c tj p tj and j i i 1 here the number of cases is reduced to the half by the symmetry of moreover if p si p si 1 and p ti 6 p ti 1 then it follows immediately from lemma 12 that m s e i m t m s m t e i 0 and that m s g i m t m s m t g i 0 and so we only need consider the cases where p si p si 1 and p ti p ti 1 or p si 6 p si 1 and p ti 6 p ti 1 in the rest of the proof we shall use the formulas of lemma 12 repeatedly let us first consider a g i and suppose that p si p si 1 and p ti p ti 1 if r is p si 1 and r it p it1 we have m s g i m t m ssi m t ssi t whereas m s m t g i m s m t g i stsi where is the kronecker delta and so m s g i m t m s m t g i if r is p is1 and r it p it1 then again m s g i m t ssi t whereas m s g i m t m s m t g i m s m tsi q q 1 m t stsi since s 6 t and so the two sides coincide if r is p si 1 and r it p ti 1 we have m s g i m t m ssi q q 1 m s m t ssi t qq 1 st and m s m t g i m s m tsi qq 1 m t stsi qq 1 st once again the two sides coincide we next consider a g i but suppose that p si 6 p si 1 and p ti 6 p ti 1 here we have m s g i m t m ssi m t ssi t and similarly m s m t g i m s m tsi stsi and so the two side also coincide in this case finally we consider the case a e i and must check that m s e i m t x s m t e i but if p si p si 1 and p ti p ti 1 we have m s e i m s and m t e i m t and otherwise if p is 6 p is1 and p it 6 p it1 we have m s e i 0 and m t e i 0 hence the two sides also coincide in this case this finishes the proof of the lemma we have the following crucial lemma lemma 14 suppose that and that s t std then we have m t n t0 s0 m s 6 0 or equivalently m t m s n s0 t0 6 0 100 in particular m t n t0 s0 6 0 and m s n s0 t0 6 0 p roof suppose that s s u and t t v then the same chain of equalities that took us from 73 to 76 in lemma 9 but postmultiplied with bd u0 g d s 0 gives us m t n t0 s0 e x t t 0 t 0t b bd v bd v0 c 0 bd u0 g d s 0 101 e x g w y 0 b bw c 0 bd u0 g d s 0 where we used 10 for the last equality note that t 0 and v are both of the initial kind using the invariance property of the previous lemma 13 we get from this that m t n t0 s0 m s m t n t0 s0 g ds bd u m t e x g w y 0 b bw c 0 bd u0 g d s 0 g ds bd u m t 102 in view of 25 and the remarks preceding 25 we have decompositions d s 0 d s 00 d t and d s d s 0 d t and hence we can use lemma 7 repeatedly on a reduced expres sion of d t to rewrite e g d s 0 g ds e g d s 0 g ds e g w and so 102 becomes e x g w y 0 g w b b c b m t  w 0 w e x g w y 0 b bw c 0 e x g w b bw m t y 0 c 0 m t 103 note that 103 does not depend on s and t only on the expressions in 103 only involve multitableaux of the initial kind and so the lemma is reduced to the corresponding hecke algebra statement to be precise for p ar n each element w of the double coclass s w s0 has a unique decomposition w w 1 w w 2 where w 1 s and w 2 s0 and moreover w w 1 w w 2 see lemma 16 of dipperjames applying this on s and s we conclude that m t occurs exactly once in the expansion of m t y 0 c 0 corresponding to the 1term in both y 0 and c 0 and so 103 is equal to 1 the lemma is proved t he tensor space v n module for en q in this section we realize the tensor space v n module for en q introduced in ry as a sum of the permutation modules m when the dimension of v is sufficiently large it is known that v n is a faithful en qmodule but here we are interested in the general case where v n may not be faithful using the results from the previous section we determine the annihilator ideal in en q of v n in turns out that is has a nice description in terms of the dual cellular basis n st it is a main point of our constructions and proofs that they work for arbitrary k let v be the free smodule with basis b v is 1 i n 1 s r that is v is of dimension r n we then define linear maps e g ends v 2 via v sj v it if s t v i v j e if s 6 t 104 105 and v tj v is  qvs vt v is v tj g v tj v is  q q 1 v s v t v t v s s 6 t s t i j s t i j s t i j 106 we extend them to linear maps ei and gi acting in the tensor space v n by letting e and g act in the i th and i 1st factors the following is theorem 1 of ry theorem 15 the rules e i 7 ei and g i 7 gi endow v n with the structure of an en qmodule in the case of enc q it was proved in ry that the specialized tensor module v cn is faithful when r n n in espry this faithfulness statement was generalized to v n itself but still only for r n n in fact it does not hold otherwise as we shall see let seqn be the set of sequences i i 1 i n of integers where each i j belongs to 1 n and let similarly seqr be the set of sequences s s 1 s n where each s j belongs to 1 r for such i and s we define v i v i 1 v i n v n 107 then the set v i i seqn s seqr is a basis for v n to s seqr we associate sets i j i s i j for j 1 r the i j s may be empty but leaving out the empty i j s we obtain a set partition in sp n that we denote a s and we say that s is of type if a s is of type for example if r 4 n a 13 and s 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 4 1 2 2 then a s 1 4 8 11 2 3 5 6 7 9 12 13 10 and so s is of type 8 4 1 recall now the idempotent decompositions asp n e a 1 and p ar n e 1 they give rise to decompositions of v n v n e a v n v n e v n 108 p ar n asp n note that e v n is canonically an en qmodule we have the following lemma which gives precise descriptions of e a v n and e v n lemma 16 with the above notations the following statements hold if a a s 1 e a v i otherwise 2 e a v n spans v i a s a 3 e v n spans v i s is of type p roof statement 1 is immediate from the definition of e a given in 38 so let us prove 2 suppose that a i 1 i 2 i k then by construction the vector v i belongs to the right hand side of 2 exactly when any two terms s i and s j of s coincide iff i and j are in the same block i l of a for example if r 3 and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 then the s satisfying a s a are the following ones 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 109 hence in view of 42 that is ea a b e b 110 together with a a 1 we conclude from 1 that e a v i v i whenever v i belongs to the right hand side of 2 which proves the inclusion of 2 to prove we assume p s s that v e a v n and consider its expansion v i v i with coefficients i s by 1 and 110 we have that a a s whenever i 6 0 and hence if v does not belong to the right hand side of 2 there are i 0 seqn and s 0 seqr such that i 0 6 0 and a a s 0 we have that e a s 0 v i 0 v i 0 and hence e a s 0 v 6 0 by 1 once again on the other hand by part 3 of proposition 3 we also have that e a s 0 v 0 and this gives the desired contradiction finally 3 follows from 2 and the definitions for n any natural number we define c omp rnn c omp rn resp p ar rnn p ar rn as the set of multicompositions resp multipartitions 1 2 r such that each i is of length less than n suppose now that c omp rnn and that t rstd then we define i t i 1 i n seqn by letting i j be the row number of the node in t containing j and similarly we define st s 1 s n seqr by letting s j be the component number of the node in t containing j for example if  18 6 9 11 14 20 7 10 12 15 18 13 16 19 23 21 22 25  52 111 then i t 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 2 and st 2 10 1 1 10 3 4 2 3 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 9 7 7 7 8 9 8 9 for t rstd we write vt for v t the following theorem relates the tensor space module v modules m with the permutation theorem 17 let v be the free smodule or kvector space of dimension r n with basis as in 104 suppose that c omp rnn is of type p ar n and that is of length r 1 the slinear map m v n given by xt vt for t rstd is an embedding of en qmodules 2 identifying m with m we have m e v n and a direct sum decomposition of en qmodules e v n 112 c omp rnn a p roof 1 follows from lemma 10 together with 105 and 106 and the definitions and 2 follows from 1 and lemma 16 for any natural number n we define lnn as the subset of ln consisting of the pairs such that the components k of all have less than n columns and we set lnn ln lnn we can now give the main theorem of our paper theorem 18 let v be as in 104 with basis b and suppose that p ar n is of length r let i en q be the annihilator ideal of the action of en q in e v n then i is free over s with basis n st s t std lnn a similar statement holds over k 113 p roof let us focus on12the scase since the kcase is34done the same way let i1 en q be the sspan of n st s t std lnn we first observe that i1 is a twosided ideal in en q as one sees from the n st version of lemma 56 of espry the number of columns of the components never decreases under the straightening procedure of that lemma we first prove that i1 i that is for a basis element n st of i1 we prove that m n st 0 for any m appearing in 112 or equivalently that m n st 0 but since i1 is an ideal in order to show m n st 0 it is enough to show x n st 0 note that may not be a multipartition only a multicomposition but in any case t is of the initial kind and so we can use lemma 44 of murphy95 to rewrite x as a linear combination of xs 1t 1 where s 1 and t 1 are 1 multitableaux of the initial kind for 1 an r multipartition such that 1 d in general for any sr there is an en qisomorphism m  m where is the r multicomposition obtained from by permuting the components as one checks using lemma 10 and so we may assume that 1 is increasing moreover since 1 d and c omp rnn we have 1 p ar rnn we now observe that xs 1t 1 is also of the form m s1 t1 where s1 s 1 u1 and t1 t 1 v1 and where the components of shapeu1 and shapev1 are all onecolumn partitions in particular d u1 d v1 1 but from lemma 9 we know that m s1 t1 n st 6 0 implies t1 e s0 which is impossible since all components of 1 have less then n rows whereas at least one component of shapes 0 has more then n rows here s s u for some u hence m s1 t1 n st 0 and so the inclusion i1 i is proved suppose now that the inclusion i1 i is strict then there exists n i i1 our plan is then to construct a c omp rnn such that a and m n 6 0 which is a contradiction since m is a direct summand of e v n by lemma 17 we shall do so by showing that there exists a ln with c omp rnn such that m n 6 0 this gives the desired contradiction since m m in order to do so we consider the expansion n ststdl st n st we may assume that shapes lnn for all s t occurring in the expansion of n otherwise if shapes lnn we subtract the corresponding term st n st from n and still get an element in i1 i by the first part of the proof we now choose smi n tmi n with smi n tmi n 6 0 and minimal in the sense that if s e smi n t e tmi n and st 6 0 then s t smi n tmi n let smi n s mi n umi n and let mi n shapesmi n mi n mi n we then have 0mi n c omp rnn of type and so we may consider the perof and m t0 mutation module m 0mi n we are interested in the elements m s0 mi n mi n m 0mi n using the minimality of smi n tmi n together with lemma 9 and the invariance of the bilinear form we get m s0 mi n n m t0 mi n 0 m s0 mi n mi n mi n  m t0 mi n 114 which is nonzero by lemma 14 hence m 0mi n n 6 0 as needed this proves the theorem in view of the above theorem it is natural to consider the following quotient algebra et l nn q en qi 115 where i is the ideal from 113 it is a generalization of the generalized temperleylieb algebras introduced in hrterich for k a field there is also a specialized version of et l nn q that we denote et lnn q by construction et lnn q is the largest quo tient of en q acting faithfully on e v we have the following corollary to theorem corollary 19 et l nn q is free over s with basis n st s t std lnn a similar statement holds for et lk the following corollary shows that et l nn q is also a generalization of the partition temperleylieb algebra pt l that was introduced in juyu corollary 20 let st i en q be the i th steinberg element given by st i q 3 g i g i 1 g i q 2 g i g i 1 q 2 g i 1 g i q 1 g i q 1 g i 1 1 116 and define pt l n q as the quotient algebra pt ln q en qji where ji is the twosided ideal of en q generated by e i e i 1 st i for some i then pt l n q does not depend on the choice of i and moreover pt l similar statements hold over k p roof in proposition 45 of juyu it is shown that the e i e i 1 st i s are all conjugate to each other in en q and so the ji s are equal ideals which proves the first statement for simplicity we write j j1 we must then show that j i where i is the ideal described in theorem 18 the inclusion j i follows from the fact that e n1 e n st n1 belongs the basis for i given in 113 in fact we have e n1 e n st n1 n t t where is chosen such that all components of 1 r are onecolumn partitions except r which is of the form r 3 1s for some s and such that all components of are onecolumn partitions for the other inclusion j i we consider a basis element n st for i as given in 113 letting shapes there is a component of with more than three columns and so there is an i such that e i e i 1 st i is a factor of n st this shows j i and concludes the proof of the corollary remark using corollary 19 we can determine the dimension of et l nn q and since the cardinality hence also of pt ln q p ar n pt l n st s t std ln2 117 p ar n we have for example dim pt l3 q 29 dim pt l4 q 334 dim pt l5 q 5512 118 these values are confirmed by juyuamaya and papis magma calculations and by espinozas preprint esp that contains a closed general formula for dim pt ln q remark there should be a diagrammatic calculus associated with pt ln q that it would be interesting to study r eferences arcisjuyu d arcis j juyumaya tied monoids arxiv200100625 aicarjuyu1 f aicardi j
