physics budapest university of technology and economics 1111 budapest budafoki t 8 hungary 30th april 2021 abstract we consider the decay of the false vacuum realised within a quantum quench into an anticonfining regime of the ising spin chain with a magnetic field opposite to the initial magnetisation although the effective linear potential between the domain walls is repulsive the time evolution of correlations still shows a suppression of the light cone and a reduction of vacuum decay the suppressed decay is a lattice effect and can be assigned to emergent bloch oscillations introduction quantum quenches ie sudden changes in a systems hamiltonian 12 provide a paradigmatic protocol to study nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and relaxation in by now routinely engineered closed quantum systems 310 in global translationally invariant quantum quenches the initial state has a finite uniform energy density with respect to the postquench hamiltonian and the system is therefore in a highly excited state this highly excited configuration acts as a source of quasiparticle excitations which may collide and thermalize with time indeed within a semiclassical picture 1 these quasiparticle excitations drive equilibration by spreading correlation and entanglement across the system in a large class of systems including various spin chains with shortrange interactions or interacting bosonic or fermionic systems quasiparticles have an upper bound on their velocity 11 leading typically to a distinctive lightcone pattern in time dependent correlation functions 1 2 1217 this behavior is however not completely generic confining forces as a remarkable exception can suppress the lightcone spreading of correlations 18 the prediction of dynamical confinement has indeed been confirmed recently in numerous systems and settings exhibiting confinement 1928 dynamical confinement 18 has originally been observed in the ferromagnetic phase g 1 true vacuum false vacuum true vacuum a confining quench false vacuum true vacuum false vacuum b anticonfining quench figure 11 a for the longitudinal field h parallel to the initial magnetisation bubbles nucleated during the quench contain the false vacuum the corresponding attractive forces blue arrows confine domain walls indicated by red lines into mesons b for h opposite to the initial magnetisation the nucleating bubbles contain the true vacuum the induced repulsive force accelerates the domain walls outwards of the quantum ising spin chain governed by the hamiltonian hqisc j iz i1  gix hiz  i dynamical confinement occurs while initializing the system in its g0 1 positive spontaneous magnetisation ground state with m hiz i 0 and h0 0 and then quenching to a hamiltonian with some g 1 and h 0 in this case the quench gives rise to oppositely moving domain walls kinkantikink pairs with a bubble of negative magnetisation m stretched between them see fig 11 with the magnetic field being turned on in the opposite direction these bubbles are filled with the false vacuum and cost therefore a potential energy that is proportional to the distance between domain walls the corresponding confining force 29 inhibits the propagation of particles to large distances and prevents thermalisation of the system within all time scales accessible to numerical simulations it is intriguing to ask what happens if we switch on a field h 0 in this case the initial state becomes the false vacuum and the interior of the bubble is filled with the true vacuum therefore the external field promotes the expansion of bubbles and generates a repulsive force between the domain walls as illustrated in fig 11 in quantum field theory this corresponds to a scenario proposed by coleman known as the decay of the false vacuum 3031 the expansion of the bubbles should rapidly accelerate to a maximal velocity and the true vacuum should fill the entire space colemans scenario would thus imply in our case that the bubbles should extend to the whole spin chain which should rapidly relax to an equilibrium or steady state around the true vacuum here we show that colemans scenario is violated in the ising spin chain the dynamics of spinspin correlation function clearly indicate that bubbles do not expand infinitely rather the repulsive force leads to an oscillatory motion of the domain walls known as bloch oscillations these findings are corroborated by recent numerical studies of the order parameter statistics in the quantum ising spin chain 32 g 04 h 01 030 g 04 h 01 015 000 g 04 h 02 020 g 04 h 02

average bubble sizes estimated as in eqn 29 and 210 respectively dynamics in the anticonfining regime quench setup and subsequent time evolution as discussed in the introduction we consider quantum quenches in the ferromagnetic phase for simplicity we start the quench from a fully aligned positively polarised state ie from the ground state with g0 0 and h0 0 we then quench to a finite transverse field g 1 and an anticonfining longitudinal field h 0 turning on a finite g0 g 0 creates a gas of domain wall excitations which then move in the presence of the field h 0 the time evolution is numerically simulated using the infinite volume time evolving block decimation itebd method 33 which we also use to compute the time evolution of the connected twopoint equal time spin correlation function cz l t h0z tlz tic h0z tlz ti h0z ti hlz ti as shown in fig 21 at a first sight the time evolution of cz l t is remarkably similar for an anticonfining field h 0 to the one obtained in the dynamical confinement region h 0 studied in 18 in both cases the lightcone propagation of correlations is suppressed and oscillations are observed closer examination of the simulation results discerns however some important differences between the two cases while correlations have an oscillatory behavior in both cases the corresponding frequencies and amplitudes are quite different as discussed in ref 18 in the confining case h 0 the frequencies of oscillations scale with h23 and correspond to bound 0025 0020 0015 0010 0005 figure 22 the kink dispersion relation k for g 03 and the initial density k for g0 0 g 03 states of domain walls calledmesons in contrast for the anticonfining case the characteristic frequency scales with h as shown explicitly by the quench spectroscopy discussed in subsection bloch oscillations as already stated oscillations observed for h 0 can be interpreted as bloch oscillations they are related to the lattice structure of the model and can be easily understood within a semiclassical picture consider first a pure transverse field quench with h 0 and g 0 the postquench state then consists of independent kinkantikink pairs with momenta k andpk these kinks behave as noninteracting fermions with a dispersion relation k 2j 1 g 2 2g cos k and propagate with the group velocity vk limited by the maximum velocity vmax 2j g the initial density of kinks can be determined following refs 15 34 kinkantikink pairs of momentum k are created with a pair creation amplitude kk tan k 2 with gg0 g g0 cos k 1 cos k p 1 g 2g cos k 1 g02 2g0 cos k and the density of kink pairs with momentum in the interval k k dk is given by kk2 1 cosk  sin2 k 2 1 kk shown in fig 22 the denominator in this equation simply reflects the fermionic nature of kinks and the spatial bubble density is just the integral of k bubble 0 2 bloch oscillations arise due to the finite longitudinal field h 0 ignored so far to a first approximation we can neglect the correction to the dispersion relation k and treat the dynamics of the bubbles as that of a twoparticle system a kink and an antikink interacting via a repulsive potential v r r where r is the distance between the kinks and the coefficient given by the energy gain of flipping the magnetisation into the external fields direction 2mh 2h 1 g 2 the semiclassical equation of motion of the kinks is then written as 1 v k  2 2 r with the factors 2 and 12 related to having two mobile kinks the second equation yields immediately kt k0 12 t and can be used to determine the kinkantikink distance as  k0 t2 k0 r0 with r0 initial size of the bubble typically of the order of the lattice spacing and k0 the initial momenta of the kinks due to the periodicity of k the kink velocity reverses sign when the momentum k passes the boundary of the brillouin zone at k where the kinks turn back as a result kinks return to their original position and collide again after a period t k0 when the bubble recollapses rt k0 0 this happens when k0 t k0 2 2 k0 at this point the kink and the antikink are reflected and start off again with the whole cycle repeating as illustrated in fig 23 causing the bubbles oscillate in time in contrast to the idealised singlebubble dynamics shown in fig 23 the observed oscillations shown on the left of fig 21 result from a large number of bubbles each having different initial momenta and initial sizes nevertheless these bloch oscillations still have a characteristic time as obvious from fig 22 and can be indeed verified by direct calculation for an initial state with g0 0 the kink density is highest around momenta corresponding to vmax which determines the front line of the bubbles and thus the overall frequency of oscillations via the condition 12 tb 2k0 for small gs yielding rt the presence of a distribution of domain wall momenta leads however to a gradual decay of oscillations due to the dependence of the oscillation period and phase on the initial kink momentum bubble collisions have a similar degrading effect on coherent oscillations we close this subsection with two interesting observations regarding oscillation decay and collisions  kinkantikink pairs collide once during every oscillation period they could in principle annihilate into mesons then however our numerics shows no such effect in the accessible time frame which is consistent with recent findings 35 that the inelastic scattering is very ineffective these collisions also give rise to a time delay due to the interaction between kinks in the case of zero longitudinal field h 0 however the kinkantikink scattering amplitude is simply 1 and there is no time delay therefore any time delay introduced by kink collisions is of order h which we can neglect in the simple semiclassical picture used here  collisions between different bubbles lead to interactions between bubbles leading to corrections to the simple motion described above this effect can be neglected if the average spacing between bubbles is larger than their maximum allowed size which leads to the condition bubble 1 fl 2 this requires the longitudinal field to be larger than some minimum value which can be computed as a function of g and turns out to be much smaller than the fields used in our simulations where the smallest field was h 005 figure 23 illustrating the bloch oscillation of a bubble with a definite initial momentum of the kinks forming the bubble walls arrows indicate the dominant spin direction as a function of the spatial position for selected time slices time delays corresponding to kink collisions are neglected verifying average bubble size and scaling one piece of evidence for the suggested scenario is that it predicts an average bubble size that agrees reasonably well with the spatial extension of the correlations this is demonstrated in figure 21 where the red lines depict the estimate for the average bubble size dk0 k0 k0 hrianticonf bubble 0 2 obtained by neglecting the original bubble size d0 for the standard confining case a similar reasoning gives the average bubble size dk0 hriconf k0 k0 0 210 bubble 0 2 since in this latter case kink momenta oscillate between k0 and 0 note that these estimates depend both on g and h and give a very good estimate for the spatial extension of the correlations shown in figure 21 another telltale signal of bloch oscillations is that their spatial extension is predicted to scale as 1h while their frequency is proportional to h this is manifest in the numerically computed time evolution as demonstrated in fig 24 where the spacetime bubble contour is extracted from the data at h 01 and then superimposed on the time evolution obtained for other h values with time and space rescaled accordingly note that the actual distance and time scales vary by a factor of 4 while the correlation profiles remain almost identical when plotted in terms of the scaled variables ht and hl this scaling works remarkably well for the first few oscillations later differences can be attributed to deviations from our simple semiclassical picture such as the presence of localised spin excitations with frequencies much higher than the bloch oscillations of the bubble walls as well as distortions due to bubble collisions and the contributions from the periodic kink collisions when bubbles shrink to their minimal size quench spectroscopy quench spectroscopy presented in fig 25 ie the fourier analysis of the time evolution after the quench provides a further tool to assess bloch oscillations for small values of h we figure 24 scaling evidence for bloch oscillations for the transverse field values g 020 left and g 025 right with the longitudinal field taking the values h 005 010 015 020 for each the plot shows h0z lz ic as a function of the scaling variables ht and hl the colour scale is defined by normalising the maximum value of the correlator to 1 while the red lines show the bubble wall defined by the data with h 010 at one tenth of its maximum value z z 0 0 h 005 h 010 h 015 h 020 z z 0 0 z z 0 0 z z 0 0 figure 25 power spectrum of h0z tlz tic for l 0 and g 025 green dotted lines show meson frequencies computed following 18 note that they become less and less relevant as h grows red dashed lines have a spacing 2hm indicating a regular sequence of higher harmonics of the bloch oscillations which instead become more prominent for higher values of only observe frequency peaks corresponding to mesonic bound states the energy gap of these mesonic excitations is always larger than twice the kink gap grows with increasing h and can also be computed theoretically using a semiclassical method 18 36 for small quench fields we do not observe bloch oscillations this is not unexpected since the bubbles are large and collide with each other before their oscillation could be observed for larger field values however mesons are harder to create and bubble collisions become less frequent we therefore expect and indeed find that mesonic contributions to the frequency spectrum become less and less pronounced with growing h while at the same time another set of regularly spaced frequency peaks emerges well below the threshold of mesonic excitations due to the dependence of their period on the initial kink momentum k0 the bloch oscillations do not in general have a welldefined frequency nevertheless as explained above we still expect to see a strong feature at the characteristic frequency furthermore since bloch oscillations are nonharmonic the frequency spectrum is expected to contain a regular sequence of higher harmonics indeed such a series of peaks is seen to coincide with the red lines in fig 25 with the distance between them equal to note that the simulation can only capture higher harmonics mostly due to the finite time window of the numerical simulations but also due to lowfrequency background which results from the quench time evolution containing frequencies corresponding to all differences between energy levels of the postquench hamiltonian conclusions as we demonstrated in this work within the transverse field ising model lightcone time evolution and the decay of the false vacuum can be absent in onedimensional systems even in a deconfined quench regime where the formation of bubbles would be energetically favorable rather quite unexpectedly we observe in this regime spatially confined correlations oscillating in time we identify these as bloch oscillations these appear due to the underlying lattice and the periodicity of the quasiparticles dispersion relation in the momentum variable our observations are in agreement with recent results obtained in kinetically constrained rydberg spin systems 37 however while in ref 37 a special constraint finetuning was needed to generate bloch oscillations here they emerge quite generically without any constraint in a regime where quasiparticle excitations would naively be expected to speed up and spread correlations over the system our results are relevant for experimental realisations of the tunneling decay of the false vacuum such as put forward in ref 38 we predict that in discrete spin chains the dynamics after bubble nucleation lead to bloch oscillations in general in stark contrast to expectations from continuum quantum field theories our results also demonstrate that simple spin chains provide an experimental realisation of bloch oscillations which can clearly be identified from the scaling of the spacetime dependent spinspin correlation
