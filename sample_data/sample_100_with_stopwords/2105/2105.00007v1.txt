the stellar mass function smf of lyman ly emitters laes from z 2 to z 6 by exploring 4000 laes from the sc4k sample we find a correlation between ly luminosity lly and restframe uv muv with bestfit muv 1603 log10 lly erg s1 4712 11 and a shallower relation between lly and stel1 lar mass m with bestfit log10 m m 0901  2840 01 log10 lly erg s 38 an increasing lly cut predominantly lowers the number density of faint muv and low m laes we estimate a proxy for the full uv lfs and smfs of laes with simple assumptions of the faint end slope for the uv lf we find a brightening of the characteristic uv luminosity muv with increasing redshift and a decrease of the characteristic number density for the smf we measure a characteristic stellar mass m m increase with increasing redshift and a decline however if we apply a uniform luminosity cut of log10 lly erg s1 430 we find much milder to no evolution in the uv and smf of laes the uv luminosity density uv of the full sample of laes shows moderate evolution and the stellar mass density m decreases with both being always lower than the total uv and m of more typical galaxies but slowly approaching them with increasing redshift overall our results indicate that both uv and m of laes slowly approach the measurements of continuumselected galaxies at z 6 which suggests a key role of laes in the epoch of reionisation key words

postdoctoral program fellow  zwicky fellow  2019 the authors drake et al 2017 sobral et al 2018a konno et al 2018 taylor et al 2020 ly emission is typically associated with young starforming galaxies sfgs eg partridge peebles 1967 but can also be emitted from active galaxy nuclei agn eg miley de breuck 2008 sobral et al 2018b calhau et al 2020 laes are typically youngprimeval low mass low dust extinction sources eg gawiser et al 2006 2007 pentericci et al 2007 lai et al 2008 matthee et al 2021 but a significant diversity of properties within the ly population has been reported in the literature eg lai et al santos et al 2008 finkelstein et al 2009 acquaviva et al 2012 hagen et al 2016 matthee et al 2016 oyarzn et al 2017 santos et al 2020 sources with high ly equivalent width ew typically have young stellar ages low metallicities and topheavy initial mass functions eg schaerer 2003 raiter et al 2010 hashimoto et al 2017 laes have been shown to be very compact in the uv eg malhotra et al 2012 paulinoafonso et al 2018 with the compact morphology possibly being favourable to the escape of ly photons additionally studies have shown that highredshift laes may be progenitors of a wide range of galaxies from presentday galaxies eg gawiser et al 2007 guaita et al 2010 yajima et al 2012 to bright cluster galaxies bcgs eg khostovan et al 2019 highlighting the significance of laes in galaxy evolution studies studies of uvcontinuum selected galaxies have found that the ly fraction ly percentage of galaxies with ly emission increases with redshift up to z 6 eg stark et al 2010 pentericci et al 2011 cassata et al 2015 de barros et al 2017 caruana et al 2018 kusakabe et al 2020 this might be explained by an average lower dust content in higher redshift galaxies eg stanway et al 2005 bouwens et al 2006 increasing the ly escape fraction fescly ratio between observed and intrinsic ly photons in a galaxy eg hayes et al 2011 andor increasing the ionising efficiency ion number of produced ionising photons per unit uv luminosity eg matthee et al 2017a ly is typically computed with large spectroscopic samples with ly being the ratio between the number of galaxies with ly emission detected above some ly ew threshold and the total number of probed galaxies see eg stark et al 2010 ly is found to be higher for galaxies fainter in the restframe uv muv eg pentericci et al 2011 implying such galaxies have higher escape fraction of ly photons andor have a higher ion eg maseda et al 2020 this can also be linked with faint muv galaxies having higher ly ew see eg shimizu et al 2011 kusakabe et al 2018 and thus being more susceptible to being picked as laes although such trend could also be a consequence of selection effects or survey limits see eg nilsson et al 2009 ando et al 2006 zheng et al 2014 hashimoto et al 2017 some studies report no strong correlation between ly and muv kusakabe et al 2020 and attribute the typical high ly of faint muv galaxies to selection biases in lyman break galaxy lbg samples which are biased towards selecting sources with high ly ew as strong ly emission will boost the photometry and enhance the lyman break making such sources easier to detect alternatively ly could in principle be inferred from the ratio between luminosity functions lf number density per luminosity bin vs luminosity of lyselected and uv continuumselected samples the uv lf of continuumselected galaxies has been extensively constrained in multiple studies up to z 10 eg steidel et al 1999 arnouts et al 2005 sawicki thompson 2006 bouwens et al 2015 finkelstein et al 2015 alavi et al 2016 mehta et al 2017 ono et al 2018 the characteristic number density  is found to decrease with an increasing redshift from log10 mpc3 25 at z 2 reddy steidel 2009 to 35 at z 6 bouwens et al 2015 the uv lf of laes has also been probed by multiple studies see eg hu et al 2004 shimasaku et al 2006 ouchi et al 2008 targeting volumes of up to 106 mpc3 ouchi et al 2008 found no evolution of the uv lf of laes at z 3 4 but an increase of uv bright laes at z 57 it is important to establish whether such evolutionary trends hold for much larger volumes 108 mpc3 and larger samples of laes furthermore it is important to establish how laes contribute to the total mass budget of galaxies laes are typically low stellar mass galaxies but can span a wide range of stellar masses with some laes being very massive 1010 m eg finkelstein et al 2009 the stellar mass function smf of continuumselected galaxies has been well studied up to z 4 see eg pozzetti et al 2010 mortlock et al 2011 santini et al 2012 ilbert et al 2013 muzzin et al 2013 the smf of continuumselected galaxies is found to shift to lower number densities decrease with increasing redshift from log10 mpc3 33 at z 2 25 to 50 at z 3 4 muzzin et al 2013 for laes our understanding of the smf is very limited as most studies are only able to determine stellar masses of stacks of the population eg kusakabe et al 2018 estimating stellar masses of highredshift laes is challenging due to nearinfrared nir coverage typically not being deep enough recent programs such as ultravista mccracken et al 2012 dr4 provide ultradeep nir imaging which can be used to better constrain the spectral energy distribution of highredshift galaxies measurements of the stellar mass of individual galaxies in large samples spanning wide redshift ranges can significantly improve our view on the evolution of laes and how they compare with more typical galaxy samples in this work we use a uniformly selected sample of  4000 laes sc4k sobral et al 2018a to compute uv lfs and smfs in the wide redshift range z 2 6 we use the publicly available catalogues from calhau et al 2020 which identify agn candidates in the sc4k sample using xray and radio measurements and the publicly available catalogues from santos et al 2020 which has measured the uv luminosity and stellar mass of laes in the sc4k sample by comparing the luminosity and stellar mass density of laes with measurements of continuumselected galaxies we can infer how representative laes are of the overall population of galaxies at different redshifts this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the sc4k sample of laes together with some galaxy properties derived in previous works we present our methodology to derive uv lfs and smfs in section 3 we present and discuss our results in section 4 probing the evolution of the uv lf and smf parameters across time as well as estimating the evolution of lae lbg proxy of ly and the luminosity and stellar mass densities we present our conclusions in section 5 throughout this work we use a cdm cosmology with h0 70 km s1 mpc1 m 03 and 07 all

435 from 198 to 214 the higher number of sources above log10 lly erg s1 427 also observed in the right panel is a consequence of flux limit differences between narrow and medium bands for reference we

and approaching 100 at lly 1044 erg s1 sed fitting from santos et al 2020 shows that sc4k laes are typically very blue  21 low mass m 1093 m and above the starforming main sequence at z 4 and m 1095 m sc4k sources are also the prime focus of followup spectroscopic observations focusing on studying primeval galaxies amorn et al 2017 mnras 000 119 2019 211 xray and radio agn in sc4k the sc4k sample includes 254 laes detected in xray and 120 detected in radio 56 in both resulting in 318 agn candidates calhau et al 2020 out of 3705 sc4k laes with xray or radio coverage following the same methodology as santos et al 2020 we classify these sources as agns since pure starforming processes would require extremely high sfrs 1000 m yr1 to be detectable at such wavelengths and redshifts throughout this work sc4k agns are removed from any fittingbinning and median values in tables except in figures 3 and 5 left panel where we show the number densities of agn laes 212 redshift binning in addition to analysing the properties of laes from specific selection filters we group filters with similar central wavelengths to analyse specific redshift bins in a more statistically robust way

spectral energy distribution sed fitting of the full sc4k sample is presented in santos et al 2020 briefly sedfitting is done using the publicly available sedfitting code magphys1 da cunha et al 2008 2012 with the highredshift extension see da cunha et al 2015 which models stellar and dust emission from galaxies we obtain photometric measurements from publicly available imaging taken with 34 restframe uvfir filters in the cosmos field capak et al 2007 mccracken et al 2012 steinhardt et al 2014 sanders et al 2007 lutz et al 2011 oliver et al 2012 as the sedfitting code does not include nebular emission we exclude the nb or mb with observed ly emission from the sedfitting derived parameters are the medianlikelihood parameters obtained by comparing modelled seds with libraries of galaxies at similar redshift magphys uses dust attenuation models from charlot fall 2000 and the stellar population synthesis model from bruzual charlot 2003 with a chabrier 2003 imf httpwwwiapfrmagphys range 01100 m the prescription of madau 1995 is used to model the intergalactic medium igm in this work we will focus on two sedderived properties restframe uv luminosity muv and stellar mass m we use the public catalogues provided by santos et al 2020 which contain coordinates photometry and derived galaxy properties for the full sc4k sample of laes 221 restframe uv luminosity muv the uv luminosity of a galaxy muv can be used as a tracer of recent starformation on 100 myr timescales eg boselli et al 2001 salim et al 2009 muv is computed in santos et al 2020 by integrating the bestfit seds at restframe 0 1400 1600 the median of the sc4k sample is muv 20207 08 table 1 which corresponds to 009lz3 steidel et al 1999 similarly but for shorter timescales ly emission also traces recent starformation due to being a tracer of lymancontinuum eg sobral matthee 2019 like h kennicutt 1998 as the massive young stars responsible for producing the uv continuum also produce the ionising photons that lead to ly emission we can expect these two properties to be related for our sample of laes we observe that these two properties are typically correlated see fig 1 left panel with the median muv significantly brightening from 198 to 214 in the luminosity range log10 lly erg s1 425 435 we compute a bestfit of muv 1602  4712 03 log10 lly erg s 11 from the median distribution however ly luminosity lly does not necessarily translate muv and viceversa see the scatter around muv 20 and see discussion in matthee et al 2017b and sobral et al 2018b this is also made evident from lbg samples where there are bright muv sources with no significant ly detection as shown by the ly fraction eg stark et al 2010 pentericci et al 2011 arrabal haro et al 2018 kusakabe et al 2020 222 stellar mass m the shape and normalisation of an sed is a reflection of the content of stars in a galaxy thus its total mass of stars stellar mass m can be derived by fitting and modelling the sed laes typically have low m but there is an important diversity within the population the median of the sc4k sample of laes is computed in santos et al 2020 using magphys log10 m m 9306 05 table 1 which corresponds to 0006 mz34 muzzin et al 2013 we find the median m and lly to be correlated see fig 1 right panel with bestfit log10 m m 0901  2840 01 log10 lly erg s 38 but with a significant scatter of individual detections this relation is shallower than the one measured between muv and lly with a more modest increase the median log10 m m only increases by 02 in the luminosity range log10 lly erg s1 425 430 we note that the sedfitting used to derive m does not include nebular emission so the two properties are independently derived additionally there is an anticorrelation between m and ly ew0 and thus ly escape fraction of laes santos et al 2020 mnras 000 119 2019 log10 mpc3 dm1 completeness corrected observed z 25 01 muv ab log10 mpc3 dlog10m1 evolution of the uv lf and smf

dark blue diamonds and after blue circles applying the completeness correction the completeness correction is based on ly flux selection criteria since muv and lly typically correlate see fig 1 left panel the completeness corrections are larger for the faintest muv bins right same but for the smf as the correlation between lly and m is shallower see fig 1 right panel completeness corrections are not a strong function of stellar mass for a specific ly cut luminosity and stellar mass functions in this section we present our methodology and computations to derive uv lfs and smfs for our sample of 4000 laes at welldefined redshift intervals between z 2 and z 6 determining the luminositymass functions we measure the number densities of welldefined muv and m bins which we use to construct the uv lf and smf we choose bin widths depending on muv and m as the most and least luminous and massive bins have fewer sources we define bins with width 05 dex in the range 22 muv 20 muv 225 for the deeper nb816 and 7 log10 m m 105 and 1 dex outside these ranges where the number densities are the lowest we use poissonian errors for any individual lf realisation the number density of a luminosity bin is given by log10 j log10 d log10 l v where j is the number density of a bin j nj is the number of sources within dlog10 l of j and v is the volume probed by the nbs or mbs for that specific bin see table 1 which is computed from the redshift range that each filter is sensitive to ly emission completeness correction faint sources and those with low ly ew may be missed by our selection criteria leading to an underestimation of number densities we estimate completeness corrections based on ly line flux same corrections used for the ly lfs in sobral et al 2018a full details therein and apply them to the uv lfs and the smfs of our sample of laes briefly mnras 000 119 2019 for each nb or mb we obtain a sample of highredshift nonlineemitters by applying the same colour break we used to target the lyman break in our laes and by selecting sources with photometric redshifts obtained from laigle et al 2016 02 the redshift range given in table 1 the distribution of mbnb magnitudes in this nonlineemitter sample is similar to the distribution of laes with a tail of 25 brighter sources the nonlineemitter sample is thus slightly brighter than the sample of laes and provides a sightly conservative estimation of the completeness corrections for each nonlineemitter sample flux is incrementally added to the nb or mb and bb see sobral et al 2018a table 3 therein by reapplying our selection criteria after each step we determine the fraction of galaxies which are picked as emitters per ly luminosity value we only consider sources with  30 completeness we apply completeness corrections to each lae individually based on their observed ly flux and not their muv or m in fig 2 we show muv and m number densities for z 25 ia427 laes before and after completeness corrections we note that the completeness correction is based on ly flux and thus larger for fainter laes but not necessarily correlated with other properties since muv and lly typically correlate see fig 1 left panel the corrections will typically be smaller for laes which are brighter in muv see fig 2 left panel since the correlation between m and lly is weak see fig 1 right panel the corrections will be similar for the entire mass range see fig 2 right panel including the completeness correction applied to each source equation 1 becomes log10 j log d log10 l i v where ci is the completeness

2008 at z 3 4 57 finding a good agreement with the offset at z 58 being easily explained by differences in ly flux limits we show the number densities of agns pink stars which predominantly dominate the bright muv regime 22 at z 4 often having higher number densities than nonagn laes at z 4 there is significantly less agn laes composing only a small fraction of laes at all muv ranges we compute the upper limit as one source at the volume probed by the nb or mb with the completeness correction equal to the total completeness correction applied to the previous luminosity or stellar mass bin fitting the uv luminosity function in order to compare our results with previous studies we adopt the common parameterisation of schechter 1976 function which consists of a powerlaw with a slope for faint luminosities and a declining exponential for brighter luminosities the transition between the two regimes is given by a characteristic luminosity l and a characteristic number density the schechter equation has the following form exp equation 33 can be rewritten for absolute magnitudes by using the substitution ldl muv dmuv muv ln 10 041muv  10 exp 1004muv 4 where muv muv muv the observed uv luminosity distribution of laes shows the same behaviour at all redshifts there is a peak number density at an intermediate uv luminosity with a subsequent decline in number density for both brighter and fainter uv luminosities see fig 3 while such a distribution does not resemble the schechter function with a steep faint end which is typically measured in lbg samples eg bouwens et al 2015 finkelstein et al 2015 we argue that such observed distribution of uv luminosities can be expected for a sample which is selected by ly line flux above some threshold corresponding to a vertical cut in fig 1 causing an incomplete sampling of muv this incomplete sampling is most significant at the faint uv luminosities which is shown in fig 5 right panel where an increasmnras 000 119

represent the same but only fitting the points above the number density peak candidate agn are removed from the analysis here see 211 ing lly limit will cause a preferential decline of number densities at faint uv luminosities and hence the observed turnover thus in order to conduct a detailed analysis of the uv luminosity distribution of laes we explore two separate scenarios  fit to the full uv luminosity range blue in fig 3 the entire observable uv luminosity range is considered including the turnover at faint uv luminosities while the low number densities at faint uv luminosities may be driven by our lly limits this approach provides the bestfit to the directly observed number densities  fit to the uv luminosity range brighter than the number density peak purple in fig 3 the bins fainter than the number density peak dominated by an incomplete sampling are thus not included in the fitting and the faint uv luminosity regime becomes unconstrained the peak in number density is different for different filters see fig 3 and different lly limits see fig 5 right panel with the simple assumptions of a steep faint end slope as measured in uv luminosityselected samples and by not including the bins below of the turnover which are heavily dominated by mnras 000 119 2019 our lly limits we obtain a proxy of the full distribution of laes we provide the schechter parameters of the bestfits to both cases in table 2 for the fit to the full uv luminosity range we find the set of parameters muv which minimises the reduced 2 2red in logspace alternatively fitting can also be performed in linearspace where 2 is less sensitive to bins with low number densities a fit in logspace thus tends to favour slightly brighter characteristic luminosities which provide a better fit to the very bright luminosities we find that the observed distribution is best fit by shallow faint end slopes 1 which are able to represent the turnover at the faintest luminosities with even being positive at some redshift ranges when constraining only the uv luminosities brighter than the number density peak we are not able to directly constrain the slope of the powerlaw and thus fix to 15 similar to the uv lf of laes from eg ouchi et al 2008 but we still perturb this parameter to quantify uncertainties see 35 here we make the assumption that does not evolve with redshift which is a necessary caveat due to not being able to directly constrain it we measure the uv lf santos et al table 2 bestfit schechter parameters for the uv lf of laes from z 2 to z 6 for each of the individual selection filters and for different redshift bins see 212 the number of sources provided here is the number of sources included in the luminosity functions ie nonagn laes with available seds and with completeness corrections 30 we provide best fits for the two cases considered in this study fit to the full uv luminosity range blue in fig 3 and fit to the bins brighter than the number density peak purple in fig 3 we provide the best set of parameters muv and which minimise 2red with being fixed for the latter case as it cannot be directly constrained when 2red is very large the errors should be interpreted with caution as the best parameters found still do not provide a good model additionally muv is also fixed for the individual filters with less than three luminosity bins although we

in fig 1 determined by observational constraints there is a turnover at low stellar masses the preferential decline of low stellar masses with increasing ly line flux is shown in fig 8 right panel and we further discuss how to interpret the shape of the smf in following the same reasons listed for the uv lf we conduct our fitting procedure in two stellar mass ranges full stellar mass range blue in fig 4 and stellar mass range above the turnover with an assumption of the slope blue in fig 4 the former provides a fit to the directly observed number densities and the later provides a proxy smf of the full distribution of laes we provide the best schechter mnras 000 119 2019 0601 1201 0801 1001 0901 1101 fits to both cases in table 3 for the fit of the full stellar mass range we find the set of parameters m which minimises 2red in logspace the observed distribution with a turnover for the faintest luminosities results in shallow faint end slopes 1 when constraining only the stellar masses bigger than the number density peak we are not able to directly constrain the slope of the powerlaw we fix to 13 but we vary all parameters including in 35 similarly to the uv lf we introduce the caveat the does not evolve with redshift which is a necessary assumption due to us not being able to directly constrain it in fig 4 we show the stellar mass bins and smfs of laes from the 16 selection filters for the filters with only two stellar mass bins we can only fit one free parameter so we fix m to a similar nearby filter santos et al nb711ia767 use mia738 101068 m we provide the schechter parameters of in best fits in table 3 perturbing the luminosity and mass functions we explore the uncertainties in our uv lfs and smfs by perturbing the luminosity or mass bins within their poissonian error bars for each iteration we perturb each bin within their error bars assuming a normal probability distribution function centred at each bin and with fwhm equal to the error and determine the value for the current realisation we compute the best schechter fit to the bins of the current realisation and iterate the process 1000 times we obtain the 16th and 84th percentile of all fits which we plot as contours in all figures for each iteration we also perturb the fixed schechter parameters for all redshifts and m or muv for the filters with only two bins by picking a random value in a 02 dex range centred in the fixed values same method as sobral et al 2018a obtaining uv and stellar mass densities we integrate uv lfs and smfs to obtain the luminosity density uv and the stellar mass density m respectively in order to fully take into account the uncertainties in our luminositiesstellar masses we perturb our measurements within their errors and fit and integrate each of the 1000 realisations see 35 the computed uv and m are the median of all integrals with the errors being the 16th and 84th percentile of the distribution of all realisations to obtain uv we compute the integral of the uv lfs in the range 23 muv 17 similar to eg finkelstein et al 2015 bouwens et al 2015 to obtain m we compute the integral of the smfs in the range 10813 m similar to eg davidzon et al 2017 all m measurements in this study assume a chabrier imf and values from the literature are converted to a chabrier imf if another imf was used results and discussion interpreting the observed uv lf and smf as detailed in the previous sections the observed distribution of both the uv lf and smf of laes has a turnover at the faintest uv luminosities and smallest stellar masses respectively see fig 3 and 4 while such a turnover has not been observed in uvselected or massselected samples it is an expected distribution of a lyselected sample where ly correlates with both muv and m but with significant scatter see fig 1 as there will be incomplete sampling of muv and m particularly at the faint uv luminosity and low stellar mass regimes as shown in fig 5 right panel an increasing lly cut will preferentially decrease the number densities of the faintest uv luminosities creating the turnover which is a consequence of selection and not an intrinsic property of the uv lf of laes a similar dependence is measured for the smf in fig 8 right panel albeit the dependence is not as strong we make the assumption that the incomplete sampling will introduce only small contributions above the turnover which is supported by our measurements fig 5 right panel when extending the luminosity cut from log10 lly erg s1 425 to 427 and even further into 429 and 431 the number densities always have a very significant drop below the turnover but remain roughly constant above it by only fitting the regime above the turnover and by fixing as a steep slope we are able to measure a distribution which is not dominated by incomplete sampling and compute a proxy for the full uv lfs and smfs we provide in table 2 and 3 the best schechter parameters of the distribution of 1 the full uv luminosity or stellar mass ranges see the blue contours in fig 3 and 4 and 2 the uv luminosity or stellar mass range above the turnover with a fixed steep slope see the purple contours in fig 3 and 4 as we aim to understand the full lae population in the analysis conducted in the following sections we use the second fitting procedure which gives a proxy of the full distribution of laes we note nonetheless that the lly limits can have some influence on the number densities even above the turnover so when probing redshift evolution we extend the analysis to always use the same lly cut and ensure the samples are comparable see discussion in 43 the global uv lf of laes at z 2 6 we start by measuring the uv lf of the full sample of sc4k laes exploring a large volume of 108 mpc3 at z 2 6 with our large sample of 4000 laes we are capable of probing extremely bright uv luminosities down to muv 24 which even in uvcontinuum searches has typically only been reached in very wide area groundbased surveys eg bowler et al 2017 ono et al 2018 additionally we have a statistically robust sample up to muv 20 providing a robust probe in a range of 4 dex in muv with individual laes as faint as muv 17 we show in fig 5 left panel the uv lf for three subsets of sc4k laes 1 all laes 2 all laes after removing agn this is the subset we use throughout this paper see 211 3 agn laes only we show the best schechter fits to each case as 1 contours which we obtain by perturbing the luminosity bins within their poissonian errors and fitting 1000 realisations of the perturbed bins see 35 we find that the uv lf of all laes resembles a schechter distribution although there is an excess at muv 23 where the uv lf starts deviating from a schechter function a single powerlaw with bestfit log10 mpc3 071001 001 muv

faint end 22 muv 20 this trend is qualitatively similar to the one found by sobral et al 2018a for the ly lf of laes such a similar behaviour between the uv lf and ly lf is a consequence of lly and muv being typically correlated see fig 1 left panel although the complicated radiative transfer physics behind ly emission should be noted mnras 000 119 2019 evolution of the uv lf and smf of laes

2025 but only decreases by 03 dex at muv 225 this trend is qualitatively the same at all redshifts it is thus clear that a varying ly flux limit will significantly affect the uv lf as a whole both in shape and characteristic parameters with number densities being significantly more affected for fainter muv to compare uv lfs at different redshifts and interpret any evolution it is therefore necessary to ensure we use the same luminosity ranges otherwise a potential evolution in the uv lf santos et al log10 mpc3 dm1 z 25 01 z 31 04 z 39 03 z 47 02 z 54 05 full sc4k log10lly erg s1 430 z

at z 3 6 of laes may not be intrinsic but instead could be a consequence of the different ly luminosity limits as such when comparing lfs we not only compare the full samples but also compare a homogeneous subset defined by a single ly luminosity cut of log10 lly erg s1 430 which we will apply to all redshifts we choose this value as it excludes the lower lly regime which can only be reached at lower redshift or by the deep nbs and covers a luminosity regime which is probed at all redshifts ensuring we are comparing similar samples of laes while this cut will only remove a small fraction of laes from mbs at z 35 it will significantly reduce the number of sources at the lower redshifts with only 10 of nonagn laes at z 25 being above this ly cut 431 the log10 lly erg s1 430 population of laes and limitations in order to probe evolution in the same luminosity ranges we have defined a subsample of the sc4k sample of laes with log10 lly erg s1 430 at all redshifts in comparison the characteristic lly is measured to be log10 lly erg s1 4293015 011 sobral et al 2018a so these sources are extremely bright laes rare dustfree starbursts amorn et al 2017 has shown that such sources some galaxies in that study are also selected as laes in the sc4k sample are analogues of highz primeval galaxies nonetheless imposing an artificial lly limit in our samples requires some caveats as it can be seen in fig 5 right panel even for the bright muv 21 regime the lf only truly converges for log10 lly erg s1 427 with a further 0102 dex dropoff in as we move to a 10430 lly cut introducing a lly limit corresponding to a vertical cut in fig 1 introduces uncertainties in the estimation of the lfs as with a log10 lly erg s1 430 cut one can only derive the lf down to muv 21 which is comparable to muv extremely deep surveys with eg muse can address this issue by reaching faint lly even at the highest redshifts at the cost of probing lower volumes and thus not being able to fully constrain the brightest regimes a combined effort from ifu and nbmb surveys see synergycombined ly lf sobral et al 2018a can be the path to fully exploring the uv lfs of laes in this work while we show and discuss the best estimates computed for the samples with the log10 lly erg s1 430 cut as they provide a relative comparison of the same luminosity regimes we focus our baseline interpretation of evolution on the full sample with no luminosity cuts redshift evolution of the uv lf from z 2 to z 6 we will now use our sample of laes selected with 16 unique nbs and mbs in 16 well defined redshift slices to probe the evolution of the uv lf of laes from z 2 to z 6 we have shown in fig 3 the uv lf for laes selected from each of the 16 individual nb and mb filters together with bestfit schechters and 1 countours we provide all the schechter parameter estimates in table 2 all samples are well represented by schechter distributions our measurements agree well with ouchi et al 2008 at z 3 z 4 and z 57 but we report lower number densities at z 58 particularly for fainter muv this discrepancy can be explained by differences in ly flux limits as the mb that we use is only sensitive to log10 lly erg s1 430 we also note that our muv measurements are estimated from sed fitting with 30 bands including the recent ultradeep nir data from ultravista dr4 instead of directly from adjacent photometric bands for a statistically robust study of the evolution of uv lfs of laes with redshift we group laes from multiple filters that probe similar redshifts to explore five different bins of redshift z 25 z 31 z 39 z 47 and z 54 see 212 as well as the full sc4k sample the completeness corrections are applied to laes individually based on their ly luminosity see 32 and the volume per redshift bin is the sum of the volume of individual redshift slices included in the redshift bin see table 1 mnras 000 119 2019 evolution of the uv lf and smf of laes no agn  519001 000 m 1105001 001

increasing redshift muv is found to become fainter increase which mnras 000 119 2019 is the opposite of what we measure in our sample of laes before applying any luminosity cut however as previously discussed 43 different ly luminosity limits play a very significant role on the shape and characteristic parameters of the uv lf we thus conduct the same analysis for a subset of our sample of laes obtained by applying the luminosity cut of log10 lly erg s1 430 by using a uniform cut at all redshifts see fig 7 we are able to probe evolution in comparable ly luminosity regimes and reduce the effects of the ly flux limit bias but also introducing some caveats see discussion in 431 we now observe an increase of log10 mpc3 dlog10m1 z 25 01 z 31 04 z 39 03 z 47 02 z 54 05 full sc4k log10lly

the smf of laes we find little m and evolution with redshift remaining constant at log10 m m 11 and log10 mpc3 58 with increasing redshift from log10 mpc3 55 at z 25 to 45 at z 3 6 which contrasts the decrease observed in uvcontinuum selected samples we do not observe trends in muv evolution which also contrasts the increase in muv observed in uvcontinuum selected samples there is no evolution of log10 mpc3 between z 3 and z 6 but we observe a brightening between z 3 and z 5 6 which is the same trend reported by ouchi et al 2008 the global smf of laes at z 2 6 following the same methodology that we use for the uv lf we now analyse the global smf of 4000 laes at z 2 6 the study of the smf of such a large sample of laes over such a wide volume is unprecedented at these redshift ranges we have a robust sample of laes at 1090 10125 m with individual measurements down to 1075 m studies that have estimated stellar masses of z 2 galaxies typically only probe 1010 m galaxies eg schreiber et al 2015 but with our population of laes we are capable of reaching galaxies with very low stellar masses while still having detections of very massive systems 1011 m we show in fig 8 left panel the smf of the full sc4k sample of z 2 6 laes after removing agn which is what we use throughout this paper see 211 unlike the uv lf we do not explore how agns influence the smf since we are not able to accurately estimate the stellar mass of agns with our stellardust sedfitting code which does not use agn models we show the schechter fit to the smf and the 1 contour which we estimate by perturbing the stellar mass bins within their poissonian errors and fitting 1000 realisations of the perturbed bins see 35 the smf resembles a schechter distribution but with an excess in number densities at 1012 m smf with varying lly cuts here we explore how different ly luminosity limits affect the smf for the uv lf of laes we have observed that an increasing lly cut significantly affects the shape and characteristic parameters of the distribution with a more significant effect on the number density of fainter uv luminosities which are typically linked with lower ly luminosities such a trend is not necessarily expected for the smf as the relation between m and lly is very shallow if even present see fig 1 right panel we show in fig 8 right panel the smf of the full sc4k sample with varying lly cuts from 10425 to 10435 erg s1 as the stellar mass and lly have a shallow relation an increasing lly produces a much more uniform decay of the number densities over the entire stellar mass range between 10425 and 10433 erg s1 log10 mpc3 decreases by 16 dex at log10 m m 925 and by 10 dex at log10 m m 110 which is much more modest than the large difference observed for the uv lf as such when comparing smfs at different redshifts we will not only look at the full samples but we will also make use of a luminosity cut log10 lly erg s1 430 for the same reasons that we do for the uv lf see the discussion in 43 including the limitations associated with fitting a lf to our sample after applying a luminosity cut this produces a luminosity range which all filters can target and is consistent with our approach to compare uv lfs redshift evolution of the smf of laes from z 2 to we probe the evolution of the smf with redshift using 4000 laes selected in 16 well defined redshift slices from z 2 to z 6 we showed the smf of laes selected from individual filters in fig 4 together with 1 schechter contours all redshift slices resemble a schechter distribution and we provide the bestfit parameters in table 3 in order to obtain statistically robust comparisons of the evolution of the smf of laes with redshift we follow the mnras 000 119 2019 evolution of the uv lf and smf of laes

surpasses that value same grouping scheme that we use for the uv lfs we define five redshift intervals z 25 z 31 z 39 z 47 and z 54 see 212 and also use the global smf of the full z 2 6 sample the completeness corrections are applied to laes individually based on their ly luminosity see 32 and the volume per redshift bin is the sum of the volume of individual redshift slices included in the redshift bin see table 1 we show in fig 9 left panel the smf at different redshifts z 25 z 31 z 39 z 47 and z 54 without any lly cut we also show in fig 9 right panel the 1 2 and 3 contours of m we observe a clear evolution of the smf with redshift before applying any ly luminosity restriction with the low mass end shifting down by 1 dex from z 25 to z 54 this is reflected as a gradual log10 mpc3 decrease with redshift from 46 at z 25 to 58 at z 54 we measure an m increase from log10 m m 106 to 115 at the same redshift ranges the shift down to lower with increasing redshift is also observed in the smf of more typical galaxies eg muzzin et al 2013 which suggests the observed trends are qualitatively the same however an analysis using the same luminosity regime is still required as previously discussed in 46 different ly luminosity limits play a very significant role on the shape and characteristic parameters of the smf we thus conduct the same mnras 000 119 2019 analysis for a subset of our sample of laes obtained by applying the luminosity cut of log10 lly erg s1 430 by using a uniform cut at all redshifts see fig 10 we are able to probe evolution in comparable ly luminosity regimes and reduce the effects of the ly flux limit bias but also introducing some caveats see discussion in 431 for the uv lf as the limitations raised also apply to the smf while there is a clear evolution in the observed schechter fits of the full samples we find no evidence of such evolution when comparing samples of laes within the same ly regime we find little m and evolution with redshift remaining constant at log10 m m 11 and log10 mpc3 58 the evolution that we find when looking at the same luminosity regimes is thus not qualitatively the same that is observed in more typical galaxies analysis of the evolution of the stellar mass density will provide more insight into this evolution of the ly fraction we attempt to infer the ly fraction ly dependence on redshift and muv we compute the ratio between the observed uv number densities in our sample of laes and the uv number densities of lbgs from the literature lae lbg which can be interpreted as the fraction of lbgs that

2018 which we use for the redshifts z 25 z 31 z 39 z 47 and z 54 respectively for the full sc4k sample median z 41 we use the z 4 literature measurements from ono et al 2018 which being a very wide area lbg survey provides a fair comparison with our wide area lae survey to prevent any biases from fitting the ratio is computed directly from the luminosity bins in this study and the literature with the latter being interpolated to the muv values used in this study as clearly seen for the full sample in fig 5 left panel the number density of faint muv lbgs is multiple times higher than the number density of faint muv laes the number densities of muv 20 laes is 15 dex lower than lbgs but they converge to the same number densities for muv brighter than 23 we show the ratio of the two number densities in fig 11 for five redshift intervals and the full sc4k sample before and after applying a lly cut the z 25 panel shows that as we probe fainter ly luminosities we get closer to unity in the lae lbg fraction and that the effect of the ly cut depends on muv as shown in 43 for very bright muv 23 we are always able to retrieve most galaxies as muv bright are typically also ly bright see fig 1 left panel and the lae lbg will always be close to unity this holds true for all redshifts with the ratio always tending to unity at the brightest uv luminosities when comparing lae lbg at different redshifts for the comparable log10 lly erg s1 430 subsample we observe that lae lbg is typically higher at z 4 than for the lower redshift samples this may imply that laes become a bigger subset of lbgs with increasing redshift same trend found in eg arrabal haro et al 2020 but we explore this further by measuring the uv luminosity density we make a direct extrapolation of the measurements of log10 lly erg s1 430 and 425 z 25 laes to lower lly cuts by scaling the increment in lae the extrapolated values for log10 lly erg s1 420 and 410 are shown in fig 11 we find that for muv 20 at z 25 we would approach unit if we could reach log10 lly erg s1 410 we make the simple assumption that the extrapolation we predict for z 25 is valid for all redshifts as the higher flux limits of the other redshifts are not capable of reaching log10 lly erg s1 425 and thus do not allow a direct extrapolation we find that for z 3 the ratio approaches unit even for muv 21 to 22 we note that for z 4 and for the full sc4k sample the extrapolation at muv 225 can be below the mnras 000 119 2019 evolution of the uv lf and smf of laes laes lit redshift 00 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55

this is qualitatively similar to the trends found by sobral et al 2018a by integrating ly lfs 410 redshift evolution of the stellar mass density of z 2 6 laes using our bestderived fits table 3 we estimate the stellar mass density m of our laes at different redshifts by integrating the smfs in the range we obtain m using the procedure described in 36 we provide our m measurements in table 4 in fig 13 we show our m measurements and compare them with measurements from the literature the observed m without applying any luminosity cuts changes from log10 m m mpc3 61 at z 25 to 55 at z 5 6 by applying the consistent log10 lly erg s1 430 cut the estimated m of our lae sample remains roughly constant with redshift at log10 m m mpc3 55 we compare our results with measurements from the

mortlock et al 2015 muzzin et al 2013 reddy et al 2012 santini et al 2012 song et al 2016 and tomczak et al 2014 the m measurements of typical populations of galaxies from the literature indicate a decrease from log10 m m mpc3 75 at z 25 to 65 at z 5 6 this implies that galaxies selected as laes always have low stellar mass densities and as we move to higher redshifts their properties become similar to the ones derived from more typical populations of galaxies suggesting that with an increasing redshift more galaxies become laelike the ratio between the stellar mass densities for the log10 lly erg s1 430 population and the values from the literature decreases from 0005 at z 25 to  005 at z 5 6 we extrapolate the ratio between the stellar mass densities of log10 lly erg s1 430 laes and lbgs and determine it tends to unity at z 10 this implies that these bright laes contribute very significantly to the total stellar mass density during the epoch of reionisation highlighting the importance of laes to the evolution of primeval galaxies in the early universe conclusions in this work we determine the uv luminosity functions lfs and stellar mass functions smfs of 4000 laes from the sc4k sample at z 2 6 our main results are  muv and lly are typically correlated muv 1602  4712 03 log10 lly erg s 11 in our sample of laes the relation between m and lly is shallower log10 m m 0901  2838 01 log10 lly erg s  different lly limits significantly affect the shape and normalisation of the uv lf and smf of laes an increasing lly cut predominantly reduces the number density of lower stellar masses and faint uv luminosities more significantly for the uv lf we estimate a proxy for the full uv lf and smf of laes making simple assumptions of fitting range and faint end slope  for the uv lf of laes we find a characteristic number density decrease from log10 mpc3 35 at z 2 4 to 45 at z 5 6 and a brightening of characteristic uv luminosity muv from 206 to 218 at the same redshift ranges  for the smf of laes we measure a decline of with increasing redshift from log10 mpc3 46 at z 25 to 58 at z 54 and a characteristic stellar mass m m increase from log10 m m 106 to 115 at the same redshift ranges  we apply uniform luminosity cut log10 lly erg s1 430 to our entire sample producing a subsample of rare bright primeval galaxies we find a more moderate to no evolution of the uv lf and smf of this subsample indicating that the trends computed for the full samples may be driven by differences in the luminosity cuts this highlights the importance of obtaining deep highz studies with eg muse  we compute lae lbg proxy of ly which tends to unity with increasing muv at all redshifts as bright laes are typically also bright in muv for fainter laes the ratio tends to one as we reach fainter ly fluxes with a simple extrapolation implying that by reaching log10 lly erg s1 410 we would approach unit for muv 20 galaxies at z 25  the luminosity density uv shows moderate evolution from 10252 erg s1 hz1 mpc3 at z 25 to 10250 erg s1 hz1 mpc3 at z 5 6 and the stellar mass density m decreases from 1061 to 1055 m mpc3 at the same redshifts both uv and m are found to always be lower than the total luminosity and stellar densities of continuumselected galaxies but slowly approaching it with increasing redshift overall we find our measurements reveal a uv and m of laes that slowly approach the measurements of continuumselected galaxies at z 6 pointing to the very significant role of laes in the epoch of reionisation acknowledgements we thank the anonymous referee
