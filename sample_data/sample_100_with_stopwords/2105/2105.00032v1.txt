abstract by harnessing quantum phenomena quantum devices have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts here we examine using wave function symmetry as a resource to enhance the performance of a quantum otto engine previous work has shown that a bosonic working medium can yield better performance than a fermionic medium we expand upon this work by incorporating a singular interaction that allows the effective symmetry to be tuned between the bosonic and fermionic limits in this framework the particles can be treated as anyons subject to haldanes generalized exclusion

originally developed as a physical theory for the purpose of optimizing the performance of largescale devices namely steam engines 1 despite these practicallyfocused origins thermodynamics has proven enormously successful in formulating universal statements such as the second law with the growing prominence of quantum technologies the field of quantum thermodynamics has emerged to understand how the framework of thermodynamics can be extended to quantum systems 2 one of the principal goals of quantum thermodynamics is to discover how quantum features such as entanglement superposition and coherence can be best leveraged to optimize the performance of quantum devices in the tradition of thermodynamics the analysis of quantum heat engines have provided one of the primary tools for exploring how quantum effects change the thermodynamic behavior of a system a nonexhaustive list of literature analyzing quantum thermal machine performance includes works examining the role of

shortcuts to adiabaticity 712132934 efficiency and power statistics 3537 and comparisons between classical and quantum machines 223840 implementations have been proposed in a wide variety of systems including harmonically confined single ions 41 magnetic systems 42 atomic clouds 43 transmon qubits 44 optomechanical systems 4546 and quantum dots 4748 quantum heat engines have been experimental implemented using nanobeam oscillators 49 atomic collisions 50 and twolevel ions 51 a notable feature of quantum particles is that they are truly indistinguishable to account for this the wave function of a multiparticle state is constructed out of the symmetric for bosons or antisymmetric for fermions superposition of the single particle states this wave function symmetry has physical consequences in terms of state occupancy with any number of bosons allowed to occupy the same quantum state while fermions are restricted to single occupancy the famous pauli exclusion principle the superposition arising from 2 of 15 the symmetrization requirements also leads to interference effects that manifest as exchange forces in the form of an effective attraction between bosons and effective repulsion between fermions 52 wave function symmetry leads to quantum modifications of thermodynamic behavior allowing for more work to be extracted from indistinguishable particles through mixing 53 or as the working medium of a quantum heat engine 245456 in ref56 we showed that for a working medium of two noninteracting identical particles a harmonic quantum otto engine exhibits enhanced performance if the particles are bosons and reduced performance if they are fermions in this paper we expand upon these results by introducing an interaction proportional to the inverse square of the interparticle distance in addition to the standard harmonic potential this model is often referred to as the singular 57 or isotonic oscillator 58 this potential is of particular interest as it provides the basis for the calogerosutherland model 5960 a system known to host generalized exclusion statistics ges anyons 6162 in the framework of ges the pauli exclusion principle is generalized to allow for a continuum of state occupancy from the single occupancy allowed to fermions up to the infinite state occupancy allowed to bosons 61 in the calogerosutherland model this anyonic behavior arises from tuning the interparticle interaction strength effectively interpolating between the bosonic and fermionic exchange forces 62 we determine a closed form for the thermal state density matrix for two particles in the singular oscillator potential by mapping to an equivalent system of statistical anyons 24 consisting of a statistical mixture of bosons and fermions we determine the timedependent internal energy while varying the oscillator potential we then analyze a quantum otto cycle demonstrating performance that interpolates between the bosonic and fermionic of ref 56 as the interaction strength parameter is changed 2 the twoparticle singular oscillator we begin by outlining the model notation and previous results from the literature that are central to our analysis we use the following hamiltonian for two particles in a singular oscillator potential 6263 p1 2 p2 2 h 1  m 2 x1 2 x2 2 2mx1 x2 2 where the parameter quantifies the strength of the interparticle interaction following calogeros original approach 59 we rewrite this hamiltonian in the center of mass and relative coordinate frame using the momentum coordinate transformations p p1 p1 p p1 p1 2 and the position coordinate transformations x x1 x1 2 x x1 x1 with this transformation we can solve the dynamics of the center of mass and relative coordinates separately hcm  m 2 x2 2m 2 hrel h 1  2 x2 2 2 4x2 where m 2m and m2 we see that the center of mass hamilton is identical to that of an unperturbed harmonic oscillator for a single particle of mass 2m while the relative motion hamiltonian is identical to that of a singular oscillator with a single particle of mass m2 note that this approach is very commonly applied when solving the dynamics of classical interacting oscillator systems 64 3 of 15 the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of eq 2 are well known and those of eq 3 have been determined directly 5859 using operator methods 65 and as a generalization of the morse potential 57 the eigenfunctions are rel x  1 12 x exp ln12 x2 n 12 with the corresponding eigenenergies erel  h 2n where n 0 1 2 and ln x is the generalized laguerre polynomial 66 for indistinguishable quantum particles the total wave function must remain symmetric under particle exchange for bosons and antisymmetric for fermions in the center of mass and relative coordinate framework the symmetry condition is satisfied by rel x rel x for bosons and rel x rel x for fermions 60 examining eq 4 we see that the parity depends on the value of the interaction strength parameter noting the relationship between the generalized laguerre and hermite polynomials 67 12 2 h2n x 1n 22n n l h2n1 x 1n 22n1 n x l12 n x along with the gamma function identity 66 2n 4 n we see that for 0 eq 4 becomes rel 22n 2n h2n similarly for 1 eq 4 becomes rel x p 22n1 2n 1 h2n1 equations 8 and 9 correspond to the relative motion wave functions for two bosons and two fermions in a pure harmonic potential respectively note that the restriction of eq 8 to even and eq 9 to odd hermite polynomials ensures that the proper exchange symmetry conditions are satisfied this demonstrates that particles in the singular oscillator potential can be treated as anyons obeying generalized exclusion statistics 61 with as the parameter that controls the nature of the particle statistics this behavior was first established by murthy and shankar in the context of the thermodynamics of the calogerosutherland model 62 3 singular oscillator thermal state the equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of the twoparticle singular oscillator can be determined from the canonical partition function z trexp h 4 of 15 noting h hcm hrel the partition function can be split into the product of individual partition functions for the center of mass and relative motion the center of mass partition function can be found straightforwardly in the energy representation using the harmonic oscillator eigenenergies zcm exp ecm n 0 exp h2 exp exp  h 1 n 0 we can find the relative partition function using eq 5 zrel exp erel n 0 exp h 32 exp exp2h 1 n 0 the total canonical partition function is then z zcm zrel exp h 2 exp h 1exp h 12 equation 13 can be identified as a product of bosonic and fermionic contributions to this end note that the partition functions for two bosons and two fermions in a harmonic potential are 24 zb exp2h exp h 1exp h 12 and zf exp h  14 exp h 1exp h 12 and therefore we can express the singular oscillator partition function 13 as z zb 1 zf this agrees with the partition function determined by murthy and shankar for the calogerosutherland model 62 and that of a statistical mixture of bosons and fermions in a harmonic potential using the framework of statistical anyons 24 a fuller thermodynamic picture arises from the equilibrium thermal density matrix this can be determined in position representation using  x y n 0 exp en n x n y the density matrix for the center of mass motion is given by the known thermal state of the quantum harmonic oscillator 68 cm x y mcsch h zcm  exp  x y tanh  x y coth the density matrix for the relative motion can be found in closed form by combining eqs 4 and 16 and applying the hardyhille formula 69 2 xyt  x yt exp  n 1 n n  xyt2 1 t n 0 5 of 15 where i x is the modified bessel function of the first kind 66 this yields rel x y csch h xy zrel 2h x2 y2 coth h i 1  exp xy csch h the total thermal state density matrix in the position representation can then be determined from the simple cartesian product of cm and rel eqs 17 and 19 respectively  x y x y cm x y rel x y 4 singular oscillator dynamics with the equilibrium behavior of the two particle singular oscillator established we next consider the evolution of the system for a timedependent parameterization of the frequency  t as in the case of the thermal state we will treat the dynamics of the relative and center of mass motion separately the dynamics of the center of mass coordinate described by eq 2 are that of the wellstudied timedependent parametric harmonic oscillator 70 the time evolved state can be determined using the path integral formulation by applying the appropriate propagator cm x y t dx0 dy0 ucm x x0 t cm x0 y0 0 ucm y y0 t where ucm x x0 t is given by 70 ucm x x0 t exp  t x 2xx0 wt x0 2ihzt 2hzt zt and wt are timedependent solutions to the classical harmonic oscillator equation of motion zt t2 zt 0 with initial conditions z0 0 0 1 and w0 1 0 0 the dynamics of the relative coordinate described by eq 3 are that of the timedependent parametric singular oscillator the corresponding propagator for this hamiltonian has also been determined exactly 7174 m xx0 mxx0 j12 urel x x0 t exp i 12  t x2 wt x02 24 hzt 2hzt 2hzt where j x denotes the bessel function of the first kind 66 and zt and wt are the same as in eq 23 as in the center of mass case the time evolved density matrix for the relative motion is given by rel x y t dx0 dy0 urel x x0 t rel x0 y0 0 urel y y0 t while the integrals in eq 21 can be carried out analytically 7577 the product of bessel functions in eq 25 makes determining a closedform expression for general values of difficult to determine an analytical expression for the timeevolved state we instead turn to the framework of statistical anyons 24 in ref 24 we showed that the behavior of a pair of particles in a noninteracting statistical mixture of boson and fermion pairs is on average fully equivalent to that of interacting 6 of 15 particles obeying generalized exclusion statistics in this framework the generalized exclusion statistics parameter is equivalent to the probability that a given pair of particles in the statistical mixture are fermions pf 24 in the context of this work this means that we can exactly map the behavior of particles in a singular oscillator potential to the average behavior of a statistical mixture of bosons and fermions in a harmonic oscillator potential using this mapping the singular oscillator density matrix is given by  x1 x2 y1 y2 t 1 pf har x1 x2 y1 y2 t pf har x1 x2 y1 y2 t where har x1 x2 y1 y2 t and har x1 x2 y1 y2 t are the time evolved states for two noninteracting bosons and fermions in a harmonic potential respectively the full expressions were determined in ref 56 and are provided in appendix a for completeness note that in eq 21 we have switched back into the individual particle frame recalling that the generalized exclusion statistics parameter for the singular oscillator is given by the interaction strength 62 we have the relation pf the timedependent average energy can be determined in the usual manner h ht i tr x1 x2 y1 y2 t ht using eq 26 this becomes h ht i 1 h hhar i h hhar i in ref 56 we found h hhar i and h hhar i to be h hhar i ht q 3coth h0 csch h0 1 and ht q 3coth h0 csch h0 1 where q is a dimensionless parameter that measures the degree of adiabaticity of the evolution 70 1 h 2 2 2 0 t zt t2 t2 wt2 t2 20 t h hhar i for a perfectly adiabatic stroke q 1 and in general q 1 4170 by combining eqs 28  30 we find ht h ht i q 3 coth 0 h csch 0 h 2 1 note that h ht i t 0 q h h0 i where h h0 i is the internal energy of the equilibrium thermal state which can be determined from eq 13 using h h0 i ln z this expression for h ht i agrees with the result of ref 54 which determined the time dependent average energy of the singular oscillator using the scale invariance of the potential 5 the quantum otto cycle the quantum otto cycle like its classical counterpart consists of four strokes 1 isentropic compression 2 isochoric heating 3 isentropic expansion and 4 isochoric cooling 7 of 15 for our working medium of two particles confined within a singular oscillator the isentropic strokes consist of increasing the oscillator frequency for compression and decreasing it for expansion during an isentropic stroke the state of the working medium evolves unitarily with constant von neumann entropy thus fulfilling the isentropic condition this is notably different from the classical otto cycle in which the isentropic strokes are thermodynamically adiabatic and reversible for the quantum cycle the finite time unitary strokes are not generally adiabatic ie in accordance with the quantum adiabatic theorem and thus subject to quantum friction in the form of nonadiabatic excitations to other energy states 2 the isochoric strokes consist of coupling the working medium to a hot cold bath to increase decrease the energy of the system while holding the oscillator frequency constant we make the standard assumption that the thermalization time is sufficiently short such that the working medium has achieved a state of thermal equilibrium with the bath by the end of each isochoric strokes which removes the need to explicitly model the systembath interaction 121524293241567879 the cycle is illustrated graphically in fig 1 hhi latexit

figure 1 energyfrequency diagram of a quantum otto cycle we consider a linear driving protocol for duration such that the time dependence of the frequency is given by t 12 t 02 for the compression stroke and for the expansion stroke note that for this driving protocol eq 23 can be solved analytically and yields solutions in terms of the airy functions 75 to determine the average heat and work exchanged during each stroke we use the following method we determine the internal energy at the beginning of the compression stroke point a in the cycle from a thermal equilibrium state with the cold bath then using eq 32 we determine the internal energy at the end of the compression stroke point b the change in internal energy between a and b gives the average work done on the system w1 we can find the the internal energy at point c using the thermal equilibrium state with the hot bath the change in internal energy between c and b gives the average heat exchanged with the hot bath q2 again applying eq 32 we find the internal energy at the end of 8 of 15 the expansion stroke point d the change in internal energy between c and d gives the average work done by the system w2 finally we can then use the difference in internal energy between points d and a to find the average heat exchanged with the cold bath q4 with the average work and heat for each stroke in hand we can then calculate the efficiency from the ratio of the total work to the heat input and the power from the ratio of total work to the cycle time hw1 i hw3 i h q2 i and hw1 i hw3 i cyc we consider isentropic strokes of equal duration 1 3 as we do not explicitly model the systembath interaction we represent the duration of the isochoric strokes as a multiplicative factor of the isentropic stroke duration thus we can represent the total cycle time as cyc 2 the full expressions for the efficiency and power are cumbersome and detailed in appendix b in fig 2 we plot the engine efficiency as a function of the ratio of bath temperatures confirming the results of ref 56 we see that the efficiency is greatest in the noninteracting bosonic limit of 0 and least in the noninteracting fermionic limit of 1 between these limits we observe that increasing the interaction strength from zero to one interpolates the efficiency smoothly between the bosonic and fermionic bounds in fig 3 we plot the engine efficiency as a function of the stroke time again we see that 0 provides the greatest efficiency and 1 the worst with intermediate values of falling between these limits we see that increasing the stroke time results in increasing efficiency approaching the bound of  1 0 achieved in the limit of perfectly adiabatic strokes q 1 we note that in the limit of long stroke times the efficiency converges to this limit for all values of this indicates that the influence of the interaction on the engine performance is a fundamentally nonequilibrium effect the oscillatory behavior of the efficiency arises from the form of q for the linear protocol 030 025 020 015 010 005 thottcold figure 2 efficiency as a function of the bath temperature ratio for 0 blue dashed 12 red solid and 1 green dotdashed parameters are 0 1 next we examine the power output of the engine as a function of the ratio of bath temperatures as shown in fig 4 as with the efficiency we see that the bosonic limit 0 gives the greatest power output and the fermionic limit 1 gives the least intermediate values of fall between these bounds in fig 5 we plot the power as a function of the stroke time as in the case of the efficiency we see that the shift in the power output arising from the interaction vanishes as the stroke time increases 9 of 15 figure 3 efficiency as a function of the stroke time for 0 blue dashed 12 red solid and  1 green dotdashed parameters are 0 tc 1 th 4 3 thottcold figure 4 power as a function of the bath temperature ratio for 0 blue dashed 12 red solid and 1 green dotdashed parameters are 0 1 examining both efficiency and power plots we observe that the zeroes for efficiency and power all occur at finite values of the bath temperature ratio or stroke time these zeroes mark the transition to the parameter regimes where the cycle no longer satisfies the conditions h q2 i 0 h q4 i 0 and hw1 i hw3 i hwtot i 0 where we use the convention that work or heat flowing into the system is positive these are known as the positive work conditions and must be met for the cycle to function as an engine in the parameter regimes where the positive work conditions are not satisfied efficiency and power are no longer meaningful metrics of performance in these regimes the cycle functions instead as a heater accelerator or refrigerator in a heater work is put into the system to induce heat flow into both baths h q2 i 0 h q4 i 0 hwtot i 0 in an accelerator work is put into the system to enhance the flow of heat from the hot to the cold bath h q2 i 0 h q4 i 0 hwtot i 0 lastly in a refrigerator work is put into the system to induce heat flow from the cold to the hot bath h q2 i 0 h q4 i 0 hwtot i 0 we note that the values of the bath temperature ratio and stroke time for which the system transitions out of the engine regime vary for different values of to further explore this relationship in fig 6 we show the parameter space under which the cycle functions as 10 of 15 thottcold thottcold thottcold figure 6

see that for short stroke times 0 displays the smallest heater and accelerator regimes and the largest engine regime while 0 displays the largest heater and accelerator regimes and the smallest engine regime intermediate values of fall between these limits in general we see that as cycle time increases the heater and accelerator regimes vanish as do the differences in the parameter space for the different values of 6 discussion in this work we have analyzed the performance of a quantum otto engine with a working medium of two particles in a singular oscillator potential including the efficiency power output and parameter regimes where the cycle functions as different types of thermal machines we have determined the full timedependent dynamics using the framework of statistical anyons and shown that by changing the strength of the interparticle interaction we can interpolate between the performance of bosonic and fermionic working mediums we see that impact of the singular interaction on the engine performance vanishes for long stroke times as the engine approaches fully adiabatic performance indicating that the performance differences are a fundamentally nonequilibrium phenomena introducing a timedependent interaction strength would open up the possibility of optimizing performance by varying 11 of 15 the behavior of the particles between that of bosons and fermions during the engine cycle however we leave this as a topic to be explored in future work the calogerosutherland model described by eq 1 has received extensive study in the context of generalized exclusion statistics and due to its direct connection to spinchain models such as the haldaneshastry chain 8083 which provide a promising route for experimental realization in trapped atom systems 8487 such systems may provide a means of experimentally implementing a singular quantum heat engine furthermore generalized exclusion statistics anyons can be used to replicate the thermodynamic behavior of fractional exchange statistics anyons that manifest in twodimensional systems 24 such anyons are highly sought after due to their close relationship to nonableian anyons which may be used to implement faulttolerant topological quantum computers 88 using the wellestablished framework of heat engines to understand the thermodynamic behavior of systems that display intermediate statistics
