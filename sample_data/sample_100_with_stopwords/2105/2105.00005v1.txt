haiman1 arxiv210500005v1 astrophhe 30 apr 2021 1 department of astronomy columbia university new york ny 10027 usa accepted xxx received yyy in original form zzz abstract the legacy survey of space and time lsst by the vera c rubin observatory is expected to discover tens of millions of quasars a significant fraction of these could be powered by coalescing massive black hole mbh binaries since many quasars are believed to be triggered by mergers we show that under plausible assumptions about the luminosity functions lifetimes and binary fractions of quasars we expect the full lsst quasar catalogue to contain between 20100 million compact mbh binaries with masses m 1059 m redshifts z 0 6 and orbital periods p 1 70 days their lightcurves are expected to be distinctly periodic which can be confidently distinguished from stochastic rednoise variability because lsst will cover dozens or even hundreds of cycles a very small subset of 10150 ultracompact p  1 day binary quasars among these will over 515 years evolve into the mhz gravitationalwave gw frequency band and can be detected by lisa they can therefore be regarded as lisa verification binaries analogous to shortperiod galactic compactobject binaries the practical question is how to find these handful of needles in the haystack among the large number of quasars this will likely require a tailored coadding analysis optimised for this purpose key words quasars general galaxies active gravitational waves 1 introduction the laser interferometer space antenna lisa amaroseoane et al 2017 is currently planned for launch in the mid 2030s and is expected to discover gravitational waves gws from coalescing massive black hole mbh binaries with component masses 104 107 m out to high redshifts it has been widely recognised that detecting the electromagnetic em emission from these binaries in addition to their gws will enable a significant range of novel science investigations ranging from a better understanding accretion onto bhs to the connection between mbhs and their host galaxies and to new tests of general relativity baker et al 2019 the em emission from a lisa source could be searched for in followup observations to lisa events or possibly by em observations during the late inspiral stage triggered by a lisa alert kocsis et al 2008 this is different from the situation for galactic whitedwarf binaries for which several are now known that will be detectable by lisa the socalled verification binaries see burdge et al 2020 and references therein here we suggest that mbh binaries detectable by lisa may also be identified prior to lisas launch among the large number of active galactic nuclei agn expected to be catalogued by the vera c rubin observatorys legacy survey of space and time lsst since most major galaxies contain nuclear mbhs kormendy ho 2013 and in hierarchical structure formation galaxies are built up via mergers pairs of mbhs should be commonly found in galactic nuclei mbhs are expected to rapidly sink to the nucleus of the new galaxy and form a gravitationally bound binary begelman et al 1980 furthermore torques during galaxy mergers are understood  2020 the authors to drive gas to the nucleus of the new galaxy barnes hernquist 1991 and bright and relatively shortlived quasar phases can be triggered by mergers kauffmann haehnelt 2000 alexander hickox 2012 the association between galaxy mergers and agn activity is also supported by observation goulding et al 2018 over the past decade hydrodynamical simulations of binary bhs with circumbinary discs have reached the consensus that a binary can continue accreting efficiently from the disc via narrow collimated gas streams essentially at the same rate as a single mbh would dorazio et al 2013 farris et al 2014 shi krolik 2015 miranda et al 2017 moreover efficient accretion has been shown to persist all the way to merger farris et al 2015 tang et al 2018 bowen et al 2018 2019 the lightcurves of mbhbs can therefore be expected to be as bright as quasars but should contain significant periodicities due either to hydrodynamical modulations of the accretion rate as shown in the above simulations andor due to relativistic doppler and lensing modulations of the apparent flux bogdanovi et al 2011 dorazio et al 2015 haiman 2017 dorazio di stefano 2018 as a result mbh binaries may be identifiable in timedomain agn surveys as a population of periodic quasars haiman et al 2009 in recent years significant effort has indeed been invested to find periodic quasars in large timedomain quasar catalogues eg in the catalina realtime transient survey crts graham et al 2015 the palomar transient factory ptf charisi et al 2016 and in a joint analysis of the dark energy survey and the sloan digital sky survey dessdss chen et al 2020 see the recent review by de rosa et al 2019 for a more complete summary these efforts have identified 200 periodic candidates among xin haiman o 105 quasars with bh masses of 1089 m and putative periods ranging from several months to a few years this roughly matches expectations massive binary bhs are expected to spend o 105 years at periodicities of order a year if their orbital decay is driven either by gw emission or by negative torques exerted by the surrounding gas disc on the viscous timescale haiman et al 2009 if quasars typically live for a few 107 years martini schneider 2004 then we might expect a fraction of few 103 to be in this stage the lsst is expected to deliver a revolutionary large sample of at least tens of millions of quasars each with wellsampled lightcurves at high cadence ie every few days these two novel characteristics will allow a search for mbh binaries with much shorterperiods which are correspondingly much rarer in this paper we suggest that it may be possible to identify ultrashortperiod mbh binaries in the lsst quasar catalogue which are so compact that they will chirp ie evolve in frequency into the mhz gw band where lisa can subsequently detect them several years later if so these sources would be the massive bh analogues of the galactic verification binaries we will argue that this is possible under plausible assumptions about the luminosity functions lifetimes and binary fractions of quasars in particular if i the faint of end of the quasar luminosity function is steep and can be extrapolated down luminosities corresponding to bh masses of 105 m ii most quasars are associated with merging mbh binaries and iii quasar lifetimes are relatively short  10 years then we expect the lssts quasar catalogue to contain several such ultracompact mbh binaries with periods  day most of these verification binaries will lie below lssts singlesnapshot flux detection threshold and identifying them will likely require coadding individual snapshots in an optimised way the rest of this paper is organised as follows in 2 we discuss our basic methodology which consists of adopting a quasar luminosity function 21 computing the corresponding lsst quasar number counts 22 and considering detectability by lisa 23 in 3 we present our main results ie the expected number of lisadetectable mbh binaries among the lsst quasars as well as how these results depend on the assumed quasar lifetime and typical binary mass ratio in 4 we further discuss several caveats and implications of our results including the requirements for coadding lsst data and folding quasar lightcurves finally our conclusions are summarised in 5 day periods will evolve into the mhz gw band where they can be discovered by lisa after accumulating sufficient signaltonoise ratio to find potential lisa detections of ultrashortperiod quasars in lsst we first estimate the number of binary quasars in lsst and then employ the most uptodate lisa sensitivity curve from robson et al 2019 we record a complete set of acceptable orbital periods within the lisa frequency band finally we compute the number of binaries detectable by lisa that is obtained from a simple relationship between the binary merger time and the total quasar lifetime 21 quasar luminosity functions the number of luminous quasars is given directly by the quasar luminosity function qlf quasars are considered to be produced by accretion onto massive black holes at the centres of galaxies lyndenbell 1969 and their activity is thought to be often triggered by the merger of two galaxies delivering fuel to the nucleus activating accretion eg barnes hernquist 1991 quasar lfs can therefore be used to determine the abundance of mbhs at different cosmological redshifts since both merging galaxies triggering the quasar activity are believed to typically contain nuclear mbhs a large fraction of quasars could contain binary mbhs eg haiman et al 2009 dotti et al 2015 over the last few decades a large amount of work has gone into understanding the shape and evolution of the qlfs throughout cosmic history in this paper we have chosen to use the qlfs reported in kulkarni et al 2019 hereafter k19 for several reasons k19 is based on a recent comprehensive compilation implementing qlfs from a large homogenised agn sample across a wide range of redshifts up to z7 their lfs are also conveniently given in the form of simple broken powerlaws as a function of absolute magnitude with the bandpass conversions from apparent optical magnitudes to absolute magnitude explicitly provided ie their fig2 this latter feature is especially convenient since it allows us to directly use them to compute the number of quasars expected to be observed by lsst above a given apparent magnitude threshold1 as mentioned above k19 use a double powerlaw pl to fit the space density of quasars versus apparent magnitude there are four parameters that define the double pl which vary as functions of redshift 2 method the efforts in large surveys of active galactic nuclei agn including bright quasars have been growing remarkably in the last few decades this is reflected not only in the significant expansion of quasar samples up to a size of a million sources flesch 2019 but also in the depth of individual surveys see compilation in kulkarni et al 2019 the upcoming lsst will offer a major improvement in the observations of quasars in survey area and depth as well as in variability information with the lightcurves of most sources sampled at high cadence of order days over several years lsst science collaboration et al 2009 ivezi et al 2019 in this section we introduce the quasar luminosity functions we use to approximate the number of quasars that lsst is expected discover a fraction of variable quasars in lsst might be compact massive black hole binaries mbhbs produced in mergers which triggered the quasar activity kauffmann haehnelt 2000 haiman et al 2009 and emitting gravitational waves gws prior to their coalescence a small subset of these objects ie those with ultrashort submnras 000 111

as reported in k19 at 25 different redshifts are shown in figure 1 the normalisation is roughly constant with redshift between 0 z 3 and then decreases sharply by 3 orders of magnitude by z 5 the break magnitude m decreases monotonically between 0 z 7  the brightend and the faintend slopes both show a general trend to steepen with redshift with visible discrepancies around z 23 shown by empty circles as explained in k19 compared with the relatively smooth evolution of other parameters the sharp this is unlike the case for the large majority of other qlf determinations in the literature eg shen et al 2020 and references therein which quote qlfs only as a function of absolute magnitude or luminosity which would make it necessary for us to undo the band flux luminosity computations in those works log mag 1cmpc 3 faintend slope z110 z150 z198 19 21 z245 30 19 21 z295 figure 1 double powerlaw parameters in the quasar luminosity function as a function of redshift clockwise from upper

figure 2 double powerlaw quasar luminosity functions lfs in 9 different redshift bins with central values as indicated in each panel the fiducial results from k19 are reproduced by the dashed curves our lfs with the four parameters interpolated smoothly across different redshifts are shown by the solid curves the red circles and their error bars represent the binned agn data used in k19 the regions in shade blue indicate the upper and lower uncertainties in lfs obtained from interpolating the error bars in figure 1 22 the number of shortperiod quasars in lsst steepening of at z 25 and dramatic flattening near this redshift are likely unphysical and instead indicate a mismatch between the boss and sdss2slaq surveys due to systematic errors induced by their selection functions likewise the outliers at low redshift z 06 also shown as empty circles result from uncertainties in the correction for host galaxy light and potentially missed agn in extended sources as a result we follow k19 who excluded these points from fitting parametric redshiftdependent qlfs and also neglect these points ie all open circles in our fiducial analysis instead we interpolate the remaining reliable points solid circles fig 1 and obtain values of each parameter as smooth functions of redshift specifically we fit 2nd and 3rd order polynomials to the solid circles in the top panels from left to right and straight lines in the bottom panels we find that using higherorder polynomials is not warranted we demonstrate the qlfs obtained from these fits in 9 randomly selected redshift bins between 01 z 6 with bins centred at z 031 050 110 150 198 245 295 388 492 and widths z 0204 these redshift bins are adopted from table 2 in k19 and can be used to compare our qlfs to theirs as shown in figure 2 we compare the double pls with parameters found in k19 dashed and those with our newly interpolated parameters solid as functions of absolute uv magnitude at restframe 1450 we also colour the uncertainty regions in each panel in blue using the interpolated upper and lower errors shown in figure 1 while k19 base their analysis on a large compilation of agn samples from different surveys each sample is categorised into smaller magnitude bins we superimpose the binned agn data in red where the shape of the lf is directly measured and thus more reliable than at either fainter or brighter magnitudes where they are extrapolated the interpolated curves show a larger degree of continuity in both the bright and the faint end slopes across different redshift as mentioned above the rubin observatorys lsst is expected to discover a large number of quasars an early estimate for these numbers which fold in the expected completeness as a function of redshift and apparent magnitude indicate that 20 million quasars in total can be identified in singleexposure images lsst science collaboration et al 2009 this number is estimated by integrating the quasar lf eg eq 1 over the desired magnitude and redshift intervals the predictions in lsst science collaboration et al 2009 were based on the earlier qlf determinations by hopkins et al 2007 here we recompute the number of quasars in a magnitude and redshift range n n m min m max z min zmax we convert the absolute uv magnitude m1450 to apparent iband magnitude allowing us to relate the mass of the black holes to their observed abundance we adopt the bandpass kcorrections from k19 who in turn adopt it from lusso et al 2015 shown in their fig 2 which conveniently directly converts m1450 to apparent imag n m min m max z min zmax is then given by  mmax  zmax dz f m zm1450 m z mmin zmin where f m z is the selection function characterising the completeness ie the fraction of selected agns to the true number of agns in a certain volume and magnitude range the selection function needs to account for all of the ways that agns are identified in lsst ie via colours the lack of proper motion variability and combinations with other multiwavelength surveys lsst science collaboration et al 2009 in general this makes selection complex with f a function of the magnitude and redshift ranging from 0 to 1 in this analysis we approximate f m z as a step function with f 0 at magnitudes above fainter than a threshold m i and f 1 for brighter quasars mnras 000 111 2020 xin haiman 106 imag 16 imag 17 imag 18 imag 19 imag 20

integrating the lf between redshifts 0 z 6 and imagnitudes 16 m 24 ie adopting a threshold m i 24 we find n 20 million quasars in total extending the magnitude limit it m i 26 the number increases to 100 million in figure 3 we show our prediction of n in 11 different imagnitude bins obtained numerically be evaluating n at 50 evenly separated values of z for each m i for reference we again show a comparison with predictions based on k19s original qlf determinations dashed curves and also the number counts from lssts science book blue dotdashed curves the predictions generally agree with those by lsst especially at the redshifts most relevant to possible lisa detections z 23 see below the vertical shaded orange bands in this figure shows the redshift ranges covered by the agn samples used to fit the qlfs redshifts outside these bands represent extrapolations for the rest of the analysis we assume that the majority of the quasars are associated with massive black hole binary mergers more generally the number of binaries throughout this paper simply scales linearly with the fraction of quasars fqb associated with coalescing black holes we further assume that the last stages of the mbh binary merger falls within the bright quasar phase this is justified by the the expected availability of gas in the nuclei of mergerremnant mnras 000 111 2020 galaxies and by recent hydrodynamical simulations of inspiralling mbhs with circumbinary discs farris et al 2015 tang et al 2018 bowen et al 2018 these studies found that while the coalescing binary creates a lowdensity central cavity in the accretion disc the mbhs can nevertheless be fuelled efficiently all the way to their merger via minidiscs fed by narrow accretion streams finally we assume that quasars typically have a total lifetime of tq few 107 years independent of redshift and luminosity and that they spend a duration of t p at orbital period p under these assumptions the number of quasars with orbital periods p is given approximately by n p t pt q fqb n the time t p that a mbh binary spends at period p for the compact binaries of interest for lisa is determined by its gw emission and depends on the bh masses to translate the apparent imagnitude into the total mass of binary bhs we need to assume a quasar luminosity bh mass relation note that the masses relevant for lisa are between 105 and 109 m with lowermass binaries dominating the majority of the population eg klein et al 2016 and references therein we adopt the relationship between imagnitude and total bh mass mbh based on a typical quasar spectral energy distribution and a bolometric quasar luminosity l fedd l edd where l edd is the eddington luminosity for mass mbh haiman et al 2009 m i 24 25 log fedd mbh 3 106 m  1 d l z 2 d l z 2 where d l z is the luminosity distance to redshift z with this definition we compute the distribution of the number of massive bbhs in 50 mass bins evenly distributed across 1059 m in logspace and 50 redshift bins evenly distributed over 0 z 6 therefore our mbh binary counts are tabulated on a 5050 grid in the mbh z plane periodic quasars in lsst as future lisa sources 23 detection by lisa 8 23 g 53 mc 53 23 fr 1012 c4 r z here mc q1 q 2 35 mbh is the chirp mass fr 1 z fobs is the restframe gw frequency and fobs 2p is the observed gw frequency with p the binarys observed period we assume for simplicity that the orbit of the mbhb is circular as expected in the lisa band muoz et al 2019 zrake et al 2021 and that it decays due to gw emission which should be a good assumption at the very small separations considered here eg haiman et al 2009 the rate of change in restframe frequency can be expressed as 96 83 g 53 mc 53 fr 113 fr 5c5 sn 5year lisa lifetime m1107 m q01 m1106 m q01 to decide which mbh binaries can be detectable by lisa we use the recent lisa sensitivity curve reported in robson et al 2019 which gives the total instrumental noise as well as the stochastic noise due to the presence of unresolved galactic binaries detectability by lisa essentially requires that the mbh binary identified in lsst as an ultrashortperiodic quasar evolves into lisas frequency band during the time when lisa is operational at the short periods of odays relevant for our discussion the binary inspiral is expected to be dominated by gw emission see below in general it will take at least several weeks for lsst to identify periodicity with p odays since n  20 periods are required see eg vaughan et al 2016 and possibly longer if coadding data from multiple lsst visits and phasefolding of the lightcurve is needed lsst is currently expected to start survey operations in the mid 2020s and lisa is currently expected to be launched in the mid 2030s with a total mission lifetime of 5 years ie ending operations in the early 2040s our requirement is therefore approximately that the time elapsed between the discovery of a periodic source by lsst and the time it enters the lisa band should be between 515 years for illustration we reproduce lisas sensitivity curve in figure 4 the vertical red and orange dashed lines mark the possible range of the frequency wall below which lisas sensitivity is expected to degrade rapidly we also show illustrative examples of the evolution of mbh binaries assuming a 5year lisa mission lifetime the tracks of binaries with primary masses of m1 105 m 106 m and 107 m and redshift z 1 3 and 5 are plotted all with a mass ratio of q m2 m1 01 the characteristic strain h c is given by nh where n is the number of cycles spent at each frequency and h is the gw strain averaged over sky location and polarisations see eg sesana et al 2005 m1105 m q01 10 3 observed freq hz 100 figure 4 characteristic gw strain of mbh binaries blue lines for three different primary bh masses as labelled assuming a binary mass ratio q 01 and shown in each case for three different redshifts z 1 solid z 3 dashed and z 5 dotted the diamonds from left to right indicate when the binary is observed to be tm 1 year 1 week and 1 day away from merger the black curve shows lisas nominal sensitivity from robson et al 2019 assuming a mission duration of 5 years the red and orange vertical dashed lines at 105 and 104 hz mark the possible range of a frequency wall below which lisas sensitivity is expected to degrade significantly the lisa sensitivity curve constrains the range of masses mbh mass ratios q redshifts z and orbital periods p of the lsst candidates that satisfy this criterion given the uncertainties in the time at which the binaries may be identified in lsst and in the timing of the launch and duration of the lisa mission for simplicity we instead require that the time to merger is t m 5 15 years as figure 4 shows most binaries with masses detectable by lsst are also well above lisas sensitivity curve just prior to their merger the exceptions are the most massive bhs  10 m at high redshifts z 5 which may merge at frequencies below lisas frequency wall these binaries are excluded from our counts below but they constitute a very small fraction of the lsst quasar sample to begin with 3 results where g is newtons constant and c is the speed of light the time to merger in the binarys restframe is tmr 38 fr fr and the observed time to merger is t m 1 zt mr binaries with t m  5 yr accumulate signaltonoise ratio at each frequency for the full assumed lisa mission duration of 5 years while binaries closer to merger spend less than this time at each frequency this results in the knees in figure 4 at the observed frequencies that correspond to t m 5 yr the diamonds from left to right mark the frequencies at which the mbhb is observed to be 1 year 1 week and 1 day to merger and the evolution of each track is terminated at the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit isco these examples assume binary bh mass ratios of q 01 for illustration as mentioned above we will require lsstidentified mbh binaries to enter the lisa band 515 years after their discovery in general in this section we present our results for the total number of quasars that lsst can discover in its multiyear survey 31 and the ultrashort period subset of these quasars that may correspond to compact mbh binaries and will subsequently be detectable by lisa 32 31 quasars number counts in lsst our predictions of the total number of quasars in lsst described in  21 and 22 are shown in figure 3 in total we find approximately 19100 million quasars down to the magnitude limits of m i 2426 the number counts we find are generally somewhat higher than those predicted by the original qlf in k19 the difference from k19 at most redshifts and magnitudes are nevertheless small and arise only from our smoothly interpolating the bestfit doublepowerlaw parameters which we consider more physical the large majority of quasars are at faint magnitudes m i  24 where our counts agree mnras 000 111 2020 xin haiman 32 the number of verification binaries detectable by lisa as explained in the previous section we hypothesise that a fraction f t m of the quasars n in the lsst catalogue are powered by ultracompact inspiralling mbh binaries which will enter the lisa frequency band and merge within the time tm after their discovery with t m between 5 and 15 years this fraction is extremely small since we have to catch a quasar during the last 5 15 years of its life the fraction can simply be approximated by the ratio f t m t m  t q so that if quasars have average lifetimes of tq 107 years and we require a mbh binary system to be within 10 years of its merger ie tm 10 years this fraction is 106 more generally the number of lisadetectable quasars nlisa t m t q fqb n simply scales linearly both with this ratio t m t q and with the assumed fraction fqb of quasars associated with binary mbh mergers to begin with and can be trivially adjusted for any other assumed quasar lifetime different timetomerger of the mbh binary or overall binary fraction we compute the characteristic strains h c of the hypothetical binaries in the mbh z plane where we assume that the binaries have a t m 5 yr observer frame time to merger we then compare their characteristic strains to the lisa sensitivity curve shown in figure 4 we find that the evolutionary track h c of 99 of the objects eventually crosses the sensitivity curve and the 105 hz frequency wall and reaches the isco frequency above it the only exceptions are the most massive binaries with mbh  few 10 m with the threshold mass depending on the adopted location of the frequency wall which merge at frequencies below lisas sensitivity band however these massive bhs comprise  1 of all lsst quasars we show nlisa nlisa mbh z under the assumption of tm 5 yr and tq 107 yr in figure 5 in the mbh z plane most objects mnras 000 111 2020 150 nlisadmbh with k19 nearly exactly as another point of reference in figure 3 we also show the number counts forecast by the lsst and quoted in table 102 in version 20 of their science book lsst science collaboration et al 2009 as the figure shows the number counts we predict at the faint end are significantly above those in the lsst science book at these faint magnitudes more specifically down to m i 24 which corresponds to the magnitude limit in a singlenight lsst exposure consisting of two separate visits we predict that lsst will discover 19 million quasars compared with 84 million in lsst science collaboration et al 2009 lsst will predominantly observe mbhs of low masses 1056 m due to the steepness of the faintend slope of the quasar lfs for this reason we extrapolate the lfs to fainter magnitudes beyond m i 24 in figure 3 where no data is gathered in k19 by coadding data from many visits during its full multiyear survey lsst might discover objects as faint as m i 26 by integrating the qlfs between redshift 05 to 65 and 16 m i 26 we find 100 million quasars compared to 167 million in the lsst science collaboration et al 2009 our numbers are 6 times higher because we adopted a qlf with a steeper faintend slope and because we included bhs with masses down to 105 m see fig 5 and detailed discussion of this discrepancy in 41 below beyond z 6 the bandpass kcorrection is not available to convert absolute magnitude to apparent magnitude so in order to evaluate the number of quasars at high redshift using eq 2 we extrapolate the kcorrection with a straight line to cover 6 z 75 a very small fraction of the total number is found at high redshift we predict approximately 38000 10000 and 3300 quasars down to m i 26 25 and 24 respectively in this redshift range 6 z 75 100 tm 5 yr nlisa logmbhm 102 101 100 0 100 200 300 400 nlisadz figure 5 number of mbh binary

downward arrows the light grey medium grey and black curves correspond to lsst detection thresholds of mi 24 25 and 26 respectively this model assumes an observed time to merger of tm 5 years and a typical quasar lifetime of tq 107 years the predicted numbers scale linearly with tm tq concentrate at z 2 at the lowmass end with mbh few 105 m which corresponds to the faint end of the qlf m 26 this is unsurprising given the steep faintend slope of the qlf in this figure we also show the histograms of nlisa integrated over all masses in the top panel and that integrated over all redshifts in the right panel we observe a peak of nlisa around z2 which is consistent with the peak of the luminosity function in figure 2 we find that lisa will detect a total of 50 quasars from the full lsst catalogue down to m 26 unfortunately not all 50 of these objects can be detected due to further constraints first the possible frequency wall of lisa could impose upper limits on the mass of the binary above which binaries merge at too low frequencies to be detected we mark the mass limits induced by the range of a possible frequency wall in figure 5 as the wall moves from 105 hz red to 104 hz orange lowermass binaries become detectable however this has only a minor influence on the total number because the majority of lisadetectable sources concentrate at the lowmass region additionally one should take into account the uncertainty on how faint lsst would be able to observe quasars and identify their periodicity the duration of observation required to identify periodic quasars will generally vary from one object to the other depending on magnitude and period as well as the nature of the stochastic red noise for each individual quasar the nominal singlenight detection threshold for quasars is m i 24 lsst science collaboration et al 2009 this corresponds to the mass limit shown by the light grey curve in figure 5 only objects with masses above this line can be detected by lsst in a single night this cut would eliminate the large majority of fainter lowermass systems mbh  10 m at z 2 leaving 194 million sources in total of which 10 are detectable by lisa however this cut is overly conservative because as data is accumulated over its full multiyear survey lsst will be able to reach periodic quasars in lsst as future lisa sources 105 104 hz 26 mag 25 mag 24 mag

of quasars left after imposing combinations of these constraints in table 1 and further discuss the issue of coadding lsst data from multiple visits of the same field in 42 below we should also emphasise that lowmass mbh binaries with short orbital periods of  3 days dominate the lisadetectable sample the distributions of orbital periods of binaries t m 5 black and 15 maroon years prior to merger are shown in figure 6 we zoom in around the peaks of the two distributions in the inset figure where the periods are shorter than 2 days the perioddistributions are also of more general interest going beyond the shortperiod binaries detectable by lisa under our assumptions quasars associated with binaries have lifetimes up to t q and therefore their merger time t m can be range between 0 t m t q assuming further that the binaries inspiral purely due to gw emission this yields a maximum orbital period pmax defined by t m 38 1 z fr fr as t m t q and fr is given by eq 7 note that the observed period is p 21 z fr where fr is the restframe gw frequency we show the number of quasars expected as a function of apparent magnitude m i and observed orbital periods 0 p 200 days in figure 7 at four redshifts z 1 2 3 and 4 and assuming t q 107 years note that at low redshifts the bottom right region marked in hatched red corresponds to periods p pmax where binary quasars do not exist in our simplistic model more generally the perioddistributions can be altered at large binary separationsperiods where the circumbinary gas can dominate the orbital evolution over gw emission at periods as low as a week for the faintest quasars whose bh masses are 105 m see eg fig1 in haiman et al 2009 102 100  50 101 tm 5 year tm 15 year 100 period days figure 6 the orbital periods of mbh

in the lower right at z 1 and z 2 shown in hatched red have gw inspiral times longer than the fiducial quasar lifetime of tq 107 years and do not exist in our simple population model 4 discussion the results presented in the previous section demonstrate that there may be 10150 lisa verification binaries in the lsst quasar catalogues here the lowest 10 number is for a conservative magnitude limit of m i 24 and adopts t m t q fqb 5 108 this may correspond for example t m 5 years t q 3 107 years and fqb 03 the highend 150 is for a more aggressive magnitude limit of m i 26 and adopts t m t q fqb 15 107 which may correspond to t m 15 years t q 3 107 years and fqb 03 these numbers rely on several assumptions beyond the choices of t m t q and fqb on which the counts just depend linearly here we discuss the main assumptions and related issues 41 uncertainties in the quasar luminosity function as mentioned in the previous section the lsst science book forecasts a total of 167 million quasars which is 6 times lower than the number we find down to the limiting magnitude of m i 26 the first item we note is that the lsst science book value includes an absolute magnitude limit of mi 20 corresponding to a bh mass of  5 10 m we have chosen not to include this cut mnras 000 111 2020 as recent years have revealed increasing evidence for the existence of lowmass bhs in galactic nuclei see next subsection to assess the importance of this cut the grey dashed curve in figure 3 shows our predicted counts but with the same mi 20 cut imposed this reduces our predictions from 1941003 million to 186787 million quasars still leaving a factor of 78716747 difference next the lsst science book predictions used an earlier qlf determination by hopkins et al 2007 so we assess how much our predictions would change if we used the same qlf unfortunately a precise comparison is difficult since hopkins et al 2007 gives the qlf for the bolometric luminosity l bol however using runnoe et al 2012 to convert l 1450 to l bol at z 2 we find that our counts are reduced by a factor of 13 22 and 38 at m i 24 25 and 26 respectively we therefore conclude that our higher number counts compared to the lsst science book can be attributed almost entirely to the different adopted qlfs additional smaller differences could result from our simplified selection function note in particular that lssts singleimage detection efficiency incorporates selections via colours lack of proper motion variability and combinations with external data and drops below unity at m i 24 25 ivezi et al 2014 to be more specific the faintend slope of the hopkins et al periodic quasars in lsst as future lisa sources 2007 lf at z 2 127 their table 3 is much shallower than the slope 198 in k19 and the one we adopted after interpolating between redshifts 19 the faintend slope in hopkins et al 2007 was determined from the 2qz survey croom et al 2004 while k19 used data from the more recent and deeper 2slaq survey croom et al 2009 as discussed in appendix b in k19 this makes the faintend slope somewhat steeper however as shown in their fig b1 k19s faintend slope inferred from the same data is significantly steeper even than obtained by croom et al 2009 this disagreement may be caused by differences in the kcorrections selectionfunctions and choices of binning to which this faintend slope is especially sensitive and needs further investigation for now we proceeded to adopt the k19based number counts and simply note that there is roughly an order of magnitude uncertainty in our predictions finally we note that there remain uncertainties in k19s lf determination itself first the statistical errors on the fitting parameters are subdominant compared to the other uncertainties as can be seen in the blue shaded areas in figure 2 however choices in determining these parameters and interpolating them over redshift must be made after excluding the double powerlaw parameters that are affected by systematic errors in the agn sample open circles in figure 1 note that including these discarded data points would increase our predicted counts one can approximate the evolution of the four fitting parameters as smooth functions of redshift k19 introduce three models in which different approaches are taken to describe the evolution of the faintend slope given that m and are fitted with quadratic cubic and linear functions of redshift respectively the faintend slope is first being modelled with a double powerlaw in z to account for the discontinuity around z 3 the second model uses the same exact procedure to find the four parameters as in the first model but excludes the sample of highestredshift agns that only have rough estimates of selection functions in the last model they again exclude the highz samples and approximate m and with quadratic cubic and linear fittings but is approximated as a linear function of z our analysis here is closest to this third approach if we had adopted the other two approaches our analysis would yield only slightly different results approximately by 23 42 coadding lsst data and identifying periodicity as noted above we employed a fiducial magnitude limit of m i 26 which is 2 magnitudes deeper than lssts singlevisit detection threshold of m i 24 over a full 10year lsst survey assuming each field is visited on average every 3 days or 100 visits per year we could naively expect that coadding these 1000 visits can lower the detection threshold by a factor of 1000 30 in flux or by 37 magnitudes on the other hand coadding every visit into a single effective combined exposure would make it impossible to detect any periodicity as a rough estimate for a possible compromise m i 26 represents the magnitude limit after coadding 30 visits this effectively leaves 30 independent datapoints each a coadd of 30 visits which may facilitate both the detection of a faint subsingleexposure quasar and the identification of its periodicity securely identifying the periodicity will require a dedicated analysis the expected periods are 12 days which is comparable but somewhat shorter than the time between individual visits for precisely uniform timesampling these periods would fall below the nyquist limit and could not be detected however the lsst time sampling will not be uniform with a pair of exposures during each overnight visit and somewhat different times elapsing between successive exposures this should enable at least in principle to fold the effective lightcurves and detect 12day periodicities coadding different exposures will introduce a tradeoff between going deeper which allows lsst to discover many more quasars but having effectively fewer points sampling the lightcurve which makes it harder to detect periodicities one can also imagine that choices of which sets of not just how many individual exposures to coadd and combine into single effective datapoints will also affect the efficiency of a periodicity search the optimal approach to such coadding and lightcurvefolding will require a detailed dedicated analysis which we plan to perform in a followup publication 43 massive black holes below 106 m as mentioned above in our analysis we have chosen to include quasars with bh masses down to a few 105 m excluding quasars fainter than mi 20 corresponding to bh masses below 5 105 m would decrease our fiducial predictions from 100 million to 79 million this assumes eddington ratios of fedd in the conversion between bolometric luminosity and bh mass adopting a lower fedd would imply larger mbh while early dynamical searches for lowmass mbhs yielded nondetections several campaigns in recent years have shown that a high fraction 5080 of small galaxies with masses of mgal 10910 m harbour nuclear mbhs with masses down to at least mbh 105 m furthermore these bhs obey the scaling relations such as between mbh and the hosts velocity dispersion seen at higher masses see the recent review by greene et al 2020 and references therein and these lowmass mbhs are found among luminous agn eg kimbrell et al 2021 and references therein based on these results we included mbhs down to these lower masses 44 quasar lifetime and relation to mbh binaries our analysis here is based on the simplified notion that quasars are often activated by galaxy mergers and that quasars are therefore are related to mbh binaries as argued in the introduction the connection between quasars and mergers are based in part on theoretical modelling which helps explain the evolution of the qlf over cosmic time particularly the rise and fall in quasar activity and its peak at z 2 eg kauffmann haehnelt 2000 there is also wellestablished theoretical eg barnes hernquist 1991 and empirical eg genzel et al 2010 support that major mergers drive gas to galactic nuclei and that they are associated with agn eg goulding et al 2018 it also seems inevitable that both mbhs contained in the two merging galaxies end up rapidly shrinking to the nucleus of the new mergerremnant galaxy eg begelman et al 1980 however there remains a major uncertainty about the precise relative timing of the quasar phase and the inspiral and eventual merger of the mbh binary the duration of the bright quasar phase is known to last 1068 years eg martini 2004 while the inspiral time of the binary remains poorly understood simple timescale arguments associated the inspiral timescale with a modified viscous timescale of the agn disk itself suggest that the coalescence of a compact mbh binary in the gasrich nucleus of a merger remnant may be comparably short haiman et al 2009 it is plausible to assume that the mbh merger takes place during the luminous quasar stage and the statistics of periodic quasar candidates to date listed in the introduction are consistent with this assumption nevertheless we mnras 000 111 2020 xin haiman emphasise that this remains a key assumption that is currently poorly understood but which will be tested by the lsst quasar variability data assuming that the mergers of mbh binaries coincide with luminous quasar phases allows us to forego modelling of the evolving mbh binary population eg based on underlying galaxy merger trees kelley et al 2019 and directly predict their number from the observed quasar luminosity functions our conclusions are subject to several caveats primarily due to the poorly constrained faintend slope of the quasar lf and the details of the analysis required to coadd singlevisit lsst data to search for the faint m i 26 and ultrashort p 12 day period agn future work will clarify the feasibility of the discovery of these verification binaries acknowledgements 45 chirping of mbhbs in lsst finally an intriguing aspect of our conclusions is that there may be a handful of ultrashort period binary quasars in the lsst survey whose period progressively shortens due to their gwdriven inspiral over the timescale of years the period will change from a day to hours as an example the observed orbital period twice the gw period p 2 fobs of a binary with a total mass of 3 105 m at z 2 a typical verification binary will change from 23 days at t m 10 years prior to merger to 06 days at t m 5 years whether or not lsst data is capable of inferring this chirp from the optical lightcurve needs to be addressed by a dedicated analysis as described in 42 above but incorporating the expected rate of periodchange p due to the gw emission a secure detection of p 0 in agreement with the expected value from the gw chirp could provide a smokinggun evidence for the presence of a mbh binary 5 conclusions in this paper we computed the number of faint quasars expected to be discovered in the vera c rubin observatorys lsst and found it to be as large as 20100 million down to the apparent magnitudes m i 24 26 reached over the multiyear survey we further hypothesised that a small fraction f t m of these sources correspond to ultrashort period binary quasars powered by massive bh binaries at the last stages of their coalescence ie within the time t m prior to their merger our model is based on the quasar lf derived from a recent compilation of data from multiple agn surveys and the simple ansatz that the latestage merging fraction is given by the product f t m t m t q fqb this expresses the product of the probability of catching a quasar during the last t m years of its full lifetime t q and the underlying fraction fqb of quasars that are associated with mbh mergers our main result is that the lsst quasar catalogue may contain a handful and perhaps up to several hundred such ultracompact binaries which will subsequently move into lisas mhz frequency band and become detectable as a gw sources we dub these massive bh verification binaries since their presence may be known before lisa is launched in analogy with a handful of known galactic white dwarf verification binaries these results can be interpreted in the reverse direction as well once lisa detects a population of mbh binaries it will be possible to look back in the lsst and similar archival data and retroactively search for periodicities of quasars while in some cases there may be a single quasar in the threedimensional lisa error volume kocsis et al 2006 in the majority of cases there will be several the archival search should offer a way to uniquely identify the true counterpart ie as the single agn whose past periodicity matches the expected orbital period extrapolated back in time from the lisa detection mnras 000
