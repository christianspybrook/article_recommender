observing a quantum measurement jay lawrence department of physics and astronomy dartmouth college hanover nh 03755 usa and arxiv210500061v1 quantph 30 apr 2021 the james franck institute university of chicago chicago il 60637 dated revised may 4 2021 abstract with the example of a sterngerlach measurement on a spin12 atom we show that a superposition of both paths may be observed compatibly with properties attributed to state collapse  for example the singleness or mutual exclusivity of outcomes this is done by inserting a quantum twostate system an ancilla in each path capable of responding to the passage of the atom and thus acting as a virtual detector we then consider real measurements on the compound system of atomic spin and two ancillae nondestructive measurements of a set of compatible joint observables can be performed one for a superposition and others for collapse properties a novel perspective is given as to why within unitary quantum theory ordinary measurements are blind to such superpositions implications for the theory of measurement are discussed pacs numbers 0367a 0365ta 0365ud introduction opinions differ on whether or not there is a quantum measurement problem and if so exactly what it is 1 2 a more focused question regards the collapse of the state vector in projective measurements as formalized by von neumann 3 by collapse we mean the observed process described by one of the textbook postulates which states in its simplest form 4 5 measurement postulate a measurement of the observable a yields one of its eigenvalues an and in an ideal measurement 6 7 places the measured object in the corresponding eigenstate n where an an n included with this or stated as a separate postulate is the born rule probability of this outcome hn i2 where is the initial state of the object being measured all interpretations must agree on the above as a statement of fact but they disagree on its status ie is it independent of the other postulates which stipulate unitary evolution in the appropriate hilbert space or is it derivable from them regarding attitudes on this more focused issue it seems reasonable to identify a small number of broad categories here is a grouping into three the most conservative takes collapse as axiomatic that is it cannot be derived from the other axioms suggesting that the collapse process itself is not subject to quantum analysis 8 9 this position is consistent with most textbooks written over more than the last half century which list collapse among the axioms it is intended to include those who apply quantum theory according to these textbook axioms without however adopting any particular interpretation philosophically it also includes the epistemic and informationbased approaches 10 whose intellectual roots extend back to the copenhagen interpretation 11 12 we refer to this general position as standard quantum theory sqt interpreted broadly a contrasting position is that the collapse phenomenon as observed is in fact derived from the other axioms following unitary evolution of an appropriate closed system which includes the apparatus and the relevant environment 13 14 as well as the object of study and indeed unitary evolution describes what we see but it also describes what we do not see namely that all branches of the state vector representing all possible measurement outcomes survive the measurement process this is nevertheless consistent because it also predicts that an observer can be aware of only one such outcome 15 we shall refer to this position as unitary quantum theory uqt it includes the many worlds interpretation 16 18 which asserts that the unobservable branches are just as real as the branch we experience but it is broader it includes orthodox decoherence theory 19 20 whose practitioners represent a variety of interpretations 21 22 and other operational approaches which assert independence from interpretations 5 23 while assuming unitarity a third position holds that the unobserved branches are removed from the theory by a mechanism of yet unknown origin which takes effect in sufficiently large systems and which is in principle subject to quantum analysis the mechanism is represented by adding a nonlinear stochastic term to the hamiltonian whose effect is to remove all but a single branch 2427 this approach in effect replaces the collapse postulate with an expansion of the dynamics postulate beyond its otherwise unitary and deterministic character this has consequences which are measurable in principle but to date undetected predicted effects are difficult to separate from decoherence and other random influences there are proposals to utilize molecular interferometry and optomechanical phenomena as well as particle diffusion 28 and it is hoped that over the next decade or two definitive tests will be possible 29 we refer to this general position as objective collapse theory oct it has fewer adherents than the other two 2 but it provides an important alternative in this paper we will make several points about the measurement process mostly interpretation independent although the blindness of ordinary measurements to superpositions calls for specific justification within the uqt approach for all points it will be useful to distinguish two stages of the measurement process first comes the reversible premeasurement stage where the object of interest becomes entangled unitarily with an ancillary system in the apparatus in our case two paths second is the detection stage where the ancillary system transfers its entanglement to the detector system in our case two detectors which then act irreversibly and record a result perhaps surprisingly two signature collapse properties are established in the premeasurement stage as properties of the objectancillary system and survive through the detection stage as correlations among the object and the two detectors these are implicit in the postulate stated above i singleness or mutual exclusivity of outcomes an and ii projection the correlations between detector readings and the postmeasurement spin state note that the singleness of outcomes implies randomness randomness is not a property of the premeasurement state it only shows up at the detection stage as a result of local which path measurement which breaks the entanglement while preserving the correlations there is a third property of the premeasurement state not a collapse property namely iii superposition the state vector is a superposition of distinct collapse scenarios in the ancilla model this property can be detected but in an ordinary apparatus it cannot be so that its survival in the state vector is open to interpretation the ancilla model expands the premeasurement stage by adding a physical realization qubits to the ancillary system the three properties are represented by hermitian operators in the hilbert space of the objectancilla system the operators commute and all three properties are observable at the detection stage in an ordinary apparatus without the ancillae we will show that all three properties are again present in the premeasurement stage but that only the two collapse properties are observable at the detection stage interpretations differ on the reason behind this blindness of an ordinary apparatus to superpositions in two of the approaches outlined above only one branch of the state vector survives the detection stage in sqt this is axiomatic in oct it is by construction of the model interaction in uqt on the other hand the superposition extends to the detectors and persists through the detection stage we will offer a physically intuitive explanation why it is nonetheless undetectable prompted by comparison with the ancilla model this will provide a useful perspective on a more conventional explanation in decoherence theory sec iii and appendix a in the next section we introduce the sterngerlach measurement model with ancilla qubits as virtual detectors and we then show how this atomancilla system may be observed in a real experiment this observation demonstrates the compatibility of the two collapse properties with the superposition property for this system in section iii we compare the analogous measurements made with two ordinary detectors we show that the collapse properties are identical to those of the ancilla model while the superposition that persists in the uqt approach is now undetectable we discuss the reason for this blindness and compare with the decoherence perspective results are summarized in sec iv a model measurement with virtual detectors consider the compound system consisting of a spin12 atom and two quantum twostate systems ancillae a and a serving as virtual detectors in the sterngerlach interferometer r t r t fig 1 sterngerlach interferometer showing the evolution described by eqs 1 4 pictured in fig 1 30 each ancilla interacts locally with the atom and it makes a transition from its 0 to its 1 state if and only if the atom passes through it the interaction is spinindependent preserving the spin state of the atom on its path we assume that the process is reversible so that the ancilla by itself does not perform a measurement hence we call it a virtual detector let us trace the evolution of entanglement as the atom passes through the device from points 1 4 the atom enters the picture at time t1 with the spatial wavefunction r t1 in an arbitrary pure spin state t1 i r t1 is is 0ia 0ia with ancillae in their 0 states by the time t2 the sterngerlach magnetic field gradient has separated the spin components into two ideally nonoverlapping paths t2 i r t2 is r t2 is 0ia 0ia entangling the atoms spatial and spin degrees of freedom by t3 the atom has passed through an ancilla a or a conditioned on its path so that t3 i r t3 is 1ia 0ia r t3 is 0ia 1ia finally a reversed magnetic field gradient brings the two paths back together at t4 assuming that there is no net phase difference between the paths the result is t4 i r t4 is 1ia 0ia is 0ia 1ia the last step allows us to ignore the spatial part and study the remaining entanglement between the spin and the two ancillae we further simplify by setting 1 2 leaving the threequbit state t4 i 110i 001i where the spin states are relabeled as 1 0 and the ordering of the indices identifies with spina a this is a greenbergerhornezeilinger ghz state 31 32 an entangled state of three qubits it was first realized experimentally in 1999 33 as a polarization state of three photons analogous states and their generalizations to more than three particles have been produced and documented in other systems for example trapped ions 34 superconducting circuits 35 36 and rydberg atoms 37 the original goal was to demonstrate nonlocality 38 more practical goals involve quantum error correction 39 and quantum communication 40 and in general the manipulation of entanglement let us discuss the observables that characterize the state and then the question of how to measure them the threequbit system lives in a hilbert space of dimension eight and t4 i is an eigenstate of three tensor product operators whose eigenvalues determine it completely the choice is not unique 41 the most revealing in the present context is zzi ziz and xxx recalling the definitions of the individual pauli matrices z x and y as given in table i one may confirm that t4 i is indeed the unique simultaneous eigenstate of the three tensor products with the eigenvalues quoted in table ii each observable may be characterized by a statement about its physical meaning with eigenvalue 1 giving the truth value 42 with ghz entanglement all such statements concern either twoparticle or threeparticle correlations and none concerns a property of an individual particle the combination of statements appearing in table ii is an example these statements may appear contradictory because the product of the first two tells us that izz 1 whose clear physical meaning is that the atom can be found on one and only one path the singleness property or mutual exclusivity on the other hand the definiteness of xxx implies that the state vector 5 is a superposition of two classically inconsistent scenarios we will explain in detail why the singleness and superposition statements are not contradictory but first we must describe the measurements made with real irreversible detecting devices 43 we will describe two modes called local and joint which differ in the acquisition of local information a local measurements table i multiplication table for pauli matrices acting on kets 1i 0i pauli i0i i1i table ii tensor product operators eigenvalues and physical interpretations spina a eigenvalue meaning zzi atom takes upper path if and only if spin is up ziz atom takes lower path if and only if spin is down xxx state is invariant under simultaneous flips 0 1 fig 2 local measurements of z factors a and x factors b in both parts m denotes standard readout devices and mz mx denote the measurement of the atoms spin component zs xs with a downstream sterngerlach apparatus wavy lines denote the atoms wave packet at t4 we begin with the simpler and more typical mode of ghz experiments 33 in which one measures the local factors and multiplies the results together to obtain the eigenvalue of the desired joint observable first consider the local z factors each of which can take the value 1 or 1 we measure the ancilla factors za and za with a standard readout device 44 for each ancilla qubit we measure the atomic spin component zs with another table iii observables characterizing the premeasurement state and the properties they represent these properties and their measurements are described in the text observable property izz 1 singleness of outcome zzi 1 and ziz 1 projection property xxx 1 and above superposition of potential outcomes downstream sterngerlach device similarly oriented with a singleatom detector placed in the path to register the arrival or not of the atom and thus record the value of zs the results are as follows the outcome of each local measurement is random because no local observable has t4 110i 001i as an eigenstate 45 but the product of any two z factors is definite as shown in the top two panels in table iii these are collapse properties and they are properties of the state t4 prior to measurement they characterize the observed collapse phenomenon that we would see in an ordinary measurement without the ancillae we emphasize that izz 1 represents the singleness or mutual exclusivity of measurement outcomes while zzi 1 and ziz 1 represent the projection property the perfect correlation between detector readouts and the remeasured value of the atomic spin downstream it is notable that the twoway correlations above persist in the face of local measurements zii izi and iiz whose random outcomes indicate that the measurement changed the state of the system the specific which path information thus obtained is not a property of t4 it enters only at the detection stage its randomness a feature shared with ordinary measurements is a necessary consequence of the singleness property now consider the measurements of the individual x factors clearly to measure xs we simply reorient the downstream sterngerlach system to measure xa and xa noting that the readout devices are keyed to the ancillas zbases we apply a hadamard transformation h 46 to each ancilla before the readout the readout value 1 then indicates in which linear combination of zbasis states 1i 0i each ancilla has been found the results of these xmeasurements are the following the individual outcomes are again random but the product of all three is always 1 the definiteness of the product indicates a coherent superposition and its positivity confirms the sign in eq 5 note that this measurement distinguishes the pure entangled state from a mixed state of the same two components the mixed state would duplicate the zmeasurement results but reveal itself through random outcomes for the product xxx to better fill out the picture of how the same state t4 can accommodate both a collapse scenario and a superposition consider the local measurement of the spin component xs which finds the atom to have taken both paths the outcome is random when it is 1 then the product xa xa must also be 1 knowing the compatible product za za 1 table iii it is easy to see that the state of the two ancillae is the bell state iaa 10i 01iaa on the other hand when xs is 1 then xa xa must also be 1 and this combined again with za za 1 indicates another bell state iaa 10i 01iaa each of these bell states represents perfect anticorrelations between the ancillas zvalues which are individually random this shows how the ancillae are able to respect the singleness property while in correlation with the atomic spin enabling the coherent superposition of both paths it may be worth noting that the observation of either superposition state is just another form of apparent collapse instead of finding which path one is finding which superposition of paths so far we have appealed to local measurements to verify the joint eigenvalues which define t4 but since these measurements change the state each new set of them requires another identically prepared state of the system one can circumvent this need and achieve a more direct demonstration of compatibility as follows b joint measurements and compatibility one can measure compatible joint observables nondestructively by refusing to acquire local information for the singleness property izz one couples a and a to an added ancilla qubit b through cnot gates fig 3a so that the state of b changes if and only if za and za are opposite thus the readout will show that izz 1 without revealing the value of either za or za similar measurements hold for the projection property zzi fig 3 a joint measurement of izz using ancilla b and b of xxx using b and c or ziz by moving one of the cnot connections to ancilla c located on the leg of the downstream sterngerlach device to measure xxx one couples three ancillae a a and c to b through hadamard and cnot gates fig 3b the readout will show that xxx 1 and this together with the above establishes the superposition property while these joint measurements provide the logically most direct demonstration of compatibility the local measurements have the virtue of demonstrating the randomness characteristic of ordinary measurements so the ancilla model subjected to local z measurements only is reduced to an ordinary apparatus but the x measurements give it access to the superposition property which is not accessible to ordinary measurements it should be noted in passing that the ancilla setup in either form can be realized starting with a photon propagating through a machzender interferometer and two ancillae one associated with each arm this is an extension of the socalled delayed choice quantum eraser dcqe which employs a single ancilla and is capable of realizing wheelers proposed delayed choice experiment 47 the choice between which path and a superposition of paths as closely realized experimentally by v jacques et al 48 a different realization and a comprehensive discussion of dcqe setups is provided in ref 49 with a single ancilla one has a two qubit system and is able to detect the superposition and projection properties xx and zz superposition xx is manifested by interference as a function of the difference in path lengths and the action of the ancilla x factor corresponds to quantum erasure of which path information but this system cannot detect singleness as the third independent observable with two ancillae on the other hand one has a three qubit system which accommodates this observable furthermore the twoancillae system forms a parallel with an ordinary apparatus which employs two detectors we show below that the singleness property must hold here as a correlation between the detectors iii apparati with real detectors reconsider the sterngerlach setup of fig 1 with ancillae replaced by real detectors d and d these act like the ancillae together with their readout devices like the ancillae they transmit the atom without changing its spin state this is in keeping with the von neumann measurement formalism 3 6 and the stated postulate and like the readout devices they record irreversibly the passage or not of the atom in this section first we show that the collapse properties of ordinary apparati are equivalent to those of the ancilla model in the sense that the singleness and projection properties are represented by observables and established at the premeasurement stage while the randomness of which path information enters only at the detection stage then second we discuss the superposition property which survives the detection stage in uqt but is nonetheless undetectable we offer a physical explanation why this is the case a equivalence of collapse properties recall that the ancillabased premeasurement state t4 exhibits nonrandom collapse properties represented by joint observables i the singleness property by za za 1 and ii the projection property by zs za 1 and zs za 1 to show that these properties are similarly preestablished in ordinary measurements note that the ancilla operators za and za act as standins for path occupation variables and we can define such variables for the ordinary setup as zp 2p 1 and zp 2p 1 where pk is a projector onto that subvolume of the path k occupied by the spatial wave packet k r t2 at time t2 so zp k 1 tells us whether or not the atom will enter the detector dk the path occupation states analogous to the ancilla states may be written as 1ip 0ip and 0ip 1ip these convey all of the necessary information about the spatial wave packets  t2 and t2 so that t2 i may be written as t2 i 1is 1ip 0ip 0is 0ip 1ip which is analogous to eq 4 of the ancilla system prior to readout this is clearly an eigenstate of zp zp zs zp and zs zp with eigenvalues 1 1 and 1 respectively thus establishing the singleness and projection properties in the premeasurement state these properties arise here from the entanglement of just the spin and the path with path occupation alone playing the ancillary role by the time t3 the path occupation variables have mediated correlations between the atoms spin and the detectors analogous to the readout state in the ancilla case the main difference is that here a detector readout follows closely the passage of the atom one cannot delay this readout as was done with the ancilla system but the ancilla system can duplicate this situation by moving the ancilla readouts to an earlier time say t3 ahead of the atomic spin remeasurement at some t t4 the time ordering has no effect on the final result 50 as an aside on the projection property although this property is axiomatic in sqt it is nonetheless conditioned on the above assumption that a detector transmits the atom without changing its spin state 6 clearly this assumption fails for detectors which work by absorbing the atom in this case the projection property still holds but it takes the form of a correlation between the reading of a detector and the angular momentum imparted to it only one detector can receive the impulse the singleness property and that impulse  is delivered to d or d respectively depending on which detector reads 1 b blindness to superpositions while the collapse properties of the two systems are equivalent the superposition property is not being detectable in the ancilla system but not in the ordinary system all approaches outlined at the beginning of the paper must agree on the facts the observation of a single definite outcome with its associated probability and the invisibility of superpositions to ordinary apparati but the approaches differ fundamentally on the physics behind these facts in the sqt and oct approaches because the detectors are macroscopic one of the terms existing in the premeasurement state is removed from the theory at detection in sqt the removal is axiomatic in oct it is dynamical a result of the nonlinear stochastic model the evolution is nonunitary in both cases in the uqt approach on the other hand the evolution including the detectors is unitary and therefore the state of the atomdetectors system must reflect the superposition in eq 8 this approach is viable as we have said only if the superposition of distinct detector states is undetectable decoherence theory shows that it is see appendix a but the ancilla analogy suggests a more fundamental explanation involving irreversibility 51 in uqt the state of the atomdetectors system at time t4 has the same ghz form as eq 8 or for that matter eq 5 of the ancilla system the crucial difference is that the detector states involve microscopic internal degrees of freedom 52 whose states are labeled by and 0 in addition to the necessary readout variables 0 and 1 respectively so eq 8 becomes t4 i 1is 1 0 id 0 id 0is 0 id 1 0 id where we have dropped the common spatial factor at t4 as done in eq 5 one can imagine 0 to be a metastable configuration of a detector which would make a transition to a final stable configuration 1 if triggered by the passage of the atom equation 9 represents just a single element of an ensemble in which each initial state of the 0 configuration evolves unitarily into the state 0 of the 1 configuration 53 the corresponding density matrix is written in appendix a in the text for clarity we shall continue to refer to state vectors again we ask how can one observe a superposition involving both paths one must measure among other things the spin component xs since this measurement by itself produces random outcomes one must measure a correlation of which t4 is an eigenstate of which the simplest is xxx there are three other options such as xy y but these offer nothing further so supposing that the xs measurement produces the outcome 1 we must then show that the product of detector x values is also 1 given that the product of detector z values is 1 this would demonstrate that the detectors are in the bell state analogous to eq 6 idd 1 id 0 id 0 id 1 id a detector operator xk connects its 0 and 1 states that is 1 0 idk xdk 0 idk and 0 idk xdk 1 0 idk since the first of these represents the natural evolution of the detector 1 0 i u t3 t2 0 i the x operators must be xdk pk 1uk t3 t2 pk 0 pk 0uk1 t3 t2 pk 1 where pk i are projection operators onto the i 0 or 1 configurations of detector dk now uk t3 t2 represents the time evolution of a complex manybody system and while this is reversible in principle it is not reversible thermodynamically 54 that is we do not have control over the microscopic degrees of freedom required to implement uk1 t3 t2 so the detector operators xk are not accessible to us and without them we cannot detect a superposition of states in the 0 and 1 configurations of dk and we cannot access xxx which would demonstrate a schrdinger catlike superposition of the two collapse scenarios of the spindetectors system in short we only have access to the detector variables zk which the detectors record and in these there can be no evidence for the existence of the superposition which in uqt continues to exist in the state vector a different but related argument on thermodynamic irreversibility in measurement was given by peres 55 the demonstration of blindness changes very little with detectors which absorb the atom rather than transmitting it as is essentially the case in the original sterngerlach experiment 56 this case is discussed in appendix b the above arguments suggest that our inability to detect superpositions of detector output states is a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics one can imagine a quantum maxwell demon who possesses the microscopic control that we lack and is capable of detecting superpositions which are invisible to us thus the quantum measurement process by its construction employs the thermodynamic arrow of time there is no need to invoke a different measurement arrow c a decoherence perspective a decoherence argument for blindness involves the concept of the pointer brasil 57 defines pointer states as eigenstates of the observable of the measuring apparatus that represents the possible positions of the display pointer of the equipment the concept was introduced in the present context by zeh 58 and developed by zurek 14 59 who showed that interactions with the environment select the pointers preferred basis the states we observe in our system these states are associated with the pair of detectors they are denoted by 1id 0id and 0id 1id or in shorthand 10idd and 01idd by simply dropping the environmental variables and 0 an argument specific to our system is written out in appendix a in brief one traces over the environmental degrees of freedom and 0 within each detector and derives the reduced density matrix of the spinpointer system which is diagonal in the basis 110isdd and 001isdd where the second and third indices refer to the pointer in the case of detectors which absorb the atom this basis reduces to just that of the pointer 10idd and 01idd in either case blindness to superpositions is represented by the diagonality of the 2 2 density matrix there are interesting consequences when the pointer is realized within the system of two detectors environmental interactions determine the preferred basis of an individual detector 1idk and 0idk corresponding to atomno atom or zdk 1 but they do not determine the preferred basis of the full pointer associated with the pair of detectors because they do not exclude the possibility of 11idd and 00idd exclusion resulting from the singleness property in fact the environment is not responsible for the singleness or the projection property or implicitly for the choice of which spin component is measured  all of which are established in premeasurement so while the environment is crucial for enforcing the blindness to superpositions its role whether internal or expanded to include the external is limited to the proper functioning of the individual detectors this separation between the premeasurement stage governed by reversible unitary evolution and the detection stage where the environment enters bringing practical irreversibility is the defining characteristic of controlled von neumanntype measurements the roles of these stages are in some sense complementary while blindness to superpositions may be seen as an emergent classical property induced by interactions with the environment the singleness and projection properties are quantum entanglement properties represented by observables and manifested in correlations between noninteracting macroscopic objects conclusions we studied an ancillaaided sterngerlach experiment allowing delayedchoice measurements on the threequbit system of atomic spin and two ancillae acting as virtual detectors we first considered local measurements and showed that one choice zi reproduces the collapse properties of ordinary unaided measurements while another xi demonstrates a superposition of the two collapselike scenarios involving both paths both choices require repeated measurements on identicallyprepared states of the system since local measurements destroy the state so secondly we showed that nondestructive measurements can be made by avoiding the acquisition of local information thus relinquishing only the specific which path information one can still measure a complete set of commuting joint observables these represent the superposition property and the two nonrandom collapse properties namely the singleness and projection properties in sec iii we applied the above ideas to an ordinary apparatus first we showed that the collapse properties occur with the same status as in the ancilla model the singleness and projection properties are represented by operators and established at the premeasurement stage while the randomness of local measurement outcomes enters only at the detection stage as a consequence of the singleness property the various approaches mentioned in the introduction the standard unitary and objective collapse approaches agree on the observed collapse phenomenon itself but they differ on its unobservable underpinnings the existencenonexistence of unobserved branches in the state vector and the nature of the observed randomness of outcomes is it objective or subjective it is possible but far from certain that future experiments alone will resolve these differences the viability of the uqt approach rests upon the invisibility of the alternate unobserved branches in the state vector the ancilla system points to a simple explanation detectors are irreversible and this makes the required complementary local observables xd and xd inaccessible the absence of a known fundamental mechanism of irreversibility acting in typical measurements suggests that the irreversibility is thermodynamic so that at least within uqt the observed collapse phenomenon is a manifestation of the second law appendix a density matrix of spindetectors system here we write out the density matrix of the spindetectors system and we show how the trace over the unobserved states of the detectors internal degrees of freedom yields the appropriate reduced density matrix which expresses the blindness of the apparatus to superpositions of output states the initial mixed state of the spindetectors system assuming probabilities p and p for the microstates 0 id and 0 id of the two detectors is t1 p p 1is 0is 0 id 0 id h1s h0s h0 d h0 d 12 after the atom passes through the detectors and the paths are recombined at t4 this becomes t4 p p 1is 1 0 id 0 id 0is 0 id 1 0 id  h1s h1 0 d h0 d h0s h0 d h1 0 d since we only read the detectors outputs and do not monitor the microscopic degrees of freedom considered as the environment e we trace over the latter to define the reduced density matrix describing the state of the spin and the detector displays which is called the spinpointer system 57 to be more precise each detector consists of its own pointer with readout states 0 and 1 and its own environment with associated states and 0 respectively the trace consists of independent traces over the environments within each detector ie r t4 t re e t4 to evaluate each of these it is convenient to sum over  ie hi in those terms where the pointer state 0 appears and over 0 where it does not the latter choice is legitimate because the two sets are related unitarily it is straightforward then to show that r t4 2 1is 1id 0id h1s h1d h0d  1is 1id 0id h0s h0d h1d p p h 0 id h0 id  0is 0id 1id h1s h1d h0d p p h0 id h 0 id 2 0is 0id 1id h0s h0d h1d the environmental sums in the second and third terms essentially vanish they are undetectably small because the inner product factors none greater than unity in magnitude have random phases in contrast with analogous factors hih0 0 i 1 which appeared in the first and fourth terms and summed to unity thus r is diagonal in the spinpointer basis which consists of 1is 1id 0id and 0is 0id 1id the surviving singleness and projection correlations result from the entanglement generated between eqs 12 and 13 by the passage of the atom in fact it should be noted that except for the remaining summations in the offdiagonal terms eq 14 is equivalent in form to the density matrix of the spinancilla system see eq 4 in sec ii thus the environmental factors in 14 neatly summarize how the superposition of outcomes becomes undetectable with real detectors appendix b detectors that absorb in the original sterngerlach experiment 56 silver atoms were directed at a glass plate and formed two separated deposits with segments of the glass acting as the two detectors imagining ideally a pair of absorbing singleatom detectors their state at time t3 could still be written as in eq 10 but the 1 states now represent the absorbed atom as well as excitations created by the absorption event natural evolution produces these states from the 0 states of the detectors multiplied by the corresponding path occupation states 1ip k of the atom 1 0 idk u t3 t2 0 idk 1ip k so the xdk operator analogous to eq 11 is xdk pk 1uk t3 t2 1ip k pk 0h1p k 1ip k pk 0h1p k uk1 t3 t2 pk 1 and the subsequent blindness argument is unchanged the decoherence approach of appendix a is similarly adapted since the 0 i states include the absorbed atom the inner product factors in 14 are replaced by h1p k h0 i or its complex conjugate the set 0 is not complete because it refers to more particles than  but it includes all states generated unitarily from and the incident atom 1 elegance and enigma the quantum interviews ed m schlosshauer springerverlag berlin heidelberg 2011 see pp 141160 for a range of opinions on this question 2 m schlosshauer j kofler and

a case of reversible decoherence 52 the internal degrees of freedom of the individual detectors are sufficient to produce decoherence see appendix a and hence they comprise the relevant environment 13 external degrees of freedom could contribute but not decisively and they certainly do not mediate interactions between the detectors 53 to define 0 more precisely it is the microscopic state of the 1 configuration at the time when the outcome 1 is recorded this is the time when the measurement is completed 43 54 t b batalhao a m souza r s sarthour i s oliveira m paternostro e lutz and r m serra
