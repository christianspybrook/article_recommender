abstract

a significant fraction of isolated white dwarfs host magnetic fields in excess of a megagauss observations suggest that these fields originate in interacting binary systems
where the companion is destroyed thus leaving a singular highlymagnetized white
dwarf in postmainsequence evolution radial expansion of the parent star may cause
orbiting companions to become engulfed during the common envelope phase as the
orbital separation rapidly decreases lowmass companions will tidally disrupt as they
approach the giants core we hydrodynamically simulate the tidal disruption of planets and brown dwarfs and the subsequent accretion disc formation in the interior of
an asymptotic giant branch star these dynamically formed discs are commensurate
with previous estimates suggesting strong magnetic fields may originate from these
tidal disruption events

introduction

white dwarfs wds with magnetic field strengths in excess
of a megagauss mg are observed in both isolated and binary systems ferrario et al 2015 wds in binaries can either be attached the companions radius extends past the
equipotential surface and mass transfer is occurring through
l1 or detached the companions radius is well within the
equipotential surface between 25 and 36 of wds in attached binary systems are highly magnetic polar or intermediate polar cataclysmic variables while the remaining systems have submg or nonmeasurable fields ferrario et al
2015 pala et al 2020 in contrast wds in detached binary
systems seldom host strong magnetic fields with only 10 of
the over 3000 found to date rebassamansergas et al 2016
parsons et al 2021 lastly about 10 of isolated wds have
measured field strengths in excess of a mg these objects are
commonly referred to as high field magnetic white dwarfs
hfmwds kawka et al 2007 liebert et al 2003 in each
of these cases the origin of the wds magnetic field strength
is an area of active research
hfmwds tend to be more massive than their isolated
nonmagnetic counterparts liebert 1988 this suggests


gcg3642gritedu

 2021 the authors

that hfmwd formation may require some type of mass
transfer during binary interactions additionally a primordial field origin in which magnetized white dwarfs are descendants of apbp stars is unable to explain the quantity and field strength distribution of hfmwds in the solar
neighborhood kawka  vennes 2004 kawka 2020 if the
origin were truly independent of binary interactions then
the presence of a detached binary should not affect the incidence of magnetic fields however in contrast to the 10
of isolated white dwarfs that host strong magnetic fields not
a single young magnetic white dwarf has been observed in
a detached binary1 kawka et al 2007 liebert et al 2003
therefore the formation channel for strong magnetic fields
in wds likely requires binary evolution tout et al 2008
nordhaus et al 2011
recently research on binary formation for magnetic
white dwarfs has focused on pathways that involve common
envelope evolution cee tout et al 2008 nordhaus et al
2011 ferrario et al 2020 in cee one of the stellar components experiences radial expansion creating an envelope

the systems in rebassamansergas et al 2016 and parsons
et al 2021 all contain older wds and companions with high
rochelobe filling factors the latter may indicate a history of
mass transfer ie not necessarily detached

during subsequent mass transfer event in the postce system or in a merger if the companion disrupts during the
ce phase tout et al 2008 nordhaus et al 2007 2011
ohlmann et al 2016a
double degenerate wdwd mergers are one proposed
pathway to create isolated hfmwds wickramasinghe 
ferrario 2000 garcaberro et al 2012 in this scenario
the resultant object is a massive white dwarf with a hot differentially rotating corona that may amplify magnetic fields
via a dynamo this seems unlikely to explain the complete
distribution of isolated hfmwds as the average mass of
hfmwds is only about 01 m more than the average
mass of nonmagnetic wds furthermore a small number of
hfmwds have been discovered in young stellar clusters in
these settings only the most massive wds would exist the
remnants of the most massive intermediate mass stars and
therefore mergers of two of these objects would have resulted
in type ia supernovae caiazzo et al 2020
here we focus on ce phases that result in the merger
of a white dwarf with a less massive companion mdwarf
brown dwarf or planetary companion nordhaus et al
2011 nordhaus  spiegel 2013 guidarelli et al 2019 during cee the companion does not possess sufficient energy
to eject the envelope and emerge in a shortperiod orbit instead the orbital separation decreases until the companion
is tidally disrupted as it nears the protowhite dwarf core
the disrupted material forms an accretion disc that may
amplify the magnetic field and advect it to the white dwarf
surface where it could anchor
previously we showed that such discs survive thermal
evaporation in the hot stellar ambient medium and remain
stable for at least 100 orbits guidarelli et al 2019 however these results assumed a disc formed from disrupted
material was already present and thus are contingent on
assumptions about the initial mass and disc geometry we
chose to verify that these assumptions are reasonable and
to obtain further insight we numerically simulate the dynamics of the tidal disruption events and subsequent disc
formation some work has been done on massive star binary
mergers with lowmass companions investigating the long
term evolution of angular momentum as well as the surface abundances chatzopoulos et al 2020 wu et al 2020
tidal disruption events around white dwarfs have also been
investigated malamud  perets 2020 veras et al 2014
however there have been no simulations investigating disc
formation and structure from tidal disruption around the
core of an asymptotic giant branch agb star
in this paper we present highresolution threedimensional adaptive mesh refinement amr simulations
of tidal disruption events involving 10 20 and 30 mj 2 companions inside the core of an agb star that was evolved

2

mj is the mass of jupiter

from a 2 m zeroagemainsequence star we find that an
accretion disc typically forms within six orbital periods at
1r  approximately 60 of the disrupted material orbits in a disk while the rest remains gravitationally bound
in the tidal tail even though the disc dynamically forms
its resultant structure is similar to the initial conditions assumed in our previous work guidarelli et al 2019
the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2
we describe our numerical techniques and initial conditions
in section 3 we analyze the evolution of the global angular
momentum present the resultant radially averaged angular
velocity profile of the disc quantify the fraction of tidallydisrupted mass that forms the disc analyze the flow properties and discuss how our results depend on resolution we
discuss future work and conclude in section 4

numerical setup

we perform 3d hydrodynamic simulations of tidal disruption events tdes with 10  20 and 30 mj companions around the 056 m core of an agb star in contrast
to ce simulations that utilize the entire star sand et al
2020 chamandy et al 2019a chamandy et al 2019b 2020
ohlmann et al 2016b 2017 de marco et al 2011 ricker
 taam 2008 ricker  taam 2012 we focus on the inner
1012 cm to study the dynamics of the tidal disruption event
 this results in a highereffective resolution than what is
typically achieved in global ce simulations that simulate
the entire primary star
the companions were initialized just outside the tidal
disruption radius we define this as the distance of the secondary from the center of mass of the primary agb core
where the companions gravitational binding energy is equal
to the average differential external potential multiplied by
the diameter of the planet this separation is given as

rtidal 

25  n mcore
3
mp

12
rp 

1

where rp and mp are the companion radius and mass
and mcore is the mass of the protowd agb core this assumes that the planet is a polytrope with index n and the
companions radius is small compared to the separation
the companions were given an initial orbital velocity
that was 65 of the keplerian velocity at that radius this
conserves computational resources as it ensures tidal disruption within one orbit the simulations were run for over 100
orbits of the innermost regions of the disc after it formed
and at least six orbits of the disc at 1r ie the approximate outer edge of the disc we investigate the dynamics of
the tidally disrupted matter the fraction of initial mass that
forms the disc the disc geometry and the timescale of disc
formation details of the numerical grid initial conditions
modifications to the stellar profile and other aspects of the
numerical implementation are described below

numerical grid parameters

to carry out these simulations we utilize astrobear an
eulerian threedimensional 3d multiphysics code cunningham et al 2009 carrollnellenback et al 2013 asmnras 000 18 2021

box size is 2  1012 cm3  the spline softening radius of the
central particle is 1010 cm we simulate approximately one
day of physical time consistent with six orbits at the outer
radii of the resultant disc and over 100 orbits at the softening
radius

initial condition generation and modification

to generate interior profiles for both the agb star and the
companions we utilize mesa modules for experiments
in stellar astrophysics version 12115 paxton et al 2011
2018 2019 mesa is a spherically symmetric stellar evolution code that is capable of simulating the interior density
pressure temperature and composition profiles of a star over
mnras 000 18 2021

figure 2 density as a function of radius for the planetary companions having an effective polytropic index n  15 because the
profiles are already flat within 109 cm the smallest grid cell they
do not require a point particle or modification the density corresponding to the flat outer section is the average agb density in
the companion vicinity this section is appended to the profile to
create an initial comoving envelope of relatively low density material which reduces the effects of the shock between the orbiting
companion and stationary ambient material

various epochs of its evolution we calculate the full evolution of a primary star with a zeroagemainsequence mass
of 2 m with solar metallicity massloss on the red giant
branch rgb is governed via a reimers massloss prescription with a reimers massloss coefficient r  07 reimers
1975 on the agb we use a bloecker massloss prescription
with a massloss coefficient b  of 07 bloecker 1995 for
the simulations reported in this paper we select the density
and pressure profiles when the radius attains its maximum
extent on the agb these sphericallysymmetric profiles are
mapped onto the grid and form the initial conditions for the
agb ambient

the simulated time the arrows represent velocity and use the
same color scale as in figures 35

figure 8 azimuthally averaged momentum per unit mass perpendicular to radial position at different times of the 10mj simulation
the black curve is the keplerian velocity profile about a point
particle of mass 0565 m mpp  while our simulations result in
elliptical discs we expect circularization in a few more orbital
time scales when this occurs the disc will still be subkeplerian
as pressure gradients will offset some gravitational force

221

figure 7 the total angular momentum as a function of time
within a cylinder of diameter 80 the simulation box side length
the 5 dip in angular momentum at 6 hr is caused by a small
amount of material accelerated by the companion that exits the
cylinder only to slow down and fall back in the the following few
hours as indicated by the gray shaded region at 13 hr the tidal
arm passes through the cylinder boundary and causes the total
angular momentum within the cylinder to decrease accordingly

similarly we use mesa to generate hydrostatic density and pressure profiles for each planet and brown dwarf
companion with the built in make planets module one
can create an initial 1d hydrostatic profile allow this profile
to relax and form a core and expose the profile to expected
radiation we initialize our companion with solar metallicity values of y  025 and z  002 and select these profiles
before cooling and core formation which results in a slightly
larger estimate for the tidal disruption radius note that a
typical core contributes  10 of the planet mass

agb profile modification

because of the large range of scales inherent to agb stars
we utilize a point particle to represent some of the mass
in the central region were a point particle not employed
the steep density gradients in this region would be underresolved resulting in numerical instability on small scales
and an inaccurate gravitational potential at larger scales
once implemented point particles allow for the original
steep density profile to be replaced with a flatter profile
however point particles also require a modification to the
gravitational potential as underresolved small separations
lead to extraneous acceleration therefore to maintain a
proper representation of the potential when implementing a
point particle we modify the density profile in accordance
with a smoothed gravitational potential acting on the surrounding material this modified profile is shown in figure
1
we modify the density and pressure distributions using
a method previously described in guidarelli et al 2019
specifically we construct a numerical integrator to iterate
over solutions to the modifiedlaneemden equation this
yields a modified density and corresponding pressure profile that maintains hydrostatic equilibrium for any choice of
initial profile and smoothing function this code is publicly
available3 and is useful for generating hydrostatic initial conditions for 3d simulations involving evolved stars guidarelli
et al 2019 ohlmann et al 2017 chamandy et al 2018

222

planet and brown dwarf comoving envelopes

in contrast to the agb initial conditions the planetary
profiles could be imported to the 3d grid without modification as the smallest gridcell accurately resolves all
density gradients however because the pressure gradients

give the surrounding ambient a spherical shell of thickness
05 r p  the same initial velocity as shown in figure 2 while
shocks are expected the initial steep pressure gradient significantly lengths the computational time by adding this
lowdensity shell of comoving material the initial shock dissipates quickly allowing subsequent shocks to develop naturally

results

figures 3  5 present the density distributions in the orbital
plane from each simulation at 66 132 and 198 hrs these
times correspond to 2 4 and 6 keplerian orbits at the
outer disc radii in each panel we also show the velocity in
units of the local keplerian circular speed from these images it is clear a disc begins to form within 20 hrs regardless

of the initial companion mass within the first few hours the
planets disrupt dispersing the angular momentum the material that gains angular momentum forms a tidal tail and
moves outward while material that loses significant angular
momentum falls inward the main differences between these
simulations stem from the increase in total linear momentum during disruption the more massive companions transfer more linear momentum to the primary core because the
core then moves in the direction of this momentum material
in the opposite direction becomes more dispersed
thermal evaporation seems to play a minor role as the
disrupted companion mass remains relatively distinct from
the hot stellar interior at the end of the simulations 60
of the initial companion mass resides in the disc the material in the tidal tail remains bound and may fall back on
longer timescales
to quantify the effect of resolution on our results we
present a snapshot from an identical 10 mj simulation at
lower resolution in figure 6 although more dispersive the
lower resolution simulation is dynamically and morphologically consistent with the higher resolution run

angular momentum evolution

the total angular momentum within a cylinder of radius
08  1012 cm is shown in figure 7 as a function of time for
each of the simulations in all cases angular momentum is
conserved to within 5 until material from the disrupted
companion leaves the computational grid at 13hrs
the distribution of angular velocity for the 10 mj planet
is shown in figure 8 each color represents a different time in
the simulation in reference to the keplerian velocity black
line as the planet moves inwards density and angular momentum diffuse radially by the end of the simulation the
angular velocity profile matches the concavity of the keplerian solution the difference in magnitude is the result of
a noncircular elliptical disc as well as pressure support
within the disc

figure 9 presents density contours of the disc taken from
slices through the point particle perpendicular to the orbital
plane at various angles indicated by color in this figure
we included an image of a 10mj disc from our previous work
for comparison guidarelli et al 2019 in aggregate the
contours provide an estimate of the height to radius ratio of
the disc we find that for these discs hr varies from 005
in the inner regions to 025 in the tidal tail consistent with
our previous work guidarelli et al 2019 the temperature
in a vertical slice through the disc is shown in figure 10 and
demonstrates that posttidal disruption the disk remains
distinct and cold compared to the hot ambient

conclusions

in this work we present the results of 3d hydrodynamic simulations of tidal disruption events of planet and brown dwarf
companions in the interior of an agb star these events are
expected to form accretion discs which may result in conditions that amplify and anchor strong magnetic fields to the
protowd nordhaus et al 2010 as massloss from the
agb star continues during its evolution a hfmwd would
eventually emerge we show that for planetary and brown
dwarf companions tidal disruption results in the formation
of an accretion disc around the protowd which typically
occurs within a few orbital timescales about 60 of the
original companion mass forms the disc with the remaining 40 in the tidal tail and subject to fallback on longer
timescales lastly the innermost region of our tidal discs are
morphologically similar to that of the disc initial conditions
assumed in our previous work guidarelli et al 2019
once the disc is formed advection of magnetic flux
through the disc or its surface might transport the field to
the white dwarf note that this would occur on radial accretion timescales4  1 month for a standard disk which is
much shorter then a typical agb lifetime 1056 years
within the environment of a stellar envelope however
a buildup of pressure may halt accretion in the absence of
a pressure release valve a pressure release valve could be
provided by jets chamandy et al 2018 the magnetic field
itself may incite vertical outflows which act to relieve pressure in essence forming a selfsustaining conveyor belt of
magnetic flux until the field gets large enough to inhibit
further advection future work should therefore include a
study of the dynamics of tidal disruption when the companion andor stellar ambient are initially magnetized
