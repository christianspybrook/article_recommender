we investigate the dynamic evolution and thermodynamic process of a driven quantum system
immersed in a finitetemperature heat bath a bornmarkovian quantum master equation is formally derived for the timedependent system with discrete energy levels this quantum master
equation can be applied to situations with a broad range of driving speeds and bath temperatures
and thus be used to study the finitetime quantum thermodynamics even when nonadiabatic transition and dissipation coexist the dissipative landauzener model is analyzed as an example the
population evolution and transition probability of the model reveal the importance of the competition between driving and dissipation beyond the adiabatic regime moreover local maximums of
irreversible entropy production occur at intermediate sweep velocity and finite temperature which
the lowdissipation model cannot describe

introduction

the open quantum system with a timedependent
hamiltonian simultaneously incorporates coherent driving and unavoidable environment noise and can therefore describe a broad range of physical systems controlled
by outside agents related problems include quantum
transport 1 adiabatic quantum computation 25 optimal quantum control 6 and dissipative manybody
systems 710 in particular the recent development
of quantum thermodynamics has advanced research on
timedependent open systems 1113
although efforts have long been made to develop an
appropriate description of dissipative quantum dynamics
with driving 14 no method is suitable for all the situations slowly driven and periodically driven systems
are the two cases studied most and formalisms based on
the adiabatic master equation 15 16 and floquets theory 1720 have been widely employed moreover various numerical methods have been proposed for this issue
such as quasiadiabatic propagator path integral quapi
21 influence functional formalism 22 shortiterative
lanczos method 23 hierarchical equations of motion
24 quantum trajectories 25 and variational method
26 27
however a general master equation is still needed
this is especially so when the dissipation and nonadiabatic transition are comparable a case that usually
occurs for dissipative systems with energylevel avoided
crossings assuming that the driving changes slowly relative to the bath correlation time a markovian master
equation has been proposed and applied to the dissipative landauzener lz model 28 however this assumption is unnecessary and the validity of the master
equation is not constrained by the adiabatic condition as
was pointed out in ref 29 with an elaborate discussion

of the definitions and relations of different dynamic time
scales
in this article we derive a timedependent quantum
master equation tdqme for systems with discrete
energy levels adopting nakajimazwanzig projective
method 30 in the adiabatic frame of reference this master equation is justified beyond the adiabatic approximation the advantage of this approach is that the nonadiabatic transition and the dissipation are completely decoupled in the equation thus the magnitudes and time
scales of these two crucial factors can be separately considered which offers great convenience in understanding and even controlling driven dissipative quantum systems the time evolution and transition probability of
the dissipative lz model are calculated for demonstration these results indicate our method can be used beyond the adiabatic condition and verify the conclusions
drawn in ref 29
furthermore we can straightforwardly evaluate the average values of thermodynamic quantities such as heat
work and entropy in nonequilibrium processes the dependence of the irreversible entropy production on the
total evolution time determines the tradeoff relation between the efficiency and output power of a heat engine
3133 which is generally linear in the lowdissipation
regime 3436 beyond the lowdissipation regime we
reveal that the irreversible entropy production changes
nonmonotonically with the sweep velocity and temperature in the context of the dissipative lz model therefore equipped with the tdqme one can extend the optimal control of the finitetime quantum thermodynamic
processes 37 to the wider parameter regime with profound physical phenomena
the remainder of the paper is arranged as follows section ii formally derives the tdqme section iii presents
the example of the dissipative lz system and the calculation of the dynamics and lz probability of the system

in deriving the master equation for a timeindependent
system we usually carry out a secular approximation according to the system eigenvalues by dropping the fast
oscillatory terms the resulting dissipation rate eij 
is then a function of the energy level difference eij between the two related eigenstates ii and ji 30 this
approach is often generalized to the timedependent open
quantum system by substituting the timeindependent
eij in eij  with the instantaneous eigenvalue difference eij t this naive approach requires that the system
hamiltonian changes slowly the meaning of the word
slowly here is twofolds 1 the adiabatic theorem 38
is satisfied such that all the nonadiabatic transitions can
be neglected and 2 the system changes slowly relative to
the bath correlation time such that the dissipative rate
changes following the instantaneous eigenvalues working in the adiabatic frame of reference is a convenient
way of deriving a quantum master equation that is justified for an arbitrary driving protocol and a wide range
of driving speeds

a

adiabatic frame of reference

generally a timedependent open system is described
by the hamiltonian
ht  hs t  hb  v

1

where hs t is the system hamiltonian hb is the heat
bath hamiltonian and v describes the systembath interaction we assume that the interaction v is weak and
all the timedependent terms are taken into account by
hs t the system hamiltonian can be diagonalized as
hs t 

x

en tntihnt

2

n

where nti is the instantaneous eigenvector and en t
is the corresponding eigenvalue under the adiabatic approximation the unitary evolution of a timedependent
system with hamiltonian hs t and initial state nt0 i
is described as
n ti  ein tin t nti

where we define the dynamic and adiabatic phase factors
z t

the unitarity of u t can be easily proved from the orthogonal completeness of n ti u t maps the timedependent state n ti to the instantaneous eigenstate
nt0 i of time t0  which can be arbitrarily chosen for convenience we also incorporate the transformation of the
heat bath in u t the transformed total hamiltonian is
then given by
ht  u  thtu t  iu  t

 hs t   t
here the transformed system hamiltonian reads

where
nm t  ieinm t hntti

9

and nm t  n t  m t n t  n t  n t it
is seen from eq 8 that hs t only includes the nonadiabatic transitions ie the transitions between the different instantaneous eigenstates moreover the nonadiabatic transition coefficient nm t is proportional to
hntti whose magnitude usually increases with the
driving speed therefore hs t can be neglected when
the adiabatic theorem is satisfied otherwise we should
consider its contribution to the dissipative dynamics of
the driven open quantum system
the transformed systembath interaction is written as
 t  u  tv u t

10

which is now time dependent we should keep all the
rotating wave and counterrotating wave terms in the
systembath coupling v to ensure the secular approximation is carried out correctly in the adiabatic frame of
reference

b

nakajimazwanzig projective approach

we follow the standard nakajimazwanzig projective
operator method 30 to derive the tdqme such that
the nonadiabatic transition and dissipation can be considered in the same framework in the adiabatic frame of
reference defined above the quantum liouville equation
reads
d
t  iht t  ltt
dt

11

3
here t is the density operator of the total system
in the adiabatic frame and relates to the operator t
in the original frame according to t  u  ttu t
the liouville superoperator lt can be decomposed into
two parts l  l0  li  where
l0 t  ihs t t

12

li t  i t t

13

then l0 describes the nonadiabatic evolution while li
describes the systembath interaction that should be
treated perturbatively
the projective operator p is defined as
p t  trb t  b  s t  b 

14

we see that p maps t to a direct product of
the reduceddensity operator of the system s t and
that of the heat bath b  as the systembath coupling is weak it is reasonable to assume that the
heat bath is always in thermal equilibrium ie b 
exphb trexphb  the orthogonal projective
operator q is defined by
qt  t  p t
2

15
2

p and q satisfy the relations p  p q  q and pq 
qp  0 we also assume that the expectation value of
odd orders of  t is zero which can be written with
superoperators as pli t1 li t2     li t2n1 p  0
the quantum liouville equation can be decomposed
into two coupled equations by applying p and q to
eq 11

p t  pltp t  pltqt

furthermore we adopt the markovian approximation
by substituting the integral variable s  t  s in eq 20
and eq 22 and assume ts  t considering that
the system density operator changes slightly within the

kt s  pli tt e

as seen from the dissipative lz model below eq 23
is proportional to the bath correlation function which
quickly decays within the short time scale b  therefore
rs contributes to eq 23 mainly during 0  s  b 
such that we can safely approximate rs  1 which is
equivalent to assuming that

formally integrating eq 17 we obtain

where greens function g t s is defined as

d ql 

state t0   s t0   b  such that qt0   0 using
pli tp  0 and l0 tq  ql0 t we only keep the
master equation to the second order of li and approximately write

21

in deriving eq 20 we also adopt the born approximation by assuming the initial state is a direct product

26

this condition is generally easy to be satisfied even if
the adiabatic condition 38 is no longer justified
combining eqs 202326 and tracing over the bath
degrees of freedom we finally obtain the general form of
the tdqme
d
s t  l0 s t  lb s t

27

where l0 is defined by eq 12 and lb is expressed as

28
the reduced density operator of the system can be
obtained by solving eq 27 and then transforming back into the original frame using s t 
trb u ts tu  t the transformation u t takes the
responsibility of the adiabatic evolution if there is no
nonadiabatic transition or dissipation u t adiabatically
rotates the system following the instantaneous eigenstates

4
it is noted that as indicated in ref 29 the tdqme
in the weak systembath coupling case is actually not
constrained by the condition 26 and can be applied to
a situation with larger nonadiabatic transitions putting
it briefly the violation of 26 implies that the nonadiabatic transition is strong such that the lb is negligible
regardless of how it is derived we will illustrate this
point in the following section taking the example of the
dissipative lz problem

tdqme for a linearly driven twolevel system

the linearly driven twolevel system interacting with a
bosonic bath is an ideal model with which to demonstrate
how to apply the tdqme as it is both simple enough yet
contains almost all the essential ingredients of dissipative
open systems this model is also a good playground
in which to study finitetime quantum thermodynamics
if we focus on the physics with avoided crossing point
this model becomes the wellknown lz model with the
hamiltonian

with  1 z the trigamma function we can also choose

however the convergence of the matsubara expansion is
much slower at low temperature

time evolution

the two most important and competitive ingredients of
the dissipative lz system namely the lz transition and
dissipation are now separately described in eq 27 by
the unitary evolution l0 s t and nonunitary evolution
lb s t respectively the unraveling of the dynamic
processes allows us to clarify how the lz transition and
dissipation contribute on different time scales

relaxation rate  t and dephasing rate z t as functions
of the evolution time t different sweep velocities are chosen in
the a slow v2  01 b intermediate v2  1 and c
fast v2  10 regimes the nonadiabatic transition eg t
black dashed line is a lorentzian peak with width 2lz and
maximum v2 the relaxation rate  t has a dip around
t  0 and its magnitude decreases with temperature t  
25 for the orange solid line and t   1 for the blue solid
line the dephasing rate z t dotdashed lines appears
on the same time scale as eg t but its magnitude is much
smaller here we set   0001 and c  10

we plot eg t  t and z t as functions of the
rescaled time tlz in fig 2 for different sweep velocities v2  01 1 and 10 at both high temperature
t  25 and low temperature t   both  t and
z t decrease with temperature while eg t is independent of temperature consistent with our discussion
in sec iiia the lorentzian line shape of eg t lies
at the avoided crossing point t  0 where there is a
sharp decline of  t the height of eg t linearly
increases with the sweep velocity entering the nonadiabatic regime v2  1 the lz transition overwhelms
the dissipation the relaxation rate  t has two maximums located around t  2lz  beyond which  t
exponentially decreases to zero on a time scale of about

2c v the curves of  t are similar to but lower than
those of  t and are not presented here
in the adiabatic regime v2  1  t is almost a
symmetric function of t as shown in fig 2a this is
because when lz fl b  we can approximately rewrite
eq 42 as

47

where n  1exp  1 and the expressions on
the right are obvious even functions of time equations 4647 are usually directly employed in the adiabatic master equation 33 42 but they are no longer
justified if v rises into the nonadiabatic regime and should
be derived on the basis of eq 42 as shown in fig 2c
with v2  10 two peaks of  t becomes asymmetric
and  t slightly oscillates on top of an exponential decay when t  2lz at t  25 in this nonadiabatic case
 t becomes negative for a short time as soon as t  0
the appearance of negative  t means the relaxation
turns into pumping however this anomaly does not
have a notable effect as it only lasts for an instant and
the lz transition is overwhelming simultaneously
the dephasing rate z t is approximately proportional to sin2 t and contributes along with eg t in
the time domain the effect of this term is to reduce
the coherence between the states et0 i and gt0 i or
equivalently that between the diabatic basis  i and  i
as we set the initial evolution time t0 fi 0 in the following calculation the energylevel shift s t is not shown
here considering its effect on the dynamics is negligible
if the systembath coupling is weak
the time evolution of the populations p t 
hs ti    are shown in fig 3 the sweep velocities of the subplots in each row are v2  01 1 and
10 from top to bottom the left right panel shows the
high low temperature cases with t   25 t   1
the time evolution starts at t0  40lz with the initial
state t0 i   i and ends at tf  40lz  outside this
period the dynamics becomes trivial because everything
decays to zero as shown in fig 2 we also plot two sets of
curves for comparison ie pl0 0 represents the population calculated by manually closing the nonadiabatic
transitions l0 s t  0 while plb 0 represents the
population in the original lz problem without dissipation lb s t  0
as shown in fig 3ad with v2  01 in the
adiabatic regime p t coincides well with the curve
pl0 0 t because the dissipation lb s t dominates the time evolution and the lz transition can be neglected when the bath temperature is high as t   25
in fig 3a the thermal excitation prevents  i from
completely transferring into  i and p tf  is thus
smaller than 1 which is different from the original unitary lz problem however if the temperature is low as
t   1 the heat bath cools the system to a new ground
state after passing the avoided crossing point whose ef

fect coincides with the adiabatic evolution thus all the
three sets of curves overlap in fig 3d
the effects of nonadiabatic lz transition emerge when
the sweep velocity gradually increases to v2  1 as
shown in fig 3be p t  0 is slightly higher
lower than pl0 0 t  0 because the lz transition prefers to reserve more population in the initial state
 i a fast oscillation with small amplitude appears
on p t  0 this is the typical signature of the lz
dynamics if we further increase the sweep velocity to
v2  10 the dynamics of the dissipative lz model
are similar to those of the original lz model because
of the relatively weak dissipation the small disparity
between p t  0 and plb 0 t  0 in fig 3d
when t   25 is evidence of thermal excitation which is
barely noticeable in the lowtemperature case fig 3f
we emphasize that the dissipative lz system generally cannot finally relax to the instantaneous thermal

cause the dissipation vanishes when the timedependent
energy gap is much larger than the bath cutoff frequency
c  as a result the system will evolve into a steady
state with an effective temperature higher than that of
the heat bath if we ignore the coherence we can define a timedependent effective temperature of the system as teff t  2ee t lnp tp t which increases
with the growing v teff tf  even becomes negative when
v2  10 implying the populations are inverted ie

it is not only interesting but also of practical importance to study how the dissipation interferes with the
lz transition indeed the opensystem version of lz
probability has received broad and longlasting interest

analogously define the lz probability p v by replacing the unitary evolution in eq 48 by the dissipative

figure 3 time evolution of diabaticstate populations of the dissipative lz model the initial state is chosen as  i the
evolution starts at t0  40lz and ends at tf  40lz  from top to bottom the two subplots in each row correspond to
v2  01 1 and 10 the left right panel is the high low temperature case with t   25 t   1 the populations
p t calculated using the tdqme are plotted with solid lines for comparison we also plot the populations evolutions in
the cases without the nonadiabatic transition l0  0 and without the dissipation lb  0 other parameters are the same
as those in fig 2

we calculate p v with tf  t0  100lz  such that
the time evolution is long enough to cover all the nonadiabatic and dissipative processes in fig 4 we plot
both p v at various temperatures and plz v with respect to the logarithmic value of v except for the lowtemperature cases of t   1 in the adiabatic regime
p v decreases with increasing v as we mentioned in the
last subsection the relaxation is active only on a time
scale inverse to v thus the system decouples with the
heat bath at an earlier time as v increases before it is in
equilibrium and greater populations remain in  i as
the sweep velocity further increases entering the region
v2  1 the gradually enhanced lz transition starts to
compete with dissipation and eventually dominates the
evolution therefore a local minimum of p v appears
around v2  1 and then p v quickly decreases with v
increasing into the lz regime v2 fl 1 the residual
effect of the heat bath in the regime 1  v2  10 is
reflected by the small disparities of p v above plz v
we note that the nonmonotonicity of the lz probabil

ity is more apparent in the case of longitudinal system
bath coupling than in the case of transverse coupling discussed here where the relaxation plays a more important
role see appendix a our results obtained using the
tdqme method are well consistent with those calculated using the quapi 41

the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the
entropy does not decrease in a closed system accordingly the total entropy production usually termed as
irreversible entropy production sirr t is always nonnegative and can be decomposed as
sirr t  st  se t  0

52

here st  st  st0  and se t  qtt is the
entropy decrease of the heat bath due to the output heat
current in finitetime processes the system is generally
in a nonequilibrium state and the irreversible entropy
production sirr t serves to characterize the deviation
of the system away from equilibrium 51 52
it is usually believed that the leading order of sirr t
is inversely proportional to the total evolution time under the lowdissipation assumption  ie sirr tf  
1tf  t0  31 which has been confirmed both theoretically 33 35 and experimentally 36 in systems
without energy level avoided crossing the validity of
the lowdissipation assumption requires there should be

no retard of equilibrium which readily occurs in fastdriving processes to explore the behavior of sirr t in
a broader region we start with the calculation of st
and se t in the dissipative lz model we initialize the system in a thermal equilibrium state s t0  
ehs t0  trehs t0   and then let the system evolve
from t0  40lz to tf  40lz  when the system finally
approaches a nonequilibrium steady state
in the highsweepvelocity region v2  10 the lz
system evolves in an almost unitary way under the slight
effect of the heat bath as a result stf  and se tf 
quickly approach zero with increasing v as shown in
fig 5a and c even when the temperature is much
higher than  eg t   100 the lz transition is still
hundreds of times larger in magnitude than the dissipation during t  lz  lz  hence the dissipation can be
safely neglected meanwhile when the sweep velocity is
low eg v2  1 the lz transition becomes negligible such that the system tends to adiabatically follow its
instantaneous eigenstates while exchanging heat with the
bath a lower sweep velocity means that more population remains in the initial adiabatic basis and the change
in system entropy stf  decreases accordingly in the
intermediate region 1  v2  10 the lz transition and
the adiabatic following compete with each other which
largely disturbs the population distribution and results
in local maximums of stf 
local maximums of stf  also appear when we
change temperature and fix the sweep velocity fig 5b
in the lowtemperature limit as t  approaching 1 the
dissipation is too weak to substantially affect the unitary
evolution and stf  thus decreases to a small value
at hightemperature limit as t   100 the critical issue of small stf  rises from the fact that the entropy
of a binary distribution changes less when the entropy is
greater consequently no matter how much the initial
state populations are changed by the subsequent dynamics stf  is bounded by ln 2  st0  which is small for
a hightemperature initial equilibrium state
the entropy flow se tf  as functions of the sweep velocity and temperature is presented in fig 5c and d
respectively at the high sweep velocity limit or high
temperature limit se tf  is extremely small for a reason similar to that for stf  we note that se tf 
is small at the high t limit also because se tf  equals
the heat absorption rescaled by 1t  furthermore the
heat absorption is positively relates to the variation rate
of the population difference between two instantaneous
eigenstates which is greatly suppressed at high t  more
sophisticated behavior of se tf  appears at low temperature t   10 in the intermediate sweep velocity
region which is consistent with the nonmonotonic region
of p v in fig 4 where the lz transition is maximally
affected by dissipation
the irreversible entropy production sirr tf  is plotted as functions of v and t in fig 6a and b respectively its behavior can be understood by combining the
above results which are not repeated here as shown

figure 6 irreversible entropy production sirr tf  as functions of a v and b t  the lowdissipation regime has low sweep
velocities and high temperatures where sirr tf  changes linearly with v other parameters are the same as those in fig 5

in fig 6a sirr tf  linearly increases with v only in
the region of low v v2  1 and high t t   50
beyond which sirr tf  has a nonmonotonic dependence
on v being linearly proportional to v is equivalent to
being inversely proportional to tf  t0 in the current situation which indicates the lowdissipation regime an
important aspect of the tdqme is that regardless of
the lowdissipation assumption we can now quantitatively determine under what conditions sirr tf  reaches
a maximum or minimum which lies at the heart of designing highly efficient thermodynamic cycles it is worth
noticing that the energylevel avoided crossing can induce
more profound dynamic and thermal phenomena which
should be considered for optimization problems in finitetime thermodynamics

conclusions and outlook

we formally derived a bornmarkovian quantum master equation for the timedependent open system in the
adiabatic basis representation based on the nakajima
zwanzig projective operator method our formalism can
be applied to an arbitrary driving protocol with a broad
range of driving speeds and is justified even beyond the
adiabatic regime several authors have pointed out that
the nonadiabatic transition and dissipation hardly dominate the system dynamics simultaneously thus the adiabatic condition is not a necessary requirement in our
approach this idea is explicitly implemented in our
formalism by separating the liouville operator into the
nonadiabatic transition and the dissipation terms tak

10
ing the dissipative lz system as an example we show
that when the system is driven quickly the nonadiabatic transition overwhelms the dissipation when the
sweep velocity is decreasing the nonadiabatic transition
decreases in magnitude meanwhile it separates from the
dissipation in the time domain the validity of our approach was checked by calculating the lz probabilities
with finitetemperature heat bathes and comparing with
previously obtained numerical results
the competition between the timedependent dissipation and nonadiabatic transition plays an essential role
in determining the thermodynamic properties of finitetime processes which is clearly revealed by the dissipative lz system our calculation shows that in the case
of a system linearly passing through the avoided crossing
point the entropy heat and irreversible entropy change
nonmonotonically with the sweep velocity and bath temperature the lowdissipation regime only appears at
high temperature and for slow driving which is consistent with the usual understanding however our tdmqe is applicable in situations with parameters beyond
the lowdissipation regime and can be used for the problems such as the optimization of the performance of the
quantum carnot cycle 53 and the distributions of the
work and heat in stochastic quantum thermodynamics

equation a2 is the same as equation 39 for x t
except that cos t and sin t are interchanged as a result the relaxation only occurs within the time window
t  lz  in the longitudinal coupling case while pure
dephasing occurs outside the time window comparing
with the dissipative rates in fig 2 the relaxation in the
transverse coupling case effectively exists for longer time
than that in the longitudinal coupling case resulting in
more apparent dissipative effects
we plot the lz probability of the longitudinal system
bath coupling case in fig 7 there are two main differences from the transverse coupling case the local minimums of p v have smaller values and are at lower v in
the lowsweepvelocity regime and p v converges more
quickly to plz v when v2  1 the simple explanation is that in the longitudinal coupling case there
is relaxation when the energy gap is small at about 2
thus in the regime of low sweep velocity the bath intends to relax the twolevel system with more evenly distributed populations on the instantaneous eigenstates at
finite temperature and p v is therefore smaller than
that in the transverse coupling case in the highsweepvelocity regime as the nonadiabatic transition and relaxation occur in the same time window and the former
overwhelms the later the effect of the heat bath is totally washed out regardless of temperature our results
are consistent with the quapi results in ref 21 41
