abstract
in situ thermal transport measurement of flowing fluid could be useful for the characterization and
diagnosis of practical thermal systems such as fluid heat exchangers and thermal energy storage systems
despite abundant reports on the exsitu thermal conductivity measurement of stagnant fluids a suitable
technique for the thermal conductivity measurement of flowing fluid has been rarely reported this paper
presents the thermal conductivity measurement of flowing fluid within a pipe using a noncontact
modulated photothermal radiometry mpr technique where the surface of the pipe is heated by an
intensitymodulated laser and the heat diffuses into the fluid with suitable modulation frequency we design
a tube section with small wall thickness suitable for the mpr measurements to maximize the sensitivity of
the thermal response to the fluid properties while minimizing the lateral heat spreading effect intrinsic
thermal conductivity of different fluids was obtained within a proper range of frequency and flow velocity
where the forced convection effect is negligible the forced convection effect became prominent at high
flowing velocity and at low modulation frequency leading to overestimated thermal conductivity of fluid
it is found that the intrinsic thermal conductivity could be obtained when the flow velocity is less than 100

1 introduction
measurement of thermal conductivity of fluids is important for the design of heat exchangers 1 2
nuclear reactors 3 4 thermal energy storage systems 5 and many other thermal systems the ability of
insitu thermal conductivity measurement of flowing fluids could be useful for the operational safety and
diagnosis of these systems 6 7 despite a multitude of techniques available for the thermal conductivity
measurement of stagnant fluids including the transient hotwire thw method 8 9 steadystate method
1012 laser flash analysis lfa 13 14 3 technique6 15 16 and time or frequency domain thermoreflectance techniques tdtrfdtr17 there are still challenges of applying these techniques for insitu
diagnostics especially under the harsh environment such as high temperature andor with corrosive fluids
hong et al applied the 3 technique for the thermal conductivity measurement of flowing water and
ethanol where a thin metallic transducer layer in contact with the fluid serves as both the heater and the
thermometer they obtained the thermal conductivity of fluids at low flow velocity 15 the 3 technique
was also used for the measurement of thermal properties of flowing gases 12 18 based on the similar
principle thermal conductivity of flowing fluids has been measured using the tdtr method19 despite
the successful implementation of the insitu 3 and tdtr measurements on common fluids where
dedicated metallic transducers are needed it is still challenging to extend them for insitu measurements
under challenging conditions such as at high temperature and for corrosive fluids eg molten salts for
nuclear reactors 20 and concentrated solar power csp 21 for example to avoid the corrosion by
molten salts to the metallic transducer in the 3 method a thin protective coating eg alumina has to be
applied which not only requires timeconsuming microfabrication but also poses question on the long

term durability22 therefore a suitable technique for the insitu thermal conductivity measurement of
flowing fluids under harsh environment would be desirable
photothermal radiometry ptr using either modulated continuous wave or pulsed laser is a wellknown noncontact thermal characterization tool for bulk and coating materials 2325 in the modulated
photothermal radiometry mpr a sample is heated by an intensitymodulated laser to probe into different
depths of the sample and its surface temperature response is measured with an infrared ir detector 24
26 we have previously established the mpr technique for hightemperature measurements of bulk and
thin coating samples by using a refractory black coating for laser absorption and ir surface
thermometry25 in this work we applied the mpr technique for insitu thermal conductivity measurement
of flowing fluids within a pipe by modulating the frequency of the laser and controlling the thermal

where  is thermal diffusivity of fluid and  is the angular frequency

beyond the wall thickness of the tube and within the momentumthermal boundary layer of the fluid we
could get high sensitivity of the surface temperature response to the thermal conductivity of the fluid while
avoiding the convection effect within a certain range of flow velocity thus obtaining the intrinsic thermal
conductivity of the flowing fluid we demonstrate the mpr measurement of flowing liquids di water
ethanol dowtherm a oil and xcertherm 600 oil in a pipe with flow velocity up to 550 mm s1 the
reynolds number red  is ranging from 0 to 13000 at temperature from 30c to 170c thus covering the
stationary laminar flow and turbulent flow regimes here red is defined based on the pipe diameter d at
low flow velocity and low red  the intrinsic thermal conductivity of fluid is obtained at higher velocity
the forced convection effect becomes more prominent and the obtained effective thermal conductivity is
12

higher this transition is found to relate to the dimensionless number red pr13 where pr is the prandtl
12

number when red pr13 is less than 100 we can obtain the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the flowing
fluids the mpr technique reported here can provide a facile insitu thermal conductivity diagnostic tool
for flowing fluids with broad applications it may open an opportunity to simultaneously quantify both the
thermal conductivity and local convective heat transfer coefficient in a fluid loop

2 experimental mothed and modelling
21 experimental section
figure 1a displays the schematic of the mpr system integrated with a flowing liquid loop the mpr
system is the same as what was reported in our previous study 25 except that the test section is replaced
with a circular tube connected to the fluid loop a waveformgenerator drove a continuous wave cw
diode laser with its intensity modulated as sinusoidal function at the angular frequency of  the laser spot
size was controlled to be around 10 mm in diameter and the laser beam was homogenized from gaussian
beam into a tophat profile the test section was heated up by the modulated laser flux leading to the
oscillation of the surface temperature rise s of the sample at the same frequency  as the heating laser
s was measured based on the thermal emission from the surface collected by a hgcdte mct detector
after proper calibration using a pyrometer more details of the mpr system can be found in our previous
work 25
the schematic and photograph of the test section of the fluid flowing pipe are shown in figures 1b
and 1c respectively the wall thickness of the test section was set to be 100 m to have high measurement
sensitivity and accuracy as discussed in the later section to ensure the mechanical strength of the setup a
100 m thick stainless steel 316 ss316 sheet was wrapped into a round shape and welded onto two short
tubes of 254 mm in outer diameter and 1 mm in wall thickness on both ends the middle thinwalled
section was 10 cm long to minimize the edge effect due to the change in the wall thickness in this section
the laser spot was about 10 mm in diameter and was located at the center of the thinwalled region the
exterior surface of the tube was coated with a 30mthick pyromark 2500 black coating see figure s1 in
supplementary information during the mpr measurement the laser beam irradiated the center of the
middle thinwalled section the tube was connected to the fluid loop with the fluid supplied by a pump

22 measurement principle
figure 2a shows the schematic of the mpr measurement of a flowing fluid inside a tube the fluid is
supplied from one end of the steel tube at a fixed bulk velocity ub  an intensitymodulated laser at angular
frequency of  irradiates the surface of the middle thinwalled section the surface temperature s is
oscillating at  the thermal penetration depth lp  can be adjusted by changing  of the incident laser
the thermal emission from the tube surface is collected by an ir detector to measure the s after calibration
with a pyrometer as described in detail in our earlier work 25 figure 2b shows the schematics of the
momentum boundary layer  thermal boundary layer  and the thermal penetration depth lp during the
mpr measurement assuming laminar flow the hydrodynamic entrance length lef and the thermal
entrance length leh can be estimated by

and

where d is the diameter of the tube in our measurement red is in the range of 10013000 and pr is in the
range of 5300 therefore lef and leh are in the range of 131650 cm and 425450 cm respectively the
laser spot 10 mm diameter of the mpr measurement is located at middle of the 10cm long thinwalled
section therefore the fluid flow is still in the hydrodynamic and thermal entrance region at the position of
the mpr measurement in this region the thermal boundary layer  is always thinner than the momentum
boundary layer  as they are related by   pr 13  and pr 13 is 015058 for the fluids to be
measured to measure the intrinsic thermal conductivity of a flowing fluid the thermal penetration depth

should be smaller than both the momentum boundary and thermal boundary layer thicknesses lp 
min   in our case since  is always smaller than  lp   should be satisfied
as shown in figure 2b at high frequency lp is shorter than  and thus the convection effect is
minimized in this case the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the fluid can be obtained on the contrary at
low frequency with lp   the convection effect becomes prominent leading to overestimation of the
measured thermal conductivity of fluid it is noted that  depends on the flowing velocity and both the 
and lp depend on the thermophysical properties of the fluid and the temperature so the desirable frequency
range to obtain the intrinsic thermal conductivity may change with the fluid properties velocity and
temperature in addition lp must be larger than the wall thickness of the tube 100 m such that the
measurement is more sensitive to the fluid than the wall therefore the frequency and lp must fall within
a suitable range in general lp in the fluid is controlled to be around 150  300 m in our experiments
although the measurement is conducted in a cylindrical tube the 2d heat transfer model based on the
planar geometry can be applied as justified later within the fluid in the absence of heat generation or
viscous dissipation and assuming constant thermal properties the 2d heat transfer equation in the frequency
domain for the flow in the entrance region is

therefore equation 3 becomes

clearly for y  0 near the wall equation 6 is reduced to a pure heat conduction equation without the
advection term therefore the convection effect is only important when the temperature field reaches deep
into the boundary layer ie at the low frequency where lp is large by doing a dimensional analysis it
was found that the forced convection effect is negligible when the following condition is satisfied 15

function of  the angular frequency is in the range of 3  12 rad s1 ie f  05  2 hz and lp  150 
300 m and thus the critical velocity is  70 mm s1 to have the negligible forced convection effect the
critical velocity increases with increasing frequency because the penetration depth decreases with
increasing frequency and thus the effect of the momentum boundary layer diminishes

the above analysis only examines the velocity and momentum equation from the heat transfer
point of view lp   also needs to be satisfied in order to measure the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the
fluid as discussed earlier here we set lp  02

in addition although the mpr measurement is conducted on a cylindrical tube the heat transfer can be
modeled based on the planar geometry under certain conditions to specify these conditions the thermal
response of a cylindrical tube is compared to that of a flat plate the surface temperature rise given by the

to quantify the forced convection effect on the thermal conductivity measurement we compare the
thermal responses predicted by the stationary fluid model in equation 15 and that numerically calculated
with comsol simulation based on equation 3 the details of the comsol simulation are described in
the supplementary information section s2 the modeling parameters are shown in table 1 as shown in
figure 4a at zero bulk velocity ub  0 mm s1 the thermal responses of the analytical stationary fluid
model equation 15 and the numerical model in comsol for the flowing fluid equation 3 agree well
with each other it is evident that the thermal response can be divided into three regions the fluid dominated

10

region at low frequency where the s  vs  12 curve is linear the steel dominated region at intermediate
frequency where the slope of the s  vs  12 curve becomes smaller because the thermal conductivity of
steel is higher than that of fluid the coating dominated region at high frequency where the slope is large
due to the low thermal conductivity of coating in an earlier study we have experimentally demonstrated
that the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of different layers can be obtained from the
thermal responses at different frequencies 25 at the low frequency limit when lp is much larger than the
thickness of coating and steel the multilayer model equation 17 can be simplified as 25 29

range therefore thermal effusivity of the fluid ef can be directly obtained by measuring the slope of the
s  vs  12 curve according to equation 19 at low bulk velocity ub  10 mm s1 as shown in figure 4a
the thermal response remains the same as that of the stationary fluid therefore the intrinsic thermal
effusivity of fluid can still be obtained by measuring the slope at low frequency range lp  150  300 m
as ub increases to above 50 mm s1 the thermal response starts to slightly deviate from that of the stationary
fluid the curves start to plateau at low frequency at ub  100 mm s1 indicating higher effective thermal
effusivity in this regime or the onset of the forced convection effect at high flowing velocity the forced
convection effect becomes important leading to a higher effective thermal conductivity therefore the
critical velocity is  100 mm s1 for mpr measurement of intrinsic thermal conductivity of the fluids with

11

the experimental conditions used in this study the critical velocity predicted by the comsol simulation
agrees well with that predicted by the dimensional analysis shown in equation 8
figure 4b shows the sensitivity of s  on the thermal conductivity of the steel wall ks  pyromark
coating kc and fluid kf  calculated based on equation 15 using the parameters in table 1 the sensitivity
of s  is defined as
s 

s s 
ki ki



20

where ki is the thermal property of the steel wall coating or fluid ks  kc  or kf  for example the
sensitivity of 1 to kf means that 1 change in kf leads to 1 change in s  as discussed above s  is
more sensitive to kf at the low frequency limit long thermal penetration depth and to kc at the high
frequency limit short thermal penetration depth while in the intermediate frequency range it is also
sensitive to ks  therefore in this study kf is extracted from the thermal response in the frequency range of
05 to 2 hz lp  150  300 m where the sensitivity of s  to kf higher than 02
another important design parameter is the small wall thickness 100 m of the mpr section
which not only ensures high sensitivity of s  to kf but also limits the lateral heat spreading effect
equation 15 is based on the 1d heat transfer model which is only valid when there is no significant lateral
heat spreading effect ie with small wall thickness we analyzed the 2d heat transfer effect in the system
in supplementary information section s3 and found that when the wall thickness is less than 100 m the
measurement error of thermal effusivity of the fluid based on the 1d assumption ie equation 15 is less
than 10 in addition to satisfy the 1d assumption one should also ensure dlaser  lp 25 in our
measurement lp is  150300 m which is much smaller than the dlaser 10 mm the natural convection
effect induced by the temperature gradient is also negligible in the mpr measurement due to the short lp
as discussed in supplementary information section s4 the heat flux is calibrated using a standard material
with known thermal effusivity e according to equation 12 as shown in supplementary information section

12

s5 this approach avoids the need to precisely measure the laser spot size which is reported to be a major
source of measurement uncertainty30 the method of converting the mct voltage signal to s  is also
shown in supplementary information section s5 the mpr measurement uncertainty is 58 and the
analysis can be found in our previous work 25
3 results and discussion
31 measurement of stagnant fluids
figure 5a shows the thermal responses of different fluids at stagnant state ie ub  0 mm s1 and
room temperature all the thermal response curves can be delineated into three regions i pyromark
coating dominated region at high frequency with lp  30 m ii tube wall or substrate dominated region
in the medium frequency range where the slope is smaller due to the high thermal conductivity of the steel
the thermal responses in these two regions are the same for all the samples because the same tube with the
same coating was used iii fluid dominated region at low frequency with lp  160 m where the slope
is determined by the thermal effusivity of the fluid according to equation 18 the thermal effusivity of
1

the fluid ef is obtained from the slope of the s  vs  2 curve in the low frequency regime and the
thermal conductivity of the fluid can be calculated based on the specific heat and density of the fluids


reported in the literature 3133 figure 5b shows the normalized thermal response by the heat flux qs  in
s

the frequency range of 052 hz ie lp in the range of 180320 m ef can be directly obtained from the


slopes of the qs vs  12 curves figure 5c compares the measured thermal conductivity of different fluid
s

eexp  to the literature values elit  while figure 5d compares the measured thermal conductivity of
different fluid kexp  to the literature values klit  3133 the measurement results are within 10 error
from the literature values validating the mpr measurement of stagnant fluids this error is similar to what
we have reported for mpr measurements on bulk materials 25 the stagnant fluids can be treated as bulk
materials if the natural convection effect is negligible in our measurements lp in the fluids ranged from
180 to 320 m in the lowfrequency regime leading to rayleigh number ra of 1 to 10 for these fluids
13

the critical ra for the induction of natural convection is 1100 34 and consequently negligible natural
convection effect
32 measurement of flowing fluids at room temperature
according to the analysis presented in section 2 to measure the thermal conductivity of flowing fluids
the flowing velocity should be lower than the critical velocity to satisfy the condition of negligible forced
convection effect in this section we measured xceltherm oil and di water at room temperature with
variable flowing velocities to experimentally identify the critical velocity and compare it to the theoretical
analysis figure 6a shows the thermal responses of xceltherm oil the thermal responses for ub  0 mm s1

and 90 mm s1 coincide indicating negligible forced convection effect up to 90 mm s1 the thermal

response curves shift downwards with increasing flowing velocities indicating higher effective thermal
effusivity and thermal conductivity due to the stronger forced convection effect the effective thermal
1

effusivity of the fluid eeff  is obtained from the slope of s  vs  2 in the linear region with lp  150 300 m equation 18 and the effective thermal conductivity keff  is calculated with the literature values
of specific heat and density of the fluids figure 6c shows keff normalized to the intrinsic thermal
conductivity k0  of xceltherm oil keff k0  as a function of ub  keff k0 is within 5 of the unity when
ub  0  90 mm s1 at higher velocity keff k0 increases reaching 118 at ub  250 mm s1 and 151 at
ub  500 mm s1 this result indicates that the intrinsic thermal conductivity of xceltherm oil can be
measured at ub  100 mm s1 for the current mpr configuration consistent with our theoretical analysis in
section 2
figure 6b shows the thermal responses of di water the slopes of the thermal responses from ub  0
mm s1 and 90 mm s1 are close indicating negligible forced convection effect up to 90 mm s1 the thermal
response curves shift downwards with increasing velocities indicating higher effective thermal effusivity
and thermal conductivity due to the forced convection similar to the xceltherm oil the curve shows a
plateau in low frequency region at ub  550 mm s1 indicating a significantly higher effective thermal

14

effusivity in this region figure 6c shows keff normalized to the intrinsic thermal conductivity k0  of di
water keff k0  as a function of ub  keff k0 is within 5 of the unity when ub  0  90 mm s1 at higher
velocity keff k0 increases reaching 118 at ub  190 mm s1 the above analysis indicates that the
intrinsic thermal conductivity of di water can also be measured at ub  100 mm s1 which is close to the
prediction from the comsol simulation as shown in figure 4a and the dimensional analysis shown in
figure 3a it is also worth noting that the forced convection effect is stronger for di water than xceltherm
oil at the same flowing velocity the keff k0 reaches 310 at ub  347 mm s1 and 1130 at ub  550
mm s1 for di water versus 151 at ub  500 mm for xceltherm this is because the viscosity of oil is
higher leading to a lower red number at the same flow velocity which will be further discussed in the
later section
33 measurement of flowing fluids at higher temperature
figure 7a and 7b show the thermal responses for di water and xceltherm 600 oil respectively at the
same velocity of ub  90 mm s1 with fluid temperature t0 ranging from 30c to 170c the upper
temperature limit is set so to avoid boiling of water or ignition of oil in air like the analysis done in the
previous section eeff of fluid is obtained from the slope at low frequency and then the keff is calculated
7d compares keff of di water and the oil to the literature value k0 at different temperature keff of di
water is close to k0 from 30c to 60c for the xceltherm oil keff is close to k0 at t0  100c however
keff of the oil increases significantly at t0  100c keff k0 is 1545 and 1681 at 140c and 170c
respectively due to the strong forced convection at higher temperature the viscosity of the oil decreases
with increasing temperature and thus red increases at higher temperature leading to stronger forced
convection effect figure 7c shows the thermal responses for the oil at the velocity of ub  50 mm s1 with
to from 90c to 170c as shown in figure 7d by reducing the flow velocity to 50 mm s1 keff of
xceltherm oil agrees well with k0 at all the temperatures evidently the critical velocity varies with the
type of the fluid and the temperature which will be discussed in the next section

34 analysis of forced convection effect
to systematically study the forced convection effect we further measured the two fluids at different
velocities a xceltherm oil from 45170c with flowing velocity of 50 mm s1 90 mm s1 250 mm s1 and
300 mm s1 and b di water at 30 c with flowing velocity of 90 mm s1 190 mm s1 350 mm s1 and 550
mm s1 figure 8a shows the normalized thermal conductivity keff k0  from all the measurements of di
water and xceltherm 600 as a function of red  it can be seen that keff k0 increases with increasing red 
although the range of velocity is the same for di water and xceltherm oil red for di water is much higher
due to the lower viscosity at ub  190 mm s1 red  10000 the flow of the water becomes turbulent
leading to strong forced convection effect therefore keff also increases significantly the viscosity of the
oil decreases with increasing temperature and thus red is higher at higher temperature as a result keff
directly obtained from the measurement is increasingly overestimated compared to k0 as the temperature
increases as shown in figure 7d however compared to di water red for xceltherm is less than 10000
and the flow is still laminar within the entire flow velocity range
12

here we plot keff k0 as a function of red pr13 in figure 8b notably keff k0 of both di water
12

and xceltherm 600 follows the same trend as red pr13 increases except the outliner for di water at high
12

red pr13value 200 because the water flow is turbulent which does not follow the nud correlation
for a laminar flow the forced convection effect is negligible for both liquids at red12pr13  100 and
12

becomes increasingly prominent as red pr13 increases this agrees well with the theoretical analysis as
shown in equation 10 therefore we conclude that it is feasible to use the mpr technique developed here
to measure the intrinsic thermal conductivity of flowing fluids under the condition of both low ub and low
12

red pr13 or more generally equation 7 and equation 11 are both satisfied on the other hand this
work also suggests that the mpr could be used to probe the convection effect of flowing fluids when ub or
12

red pr13 is larger

4 conclusion
in this work we develop an mpr setup to measure the thermal conductivity of flowing fluid in a tube
by controlling the modulation frequency of heating laser beam and the corresponding thermal penetration
depth the mpr setup is first validated by the thermal conductivity measurement of stationary fluids
including diwater dowtherm a oil xceltherm 600 oil and ethanol at room temperature the measurement
error of stationary fluid is within 10 subsequently the mpr setup is extended for the measurement of
flowing fluid in the velocity range of 0  550 mm s1 and from room temperature to 170c the intrinsic
thermal conductivity of fluid can be obtained at low velocity where the forced convection effect is
minimized the forced convection effect becomes prominent at high flow velocity and low frequency
leading to the overestimation of thermal conductivity the critical velocity is determined by the
12

12

dimensionless number red pr13 modeled based on the laminar boundary layer when red pr13  100
the intrinsic thermal conductivity of fluid can be obtained the mpr technique reported here provides a
convenient tool of insitu thermal conductivity measurement of flowing fluid and shows the potential to
characterize the local forced convection heat transfer close to the wall
