abstract we put forward a twodimensional nonlinear sigma model that couples bosonic
matter fields to topological hoava gravity on a nonrelativistic worldsheet in the target space
this sigma model describes classical strings propagating in a curved spacetime background
whose geometry is described by two distinct metric fields we evaluate the renormalization
group flows of this sigma model on a flat worldsheet and derive a set of betafunctionals for
the bimetric fields imposing worldsheet weyl invariance at the quantum level we uncover
a set of gravitational field equations that dictate the dynamics of the bimetric fields in the
target space where a unique massless spintwo excitation emerges when the bimetric fields
become identical the sigma model gains an emergent lorentz symmetry in this single metric
limit the betafunctionals of the bimetric fields reduce to the ricci flow equation that arises
in bosonic string theory and the bimetric gravitational field equations give rise to einsteins

1 introduction
string theory has been serving as a powerful paradigm for addressing fundamental questions in
theoretical physics as a quantummechanically consistent framework that admits a massless
spintwo excitation string theory provides a natural arena for testing outstanding ideas about
quantum gravity it has been long known that different superstring theories are corners of a
single elevendimensional theory of supermembranes dubbed mtheory however unlike string
theory which can be defined perturbatively with respect to the genera of riemann surfaces
there is no simple way of justifying a perturbative expansion in membranes another difficulty
of defining a quantum theory of membranes comes from the lack of quantization techniques
1 it is widely believed that the hypothetical mtheory is inevitably strongly coupled and
should be probed by exploring nonperturbative regimes of string theory
in 2 a rather different approach towards a quantum theory of membranes is pioneered
which is designed such that its groundstate wavefunction reproduces the partition function of bosonic string theory this construction introduces a space and time anisotropy in
the worldvolume and the membranes are described by a threedimensional nonlinear sigma
model nlsm at a z  2 lifshitz point where z denotes the critical dynamical exponent
implying that the worldvolume degrees of freedom enjoy a quadratic dispersion relation and
are fundamentally nonrelativistic the nlsm is coupled to threedimensional hoava gravity
on the nonrelativistic worldvolume the worldvolume anisotropy induces a preferred foliation
structure by leaves of constant time which allows one to consistently restrict the sum over
threemanifolds in the membrane theory to be a set of more tractable foliated manifolds
bypassing some of the major difficulties in the construction of quantum membranes
the membrane theory introduced in 2 referred to as membranes at quantum criticality
opens up the study of a new spectrum of powercounting renormalizable sigma models coupled
to worldvolume hoava gravity of different dimensions in the flat worldvolume limit the
worldvolume admits isometries generated by time and space translations supplemented with
the spatial rotations but there are no boost symmetries this spacetime is nonrelativistic and
known as aristotelian spacetime 3 4 at renormalization group rg fixed points the sigma
models develop various anisotropic scaling invariances ie lifshitz scaling symmetries and
become of the lifshitztype one important step forward is to understand the appropriate
target spacetime geometries to which the branes strings described by such lifshitztype
sigma models should be coupled this requires a thorough analysis of the rg flow structure
of these nonrelativistic sigma models which still remains underexplored
in this paper we focus on the simplest example of the infinite hierarchy of lifshitztype
sigma models a twodimensional sigma model at a z  1 lifshitz point that describes classical
strings propagating in spacetime which is the stringy analogue of the threedimensional sigma
model for membranes at quantum criticality at the z  1 lifshitz point the space and time
have the same scaling dimension however the nlsm is generically nonrelativistic because

where x   x  t x    0 1     d  1 are worldsheet fields that map the worldsheet
 to a ddimensional target space without any neither lorentzian nor galilean boost
symmetry on the worldsheet the background fields g and h are independent symmetric
twotensors assuming that these twotensors are nondegenerate the geometry of the target
space described by g and h has a bimetric feature 1 although the worldsheet is not
boost invariant the target space is lorentzian see 23 the action 11 defines a unitary
and renormalizable quantum field theory at the rg fixed point where g  h  the
action 11 develops an emergent lorentz symmetry on the worldsheet and underlies standard
bosonic string theory with the target space geometry encoded in a single metric
for the sigma model 11 to describe nonrelativistic strings moving in a bimetric spacetime we will couple the matter fields x  to appropriate worldsheet gravity that lacks any
local boost symmetry ie hoava gravity in twodimensions which is topological and has
the notion of a preferred time direction we will discuss how to couple the sigma model to
dilaton fields on a curved worldsheet at least at the classical level this forms an essential
ingredient towards understanding whether our nlsm is ultimately qualified as a consistent
quantum theory of strings that generalize the standard string theory if there indeed exists a
notion of perturbative string theory for the lifshitztype nlsm 11 we will have a simple
example that goes beyond the framework of relativistic bosonic string theory 2 this hypothetical bimetric string theory would define us a bimetric quantum gravity alternatively if
there arise any obstacles for defining such bimetric string theory with two distinct spacetime
metrics at the quantum level we would have a rather strong nogo theorem that reinforces
the uniqueness of relativistic string theory
regardless whether our sigma model can ultimately be promoted to be a fullfledged
quantum theory of strings the renormalization of the lifshitztype sigma model 11 already
presents a welldefined and challenging problem in this paper we will mostly focus on the
betafunctionals of the background metric fields g and h in 11 3 imposing worldsheet
weyl invariance at the quantum level leads to vanishing betafunctionals which give rise
to a set of field equations that define a novel bimetric gravity this is analogous to how
einsteins gravity arises in twodimensional relativistic sigma model on a curved spacetime
background we will analyze the linearized bimetric gravity and reveal that in the free
1

lifshitztype sigma models that describe supermembranes propagating in a bimetric spacetime have been
discussed in 5 which we will review later in 4
2
different notions of nonrelativistic strings already exist in the literature see eg 612 these theories
of nonrelativistic strings arise as different corners embedded in relativistic string theory with various galileantype boost symmetries along other lines certain classes of multigravity have been shown to arise in relativistic
string theory 13 in contrast the lifshitztype sigma models are beyond relativistic string theory
3
the betafunctionals will be expressed as a taylor expansion with respect to g  h that we take to be
sufficiently small see 333

theory perturbing around flat spacetime there is one massless spintwo gauge field together
with other tensorial degrees of freedom that satisfy the kleingordon equation this rg
calculation not only provides us with an opportunity for probing exotic bimetric geometries
but also constitutes essential first steps towards a vast landscape of generically nonrelativistic
theories of strings and membranes 4 where relativistic string theory only emerges at a corner
with lorentz symmetry
the paper is organized as follows in 2 we define our sigma model coupled to twodimensional hoava gravity on the worldsheet and show that this sigma model describes
strings moving in a bimetric spacetime when a timereversal symmetry is imposed in 3
we use the heat kernel method to compute the oneloop betafunctions of the bimetric sigma
model on a flat worldsheet in terms of a taylor expansion with respect to the difference
between the metric fields this result is summarized in 389 in 4 we discuss generalizations of the string sigma model to classical theories of membranes at quantum criticality
we conclude the paper in 5 in appendix a we present the full result of the heat kernel
coefficient that is relevant to the betafunction calculation

2 classical strings in a bimetric geometry
in this section we construct a nlsm that maps a twodimensional nonrelativistic worldsheet
 to a ddimensional spacetime manifold m equipped with two metric fields we first define
the desired nonrelativistic symmetries of the worldsheet generically excluding any lorentzian
nor galilean boost transformations the dynamics of the worldsheet geometry is described
by twodimensional hoava gravity at a z  1 lifshitz point which is topological we will
couple scalar fields to this twodimensional nonrelativistic gravity and build up a sigma model
that describes classical strings moving in a bimetric geometry
21 elements on hoava gravity
we start with a brief review of hoava gravity following 2 14 which we will use later to describe the worldsheet geometry hoava gravity lives on a d  1dimension spacetime manifold  equipped with a foliation by leaves of codimension one which are slices of constant time

we will use the coordinates t x  xi  i  1    d that are adapted to the foliation structure the dynamics of this foliated geometry is described by the adm formalism variables
originally introduced in the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity where the relativistic spacetime metric is decomposed into the lapse function n  the shift vector ni  and the
spatial metric ij 15 in hoava gravity the adm variables are used to define the time length


element ds2t  n 2 dt2  and the space length element ds2l  ij n i dt  dxi n j dt  dxj 
which are a priori unrelated 16 the time space length is measured in the time space
unit t l  with
dimdst   dimt  t 

dimdsl   dimx  l

21

in the particle case however the sigma model is defined on a worldline and identical to the relativistic
case with a unique metric encoding the target space geometry

it follows that the classical dimensions of the adm variables are
dimn   1 

dimni   lt 

dimij   1 

22

at rg fixed points the classical theory develops anisotropic scale invariance with the dynamical critical exponent z  such that t  lz  which leads to the scaling dimensions for the

in this convention energy is of scaling dimension one
the gauge symmetries in hoava gravity are diffeomorphisms that preserve the foliation

infinitesimally we write t  t and xi   i t x  the adm variables transform under

which forbids terms that are odd in time derivatives in addition we impose the anisotropic

we will soon construct the nlsm that couples scalar fields to twodimensional hoava gravity
requiring that the anisotropic weyl invariance 210 hold classically as well as at quantum
level will give rise to a set of consistency equations that dictate the dynamics of the target
space geometry
in flat limit we have the ground state solution n  1  ni  0  and ij  ij  this
ground state solution possesses the isometries

where  and  i parametrize translations in temporal and spatial directions respectively and

boost symmetry is aristotelian spacetime 3 4 in the special case when z  1  however the
isometry group of the ground state solution is enlarged to the poincar group that incorporates
the lorentzian boosts
22 dynamics of worldsheet geometry
we define the worldsheet to be a twodimensional manifold   equipped with a codimensionone foliation structure the coordinates on the worldsheet are t x  x1   we also require
the foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms 25 on the worldsheet

23 sigma models in a bimetric spacetime
we are ready to couple scalar fields to the worldsheet geometry presented in 22 and construct the sigma model that describes classical strings propagating in a bimetric geometry
define the worldsheet scalar fields x  t x    0  1      d  1 that map the twodimensional worldsheet  to a ddimensional target space m  we require that x  transform
trivially under the worldsheet foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms timereversal symmetry
and weyl transformation coupling x  to the worldsheet gravity introduced in 22 gives
rise to the following sigma model action

where x    0 and g x and h x are arbitrary functionals of x   all the terms in
224 are marginal the background fields g and h are a priori unrelated due to the
lack of any boost symmetries that transform the worldsheet coordinates t and x into each

ie both g and h transform as a symmetric twotensor field under the condition that
these twotensor fields are nondegenerate they are both qualified as metric fields therefore
the sigma model defined in 224 that consists of lifshitz scalars at a z  1 lifshitz point
describes strings moving in a target space whose geometry is encoded in two metric fields
we will refer to this type of geometries as a bimetric geometry intriguingly even though
the worldsheet lacks any boost symmetry the target space geometry has the full lorentzian
boost symmetry as we will see in later discussions the bimetric geometry that arises in
our sigma model deviates drastically from the ones considered so far in the literature also
note that the sigma model we consider here does not accommodate any kalbramond field
which breaks the timereversal symmetry 215 in a variant of our sigma model that we
will soon introduce in 24 the timereversal symmetry is explicitly broken and the same
kalbramond term considered in relativistic string theory can be included
the nambugoto formalism of 224 can be obtained readily by integrating out the

worldsheet gravitational fields n    and nx in the path integral since there is no prop
agating degrees of freedom in our worldsheet gravity we can eliminate n    and nx by
taking their equations of motion to be onshell there are two independent equations of
motion from varying these worldsheet gravitational fields

the virasoro constraints in bosonic string theory however unlike the relativistic worldsheet
theory we do not have enough diffeomorphism to fix e to one instead the virasorotype

that underlies bosonic string theory the distinction here is that instead of fixing the full
relativistic diffeomorphisms we fixed part of the foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms followed

by the special choice n    1 to obtain 236 this implies that we have a rather
different brst symmetry and ghost action therefore the resemblance between 236 and
the relativistic string action is only at the classical level
24 timereversal breaking and trimetricity
we mentioned earlier that the sigma model defined in 224 does not accommodate any
kalbramond term which explicitly breaks the timereversal symmetry 215 that forbids
any terms containing both space and time derivatives however the timereversal symmetry
is not an essential ingredient in our formalism explicitly breaking the timereversal symmetry
not only enriches the worldsheet topologies but also introduces a plethora of extra lagrangian
terms that include the kalbramond term each of these extra terms is an infinite sum of
a series of marginal operators invariant under the foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms and
the weyl invariance

where q is a symmetric twotensor and b is an antisymmetric twotensor that plays the
role of a kalbramond field the novel qterm arises due to the lack of local boost symmetry
on the worldsheet
without the timereversal symmetry there are three extra gravitational terms that contain both temporal and spatial derivatives and transform as scalars under the foliationpreserving diffeomorphisms 214

which describes sigma model in a curved background described by three symmetric twotensor
fields g  h  and q  one antisymmetric twotensor b  and four dilaton fields t 
l  1  and 2  we will not consider the quantum mechanics of this more general sigma
model that includes terms breaking the timereversal symmetry instead we will focus on the
simpler timereversal invariant case 228 in the rest of this paper

3 renormalization of bimetric sigma models
we are now ready to compute the betafunctionals for the background fields in the sigma
model 230 with the timereversal symmetry imposed we will not consider the betafunctionals of the dilaton fields in this paper which require a more thorough understanding
of the foliated worldsheet geometry and further examinations of the weyl anomalies on a
curved worldsheet from now on we simply take the flat worldsheet limit by setting e  1 
which does not affect the betafunctionals of the metric fields g and h  we will therefore
focus on the following renormalizable nlsm

we have performed a wick rotation t  i in 230 together with s  ise  note
that one is free to introduce a constant rescaling factor between the bimetric fields such that
g  g and h  c2 h  by rescaling the worldsheet fields and coordinates later
in this section we will also include the contributions from the dilaton fields to the betafunctionals of the metric fields at the lowest order in 0 that we are interested in these
contributions from dilatons are purely classical as in relativistic string theory since we are
focusing on the rg flows which only capture local properties of the system we can drop any
total derivative terms through the calculation
it is important to note that the action 31 is invariant under the following mapping

g  h 

32

this selfdual property has to be preserved in the resulting betafunctionals we will use this
duality frequently to guide our quantum calculations as well as a sanity check
31 bimetric geometry in the target space
as a preparation for quantum calculations we investigate some essential ingredients of the
targetspace bimetric geometry here some of these ingredients have been introduced in

with respect to the metric fields g and h  we introduce two levicivita connections

with the above elements of bimetric geometry in hand we are ready to use the covariant
background field method to expand the worldsheet action 31 as a preparation for evaluating
the oneloop effective action on the worldsheet we first choose g to be the reference metric
with respect to which the standard background field method can be applied consider a
sufficiently small neighborhood o of a point x0 in the target space m  for an arbitrary
point x  in o and with respect to the reference metric field g  there exists a unique
geodesic interpolating between x0 and x   parametrized by y  s  with an affine parameter

alternatively we can choose h instead of g to be the reference metric which must
be equivalent when any physical observable is concerned there also exists a unique geodesic

formula since the supplementary duality transformations in 324 also act nontrivially on
the quantum fluctuations p and q   choosing to integrate out either p or q  will lead to
betafunctionals that do not manifest the selfdual transformations this drawback can be
circumvented by taking the change of variables

33 heat kernel method for bimetric sigma models
we are now ready to use the heat kernel method to compute the oneloop effective action
associated with the sigma model 31 we start with defining the effective action then we
will review some essential ingredients in the standard heat kernel method 2325 and discuss
in detail how it is applied to our sigma model in a bimetric spacetime
331 heat kernel representation of the effective action
we start with a quick review of the heat kernel method and derive the general form of the
effective action following 2327 but with adaptions to the bimetric sigma models first we
define the associated path integral for the covariantly expanded action 330 with respect
to a reference metric g x0

even though we chose to define the measure in the path integral with respect to the reference
metric g x0  with g  detg   it does not give g any privileges in physical results as
long as we integrate out all configurations of the quantum fluctuation later on we will see
explicitly that this choice preserves the selfdual property 32 in the final betafunctionals
choosing the background value x0 such that j   se1   in the semiclassical limit the
path integral is approximated by

we have defined    g    also note that only the covariant derivatives in o that act

directly on   are shifted by i or i in 342 moreoever the bifunction i   x  0  x0
is required to satisfy the following conditions in the coincidence limit   0 and x  x0

on a curved worldsheet there exists a covariant generalization of the phase function ei  0 i xx0 
adapted to the foliation defined using the symbolic calculus of pseudodifferential operators 25 27 28 we
will not need this covariant generalization of the phase function in this paper but it will play an important
role when it comes to the betafunctionals of the dilaton fields

clearly the heat kernel coefficient e2 contributes the log divergence in the oneloop effective
action 354 this log divergence is associated with the betafunctionals of various couplings
in the sigma model the powerlaw divergences can be set to zero by choosing appropriate
counterterms
332 solving the recursion relations
now we compute the coincidence limit of the symbol 2  from which we will be able to read
off the betafunctionals by using 352 using the explicit expression for o in 332 we find

the heat kernel coefficient e2 defined in 352 which is determined by 2 and gives rise
to the log divergence in the oneloop effective action 354 further note that e2 involves
integrations over the frequency  and momentum   and only receives nonzero contributions
from terms in 2  that are even in both  and   according to 358c this implies that we
only need to keep terms in  1  that are odd in  but even in   and terms in x 1  that
are odd in  and even in   this observation brings some simplification in the calculation
which we will come back to momentarily
from the recursion relations in 357 we compute the coincidence limits for expressions

plugging the result of 2  back into 352 and performing the integrals over  and   the
heat kernel coefficient e2 can be derived the exact result after performing these integrals is
difficult to compute however as we will show in the following when the difference between
g and h is sufficiently small the heat kernel coefficient can be computed order by order
perturbatively
333 perturbative expansion of the heat kernel coefficient
we now perform the frequencymomentum integrals in the expression for the heat kernel
coefficient e2 in 352 from now on we focus on the case where the difference between g

which demonstrates that u remains unchanged if g and h are swapped the remaining
perturbative expansion in 373 can be extended to all orders in  as well leading to the
exact heat kernel coefficient since this exact expression does not take any illuminating form
we refer the interested readers to appendix a for details
further note that the effective action 371 is selfdual under the mapping 326 which
is a symmetry of the sigma model 31 that we started with this is highly nontrivial since all
the intermediate steps that eventually lead to the effective action are taken with respect to a
reference metric g  these intermediate steps eg 369 do not manifest the selfduality
transformation 32 the fact that the final effective action 371 is selfdual therefore acts
as a strong sanity check of our calculation
34 dilaton contributions
up to now we have been focusing on the flat worldsheet where the contributions from the
dilaton terms to the effective action are invisible in this subsection we revisit the dilaton
terms on a curved worldsheet and evaluate the contributions from the dilatons to the rg
flows of g and h 
recall that the sigma model on a curved worldsheet is given by 228 in the flat
worldsheet limit the dilaton term vanishes however the dilaton term in 228 still makes
nontrivial contributions to the trace anomaly

on the other hand the trace of the stress energy tensor is related to the betafunctionals of
g and  h as

t   0  x   x

for t in 382 to be absorbed into the betafunctionals in 383 we need to remove in
382 the last two terms that depend on   x  and x x x   this can be achieved by
first using the equation of motion 323 satisfied by the background field x0 
g   x0  h x x x0  0

under the duality transformation 32 we have f  f  which induces g  h 

 24 

384

which allows us to rewrite 382 as
t   x   x    t  x x  x x    l

   x   t  g h   l 

385

setting the extra   x  term to zero requires that the background fields satisfy
g  t  h   l 

386

this condition is fullfilled for example when the dilaton fields are constant as a result
t   x   x    t  x x  x x    l 

387

comparing with 383 we find that the classical trace anomaly in 382 can be absorbed
g and  h by adding the following terms
into the betafunctionals 

g

388

we emphsize that the extra condition 386 has to be imposed otherwise we would have the
extra term   x  in 385 that cannot be absorbed into any local counterterms
35 betafunctionals and coupled ricci flows
in 371 and 388 we derived the weyl anomalies in the effective action that are generated
by quantum corrections which lead to the following betafunctionals

recall that r     and    are respectively the riemann tensor and covariant
derivative defined with respect to the metric g h   under the duality map g  h 
g is transformed into  h  to map out the full rg flow structure of the
the betafunctional 

sigma model however we will also need to compute the betafunctionals for the dilaton fields
t l at the lowest order in 0  which are for example important for determining the critical
dimension if such notion still exists of the target space however the analysis of the dilaton
betafunctionals requires a more thorough understanding of the worldsheet geometry and
higherloop calculation 29 for which other techniques are needed for example evaluating
the weyl anomalies on a curved worldsheet with a foliation structure requires the method
developed in 27 which we leave for future studies
the set of betafunctionals in 389 gives rise to a notion of coupled ricci flows in the
limit h  g  the condition 386 gives  t   l     moreover the two
equations in 389 reduce to the following betafunctional in relativistic string theory

flow equation for the metric field 30 the equations in 389 can be viewed as a generalization of the ricci flow equation that governs the evolution of two different geometries in a
coupled way
36 bimetric dynamics and linearized gravity
requiring weyl invariance at the quantum level sets the betafunctionals in 389 to zero
this gives rise to the equations of motion that dictate the dynamics of the target space

together with the condition g  t  h   l in 386 here     denotes higherorder terms in 0 and   of course we also need the equations of motion from setting the
betafunctionals of the dilaton fields to zero to determine the full dynamics of the target space
geometry which we leave for future studies
in the single metric limit g  h  the spacetime equations of motion 392 reduce to
r  2     0 

393

in the case of a constant   this gives the ricci flat condition that describes einsteins gravity
in absence of matter fields in this sense the equations of motion in 392 extend einsteins
gravity to a bimetric gravity
to further understand the dynamics of the bimetric geometry we set the background
dilaton fields to be constant and focus on the linearized part of the spacetime equations of
motion in 392 it is instructive to first linearize the betafunctionals in 389 and then
impose the weyl invariance to get the linearized spacetime equations of motion we expand
the metrics g and h around the minkowskian metric  as


g    21 f  f 
h    12 f  f 
394
the infinitesimal gauge transformations of f and f are induced by 225 which at the
linearized order read

f  2          
f  0     
395
where     denotes nonlinear terms for simplicity we require the dilatons to be constant
g and  h in f
linearizing the betafunctionals

399

these expressions are invariant under the linearized infinitesimal gauge transformation 395
therefore at the linearized order from g and h we form a massless spintwo gauge field
f and a matrix f that satisfies the kleingordon equation this is not necessarily against
the usual nogo theorem that multiplets of interacting massless spintwo fields do not exist
31 even though the targetspace geometry is described by two metric fields g and h 
there is only one massless spintwo excitation formed by these two metric fields in the single
metric limit h  g  ie f  0  the extra modes are set to zero and we are left with
einsteins gravity our analysis here is only for the free theory and it requires further analysis
to determine whether the interacting theory is free of ghosts which we leave for future work 7

4 outlooks membranes at quantum criticality
since we have given up the worldsheet boost symmetry strings no longer have any privileged
position and a broader spectrum of theories that are beyond string theory present so far
we have been focusing on twodimensional sigma models that describe strings propagating
in a bimetric spacetime in the following we discuss natural generalizations to lifshitztype
nlsms that describe membranes at quantum criticality following 2 5 32
we consider worldvolume theories described by sigma models at a lifshitz point in which
case it is possible to construct quantum theories of membranes that are potentially perturbatively defined a quantum theory of membranes of this type is introduced in 2 and has been
preluded in 1 where the worldvolume theory of the sigma model is described by a threedimensional quantum field theory at a z  2 lifshitz point coupled to worldvolume hoava
gravity due to the foliation structure induced by the foliationpreserving diffeomorphism on
the worldvolume the summation over the threemanifold can be consistently restricted to be
over a specific class of foliated manifolds whose spatial leaves are riemann surfaces the spatial topology in the foliated manifold changes when the membranes interact with each other
when the threedimensional sigma model satisfies the socall detailed balance condition
ie the timeevolution of the worldsheet gravitational and matter fields is governed by a gradient flow generated by some euclidean action principle an intriguing connection to string
theory can be established as shown in 2 the quantum theory of membranes that satisfies
7

a preliminary analysis of the lagrangian formalism for the linearized equations of motion in 399 shows
that there are kinetic terms with a wrong sign which could be problematic when interactions are included
nevertheless it is possible that the related ghostlike modes are removed by nonlinear hamiltonian constraints
in the full interacting theory this endeavour requires first constructing an action principle and then performing
a hamiltonian analysis on the other hand as long as the worldsheet quantum field theory that underlies this
bimetric gravity is welldefined the worldsheet perspective will keep providing us with a solid foundation for
future studies of this exotic gravity theory

 28 

the detailed balance condition and with compact spatial topology h  has the property that
its groundstate wavefunction reproduces the partition function of bosonic string theory on
the worldsheet h  moreover the threedimensional sigma model that describes membranes
at quantum criticality inherits the rg properties of the twodimensional relativistic sigma
model that underlies bosonic string theory as a result the appropriate spacetime geometry
coupled to the membranes is the same as in string theory and the dynamics of the spacetime
geometry is described by einsteins gravity
it is however intriguing to consider sigma models that generalize the theory of membranes at quantum criticality in 2 by relaxing the detailed balance condition this will allow
us to probe more exotic spacetime geometries we will discuss different generalizations below
an especially interesting example has been introduced in 5 32 where a threedimensional
nlsms with aristotelian supersymmetry is formulated presenting a nonrelativistic ultraviolet uv completion of threedimensional relativistic n  1 supersymmetric sigma models
this lifshitztype nlsm provides a manageable candidate for a quantum membrane theory
in a bimetric spacetime
41 bosonic membranes and on  nonlinear sigma model
for simplicity we will impose the worldvolume timereversal symmetry throughout this section in the bosonic case the generalization to theories of membranes leads to a proliferation
of terms to construct such membrane theories we introduce the coordinates t xi   i  1 2

betafunctional of g is the usual ricci flow equation as in 391 with the dilaton field set

is quite intricate and described by multiple tensorial fields the sigma model 42 can also
be consistently coupled to the worldvolume weylinvariant hoava gravity which does not
possess any propagating gravitational degree of freedom 2

42 still deviates from its relativistic counterpartner in an interesting way the marginal

the rg flows of the nlsm in 43 have been evaluated in 34 35 intriguingly projected
in the 1 2 plane the rg flows possess multiple fixed points depending on the value of d 
in particular there is one rg fixed point that is independent of d at 1  2  0  at this
common fixed point in the 1 2 plane the theory exhibits the detailed balance properties
the betafunction calculation of the od nlsm 43 is already rather involved due to the
presence of the terms that are quartic in spatial derivatives when it comes to the nlsm
42 in general target spaces the proliferation of tensorial structures in spacetime poses more
challenges which might require new techniques to tackle with
42 supermembranes in a bimetric spacetime
just like the case of the on  nlsm imposing the detailed balance condition on sbrane
in 42 significantly simplifies the quartic derivative terms at the meantime the detailed
balance condition also forces g  h  nevertheless it is indeed possible to simplify
the quartic derivative terms but still allow a bimetric structure in the target space this is
achieved in 5 32 by introducing aristotelian supersymmetry in three dimensions generated
by two real supercharges q1 and q2 that form a multiplet q    1 2 
we follow closely 5 below and review the basic ingredients in the construction of the
theory of supermembranes in a bimetric spacetime the same superspace formalism for
lifshitztype on  sigma models can be found in 37 we start with some conventions
define the twodimensional dirac gamma matrices

16 for related discussions since we are zooming in around the uv z  2 lifshitz point
here we will tune the coupling c to zero in the following discussion

we use the convention d2    1  at the rg fixed point g  h  the theory is closely related
to the effective action in the context of stochastic quantization with the parisisourlas supersymmetry see
eg 38 at equilibrium the action 412 in the single metric limit reduces to a twodimensional euclidean
theory which coincides with the action of the harmonic topological sigma model on a flat worldsheet 39 40

this significantly simplifies the bosonic action 42 while retaining the bimetric natural of
the target space it is manifest that the matter fields have a quadratic dispersion relation
the supersymmetric nlsm describes classical membranes propagating in a bimetric
spacetime however unlike the twodimensional sigma model 31 in a bimetric spacetime
which is selfdual under the transformation 32 now in 412 the metric fields g and
h are not on the same footing anymore therefore we expect genuinely distinct betafunctionals for g and h in the membrane action 412 powercounting renormalizable
nlsms of this type can also be constructed in higher dimensions these nlsms exhibit different lifshitz scaling symmetries and in principle lead to an infinite hierarchy of multitensorial
targetspace geometries

5 conclusions
in this paper we considered a novel type of twodimensional nlsms defined on a nonrelativistic worldsheet that lacks any local lorentzian nor galilean boost symmetries the
worldsheet dynamics is described by topological hoava gravity imposing the worldsheet
timereversal symmetry the sigma model is coupled to a pair of metric fields and describes
classical strings propagating in a bimetric spacetime we analyzed the rg flows in the bimetric sigma model and derived the betafunctionals of the bimetric fields in 389 up to
the fourthorder in the taylor expansion with respect to a small deviation away from equal
metric this set of betafunctionals form a pair of coupled ricci flow equations in the limit
where the two metric fields are identical to each other the coupled ricci flow equations reduce
to a single ricci flow equation that arises as the betafunctional in relativistic string theory
imposing weyl invariance at the quantum level we discover the equations of motion that govern the dynamics of the background geometry in the bimetric sigma model in the linearized
bimetric gravity there emerges a massless gravitational excitation which is accompanied by
other degrees of freedom that satisfy the kleingordon equation in 399

 32 

our study of lifshitztype sigma models hints at new bimetric gravity theories different
versions of bimetric and multimetric gravity theories have been studied extensively in the
literature a general formulation of bimetric gravities is introduced in 43 see also 20 21
using which a special version of bimetric gravity is put forward and shown to be free of
singularities while preserving the general covariance principles 44 along other lines in
the context of massive gravity a modern version of bimetric gravity see eg 45 46 and
references therein has been constructed which has the attractive feature of being free of
the boulwaredeser ghosts 47 and also bears applications to cosmology the electroweak
hierarchy problem 48 the fractional quantum hall effect in condensed matter theory 49
et cetera furthermore it has been shown in 13 that related multimetric description of
massive gravity also arises in the context of nonlocal multistring theory 50 nevertheless
the bimetric gravity considered in our work does not seem to fit into any of the previously
existing models to further the understanding of the bimetric gravity that arises in our
work and to identify its relation to existing bimetric theories one imminent future task is to
construct a gravitational action principle that gives rise to the spacetime equations of motion
found in this paper and analyze the hamiltonian constraints to determine the actual degrees
of freedom the fact that our bimetric gravity arises from a stringtheoretical setup makes it
promising that the full interacting theory might be free of ghosts
the main focus of this paper has been the betafunctionals of the spacetime bimetric
fields however to map out the complete rg structure of the twodimensional lifshitztype
sigma model one also needs to determine the betafunctionals for the dilaton fields for which
detailed rg properties of the worldsheet hoava gravity is required some useful techniques
have been developed in the literature see eg 27 5155 this piece of calculation will be
essential for understanding the notion of critical dimensions in lifshitztype sigma models
further investigations of the foliated worldsheet topology will be important for revealing
whether there exists a welldefined perturbative expansion with respect to a unique effective
string coupling formed by the two dilaton fields in 228 it will be fascinating to find
out whether our nonrelativistic sigma model can ultimately be promoted to describe a selfconsistent quantum theory of strings that generalizes relativistic string theory
the concepts and techniques developed in this paper are applicable to a large class of
lifshitztype sigma models that map pbranes to novel spacetime geometries described by
multitensorial fields we have discussed two natural generalizations in the paper the first
variant that we introduced in 24 is by explicitly breaking the timereversal symmetry in
our sigma model which leads to a twodimensional sigma model in a trimetric spacetime
geometry coupled to a bfield and multiple dilaton fields later in 4 we studied a second
variant that is a threedimensional supersymmetric sigma model describing membranes at
quantum criticality following 5 32 understanding these new ingredients will boost the
exploration of the mostly uncharted territory of lifshitztype nlsms providing an arena for
probing new geometries and alternative constructions of quantum membranes
