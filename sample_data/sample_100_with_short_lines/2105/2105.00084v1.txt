we present largeeddy simulations less of riverine flow in a study reach in the sacramento
river california the riverbed bathymetry was surveyed in highresolution using a multibeam
echosounder to construct the computational model of the study area while the topographies were
defined using aerial photographs taken by an unmanned aircraft system uas in a series of
field campaigns we measured the flow field of the river using the acoustic doppler current profiler
adcp and estimated using largescale particle velocimetry of the videos taken during the
operation uas we used the measured data of the river flow field to evaluate the accuracy of the
lescomputed hydrodynamics the propagation of uncertainties in the les results due to the
variations in the effective roughness height of the riverbed and the inflow discharge of the river
was studied using uncertainty quantification uq analyses the polynomial chaos expansion
pce method was used to develop a surrogate model which was randomly sampled sufficiently
by the monte carlo sampling mcs method to generate confidence intervals for the lescomputed velocity field also sobol indices derived from the pce coefficients were calculated to
help understand the relative influence of different input parameters on the global uncertainty of
the results the uq analysis showed that uncertainties of les results in the shallow near bank
regions of the river were mainly related to the roughness while the variation of inflow discharge
leads to uncertainty in the les results throughout the river indiscriminately
1 introduction
the use of computational fluid dynamic cfd models has become more prevalent in hydraulic
modeling of natural systems in recent years due to improvements in highperformance computing
capabilities advanced numerical models can provide meaningful insights into the threedimensional 3d flow structures naturally occurring in riverine environments for example 3d
computational models can help to understand better the dynamics of the secondary flow at meander
bends and vortex shedding processes from manmade obstructions such as bridge foundations and
spur dikes kang et al 2020 2021 khosronejad flora  kang 2020 khosronejad flora
zhang et al 2020 khosronejad  sotiropoulos 2017 the early use of cfd models for the
study of rivers was limited by computing power to relatively coarse computational meshes and
employed timeaveraged reynolds averaged navierstokes rans turbulence closure models
fischerantze et al 2008 liang  fotis 2005 liu  garca 2008 rther et al 2010 wilson
et al 2003 recently more sophisticated highfidelity models using detached eddy simulation
des and large eddy simulation les have provided the capability to capture even greater spatial
and temporal details of the flow constantinescu et al 2011 kara et al 2015 khosronejad

kozarek diplas et al 2015 khosronejad kang et al 2019 for instance les models for fullscale rivers like the mississippi river in minnesota and the feather river in california have
recently been modeled using les khosronejad le et al 2016 khosronejad flora  kang
2020 despite these massive improvements in the resolution of the hydrodynamic in rivers little
attention has been paid to quantifying the results relative uncertainty highly detailed flow
structures may have resulted from considerable uncertainty in modeling parameters and methods
leading to an excessive level of confidence being placed in modeling results furthermore the
precision offered by highly detailed and impressive results derived from sophisticated numerical
models that were processed by overwhelming computing power may still lead to misleading or
even worse incorrect interpretation
uncertainty in numerical modeling arises from many factors which can be broadly divided
into five primary types 1 modeling uncertainty 2 discretization and truncation errors 3
convergence errors and 4 computer roundoff errors sadrehaghighi 2020 some of these
sources of error can be estimated or minimized through increased computational effort such as
using higherorder numerical schemes smaller temporal and spatial steps and specifying reduced
tolerance for reaching convergence celik et al 2008 however the uncertainty associated with
modeling is often due to model simplifications limited knowledge of model parameters boundary
conditions or accurate calibration data these types of sources of uncertainty cannot be eliminated
or easily reduced which makes it necessary to quantifying these types of errors to enable a more
comprehensive understanding of the model results in particular hydrodynamic modeling of
natural waterways has many sources of uncertainty this is due to the spatial nature of the domain
which is typically large highly complex and whose boundaries are frequently changing in a
typical river heterogeneity of the channel bed materials variations in density and types of
vegetation and complex shapes on the bed including bedforms and pools make it impossible to
capture this degree of variation fully and requires many modeling simplifications casas et al
2010 flora  khosronejad 2021 lawless  robert 2001 warmink et al 2011
in addition to topography the inflow boundary conditions could be complicated by
hydrological ambiguity and the error associated with the flow field measurements being generated
by rare meteorological events a sufficiently large number of historical flow rates are often lacking
at the model location leading to the statistical uncertainty for desired flows of interest
additionally hydrologic uncertainty remains regarding the recorded flow rate data which are
typically derived from rating curves with inherent errors in both the method and the associated
discharge measurements di baldassarre  montanari 2009 pelletier 1988 nowadays
acoustic doppler current profilers adcps are commonly used for estimating discharges in
natural streams because of their relative speed and accuracy however adcps are known to have
many potential sources of error including operator error programming errors instrument errors
and extrapolation errors near the bed water surface and channel banks mueller  wagner 2009
muste et al 2010 muste yu  spasojevic 2004 schmalz et al 2012 additionally when used
for calibration of numerical models adcp data can suffer from the practical difficulty of
obtaining enough passes over the same transect line to provide a reliable timeaveraged velocity
from the instantaneous data it measures nevertheless with proper operation and postprocessing
muste yu pratt et al 2004 it is possible to determine accurate average turbulence intensities
and timeaveraged velocity field by equally sampling fluctuations higher and lower fluctuations
than the mean value fernndezgonzlez et al 2017 muste yu  spasojevic 2004
uncertainty in highfidelity modeling associated with adcp measurements used for inflow flow
rates was explored in this study
2

another field measurement for riverine models which can be subject to error is inaccurate
or incomplete mapping of the bathymetry of the channel casas et al 2006 legleiter et al 2011
in a case study pasternack et al pasternack et al 2006 estimated that 21 percent of the predicted
depth error in a twodimensional 2d model could be attributed to the errors in topographic
resolution moreover in 3d modeling accurate bathymetry data is critical for determining not
only mean flow characteristics such as depth and mean velocity values but turbulent structures and
secondary velocity components as well keylock et al 2012 lane et al 1999 the uncertainty
associated with delineation of the channel bed surface can result from several sources of
measurement error such as faulty echosounder readings spatial inaccuracies owing to poor quality
gps positions and unaccounted rotations of the boat and sonar transducer besides the low spatial
resolution of the sonar readings caused by low sampling rates or overly wide spacing between
adjacent vessel passes can result in missing essential features in the bathymetry and produce
overly simplified channel surfaces many of these errors can be reduced or eliminated using 1
more precise equipment such as augmenting gps with an inertial navigation unit inu for
improved spatial accuracy and 2 a multibeam echosounder mbes when possible instead of a
singlebeam echosounder a comparison of les results from mbes and singlebeam sonar data
showed improved bathymetric resolution reduced nearbed velocities and shear stresses but
increased the number of turbulent structures in areas with highly irregular topography flora 
khosronejad 2021
resistance in a channel can be due to many sources including instream obstacles such as
vegetation and bridge piers bank irregularities meander bends bedforms and roughness due to
individual grain particles recking et al 2008 robert 2003 while the larger features may be
captured in bathymetrictopographic survey data and resolved directly in the discretization of a
highfidelity model the surface roughness of the individual grains cannot be practically resolved
when modeling a natural river instead wall models are employed to account for this type of
resistance wall models capture different degrees of surface roughness or grain sizes by assigning
an equivalent roughness height value k  which is proportional to a characteristic grain size
unfortunately there is no general consensus among researchers for the constant of proportionality
or which specific grain size among the distribution of grain sizes one should use camenen et al
2006 chanson 2004 has provided a summary of equivalent roughness heights of several past
researchers regarding flow resistance which ranged between 15d by sumer 1996 in cases of
sheet flow to 3d by van rijn 1984 in bedload transport of experimental and field data other
researchers have argued that k is not only a function of grain size but is a function of the bed load
transport camenen  larson 2013 sumer et al 1996 yalin 1992 and the dimensionless
settling velocity rate as well camenen et al 2006 regardless the general lack of consensus
creates uncertainty in what value of k is appropriate for use in wall models this study seeks to
investigate how the grain roughness uncertainty impacts the hydrodynamics simulation results of
a fieldscale river
hence the objective of this study is to 1 collect bathymetric and flow measurement data
for a case study in a reach of the sacramento river in california 2 conduct highfidelity largeeddy simulations less of the river flow and 3 quantify the uncertainty in the hydrodynamic
results of the river flow for two input modeling parameters discharge and the equivalent roughness
height specifically the inflow rate will be varied based on the measurement uncertainty identified
from the adcp measurements at multiple transects in the river reach also a range of equivalent
roughness height parameters will be used in the wall model to determine how changing the
3

characteristic grain size will alter the flow velocities of this natural river to quantify the combined
uncertainty of the les results polynomial chaos expansion pce and monte carlo mc
simulations will be used to provide approximate velocities at select transects over a continuous
range of input parameters to generate a 95 percent confidence levels for the computed velocity
fields sobol indices also known as variancebased sensitivity analysis which are used as a form
of global sensitivity analysis were determined to estimate the relative impact each of these two
parameters has on the hydrodynamics simulation results finally the computed depthaveraged
velocity magnitudes along adcp transect lines and velocity profiles at select locations were
compared against the measured flow field data
the governing equations and the wall model used in the numerical model are introduced
in section 2 next the case study and the field data collection for the river bathymetry and flow
field measurement are discussed in section 3 subsequently the computational details boundary
conditions and the range of input parameters for the les are described in section 4 afterward
the uncertainty quantification procedures are described in section 5 followed by presenting and
discussing the les results and uq analysis of the computed flow field in section 6 finally
conclusions concerning the importance of assessing uncertainty in numerical modeling of natural
rivers are presented in section 7
2 numerical framework
to simulate instantaneous 3d incompressible turbulent flow for our case study we use our inhouse opensource cfd code the socalled virtual flow simulator vfsgeophysics model
the successful use of vfsgeophysics for simulating flow in natural waterways has been well
documented giang  hong 2019 kang  sotiropoulos 2012 khosronejad le et al 2016
khosronejad kang et al 2019 khosronejad flora  kang 2020 for implementing les in
vfsgeophysics model the curvilinear immersed boundary curvib method described by ge
and sotiropoulos ge  sotiropoulos 2007 is used to resolve the arbitrarily complex geometric
shapes associated with a natural river bathymetry such as channel bedforms vegetation bridge
piers and irregularly shaped banks in the context of the immersed boundary method ibm a
structured background mesh is used for the flow domain the solid boundaries of objects such as
the channel banks and channel bed are treated as unstructured triangular meshes which are
superimposed inside the flow domain fig 1 the ibm classifies each node inside the flow
domain as either a solid fluid or immersed boundary ib node  as depicted in fig 2 as seen
the nodes shown in the slice in fig 2a are designated in fig 2b as either 1 solid nodes red region
which are removed from the computations 2 fluid nodes blue region which reside outside of
the solid boundary where the governing equations for the flow computations are applied or 3 the
ib nodes white circles within the gray region adjacent to the boundary where the velocities are
reconstructed using a wall model

figure 2 a schematic of a slice taken through channel bed b is an enlarged view of the area
near the riverbed b shows the classification of the background mesh into fluid solid and ib
nodes and the location of the nodes adjacent to the wall boundary where the wall models are

in the vfsgeophysics model the implementation of les is fully described by kang et
al kang et al 2011 and uses the following algorithm from the smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs
model smagorinsky 1963

the log layer and reads as follows khosronejad et al 2011

study k will be varied to observe how changes in the equivalent roughness height in the wall
model influence the hydrodynamics of the river
3 case study sacramento river at knights landing
31 site description
the sacramento river is a major river in northern california with headwaters in the klamath
mountains which flows over 700 km into the san francisco baydelta approximately 50 km
upstream from the city of sacramento the sacramento river makes a sharp bend  as it passes
through the town of knights landing ca which is the site for this case study fig 3 the reach
of interest for our simulations is approximately 610 m long with a twolane highway bridge on
route 113 crossing the river just downstream from the meander bend the bridge has piers at each
bank protected by timber fenders causing only a minor contraction of flow at the crossing fig 4
the river in this location is confined by levees on each bank and has an average channel top width
of about 70 m during our field data collection stage during our field investigation the mean flow
depth in the channel was about 33 m with a deep section approximately 85 m deep along the outer
bank located at the channel bend a side tributary called sycamore slough enters the sacramento
river along the right bank near the midlength of the study area irrigation water flows into the
slough through a gate located about 400 m upstream from the confluence on sycamore slough
however this inflow is considered an insignificant addition to the main channel flow in the
sacramento river

32 field measurements
in december 2020 we collected three types of field data 1 aerial photogrammetry and video
imagery 2 adcp flow field and 3 bathymetric survey herein the measurement methodology
equipment used and the results of each type of data collection are described briefly below videos
and images were taken at the site using a dji phantom 4 unmanned aircraft system uas almost
700 4k still photos were taken from an altitude of about 60 m and used to generate topographic
data this imaging technique is based on the structure from motion sfm fonstad et al 2013
methodology which uses opensource software of opendronemap drone mapping software opendronemap nd the elevation data above the water surface fig 5 was tied into the 30
ground control points surveyed using a trimble geoexplorer 7x gps unit this unit allows for
augmenting the bathymetric survey data to generate a complete digital map of the river within the
study reach

10

figure 5 textured model showing the measured above water topographic data derived from
aerial photography using sfm for sacramento river at knights landing flow is from the top right
to the bottom
during the same day over 20 aerial movies were taken from the field site using the same
dji phantom 4 uas these animations were used to produce still images which were then
processed using largescale particle image velocimetry lspiv to obtain the water surface
velocity field of the river lspiv was first used by fujita 1997 to monitor a flood event in japan
in 1993 since then others have successfully employed this method to estimate the water surface
velocity field and turbulence of riverine environments fujita et al 1998 jin  liao 2019 lewis
 rhoads 2015 sutarto 2015 lspiv is an extension of particle image velocimetry piv
commonly used in laboratories where water is seeded with particles and tracked with highspeed
cameras to study flow dynamics in flumes with lspiv naturally or artificial seeded particles
floating on the water surface are similarly tracked over multiple video frames to estimate the
surface velocity magnitude and the direction of the flow herein the videos were shot normal to
the water surface from a stationary uas for between 30 and 60 seconds and included at least two
control targets with measured coordinates within the field of view the control targets enable the
scaling of the measurements during the postprocessing of the data the water surface flow
characteristics were analyzed for the most promising videos based on the quantity of seeding using
11

open source software ie river patalano et al 2017 using only natural seeding consisting
primarily of bubbles and small vegetal debris on the water surface this software is a graphical
user interface for the matlab tool pivlab designed specifically for lspiv processing as seen
in fig 6 the seeding and lighting on the water surface varied significantly and strongly influenced
the quality of the results in fig 6b regions 2 and 4 have minimal seeding and poor lighting
conditions therefore the lspiv processing could not effectively resolve the velocity directly requiring the program to extensively interpolate these regions from the resolved velocities in
regions 1 and 3 despite minimal seeding region 1 still provided reasonable velocity data which
compared favorably with the other velocity measurements see section 6 however the excessive
uncertainty in the lspiv velocities proved too great to provide useful flow field data for this study
the computed depthaveraged results taken as 85 percent of the surface velocities are presented in
section 6
on december 15 2020 adcp streamflow measurements were collected using a teledyne
rd workhorse rio grande 1200 khz adcp and their winriver ii data acquisition software
spatial data for the survey was obtained using the advanced navigation spatial dual inertial
navigation unit inu based on the measured stage from lspiv data collection of the previous
week the stage of the river was nearly identical in total 17 adcp transects were made for the
sacramento river at 5 locations with three locations being upstream from the highway bridge and
two locations downstream  see fig 7 flow rates from each transect are shown in table 1 with
an average flow rate of 1305 m3s with a standard deviation of 47 m3s variability in the
measurements could be primarily attributed to operator error and a minor inflow from the
sycamore slough stream that was measured to be equal to 53 m3s each of the five transect
locations was postprocessed using the velocity mapping toolbox vmt software available from
the usgs parsons et al 2013 using vmt multiple transects at each location were combined
to provide a single set of velocity values along a spatiallyaveraged crosssection to provide a more
timeaveraged depiction of the flow than the instantaneous velocities measured during each
transect fig 8 the velocity values were also depthaveraged and used for comparison with the
les simulations

on the same date as the adcp measurements a bathymetric survey of the channel bed
was made using a picotech picomb120 mbes which operated at 25 pulses per second the
picomb120 has a 120degree swath angle projecting 256 beams equally spaced at 047 degrees
overlapping passes of the operating boat were used to measure the detailed bed bathymetry of the
river the boat movements and locations were measured using the advanced navigation spatial
dual inu and postprocessed for improved coordinates using advanced navigations
14

kinematicatm algorithms the heading for the inu was provided using 2 trimble zephyr 2
antennas over 26 million bathymetric data points were collected and subsequently postprocessed using the beamworxtm hydrographic suite of software  see fig 9 as clearly seen
the survey data captured large bedforms that are 1 to 15 m high and present throughout the reach
also scour regions that are approximately 4 m deep can be seen along the outer bank of the
meander bend while about 2 m deep scour regions were detected near the bridge crossing as
shown in the deeper parts of the river in blue the thalweg of the river switches sides by crossing
over from the right bank at the bridge crossing to the left bank near the downstream end of the
study reach this shift in thalweg is typical of a meandering river and influences the bathymetry
and hydrodynamics as will be seen in the les results presented in section 6

4 computational details
the les of the river flow in the study area was carried out for a meanflow depth of 33 m and
meanflow rate of 0565 m3s which result in the reynolds and froude numbers of 186  10
and 011 respectively the flow domain was discretized using a uniform grid node spacing in all
directions equivalent to  06 m for this spacing 201 1201 and 21 nodes were placed in the
spanwise streamwise and vertical directions respectively to create a flow domain with
approximately 5 million computational grid nodes about half of these nodes were classified as
solid nodes and banked out of the computations the timestep for all simulations was equivalent
to 007s typical values for y 1 were greater than 1000 given the reynolds number of the river
flow in this study the employed grid resolution is understandingly too coarse to capture the viscous
sublayer of the turbulent flow however since in such largescale riverine flows large bathymetry
features and other wallmounted structures are responsible for producing slowly evolving but very
energetic coherent structures which are responsible for producing most of the turbulence we have
been able to successfully resolve such flows using wall models flora et al 2021 khosronejad et
al 2011 2012 2013 khosronejad diplas angelidis et al 2020 khosronejad flora  kang
2020 khosronejad kozarek palmsten et al 2015 that is without needing to resolve the details
of the near wall flow provided that one uses grids fine enough to capture key geometrical features
and resolve the slowly coherent flow structures they induce this has been the basic premise for
the success of les linked with the immersed boundary method developed for and introduced in
16

simulations of river hydrodynamics and morphodynamics khosronejad et al 2013 khosronejad
flora  kang 2020 khosronejad flora zhang et al 2020 khosronejad le et al 2016
based on the field observations of the water surface elevation during the bathymetric
survey there was minimal variation in the water surface throughout the reach the water slope of
the river was highly mild 0005percent for this reason khosronejad ghazian arabi et al
2019 we employed a flat rigidlid assumption at the free surface to facilitate the computations of
the less using the location of the free surface obtained from the measured water surface elevation
the noslip boundary condition was prescribed at the wall boundaries and bridge piers a range of
flow rates for the sacramento river was assigned at the inlet as discussed in section 6 before
conducting the less of the study reach a short and straight reach with uniform channel geometry
derived from the inlet crosssection of the study reach this short channel was used to develop
turbulent inlet boundary conditions at the inflow boundary of the study reach separate precursor
runs were completed for each discharge used in this study for each flow rate when the precursor
simulation reached a fully developed turbulent flow state the instantaneous velocity field at the
outlet was stored for later use in the less of the study reach no additional flow was assumed to
enter the flow domain at the confluence with sycamore slough
5 uncertainty in model parameters
the hydrodynamic results of our less are presumed to be highly dependent on two crucial input
parameters 1 the inflow discharge and 2 the equivalent roughness height as shown in table
1 in the study reach several different flow rates were measured using the adcp using the mean
value of 1305 m3s would be a logical choice for inflow discharge however one needs to
determine how much uncertainty this mean discharge value will introduce in the les results to
quantify this uncertainty a range of nine different flow rates representing flow rates from 10
percent less than the mean discharge to 10 percent greater than the mean value was simulated in
addition the equivalent roughness height k  used in the wall model eqn 7 could impact the
computed velocity profiles within the river and possibly redistribute the velocities laterally as
well as stated earlier there is a lack of consensus among researchers for how to define k  for
this study several values were used to represent a wide range of potential values for k 
specifically values for the equivalent roughness height ranging between 15d  k  3d
were utilized based on the disparity of values and relationships related to k in literature camenen
et al 2006 chanson 2004 ferguson 2007 hey 1979 sumer et al 1996 van rijn 1984
furthermore it was assumed that the uncertainty associated with k is uniformly distributed the
usgs sampled bed material from the river on november 1 1977 at the usgs gage no 11391000
usgs 11391000 sacramento r a knights landing ca water quality data nd based
on three representative sediment samples presented in fig 10 d  70 mm and d  216 mm
making the equivalent roughness height to range between 10 mm and 65 mm therefore for this
study values of k equal to 10 14 20 40 and 60 mm were used in the less due to the
computational cost for running each les only 11 cases combining different discharges and
equivalent roughness heights were run see table 2 to augment the gaps for other
combinations of these two parameters a pce was used to estimate the flow field results of all
possible combinations of parameter values for the inflow rate and equivalent roughness height

the pce is a general methodology that can be used in uncertainty quantification
evaluations representing the functional relationship between input parameters and the resulting
output rather than only the statistical correlation between the parameter inputs and hydrodynamic
outputs adams et al 2020 herein nonintrusive pce simulations are used as black boxes and

where  is a deterministic coefficient  is the ith multidimensional orthogonal polynomial and
 is a vector of standardized random variables herein the askey family of orthogonal
polynomials are employed for the pce evaluation more specifically since the probability
distributions for the inflow and k are assumed to be uniformly distributed the legendre
orthogonal polynomials are used for the pcenarayan  xiu 2012
to assess the relative sensitivity caused by different variables in the uncertainty of the
hydrodynamics results the coefficients in pces can be analyzed using variancebased
decomposition to extract values known as sobol indices sudret 2008 this analysis identifies
the fraction that either individual variables or a specific combination of variables contribute to the
total uncertainty in the response y this effect is known as the main effect sensitivity index and
for a single variable x  is represented by the sobol index value s  which is defined as eldred et
al 1999

where var eyx  represents the variance of the conditional expectation of y for a given x
and vary is the total variance
once the pce is evaluated the full range of inflow rates and equivalent roughness heights
can be explored using the surrogate model by the mc sampling the mc sampling repeatedly
selects random values of the two parameters and evaluates the corresponding velocities from the
pce to define the confidence intervals from the statistical variance in the pce responses this
process is repeated for each location in the study reach where confidence intervals are desired
herein we evaluate the depthaveraged velocities along 4 of the adcp locations and at four
vertical profiles where adcp measurements were taken the design analysis kit for
optimization and terascale applications dakota software developed by sandia national
laboratory was used to conduct the uq analysis based on the 11 les cases dakota first
determined the pce coefficients and sobol indices for the points of interest in the study reach and
then randomly sampled 10000 combinations of parameter inputs using mc sampling to define 95
percent confidence intervals fig 11 shows the workflow for the uq analysis

each of the 11 les cases listed in table 2 ran until flow was well established through the reach
as shown in fig 12 this figure shows a large flow separation region occurring along the outer
bend of the river near the confluence with sycamore slough a smaller separation zone is also
noted at the inner bend upstream of the bend flow is relatively uniform showing only velocity
fluctuations corresponding to the bedforms on the left side of the channel due to the meander
bend however the flow becomes noticeably less streamlined and exhibits continuous largescale
turbulence after the kinetic energy of the flow stabilized timeaveraged results were computed
until the mean statistics converged like the instantaneous flow the small fluctuations in the timeaveraged velocity magnitudes on the water surface reflect the presence of the channel bedforms
throughout the channel and the flow separation along the right bank fig 13 a as seen in fig
13 c the sharp meander bend leads to largescale redistribution of the velocity core in the water
column the strong secondary flow at the bend produces nontypical velocity profiles in vertical
which can be clearly seen in crosssection 3 of fig 13c the velocity magnitude at the water
surface elevation is significantly lower than that of middepth near the outer bank trying to
measure the discharge in this area will likely create inaccurate readings for instance if an adcp
is used the flow near the water surface cannot be measured directly and is estimated using a
logarithmic profile assumption which is not valid at this location similarly when processing
lspiv data the velocities at the water surface are typically reduced to estimate the depthaveraged
value for use in the discharge calculation as shown reducing the surface velocity at this location
would be inappropriate based on the computed results
due to the uncertainty in the inflow discharge several less were conducted using identical
equivalent roughness heights while varying only the flow discharge to assess the effect of flow
discharge alone on the computed hydrodynamics for instance both cases 4 and 10 simulated the
flow field using k  20 mm but varied the inflow discharge from 1403 m3s to 1207 m3s that
20

are 1075 percent and 925 percent of the mean flow respectively the timeaveraged surface
velocity magnitudes for these two cases are shown in fig 14a and b as expected the higher
flow rate in case 4 shows noticeably higher velocity magnitudes at the water surface however
when comparing the difference in velocity magnitudes in fig 14c the increase in velocity
magnitude at the water surface scales nonuniformly concerning the 15 percent difference in
discharges upstream of the bend along the inner bend of the river in the shallower parts of the
river flow velocity magnitudes increase by roughly 30 percent whereas along the outer bend the
velocity magnitudes increase by less than 10 percent even more surprisingly the velocity field
throughout the flow depth scales nonuniformly with the increased flow rate but shows highly
variable increases throughout the study reach fig 14 d we argue that this could be attributed
to the complex secondary flows and nonuniformity of bed bathymetry the former is known to
cause the lateral movement of the highvelocity core kang et al 2011 kang  sotiropoulos
2012 while the latter is known to produce heterogeneous turbulent flow structures in the water
column khosronejad hansen et al 2016 le et al 2019
like the variability in velocity field throughout the river caused by changing the discharge
les cases were also computed using different equivalent roughness heights while maintaining the
same flow rate at the inlet fig 15 shows the results from case 1 and case 6 which used k values
of 10 mm and 60 mm respectively as seen in fig 15 a and b the velocity magnitudes at the
water surface appear to be quite similar however considering the difference in the two surface
velocity magnitudes one can see that increasing the bed roughness results in a decrease in the
velocity magnitude ranging from 5 to 15 percent along the left bank see fig 15c conversely
downstream from the bend along the right bank increasing the bed roughness leads to an increase
in surface velocities by 5 to 15 percent within the bend itself these effects are even more evident
causing the same velocity changes to be even more significant as seen in fig 15 d at the three
crosssections in different parts of the bend the degree and location of the velocity magnitude
changes are nuanced with varying changes being induced by the roughness seen in other velocity
structures in the crosssections
typically the velocity profile of a river flow follows a logarithmic or parabolic profile
robert 2003 accordingly the depthaveraged velocity magnitude is often approximated to be
about 85 percent of the surface velocity magnitude buchanan et al 1976 the surface velocity
magnitude and depthaveraged velocity magnitudes are compared for case 3 to investigate the 85
percent approximation using our simulation results in the study reach of the sacramento river
this case corresponds to the inflow rate of 1305 m3s and the equivalent roughness height of k 
20 mm as seen in fig 16 a and b as expected the velocity magnitude is generally lower for
the depthaveraged values closer examination of the percentage of the depthaveraged velocity
magnitude relative to the surface velocity magnitude in fig 16c however reveals that the
percentage varies appreciably from the 85 percent estimate with blue regions being a higher
percentage typically occurring along the inside of the bend and red regions being a lower
percentage located principally along the outside of the bend based on the four crosssections
plotted in fig 16 d the range for the ratio varies considerably in the bend ie from 70 percent
to 95 percent however in crosssection b extreme values that range from 50 percent to as much
as 160 percent are found near the outside of the bend crosssection d is located near the outlet of
the flow domain and shows the closest agreement with the 85 percent approximation while only
deviating by about 5 percent higher and lower across most of the study reach except near the banks
where there is less agreement

thus far we have demonstrated the strong yet somewhat unpredictable effect that both the
inflow discharge and equivalent roughness height can have on the velocity field of the river flow
in the study reach of principal interest in this study is the potential combined effect of these two
uncertain parameters on the les results as expressed by confidence intervals in other words we
seek to determine with 95 percent confidence the velocity magnitude of the river in the study
reach considering the uncertainty associated with the flow discharge and equivalent bed
roughness the computed velocities along selected crosssections and velocity profile points were
sampled using the 11 les cases to determine the joint effect specifically locations 2 to 5 were
selected along the mean crosssection location corresponding to the adcp measurements as
shown in fig 5 where 16 equally spaced depthaveraged velocities were determined and used for
the uncertainty quantification analysis similarly the fourpoint locations two along the crosssection at location 2 and two along the crosssection at location 5 fig 7 were selected for
samples of velocity profiles depending on flow depth between 21 and 28 velocity magnitude
values were extracted from the les results at each point location and labeled as vp1 to vp4
these values were then used in the software program dakota to determine the pce coefficients
and sobol indices subsequently the pce results were utilized to determine the confidence
intervals by randomly sampling 10000 combinations of discharge and equivalent roughness
heights combinations using mc simulations the range of variables used in the mc simulations
was as follows inflow discharge ranged uniformly within 10 percent of the mean discharge and
k was varied uniformly between 10 mm and 65 mm the results of these evaluations are presented
in figs 17 to 24
considering the uncertainty in the depthaveraged velocity results for location 2 which
mainly resides farthest upstream in the study reach fig 17b shows that the computed results
from the les correspond well with the recorded adcp measurements as seen most of the adcp
25

measured data points fall within the 95 percent confidence limits considering that these
measurements reflect the average of only a few instantaneous measurements readings outside of
the 95 percent confidence bands may be due to the error in the measurements conversely since
location 2 is near the inlet of the flow domain it is likely that the velocity field imposed at the
inlet crossplane ie as the inlet boundary condition for the les does not accurately reflect the
proper boundary conditions this is mainly due to the complexities associated with the meandering
bends upstream of the study reach which were not considered
furthermore the computed velocities falling outside the 95 percent confidence bands are
located near the side banks and these outliers tend to propagate downstream at the other
locations the magnitude of the computational errors however tends to diminish in the
downstream direction this trend would be expected because the les results are gradually
corrected for the initial error in velocity distribution at the inlet as flow is conveyed downstream
quantifying the uncertainty caused by the distribution at the inlet is not possible without additional
bathymetry data and a more extended study reach regarding the relative contribution to the
uncertainty the sobol indices in fig 17c show that the flow discharge almost entirely influences
the level of uncertainty in the depthaveraged velocities this is evident in the sobol indices that
uniformly exceed 09 throughout the study reach and in all crosssections including depths
ranging from 2 m to over 7 m this uniform impact of the flow rate on the overall uncertainty
could be better understood by employing a constant equivalent roughness height for all precursor
simulations which were conducted to obtain the inlet boundary condition for the less since
location 2 is nearest to the precursor flow the full effect of varying the roughness height may
have not fully impacted the hydrodynamics of the river until farther downstream

location 3 is immediately downstream from the river bend and the confluence with
sycamore slough fig 18a despite the strong secondary flow caused by the bend and the
additional although minor flow entering at the confluence the computed les results are still in
close agreement with the adcp measured velocity field fig 18b as with location 2 near
each bank the measured depthaveraged velocities are slightly outside of the 95 percent
confidence bands from the sobol indices in fig 18c the uncertainty in the depthaveraged
results is almost entirely due to the uncertainty in the discharge near the center of the channel
however near the banks a stronger influence of the bed roughness can be seen  particularly along
the left bank where the uncertainty due to the equivalent roughness height is more pronounced
at locations 4 the crosssection is relatively uniform in shape fig 19c since it is
located at a crossover point of the river thalweg location 5 on the other hand is located farther
downstream of the study reach where the thalweg has shifted toward the left bank of the river fig
20c at both locations the depthaveraged velocity measurements generally fall within the
uncertainty of the les results except near the side banks however at location 5 which is farthest
from the inlet precursor distribution the measurements and numerical results are in closest
agreement as for the previous locations the sobol indices show that near the center of the river
the uncertainty in the computed results is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in the flow rate
with values typically exceeding 90 percent however near the side banks the uncertainty is mainly
caused by the equivalent roughness height and ranges from 30 to 50 percent it is worth noting that
the confidence intervals near the side banks show less uncertainty than in the center of the river
therefore the increased sobol index values do not necessarily indicate an absolute increase in the
uncertainty caused by the bed roughness but may only be a more significant percentage of the total
uncertainty in these regions

the velocity profiles in the water column were also analyzed using the same uq
methodology to define the confidence bands and sobol indices of the les results at 4 locations
within the study reach locations vp1 and vp2 are along the outer bank at the entrance to the
meander bend on the same crosssection at location 2 discussed above for these two computed
velocity profiles most of the measured velocity data does not fall within the 95 percent confidence
intervals we conjecture that this may be primarily due to the measured values which reflect only
instantaneous velocity readings while the depthaveraged adcp readings in the spanwise
directions were also computed by averaging only a few instantaneous readings the depthaveraging process itself helps smooth out the instantaneous fluctuations by averaging the ensemble
of values over the entire water column however the velocity profiles in the vertical direction do
not have this same advantage and show only the average of 3 or 4 instantaneous readings to better
assess this error one would need to make stationary measurements over several minutes to account
for the various turbulent structures passing through a given point we note that such stationary
measurements in the field are extremely difficult locations vp3 and vp4 fall along the crosssection at location 5 with vp3 and vp4 being located near the left and right banks respectively
fig 23 a and b at these two locations the adcp measurement data agree more closely with
the les results this improved agreement may be due to the fact that these points are far away
from the inlet and strong secondary effects due to the bend for each case the sobol indices for
k increases appreciable from less than 5 percent near middepth to between 15 to 40 percent near
the bed this increase influence of equivalent roughness height on the uncertainty near the bed
seems reasonable since the value for k is directly applied to the wall model to reconstruct the
velocity field of the computational nodes near the bed however it is also noted that the confidence
limits near the riverbed are very small for each of the four vertical profiles indicating the
uncertainty associated with q and k are primarily experienced away from the bed in this light
the influence of k on the uncertainty should be recognized as higher relative to q and not as
causing greater uncertainty in an absolute sense

7 conclusions
highfidelity numerical modeling of turbulent flows in riverine systems with intricate bathymetry
is generally based upon field measurements and modeling parameters  both of which have
inherent uncertainty in this study we evaluated the propagation of uncertainties due to the
variations in the inflow discharge and roughness parameters through les computed
hydrodynamics of the sacramento river when considered independently both parameters
redistributed the flow laterally in the river and modified the velocity profiles in nonuniform ways
the presence of the meander bend in the study reach and associated secondary flows created
nonintuitive changes in the flow structure making the relationship between depthaveraged
velocity magnitudes and the surface velocities highly variable however farther downstream from
the bend the depthaveraged flow from the les results seemed to be typically between 80 and 90
percent of the velocity magnitude at the free surface this conclusion demonstrates the value of
collecting field velocity data at locations in the river away from meander bends to obtain more
predictable flow data
the uq analysis of the joint effect of equivalent roughness height and inflow discharge
uncertainty provided 95 percent confidence bands of the depthaveraged velocities at selected
locations which were generally validated by the adcp measurements the sobol indices analysis
showed that uncertainty in the flow discharge at the inlet contributed to most over 90 percent of
the uncertainty of the computed depthaveraged velocities however at regions near the side
banks the equivalent roughness height contributed more influence ranging from 10 to 80 percent
this variability was associated with the location with the higher percentage of uncertainty
attributed to the bed roughness ie near the meander bend moreover the uncertainty of the
vertical velocity profiles near the bed was low and mostly was dominated by the equivalent
roughness height away from the riverbed the sobol indices indicate that inflow discharge
contributed almost exclusively to the uncertainty in the velocity profile
while the results of this study apply to the specific flow conditions and river reach on the
sacramento river they illustrate the importance of quantifying the uncertainty in both the model
parameters and the resulting hydrodynamics when conducting numerical modeling of natural river
flows a proper uq assessment of the model can provide helpful confidence levels for the
computed results and thus can add valuable context for interpreting and applying the model to
realworld applications
