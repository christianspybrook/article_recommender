abstract
the interior of the black hole can be described by anisotropic cosmology by quantizing the metric function
we can obtain the wheelerdewitt equation for inside the horizon in order to interpret the wave function
consistently one needs to impose a boundary condition in this paper we introduce a prescription for the
euclidean analytic continuation inside the horizon and the corresponding wave function solution

1 introduction
understanding the inside structure of the black hole in the light of quantum gravity is the fundamental but unresolved problem of
modern theoretical physics this topic is related to the resolution of the singularity 1 as well as the information loss problem of
black holes 2 where we need to figure out the true answer for the question 3 there are several approaches toward the quantum
gravity but the most constructive approach to resolve the singularity inside the black hole horizon is to follow the canonical
approach ie to solve the wheelerdewitt equation 4
regarding this approach there are several important physical questions
1 what is the boundary condition of the wave function for the inside the horizon is there any unique or trivial way to provide
the boundary condition
2 what is the fate of the infalling observer will the classical geometry be extended if not what is the destiny of the infalling
information
3 what is the global description including both of inside and outside the horizon in addition to this what is the implication to the
information loss problem
although the answers to all these questions are beyond the scope of this paper we will mainly focus on the first issue
we first provide the generic framework to describe inside the horizon using the canonical formalism 5 in principle there can
be several ways to choose the wave function but one may ask what is the ground state of the wave function of course there is
no welldefined notion of the ground state in quantum gravity but we can remind the wisdom from the hartlehawking wave
function 6 if one can provide the euclidean future boundary condition for the inside the black hole this will mimic the idea of
the noboundary wave function here horowitz and maldacena further speculated that this final state can provide the projection
of the wave function 7 can we realize and justify or criticize these ideas 8

2 wave function inside the horizon
let us first choose the metric ansatz for inside the horizon as follows 9
ds2   n 2 tdt2  a2 tdr2 

r2s b2 t
d2 
a2  t

where n t is the lapse function rs is the schwarzschild radius and at and b t denote two canonical variables here the classical
schwarzschilid solution correspond to the following relation

 a

a

2

where this relation is invariant up to the choice of the lapse function n t from this metric ansatz one can derive the wheelerdewitt equation

in order to solve the partial differential equation one can first introduce the separation of variables say    x  y  where

where k2 is the separation constant interestingly this is equivalent to the twodimensional schrdinger equation of quantum
mechanics where x is a timelike direction and y is a spacelike direction with the potential barrier  e2y 
following the usual wisdom of quantum mechanics we can obtain the following observations
1 it is reasonable to interpret k2  0 as the energylike eigenvalue
2 x and y domains are not bounded hence k2 is not quantized
3 there is only the potential barrier along the ydirection and the barrier is divergent as y goes to infinity hence if there is
an incoming mode along the ydirection then there must be an outgoing mode along the ydirection unless there exist
divergent contributions at the y  0 region
4 the classical observer will follow the ehrenfest theorem ie the peak of the wave function should correspond to the classical
solution therefore at the horizon we need to impose the boundary condition that the wave function has a peak at the
classical solution
by imposing these properties we obtain the following form of the solution without loss of generality 9

then the classical solution is located at the gaussian peak of the wave function at the event horizon x y    where  is the
standard deviation and a is the normalization constant

3 euclidean analytic continuation
since x is the timelike variable in the superspace one may ask what happens if we wickrotate x  ix in usual quantum
mechanics along the euclidean time all excited modes exponentially decay and hence the euclidean wickrotation helps to choose
the ground state wave function however in our case after the wickrotation k  0 modes exponentially blow up therefore in
order to provide a consistent wickrotation we need to choose only k  0 modes ie if x  0

and after the wickrotation at x  ix we obtain

a numerical example is reported in fig 1 even though we choose k  0 modes at the event horizon still the ehrenfest
theorem will be satisfied left half of fig 1 however near the bouncing point x  0 the bias from the classical trajectory becomes
significant after the wickrotation as expected the wave function quickly decays to zero right half of fig 1
then what will be the corresponding euclidean onshell geometry for this proposed euclidean wave function see also speculations in 10 indeed this question has no meaning because there is no trivial steepestdescent in the euclidean part as we can
see in fig 1 however we can check whether we can regard the x  0 part as the genuine euclidean metric or not the clue might
be related to the wickrotation x  ix the metric ansatz becomes
ds2   n 2 tdt2  e2ix  t dr2  r2s e2y  t e2ix  t d2 

3

in the first glimpse this metric looks a little bit strange because the metric is entirely complexvalued however as x increases the
wave function rapidly decays to zero so if we choose a reasonable realvalued euclidean manifold at the sufficiently large x this
is enough if we choose x  n2 the metric becomes


ds2   dt 2  dr2  r2s e2y  t  d2 
4
and hence the signature is euclidean by choosing a proper n t we can define t

4 conclusion
in this paper we sketched the idea to impose the euclidean boundary condition of the wheelerdewitt wave function for the
inside the horizon the motivation was originated from the hartlehawking proposal but in the black hole case the corresponding
euclidean geometry is less clear however there are several important physical meanings
 first the wave function eq 2 satisfies several physical criteria that we discussed in sec 2
 second as x increases the highk mode rapidly decreased if we interpret that k is the analog of the energy then this euclidean
boundary condition selects the lowest energy state or the ground state
 third by choosing sufficiently large x one can find a realvalued geometry that has zero probability but has euclidean
signatures from this starting point one can construct a reasonable complex contour from the euclidean geometry to the
lorentzian geometry as we usually did in the euclidean pathintegral approach
therefore one may speculate that eq 2 is the ground state wave function as a solution of the wheelerdewitt equation although
we need further justifications
one may further ask whether this wave function can explain the projection of the wave function as horowitz and maldacena
proposed however this seems less probable because the wave function depends on the incoming data or the physical information
of the event horizon however this euclidean boundary condition may have important physical meaning to the information loss
paradox the wave function of the black hole asymptotically approaches to zero in the superspace therefore if there exists the
singularity as well as the inside structure of the semiclassical history the overall probability should approach to zero eventually
hence the only histories without singularity will be dominated eventually 11 this boundary condition seems to be one another
realization of the dewitt boundary condition in some sense 9 there can be further interesting speculations but we leave them
for future investigations
