abstract
a series of recent developments points towards auditing as a promising mechanism to bridge the gap between principles and practice in ai ethics building on
ongoing discussions concerning ethicsbased auditing we offer three contributions
first we argue that ethicsbased auditing can improve the quality of decision making increase user satisfaction unlock growth potential enable lawmaking and
relieve human suffering second we highlight current best practices to support the
design and implementation of ethicsbased auditing to be feasible and effective
ethicsbased auditing should take the form of a continuous and constructive process
approach ethical alignment from a system perspective and be aligned with public policies and incentives for ethically desirable behaviour third we identify and
discuss the constraints associated with ethicsbased auditing only by understanding and accounting for these constraints can ethicsbased auditing facilitate ethical
alignment of ai while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits
of automation

when applied to ai new mechanisms are thus needed to ensure ethical alignment
of the ai systems that increasingly permeate society
leading institutions across the political commercial and academic strata
of society have responded to the urgency of this task by creating ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai floridi and cowls 2019 however the adaptation of
such guidelines remains voluntary moreover the industry lacks useful tools and
incentives to translate highlevel ethics principles to verifiable and actionable criteria for designing and deploying ai raji et al 2020
a series of recent developments points towards ethicsbased auditing as a promising mechanism to bridge the gap between principles and practice in ai ethics
a landmark article published in april 2020 by leading researchers from among
others google intel oxford cambridge and stanford suggests that thirdparty
auditors can be tasked with assessing whether safety security privacy and fairnessrelated claims made by ai developers are accurate brundage et al 2020 in
parallel professional services firms like pwc and deloitte are developing frameworks to help clients design and deploy trustworthy ai pwc 2019 deloitte 2020
we encourage this development nevertheless it is important to remain realistic about what ethicsbased auditing of ai can and cannot be reasonably expected
to achieve

2 ethicsbased auditing of aiwhat it is and how it works
ethicsbased auditing is a governance mechanism that can be used by organisations that design and deploy ai systems to control or influence the behaviour of
ai systems operationally ethicsbased auditing is characterised by a structured
process by which an entitys behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant
principles or norms
while ai should also be lawful and technically robust our focus here is on
the ethical aspects ie what ought and ought not to be done over and above the
existing regulation rather than attempting to codify ethics ethicsbased auditing helps identify visualise and communicate whichever normative values are
embedded in a system
although standards have yet to emerge a range of different approaches to ethicsbased auditing of ai already exists functionality audits focus on the rationale behind the decision code audits entail reviewing the source code and impact
audits investigate the effects of an algorithms outputs
whether the auditor is a government body a thirdparty contractor or a specially designated function within larger organisations the point is to ensure that
the auditing runs independently of the daytoday management of the auditee
ethicsbased auditing contributes to good governance just as businesses
require physical infrastructures to succeed interactions between agents require an
ethical infrastructure to flourish floridi 2014 by promoting procedural regularity and strengthening institutional trust ethicsbased auditing can help

provide decisionmaking support by visualising and monitoring outcomes
inform individuals why a decision was reached and how to contest it
allow for a sectorspecific approach to ai governance
relieve human suffering by anticipating and mitigating harms
allocate accountability by tapping into existing governance structures
balance conflicts of interest eg by containing access to sensitive information to
an authorised thirdparty

3 getting it right
ethicsbased auditing of ai need not be difficult to implement to be feasible and
effective however specific requirements must be met as a gold standard we propose that the process of ethicsbased auditing should be continuous holistic dialectic strategic and designdriven
first ethicsbased auditing is a process not a destination this implies that audits
need to continuously monitor and evaluate system output and document performance characteristics
second ai is not an isolated technology but part of larger sociotechnical systems thus a holistic approach to ethicsbased auditing takes knowledge of available alternatives into account when evaluating aibased systems
third ethics does not provide an answer sheet but a playbook ethicsbased
auditing should thus be viewed as a dialectical process wherein the auditor exists to
ensure that the right questions have been asked
fourth doing the right thing should be made easy in practice strategic value
alignment means that ethicsbased auditing frameworks must harmonise with organisational policies and individual incentives
finally trustworthy ai is about design hence interpretability and robustness
should be built into systems from the start ethicsbased auditing support this aim
by providing active feedback to the continuous redesign process

4 a roadmap for future research
ethicsbased auditing of ai is not a panacea in fact as a governance mechanism it
is subject to a range of conceptual technical economic social organisational and
institutional constraints these are listed in table 1
conceptual constraints are logical limitations which cannot be easily resolved but
need to be continuously managed how to prioritise amongst incompatible definitions of concepts like fairness and justice for example remains a fundamentally
political question hence one function of ethicsbased auditing would be to arrive at
resolutions that even when imperfect are at least publicly defensible
technical constraints are tied to the autonomous complex and scalable nature
of ai for example meaningful quality assurance of aibased systems is not
always possible within test environments due to their ability to update their

table 1  constraints on auditing as a mechanism to ensure trustworthy ai
type

constraints

conceptual

there is a lack of consensus around highlevel ethics principles
normative values conflict and require tradeoffs
it is difficult to quantify externalities of complex ai systems
information is infallibly lost through reductionist explanations

technical

ai systems may appear opaque and can be hard to interpret
data integrity and privacy are exposed to risks during audits
linear compliance mechanisms are incompatible with agile software development
tests may not be indicative of ai systems behaviour in realworld environments

economic
 social

audits may disproportionately disadvantage or burden specific sectors or groups
ensuring ethical alignment must be balanced with incentives for innovation
ethicsbased auditing is vulnerable to adversarial behaviour
the transformative effects of ai pose challenges for how to trigger audits
ethicsbased auditing may reflect and reinforce existing power structures

organisational
 institutional

there is a lack of institutional clarity about who audits whom
auditors may lack the access or information required to evaluate ai systems
the global nature of ai systems challenge national jurisdictions

internal decisionmaking logic over time however since these constraints are contextdependent they are likely to be relaxed or transformed by future research
economic and social constraints depend on the incentives of different actors
because ethicsbased auditing imposes costs financial and otherwise care must be
taken to not unduly burden particular sectors or groups in society at the same time
effective governance cannot afford to be nave even in cases where audits reveal
flaws in aibased systems asymmetries of power may prevent corrective steps from
being taken
organisational constraints concern the design of operational auditing frameworks ethicsbased auditing is only as good as the institutions backing it currently
a clear institutional structure is lacking moreover the effectiveness of ethicsbased
auditing remains constrained by a tension between national jurisdictions on the one
hand and the global nature of technology on the other

5 outlook
policymakers are encouraged to consider ethicsbased auditing as an integral component of holistic approaches to managing the ethical risks posed by ai this does
not mean that traditional compliance mechanisms are redundant instead ethicsbased auditing of ai holds the potential to complement and enhance other tools and
methods like human oversight certification and regulation

ethicsbased auditing to develop trustworthy ai	

for ethicsbased auditing to be effective the shift of power from juridical courts
to private actors must be resisted however too strict laws risk stifling innovation
and undermining the legitimacy of law enforcement the solution here is that governments retain supreme sanctioning power by authorising independent agencies
who in turn conduct ethicsbased audits of ai systems
much remains to be done future research should focus on the 16 constraints
listed in table 1 only if these constraints are understood and accounted for will
ethicsbased auditing help address the ethical risks posed by ai
in conclusion ethicsbased auditing of ai affords good governance by strengthening the ethical infrastructure of mature information societies however ethicsbased auditing will not and should not replace the need for continuous ethical reflection among individual moral agents
