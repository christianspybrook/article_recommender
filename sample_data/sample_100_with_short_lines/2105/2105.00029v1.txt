a covariant nonlocal nambujonalasinio nlnjl model used to describe the color superconducting quark matter phase in hybrid neutron stars is parametrized with two free parameters the
dimensionless vector and diquark coupling strengths v and d  changing the values of these parameters results in different equations of state eos with varying stiffness on the other hand the
constantsoundspeed css model is a frequently used simple quark matter equation of state with
three parameters the slope parameter a the speed of sound cs and the bag pressure b we show
that the css model eos provides an excellent fit to that of the nlnjl model this work provides a
simple functional form for the mapping between the parameter spaces of these two models ie the
d  v and a  c2s  b parameter sets these results allow for a simplified description of the quark
matter phase in neutron stars and for an interpretation of hybrid neutron star phenomenology in
terms of parameters of a lagrangian quark matter model

introduction

recent investigations of neutron star ns properties
support the idea that deconfined quark matter builds the
cores not only of the heaviest known nss 1 but even of
all nss in the presently observed mass range 2
in order to draw such conclusions the equation of state
eos for the quark matter phase in nss is needed the
best candidates to provide a reliable quark matter eos
under neutron star conditions are those effective models
that share key features with lowenergy qcd such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the resulting lowenergy theorems as the gellmannoakesrenner and
goldbergertreiman relations the most popular chiral
effective model that reasonable fulfills these requirements
is the nambu jonalasinio njl model 3 4 that was
developed in order to understand the generation of a mass
gap for fermions nucleons in analogy to the energy gap
in the bcs model of electronic superconductivity based
on local fourfermion interactions with the introduction
of quarks as the fundamental fermionic degrees of freedom of strongly interacting matter the model has been



guest scientist

reformulated on that level of description see 511 for
early reviews and 12 for the njl model analysis of dense
quark matter
the local njltype models have a major caveat the
absence of confinement a local fourfermion coupling is
incompatible with the strong coupling at largedistances
that is phenomenologically established by hadron spectroscopy and lattice qcd simulations of the free potential energy between static heavy color charges that
exhibits a funnelshaped interquark potential one way
to bring effective lowenergy qcd models closer to capturing also the confining nature of the strong interaction
at large distances is the generalization of the local fourfermion coupling to a nonlocal fourpoint function a
first step in this direction has been done with socalled
bilocal qcd models 13 14 which could successfully
address lowenergy qcd and hadron phenomenology on
the basis of a nonperturbative model gluon propagator
15 or a relativistic generalization of confining potential
models 16
the next step towards the modern formulation of the
nonlocal chiral quark model in the following denoted as
nlnjl was to generalize the interaction model from
a twopoint function to a fourpoint function following
two schemes the first one defines the nonlocal interac

tion similar to the relativistic smatrix with its dependence on the kinematic mandelstam variables and assumes separability a product ansatz of pairwise relative momenta 17 this scheme has later been denoted
as onegluon exchange oge model for the model
formfactors the ansatz has been made of instantaneous
energyindependent functions that depend on the relative threemomenta only in this way the evaluation of
thermodynamic properties of the model within the imaginary time formalism became straightforward because the
matsubara summations could still be performed analytically as in the original njl model which was recovered
for a step function as the formfactor using smooth functions as formfactors of the nonlocality resulted in a lowering of the psudocritical temperature of the chiral restoration closer to the results from lattice qcd 17 the
second scheme denoted as instantonliquid model ilm
was built using a simple product ansatz for the formfactors that were attached to each of the four fermion legs
18 a comprehensive overview over the nonlocal chiral
quark models in this early era has been given by georges
ripka in his book 19 where formal details and more
references can be found
with the extension to rank2 separable gluon propagator models and using formfactors depending on the
4momentum a close correspondence to the dysonschwinger equation approach could be established 20
the finitetemperature extension led to a dramatic reduction of the chiral restoration temperature 21 which recently has been found in lattice qcd simulations as tc0 
1323
6 mev in the chiral limit 22 when coupling the
nonlocal chiral quark dynamics to a gluon background
field within the polyakovloop extension of the model
see 23 for the details in case of the local njl model
where besides adding gluonic degrees of freedom at finite temperatures confinement is mimicked acceptable
values and systematics for the pseudocritical temperature of qcd could be obtained 24 25 and thermodynamic instabilities associated with complexconjugated
mass poles could be largely cured 26
another advantage of using covariant formfactors in
the nlnjl model is that the momentum dependence of
the quark mass as well as the wave function renormalization factor of the quark propagator can be described
in accordance with lattice qcd simulations 27 since
the nonperturbative lowenergy interaction of the nlnjl
model can be calibrated using lattice qcd simulations
one has a serious basis to extend studies of thermo

dynamic properties from the temperature axis into the
whole phase diagram including high baryochemical potentials where no lattice qcd simulations are available
because of the severe sign problem using the nlnjl
model with realistic formfactors the position of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram has been obtained for
temperatures below 130 mev 28 29 a prediction that
can be investigated in the upcoming heavyion collision

experiments with collision energies sn n  3  6 gev
eg at the nica facility of jinr dubna or in the fixedtarget experiment at rhic see fig 14 of ref 30 a
recent detailed review on nlnjl models and their applications to studies of matter under extreme conditions is
given in 31
in the present work we want to study the eos of quark
matter in nss at vanishing temperature a first application of the covariant nlnjl model has been given
in 32 where a simple gaussian formfactor was used
and only the scalarpseudoscalar meson interaction channel has been included it could be shown that such a
model with two quark flavors is equivalent to a thermodynamic bag model with a bag pressure b  813
mevfm3  the strange quark flavor appeared sequentially at a higher density and rendered the corresponding neutron star unstable against gravitational collapse
for masses above 162 m  in order to describe stars
with masses above 2 m as required by recent neutron
star observations 33 one has to include a repulsive vector meson interaction channel1  in hybrid star models
the transition to such a quark matter phase occurs only
at rather high densities close to the maximum mass of
the sequence as it is known from studies using the local njl model the simultaneous addition of a scalar diquark interaction channel leads to the effect of diquark
condensation color superconductivity which pushes the
onset of quark deconfinement to lower densities and results in quark matter cores for neutron stars with typical
masses of  14m 35 36 the situation is similar for
the covariant nlnjl model where increasing the diquark
coupling results in a lowering of the onset density for
the chiral restoration transition 37 correspondingly a
phenomenologically satisfactory situation occurs for the
hybrid neutron star eos when a repulsive vector and diquark interaction channel is included to the covariant nlnjl model 38 since it develops an early deconfinement

we note that in the local limit such a model has been introduced
as vbag model 34

transition to a stiff color superconducting quark matter
phase
consequently we will use in this study the covariant nlnjl model in the oge scheme that is parameterized with the dimensionless vector and diquark coupling
strengths v and d  given as ratios of the vector and
diquark couplings gv and gd  to the scalar coupling
constant gs  respectively the values of these input parameters however are not known from first principles
while the original version of the nlnjl model is formulated with constant densityindependent coefficients
in refs 39 40 densitydependent coefficients have been
introduced in such a way that the results of a recent relativistic densityfunctional approach to quark matter 41
could be reproduced the applicability of both versions
of nlnjl model in constructing the phase transition from
hypernuclear matter to deconfined quark matter has laso
been investigated 42 43
the microscopic approach of the nlnjl model has the
advantage that it allows to relate the spectrum of observable ns properties to the ranges of v and d parameters in the lagrangian of an effective lowenergy
qcd model for details see 44 it involves however
timeconsuming numerical routines for solving the selfconsistent nonlocal mean field equations together with
an extrapolation procedure at high densities for this
reason we explore the possibility to mimic the nlnjl
results with simpler approach the constantsoundspeed
css model 45 46
the css approach is widely used in the literature
in particular for the classification 45 and systematics
47 48 of hybrid neutron stars among the applications
of the css model is also the investigation of the third and
fourth families of compact stars for which stable branches
have been verified as well 4951 the work of ref 46
demonstrates the possibility for njl modelbased approaches to colorsuperconducting cold quark matter to
be well approximated by css parameterization it was
shown that the eos for quark matter developed for the
nonlocal separable njl model with formfactors depending on the threemomentum in 52 53 can be well fitted
with the css model
it is also worth mentioning that the css extrapolation becomes necessary for nlnjl models of certain values of v and d parameters due to the limitation of its
covariant formfactor realization 37 to chemical potentials up to  1600 mev however we would like to map
the nlnjl eos to the css eos for the whole range of

chemical potentials in the quark matter phase and not
only for b  1600 mev as it was previously done 44
this mapping would enable a replacement of the complicated quark matter eos by a simple model which gives
the eos of quark matter not only in the twoflavor colorsuperconducting 2sc phase but also at higher densities
for the colorflavorlocked cfl phase
the main idea of this work is to provide a simple functional form that enables a mapping between the two parameter spaces the nlnjl model parameters v and d
and the parameters of the css model the slope parameter a the squared speed of sound c2s and the bag pressure
b with the simplified description of the quark phase in
hybrid nss its eos would become easier to handle and
would at the same time have strong microphysical justification
the structure of the present paper is as follows in sec
ii we introduce the formulations of both nlnjl and css
models and their parameters along with an additional
phenomenological eos of alford 54 for comparison in
sec iii the functional dependence between the two parameter sets is found and parameter mapping between
the two models is discussed finally the main conclusion are given in sec iv

the inclusion of the scalar diquark channel together
with the repulsive vector interaction channel plays an
important role in the phenomenology of hybrid eos of
compact stars
the diquark condensate gives rise to color superconductivity 2sc and is responsible for lowering the onset
of the phase transition from the phase with broken chiral
symmetry to the 2sc phase the vector interaction induces a stiffening behaviour in the eos that is essential
to reach compact stars masses above 2m  systematic
investigation of hybrid ns properties reveals 36 44 that
phenomenological constraints from mass and radius measurements are optimally fulfilled when an increase in the
diquark coupling is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the vector coupling
the model includes three input parameters mc current quark mass p0 effective momentum scale and gs
coupling constant they are determined as to reproduce the pion mass and decay constant as well as the
chiral condensate in the vacuum at vanishing temperature and densities the two remaining coupling constants gs and gv are driving the terms that after
bosonization give rise to the color superconducting gap
and the vector meson mean field the dimensionless ratios d  gd gs and v  gv gs are free parameters from a fierz rearrangement of the oge interactions one obtains d  34 and v  12 that could
serve as an orientation for the values of these parameters in the vacuum there is no precise derivation of
effective couplings from qcd as we consider here the
strongly nonperturbative lowenergy regime moreover

one has to expect that these couplings could be subject
to a medium dependence however d values larger

than d
 32mm  mc  may lead to color symmetry breaking in the vacuum 55 where m stands for
the dressed mass and mc for the current quark mass

as we intend to describe the behaviour of quark matter
in the cores of nss we have to take into account the
presence of leptons electrons and muons which we include into the thermodynamic potential as free relativistic fermi gases in addition we have to consider that
the stellar matter satisfies the following conditions equilibrium under weak interactions chemical equilibrium
as well as color and electric charge neutrality as a consequence it can be seen that the six different chemical
potentials f c depending on the two quark flavors u and
d and quark colors r g and b in eq 7 are not independent from each other and can be written in terms of three
independent quantities the baryonic chemical potential
 the electron chemical potential e and a color chemical
potential 8  basically for each value of  we solve selfconsistently the gap equations 8 complemented with
the conditions for equilibrium and electric charge and
color charge neutrality details of the calculation can be
found in the appendix of ref 38
in the present work we consider a gaussian form factor gp  expp2 p20  in euclidean 4momentum space
the fixed input parameters of the quark model considered here are mc  54869 mev p0  78216 mev and
gs p20  19804

using the definition of the pressure 9 the energy density 11 can be rewritten as
p   p  1  b 

12

which directly reveals that the squared sound speed is
c2s  1  const since   const
the speed of sound determines the stiffness of the eos
which has to be large enough to allow for the maximum
neutron star mass to fulfil the observational lower bound
of 201 m from the shapirodelay based mass measurement on psr j07406620 33 a recent upgrade of the
former mass measurement 57 at the 1 level the prefactor a changes the slope of the p  curve and has thus
also an effect on the stiffness of the eos lowering the
value of a increases the stiffness the effective negative
bag pressure b realises quark confinement at low densities in quark matter eos because it makes sure that any
small but positive pressure of a hadronic phase would be
preferable this region the parameters a b and c2s are
free parameters which define the behaviour of the quark
matter eos
it is worth mentioning that for a large class of quark
matter models including the standard njl model 58
59 or its nonlocal generalization with instantaneous
threemomentum dependent formfactors 60 it was observed that the sound speed appears largely densityindependent 46 for the covariant nlnjl model such
an observation has not yet been made therefore for the
first time in the present work the question is considered
how well the covariant nlnjl model in the 2sc phase can
be approximated by the quark matter eos with constant
speed of sound given by eq 9

c

phenomenological eos

besides the css model eos there is a phenomenological formulation of the eos of quark matter in use which

has been introduced and motivated in ref 54 in that
work the quark matter eos consists of the first three
terms of a series in even powers of the quark chemical
potential
qm  34 2 a4 4  34 2 a2 2  beff 

13

where a4  a2  and beff are coefficients independent of 
the quartic coefficient a4  1  c is well defined for
an ideal massless gas for which c0 perturbative qcd
corrections in lowest order ie os  for massless quark
matter lead to a reduction of a4  eg accounted for by
c  03 so that a4  07 the quadratic 2 term arises
from an expansion in the finite strange quark mass ms
and the diquark pairing gap  so that a2  m2s  42 
in cfl quark matter they are almost in the same order
of about 100 mev so that the coefficient a2 is almost zero
and this corresponds to a constant speed of sound c2s 
13 the conformal limit 54 in the phenomenological
parameterization 13 the coefficient a2 usually varies in
the limits 150 mev2 61
however this eos for quark matter is softer than some
nucleonic ones it has been shown in 54 that even for
this simple parameterization which hereafter we call alford fit the resulting hybrid stars can have massradius
relations very similar to those of pure nucleonic stars and
the maximum mass fulfills the constraint for its observational lower limit 33
as another aim of the present work we intend to compare the results of fitting the nlnjl eos with both css
parameterization and alford parameterization

results and discussion

fitting procedure

in order to obtain a functional relation between the
parameters of the two approaches we considered 34 eos
based on nlnjl model for different values of d and v
parameters to which we fit the css eos 9 in order to
obtain the values of a b and  in these eos fits the
parameter b is expressed through the values of a and 
as

one example of the css fit to the nlnjl eos with
d  075 and v  014 is given in fig 1 for comparison fitting the parameters of the phenomenological eos
13 that was introduced by alford et al in 54 we obtain
a4  0003 a2  102342 mev2 and beff  12453
mev fm3  this alford fit is also shown in fig 1 it
is worth mentioning that the value of a4  0 which is
obtained by the fit entails that the correction relative to
the ideal gas limit is close to 100 and thus not compatible with its value of c  2s   30 in perturbation
theory to os  62 this can be seen as an hint to the
nonperturbative nature of the quark matter eos in this
domain of low chemical potentials in the vicinity of the
hadronization transition
in the inserted plot we further examine the low chemical potential region where the most significant difference
between the two fits is found the css follows the nlnjl
behaviour more closely which will be also manifested in
the massradius curves discussed toward the end of the
chapter for the remaining chemical potentials the two
fits present the same quality in reproducing the nlnjl
eos the quality of the fits is estimated with the 2

from the css fit the values of a and  parameters are
obtained from which b parameter and squared speed of
sound c2s are calculated these values are given in table i
together with the 2 values for the 34 different nlnjl
eoss giving the total of 34 data points from these values
the functional form between nlnjl parameter space and
the css one is to be found
in order to find the functional dependence between
the two parameter spaces we analyze the behaviour of
the css model parameters for different values of d and
v  as given in figure 2 the parameter a shows the
strongest dependence on both nlnjl model parameters
while c2s and b are almost independent on d and linearly
depending on v  respectively from these dependencies the simplest functional form between two parameter
spaces can be assumed the variation of css parameters
is linear with the change of d  while it is quadratic with
the change of v  thus we write the following equations

where the coefficients ai  bi and ci with i  1 2 3 are

to check the quality of our method we choose one
original nlnjl eos that was not included in the initial
fitting data set eg d  075 and v  015 and
calculate css eos using eq 9 with the parameter values obtained through eqs 1618 the eos comparison is given in fig 3 it is worth noticing that the

that the css parameterization works better for fitting
the nlnjl model for comparison the massradius m 
r curves for the hybrid stars constructed using nlnjl
model and two different versions of fitted eos are shown
in fig 4 for the hadronic eos we have employed the
relativistic densityfunctional rdf model based on the
dd2 parameterization 66 with excluded volume effects
67 the dd2 model with excluded volume is mainly
used in the context of an early deconfinement onset with
large latent heat
the results for the m  r curves sufficiently demonstrate the applicability of the mapping that has been
performed it is clear that the m  r curves for the
css fit and its functional version are sufficiently close

for these two parameterizations to be considered equivalent furthermore their difference to the m  r curve
for the original nlnjl eos amounts to maximally 200 m
in radius this difference is well visible but still much
smaller than the design accuracy of observational radius
measurements from nicer which even has not yet been
reached by the first nicer radius measurements therefore our work provides a sufficiently precise tool for ns
phenomenology moreover the comparison with alford
fit shows that the radius of the ns is really sensitive
to the eos while both fits are very close according to
fig 1 the css parameterization performs better in the
m  r curve in particular close to the onset of the phase
transition at low densities from our results we can see

that the alford fit may be useful close to the maximum
mass
we conclude that for the nlnjl eos parameterizations
within the ranges 07  d  08 and 011  v  018
the css approach can mimic the behaviour of the nlnjl
eos to high accuracy the range of d values between
07 and 08 is covering the value for the fierz transformation of a onegluon exchange interaction d  34 and
entails that the quark matter is in the color superconducting phase the css parameters for the nlnjl eoss

with high values of v  018 are showing deviations
from the general behaviour fitted by eqs 1618 but
since for these v values there is a causality violation at
large chemical potentials the css form of the eos fitted
at low densities can be used to extrapolate the eos above
a certain density a lower limit on the values of the v

conclusion

we have considered the correspondence between the
covariant nlnjl model and the css model eos we have
performed a mapping between the parameters of these
two models in a decent range with a 2 value that qualifies an excellent fit the finding of this equivalence allows
to employ the simpler css approach instead of the covariant nlnjl model when a hybrid star eos with color
superconducting quark matter shall be constructed the

the alford parameterization but this resulted in a worse
quality of the fit when compared to the css one at least
for masses well below the maximum mass therefore we
could confirm for the first time that the covariant nlnjl
is fitted to the css parameterization with high accuracy
while these microphysical parameters the diquark coupling and the vector meson coupling considered here to
vary in the range of 07  d  08 and 011  v 
018 respectively it is possible to extend the range of
applicability of the css parameter fit also beyond these
ranges
our studies can be used not only in order to explore
the phase transition between hadronic and color superconducting quark matter in cold ns but it can also be
extended to finite temperatures when it will be useful in
simulations of core collapse supernovae 68 and neutron
star mergers 6971 involving quark matter deconfinement

acknowledgments

functional fit provided in this work allows to interpret
the parameters of the css model that are favorable for
explaining ns phenomenology in terms of the unknown
coupling constants of the effective lowenergy qcd lagrangian we have also tried to fit the nlnjl eos with
