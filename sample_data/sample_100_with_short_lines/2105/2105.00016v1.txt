abstract a theorem due to kazhdan and ziegler implies that by substituting linear forms for its
variables a homogeneous polynomial of sufficiently high strength specialises to any given polynomial
of the same degree in a bounded number of variables using entirely different techniques we extend
this theorem to arbitrary polynomial functors as a corollary of our work we show that specialisation
induces a quasiorder on elements in polynomial functors and that among the infinitestrength
elements there is a unique smallest equivalence class in this quasiorder

1 introduction and main results
fix a field k in our main results we will assume that k is algebraically closed and of characteristic
zero but for now we make no such assumption
11 strength
definition 111 let n  1 be an integer and let f  kx1      xn d be a homogeneous polynomial
of degree d  2 then the strength of f  denoted strf  is the minimal integer k  0 such that there
exists an expression
f  g 1  h1      g k  hk
where gi  kx1      xn di and hi  kx1      xn ddi for some integer 0  di  d for each i  k 
the strength of polynomials plays a key role in the resolution of stillmans conjecture by ananyanhochster 1 2 the subsequent work by ermansamsnowden 12 13 14 and in kazhdanzieglers
work 17 18 also see 3 4 5 7 9 10 for other recent papers studying strength
12 polynomial functors and their maps assume that k is infinite let vec be the category
of finitedimensional vector spaces over k with klinear maps
definition 121 a polynomial functor of degree  d over k is a functor p  vec  vec with the
property that for all u v  vec the map p  homu v   homp u  p v  is a polynomial map of
degree  d a polynomial functor is a polynomial functor of degree  d for some integer d   
remark 122 for finite fields k the correct analogue is that of a strict polynomial functor 15 
any polynomial functor p is a finite direct sum of its homogeneous parts pd  which are the polynomial subfunctors defined by pd v   p  p v   t  k  p t idv p  td p for each integer d  0
a polynomial functor is called homogeneous of degree d when it equals its degreed part
example 123 the functor u 7 s d u  is a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree d if u has
basis x1      xn  then s d u  is canonically isomorphic to kx1      xn d  in this incarnation linear
maps s d  for   u  v correspond to substitutions of the variables x1      xn by linear forms in
variables y1      ym representing a basis of v

polynomial functors are the ambient spaces in current research on infinitedimensional algebraic
geometry 6 7 8 11 polynomial functors form an abelian category in which a morphism   p  q
consists of a linear map u  p u   qu  for each u  vec such that for all u v  vec and all
  homu v  the following diagram commutes
p u 

u

p 


p v 

 qu 
q

v


 qv 

in characteristic zero each polynomial functor p is isomorphic in this abelian category to a direct
sum of schur functors which can be thought of as subobjects or quotients of the polynomial functors
v 7 v d  for that reason we will informally refer to elements of p v  as tensors
in addition to the linear morphisms between polynomial functors above we may also allow each u
to be a polynomial map p u   qu  such that the diagram commutes such an  will be called
a polynomial transformation from p to q if u is irrelevant or clear from the context we write 
instead of u 
lk
di
 s ddi  and q  s d
example 124 in the context of definition 111 we set p 
i1 s
and define  by
g1  h1      gk  hk   g1  h1      gk  hk 
this is a polynomial transformation p  q



example 125 let q r be polynomial functors and   q  r  p a linear morphism then
q r 7 q  r defines a bilinear polynomial transformation q  r  p 

inspired by these examples we propose the following definition of strength for elements of homogeneous polynomial functors we are not sure that this is the best definition in arbitrary characteristic
so we restrict ourselves to characteristic zero
definition 126 assume that char k  0 let p be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree
d  2 and let v  vec the strength of p  p v  is the minimal integer k  0 such that
p  1 q1  r1       k qk  rk 
where for each i  k qi  ri are irreducible polynomial functors with positive degrees adding up
to d i  qi  ri  p is a bilinear polynomial transformation and qi  qi v  and ri  ri v  are
tensors

remark 127 positive degrees of two polynomial functors cannot add up to 1 so nonzero tensors
p  p v  of homogeneous polynomial functors p of degree 1 cannot have finite strength we say that
such tensors p have infinite strength note that the strength of 0  p v  always equals 0

proposition 128 assume that char k  0 for each integer d  2 the strength of a polynomial
f  s d v  according to definition 111 equals that according to definition 126
proof the inequality  follows from the fact that i  s di  s ddi  s d  g h 7 g  h is a bilinear
polynomial transformation for the inequality  suppose that   q  r  s d is a nonzero bilinear
polynomial transformation where q and r are irreducible of degrees e  d and d  e  d so q
and r are schur functors corresponding to young diagrams with e and d  e boxes respectively and
q  r admits a nonzero linear morphism to s d  whose young diagram is a row of d boxes the
littlewoodrichardson rule then implies that the young diagrams of q and r must be a single row as
well so that q  s e and r  s de  and also that there is up to scaling a unique morphism q  r 
s e  s de  s d  namely the one corresponding to the polynomial transformation g h 7 g  h 
the strength of a tensor in p quickly becomes very difficult when p is not irreducible

example 129 take p  s d e for some integer e  1 then the strength of a tuple f1      fe  
p v  is the minimum number k  0 such that
f1      fe  spang1      gk 
where g1      gk  s d v  are reducible polynomials

v
example 1210 consider p  s 2  2  so that p v   v  v  and assume that k is algebraically closed the only possibilities for q and r are qv   rv   v  the bilinear polynomial
transformations   q  r  p are of the form
u v  au  v  bv  u  cu  v  v  u  du  v  v  u
for certain a b c d  k we note that stra  rka2 when a  s 2 v  and stra  rka2
v
when a  2 v  in general we have
rka2 rka  a 2 rka  a 2  stra  rka rka  a 2  rka  a 2

for all a  v  v  where each bound can hold with equality for example for the matrix


0 1

0 0






a




0 1
0 0
we have rka  a 2  rka  a 2  stra  rka

v

example 1211 again take p  s 2 
and consider p k 2   k 22  assume k is algebraically
closed the matrix


1 x
a
0 1
clearly has strength  2 we will show that a has strength 2 whenever x  2 and strength 1
otherwise in particular this shows that the subset of p k 2  of matrices of strength  1 is not closed
suppose a has strength 1 then we can write a as au  v  bv  u with a b  k and v u  k 2 
let e1  e2 be the standard basis of k 2  without loss of generality we may assume that u  e1  e2
and v  e1  e2 for some    k we get
a  b  1

a  b  x

a  b  0

  1

using   1 and b  1  a we are left with a2  1  a  x and a  1  a2  0 the latter
gives us  6 1 and a  2 2  1 we get 2  1  x now if x 6 2 then such a  6 1
exists so in this case a indeed has strength 1 if x  2 the only solution is   1 hence a has
strength 2 in this case

13 subsets of polynomial functors
definition 131 let p be a polynomial functor a subset of p consists of a subset xu   p u 
for each u  vec such that for all   homu v  we have p xu   xv  it is closed if each
xu  is zariskiclosed in p u 

example 132 fix integers d  2 and k  0 the elements in s d v  of strength  k form a subset
of s d  this set is closed for d  2 3 but not for d  4 see 3

example 133 take k  r and let xv  be the set of positive semidefinite elements in s 2 v 
ie those that are sums of squares of elements of v  then xv  is a subset of s 2

14 kazhdanzieglers theorem universality of strength
theorem 141 kazhdanziegler 18 theorem 19 let d  2 be an integer assume that k is
algebraically closed and of characteristic 0 or  d let x be a subset of s d  then either x  s d or
else there exists an integer k  0 such that each polynomial in each xu  has strength  k
this theorem is a strengthening of 7 theorem 4 where the additional assumption is that x is
closed the condition that k be algebraically closed cannot be dropped eg by example 133 there
is no uniform upper bound on the strength of positive definite quadratic forms the condition on the
characteristic can also not be dropped but see remark 192
corollary 142 kazhdanziegler universality of strength with the same assumptions on k for
every fixed number of variables m  1 and degree d  2 there exists an r  0 such that for any
number of variables n  1 any polynomial f  kx1      xn d of p
strength  r and any polynomial
g  ky1      ym d there exists a linear variable substitution xj 7 i cij yi under which f specialises
to g
proof for each u  vec define xu   s d u  as the set of all f such that the map
homu k m   s d k m 
 7 s d f
is not surjective a straightfoward computation shows that this is a subset of s d  it is not all of s d 
because if we take u to be of dimension d  dim s d k m  then in s d u  we can construct a sum f of
dim s d k m  squarefree monomials in distinct variables and specialise each of these monomials to a
prescribed multiple of a basis monomial in s d k m  hence f 6 xu  by theorem 141 it follows
that the strength of elements of xu  is uniformly bounded

15 our generalisation universality for polynomial functors let p q be polynomial functors we say that q is smaller than p  denoted q  p  when p and q are not linearly isomorphic
and qd is a quotient of pd for the highest degree d where pd and qd are not isomorphic we say that
a polynomial functor p is pure when p 0  0
remark 151 let q  p be polynomial functors and suppose that p is homogeneous of degree
d  0 then qd must be a quotient of pd  so we see that q  r  p for any polynomial functor r
of degree  d

the following is our first main result
theorem 152 main theorem i assume that k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero
let x be a subset of a pure polynomial functor p over k then either xu   p u  for all u  vec
or else there exist finitely many polynomial functors q1      qk  p and polynomial transformations
sk
i  qi  p with xu   i1 imiu  for all u  vec in the latter case x is contained in a
proper closed subset of p 
if we assume furthermore that p is irreducible then in the second case there exists a integer k  0
such that for all u  vec and all p  xu  the strength of p is at most k
this is a strengthening of a theorem from the upcoming paper 8 also appearing in the first
authors thesis 6 theorem 425 where the additional assumption is that x be closed
remark 153 when p is irreducible of degree 1 then p u   u  in this case the subsets of p are
p and 0 so indeed the elements of a proper subset of p have bounded strength namely 0

again the condition that k be algebraically closed cannot be dropped and neither can the condition on the characteristic however see remark 192 main theorem i has the same corollary as
theorem 141

universality of highstrength tensors

corollary 154 with the same assumptions as in main theorem i let u  vec be a fixed vector
space then there exist finitely many polynomial functors q1      qk  p and polynomial transforsk
mations i  qi  p such that for every v  vec and every f  p v  that is not in i1 imiv 
the map homv u   p u   7 p f is surjective
sk
if p is irreducible then the condition that f 6 i1 imiv  can be replaced by the condition that
f has strength greater than some function of dim u only
16 limits and dense orbits let p be a pure polynomial functor over k there is another point
of view on closed subsets of p  which involves limits that we define now
definition 161 we define p  limn p k n  where the map p k n1   p k n  is p n  with

n  k n1  k n the projection map forgetting the last coordinate we equip p with the inverse
limit of the zariski
topologies on the p k n  which is itself a zariski topology coming from the fact
s
that p   n p k n    we also write p n  for the projection map p  p k n  this will
not lead to confusion a polynomial transformation   p  q naturally yields a continuous map
p  q also denoted by 

if p  s d  then the elements of p can be thought of as homogeneous series of degree d in
infinitely many variables x1  x2     here closed subsets of p are defined by polynomial equations
in the coefficients of these series s
on p acts the group gl  n gln  where gln is embedded into gln1 via the map


g 0
g 7

0 1
indeed with this embedding the map p k n1   p k n  in the definition of p is gln equivariant
and this yields the action of gl on the projective limit in the case of degreed series an element
g  gln  gl maps each of the first n variables xi to a linear combination of x1      xn and the
remaining variables to themselves
the map that sends a closed subset x of p to the closed subset x  limn xk n  of p is a

bijection with the collection of closed gl stable subsets of p 6 proposition 1328 hence closed
subsets of polynomial functors can also be studied in this infinitedimensional setting
example 162 on degreed forms gl clearly has dense orbits such as that of
f  x1 x2    xd  xd1 xd2    x2d    
the reason is that this series can be specialised to any degreed form in finitely many variables by
linear variable substitutions this implies that the image of gl f in each s d k n  is dense hence
d


gl f is dense in s
for every pure polynomial functor p  the group gl has dense orbits on p in fact uncountably
many of them see 6 451 they have the following interesting property
corollary 163 suppose that gl p is dense in p  then for each integer n  1 the image of
gl p in p k n  is all of p k n 
proof for v  vec define
xv   p p n p  n  1   homk n  v   p v 
which is exactly the image of gl p under the projection p  p k m  followed by an isomorphism
p  where   k m  v is a linear isomorphism we see that x is a subset of p  for each v  vec
the subset xv  is dense in p v  since gl p is dense in p  so x  p by main theorem i

the notion of strength has an obvious generalisation
definition 164 assume that char k  0 let p be a homogeneous polynomial functor the
strength of a tensor p  p is the minimal integer k  0 such that
p  1 q1  r1       k qk  rk

arthur bik alessandro danelon jan draisma and rob eggermont

for some irreducible polynomial functors qi  ri whose positive degrees sum up to d bilinear polynomial
transformations i  qi  ri  p and elements qi  qi and ri  ri  if no such k exists we say
that p has infinite strength

corollary 165 assume that char k  0 and that p is irreducible of degree  2 then an element
of p has infinite strength if and only if its gl orbit is dense
proof if p  p has finite strength then let i  qi  ri  p be as in the definition above and let
  1      k  q 

k
m
qi  ri   p
i1

be their sum so that p  im consider the closed subset x  im ie the closed subset
defined by xv   imv  for all v  vec as dim qk n  is a polynomial in n of degree  d while
dim p k n  is a polynomial in n of degree d we see that xk n  is a proper subset of p k n  for all
n  0 since p  x  it follows that gl p is not dense
suppose conversely that gl p is not dense then it is contained in x for some proper closed
subset x of p  hence p has finite strength by main theorem i

example 166 let p q be homogeneous functors of the same degree d  2 and let p  p be
an element of infinite strength then p 0  p  q also has infinite strength but the orbit
gl p 0 is not dense

remark 167 in section 3 we will use a generalisation of notation introduced here for an integer
m  0 we will write pm for the limit limn p k nm over all integers n  m this space is

isomorphic to p  but the indices have been shifted by m on pm acts the group glm 
 gl 
which is the union of glk nm  over all n  m we denote the image of an element p  pm
in p k nm  by pnm  the inclusions n  k nm  k n sending v 7 0 v allow us to view
pm as a subset of p 

corollary 168 let p be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree d  2 and m  0 an integer
let p  pm be a tensor whose glm orbit is not dense and let q  p be an element with finite
strength then the gl orbit of p  q  p is also not dense
proof note that p is contained in the image of   qm  pm for some polynomial transformation   q  p with q  p 6 theorem 425 and q is contained in the image of   r  p for
some polynomial transformation   r  p with degr  d so since q  r  p by remark 151
we see that p  q is contained in a proper closed subset of p  hence its gl orbit is not dense 
17 linear endomorphisms our second goal in this paper is to show that there always exist
minimal f with dense orbits this minimality relates to a monoid of linear endomorphisms extending
gl  as follows elements of gl are n  n matrices of the block form


g 0
0 i
where g  gln for some n and i is the infinite identity matrix
definition 171 let e  gl be the monoid of n  n matrices with the property that each row
contains only finitely many nonzero entries

example 172 for every integer i  1 let i  k ni mi be a matrix then the block matrix

is an element of e

we define an action of e on p as follows let p  p0  p1      p and   e for each integer
i  0 to compute qi in
q  q0  q1      p p
we choose ni  0 such that all the nonzero entries of the first i rows of  are in the first ni columns
now we let i  k ini be the i  ni block in the upperleft corner of  so that


i 0


 
and we set qi  p i pni  note that if we replace ni by a larger number i  then the resulting matrix
i satisfies i  i   where   k i  k ni is the projection consequently we then have
p i pi  p i p pi  p i pni 
so that qi is indeed welldefined a straightforward computation shows that for    e we have
p   p   p    so that e does indeed act on p 
p
for infinite degreed forms the action of   e is by linear variable substitutions xj 7 i1 ij xi 
note that since each xi appears in the image of only finitely many xj  this substitution does indeed
make sense on infinite degreed series
since gl  e an estable subset of p is also gl stable the converse does not hold since
for instance e also contains the zero matrix and p 0f  0 6 p gf for all nonzero f  p and
g  gl when the polynomial functor p is pure however it is easy to see that gl stable closed
subsets of p are also estable in particular we have gl f  p ef 
18 a quasiorder on infinite tensors
definition 181 for infinite tensors p q  p we write p  q if p  p eq in this case we say
that q specialises to p

from the fact that e is a unital monoid that acts on p  we find that  is transitive and reflexive
hence it induces an equivalence relation  on p by
p  q  p  q and q  p
as well as a partial order on the equivalence classes of 
example 182 fix an integer k  1 and consider the polynomial functor p  s 1 k  a tuple
1
q  q1      qk   p has a dense gl orbit if and only if q1      qk  s
are linearly independent
suppose that q has a dense gl orbit and let a be the n  k matrix corresponding to q then a
has full rank by acting with an element of gl  e we may assume that
 
ik
a
b
where b is again an n  k matrix now take
c 



ik
c

i



e

and note that b a  ik 0  so that p b q  x1      xk  so any two tuples in p with a
dense gl orbit are in the same equivalence class moreover the element of e specializing one tuple
to the other can be chosen to be invertible in e as c c  i 

there is an obvious relation between  and orbit closures namely if p  q then p  gl q the
converse however is not true
3
example 183 let p  x1 x21  x22     q  x31  x32      s
 then q has infinite strength and
3
so p  s  gl q however we have p 6 q suppose that

f  x1 gx1  x2      hx2  x3      s 3 eq

3
for some g  s
and h  s
 as only finitely many variables xi are substituted by linear forms
containing x1 when specialising q to f  we see that

x1 gx1  x2      hx2  x3      s 3 ex31  x32      x3n 
3
for some integer n  1 and h  s
 from this it is easy to see that g has finite strength hence
2
2
f 6 p as x1  x2     has infinite strength so indeed p 6 q


in order to have a tensor p  p with a dense gl orbit the polynomial functor p must be pure
for some time we believed that when this is the case all elements p  p with a dense gl orbit
might form a single equivalence class when p has degree  2 this is in fact true see example 414
however it doesnt hold for cubics
3
example 184 let p q  s
be as before now also consider r  px1  x3      qx2  x4    
3
we have q  r0 x1  0 x2      r and so s
 gl q  gl r hence both q and r have dense
gl orbits and we have r 6 q indeed otherwise p  rx1  0 x2  0     r  q but p 6 q


19 minimal classes of elements with dense orbits our second main result is the following
theorem 191 main theorem ii suppose that k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero
let p be a pure homogeneous polynomial functor over k then there exist tensors p r  p whose
gl orbits are dense such that p  q  r for all q  p whose gl orbit is dense
the elements p that have this property form a single class which lies below the classes of all
other q  p whose gl orbit is dense for the construction of such a tensor p  p  see 31 for
the construction of the tensor r  p  see 34
remark 192 in both our main theorems we require that the characteristic be zero this is
because the results in 6 and 8 require this however the proof of topological noetherianity for
polynomial functors in 11 does not require characteristic zero and shows that after a shift and a
localisation a closed subset of a polynomial functor admits a homeomorphism into an open subset of
a smaller polynomial functor in characteristic zero this is in fact a closed embedding so that it can
be inverted and yields a parameterisation of part of the closed subset in positive characteristic it
is not a closed embedding but the map still becomes invertible if one formally inverts the frobenius
morphism this is touched upon in 8 this might imply variants of our main theorems in arbitrary
characteristic but we have not yet pursued this direction in detail

acknowledgments we thank andrew snowden who first pointed out to us the action of the
monoid e on p and asked about its orbit structure there
2 proof of main theorem i
21 the linear approximation of a polynomial functor
let p be a polynomial functor over
l
an infinite field and let u v  vec then p u  v   de0 qde u v  where
qde u v   v  p u  v   s t  k  p s idu  t idv v  sd te v  pde u  v 

the terms with e  0 add up to p u  and the terms with e  1 add up to a polynomial bifunctor
evaluated at u v  that is linear in v  this is necessarily of the form p  u   v  where p  is a
polynomial functor in other words we have
p u  v   p u   p  u   v   higherdegree terms in v
we informally think of the first two terms as the linear approximation of p around u  now suppose
that we have a short exact sequence
0p qr0
of polynomial functors this implies that for all u v we have a short exact sequence
0  p u  v   qu  v   ru  v   0

and inspecting the degree1 parts in v we find a short exact sequence
0  p   q  r  0
this and further straightforward computations shows that p 7 p  is an exact functor from the
category of polynomial functors to itself
remark 211 for u  vec fixed denote the polynomial functor sending v 7 p u  v  and
 7 p idu  by shu p  then we have
shu p e v   v  p u  v   t  k  p idu  t idv v  te v
and from this we see that qde u v   shu p e v   pde u  v  in particular when p is homold
geneous of degree d we see that p u  v   e0 qdee u v  where qdee u v   shu p e v 
also note that in this case shu p 0 v   p u  and shu p d v   p v  via the inclusions of u v
into u  v 

example 212 if p  s d  then the formula

example 213 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p then s p contains the
subfunctor p v   v p  v  v  we have p u  v   p u   p v  and hence p   0

22 proof of main theorem i in this subsection we prove theorem 152 we start with a result
of independent interest
theorem 221 let p be a pure polynomial functor over an algebraically closed field kof characteristic 0 or  degp  and let x be a subset of p such that xv  is dense in p v  for all v  vec
then in fact xv  is equal to p v  for all v  vec
example 133 shows that the condition that k be algebraically closed cannot be dropped we do
not know if the condition on the characteristic of k can be dropped but the proof will use that the
polynomial functor p  introduced in 21 is sufficiently large which by example 213 need not be
the case when char k is too small
proof let q  p k n  for each k  n we consider the incidence variety
zk   r  homk k  k n   p k k   rk  n and p r  q
we write ek  dimk p k k  since for every   homk k  k n  of rank n the linear map p  is
surjective zk is a vector bundle of rank ek  en over the rankn locus in homk k  k n  hence zk is
an irreducible variety with dim zk  knek en  we therefore expect the projection   zk  p k k 
to be dominant for k  n to prove that this is indeed the case we need to show that for z  zk
sufficiently general the local dimension at z of the fibre 1 z is at most dimzk ek  knen 
by the upper semicontinuity of the fibre dimension it suffices to exhibit a single point z with this
property and indeed it suffices to show that the tangent space to the fibre at z has dimension at
most kn  en 
to find such a point z set u  k n and v  k kn and consider
z  u  p u q  r  zk 
where u  u  v  u is the projection and u  u  u  v is the inclusion and where we will choose
r  p  u   v  p u  v  note that then

and that p u r  0 so that z does indeed lie in zk

the tangent space tz 1 z projected into homk k  k n  is contained in the solution space
of the linear system of equations
p u  p u q  r  q

mod 2

for  by the rank theorem the dimension of this solution space equals kn  dimhomk k  k n 
minus the rank of the linear map
homu  v u   p u   7 the coefficient of  in p u  p u q  r
so it suffices to prove that for all k  n there is a suitable r such that this linear map is surjective in
fact we will restrict the domain to those   homu  v u  of the form   v where v  u  v  v
is the projection and   homv u  then
p u  p u q  p u    v   u q  p idu q  q
so p u q does not contribute to the coefficient of  and this coefficient equals
p idu  idu idp  u  r
where idu  idu  u  u  u is the map sending u1  u2  to u1  u2  note that the codomain of
idp  u   equals p  u   u  p u  u  so that the composition above makes sense below we will
show that for k  n  dim v  n and suitable r  p  u   v the linear map
pvr  homv u   p u 
 7 p idu  idu idp  u  r
is surjective
hence there exists a k such that zk  p k k  is dominant by chevalleys theorem the image
contains a dense open subset of p k k  and this dense open subset intersects the dense set xk k 
hence there exists an element p  xk k  and a   homk k  k n  such that p p  q finally
since x is a subset of p  also q is a point in xk n  hence xk n   p k n  for each n as desired 
lemma 222 let p be a polynomial functor over an infinite field k with chark  0 or chark 
degp  and let u  vec then for v  vec with dim v  dim u  there exists an r  p  u   v
such that
pvr  homv u   p u 
 7 p idu  idu idp  u  r
is surjective
proof when chark  0 the abelian category of polynomial functors is semisimple with the
schur functors as a basis when chark  p  0 the situation is more complicated the irreducible
polynomial functors still correspond to partitions 16 theorem 35 a degreed irreducible polynomial
functor is a submodule of the functor t v   v d if and only if the corresponding partition is column
pregular 19 theorem 32 luckily this is always the case when d  p and the abelian category of
polynomial functors of degree  p is semisimple 16 corollary 26e now if p q are such polynomial
functors and r1  p  u   v and r2  q u   w have the required property for p q respectively
then
r  r1  r2   p  u   v   q u   w   p  u   q u   v  w 
 p  q u   v  w 
has the required property for p  q hence it suffices to prove the lemma in the case where p is an
irreducible polynomial functor of degree d we then have t  p  q where t v   v d and q
is another polynomial functor by a similar argument as above if r  t  u   v has the required
property for t  then its image in p  u   v has the required property for p  hence it suffices to prove
the lemma for t

now we have
t u  v   t u   v  u  u      u   u  v  u      u 
     u  u  u      v   terms of higher degree in v 


so that t is a direct sum of d copies of u 7 u d1  we take r in the first of these copies as follows
let e1      en be a basis of u and set
x
v  e1      ed1
r 
nd1

where the v are a basis of a space v of dimension nd1  for every   nd1 and i  n the linear
map  that maps v to ei and all other v to zero is a witness to the fact that ei  e1      ed1
is in the image of tvr  hence this linear map is surjective

lemma 223 assume that k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero let p q be polynomial
functors assume that p is irreducible of degree d q has degree  d and let   q  p be a
polynomial transformation then there is a uniform bound on the strength of elements of imv  that
is independent of v 
proof let r be the sum of the components of q of strictly positive degree any element in imv 
is also in imv  for a polynomial transformation v  r  p obtained from  by a suitable specialisation write r  r1      rk  where the ri are schur functors of degrees 0  di  d the
polynomial transformation  factors uniquely as the polynomial transformation

and a linear polynomial transformation   f  p  as  is linear we see that strv v  strv
for all v  vec and v  f v  so it suffices to prove that the elements of the subset im which
depends only on q and d have bounded strength we have

proof of theorem 152 main theorem i let x be a subset of a pure polynomial functor p over
an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero for each v  vec define y v   xv  if
y is a proper closed subset of p  then by 6 theorem
s 425 there exist finitely many polynomial
transformations i  qi  p with qi  p and y v   i imiv  for all v  vec since x  y  we
are done otherwise if y v   p v  for all v  then theorem 221 implies that also xv   p v 
for all v  the last statement follows from the previous lemma

proof of corollary 154 let x be the subset of p constisting of all elements f  p v  such that
homv u   p u 
 7 p f
is not surjective by main theorem i it suffices to prove that x 6 p  as before we claim that in
fact xv  6 p v  already when dim v  degp   dim p u 
first suppose that p is irreducible then p is a schur functor take v0  k d and l  dim p u 
then it is known that homv0  u   p v0  spans p u  let p 1 p1      p l pl be a basis of p u 
let i  v0  v0l and i  v0l  v0 be the inclusion and projection maps and take
p  p i p1      p l pl  p v0l

then p i  i p  p i pi  hence
homv0l  u   p u 
 7 p p
is surjective
next suppose that p  q  r and that there exist f  qv  and g  rw  such that
homv u   qu 

and

homw u   ru 

 7 qf

 7 rg

are surjective by induction we can assume such f g exist when dim v  degp   dim qu  and
dim w  degp   dim ru  now we see that
homv  w u   p u 
 7 p p 1 f   p 2 g
is surjective this proves the first part of the corollary for the second statement we note that when
p is irreducible the elements of imi  have bounded strength as the bound depends only on x and
s
x only depends on dim u  we see that f 6 ki1 imi  for all f with strength greater than some
function of dim u only

31 construction of the minimal class let p be a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree
d  0 over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero decompose
p  p 1      p l
into schur functors for each u  vec of dimension  d the glu module p i u  is irreducible
and in particular nonzero let v  vec be a vector space of dimension d let v 1i be a copy of v
for each i  1     l and choose any nonzero q 1i  p i v 1i  we write
q 1  q 11      q 1l  p 1 v 11       p l v 1l   p w 1 
where w 1  v 11      v 1l  we take independent copies w j  v j1      v jl of w 1
and copies q j  q j1      q jl  p w j  of q1 and set
q  q 1  q 2      p
where we concatenate copies of a basis in the lddimensional space w 1 to identify w 1      w k
with k kld 
vd
 so that we may take v  k d  we may take q 11  xd1 
example 311 let p  s d 
vd 12

 where x1      xd and xd1      x2d are bases of
s d v 11  and q 12  xd1      x2d 
v 11 and v 12  respectively we then have
q  xd1  xd1      x2d   xd2d1  x3d1      x4d     



we will prove first that any q constructed in this manner has a dense gl orbit in p  and
second that q  p for all p  p with a dense gl orbit
32 density of the orbit of q
proposition 321 the gl orbit of q is dense in p 
proof it suffices to prove that for each u  vec and each p  p u  there exists a k  1 and a linear
map   w 1      w k  u such that p q 1      q k   p furthermore we may assume
that u has dimension at least d fix a linear injection   v  u  now q i  p q ji  is a nonzero
vector in the glu module p i u  which is is irreducible hence the component pi of p in p i u 
can be written as
pi  p g 1i q i      p g ki i q i

for suitable elements g 1i      g ki i  endu  do this for all i  1     l by taking the maximum
of the numbers ki and setting the irrelevant g ji equal to zero we may assume that the ki are
all equal to a fixed number k this is the k that we needed now we may define  by declaring its

33 minimality of the class of q
proposition 331 we have q  p for every p  p with a dense gl orbit
proof let p  p be a tensor with a dense gl orbit and write p  p0  p1  p2     with pi  p k i 
take m0  n0  0 there exists a linear map 0  k m0  k n0 such that p 0 pm0  qn0  0
namely the zero map write ni  n0  ild our goal is to contruct for each integer i  1 an integer
mi  mi1 and a linear map i  k mi mi1   w i such that the linear map i  k mi  k ni

commute satisfies p i pmi  qni  q 1      q i 
let i  1 be an integer as observed in 21 we can write
p k mi1  v   p k mi1   r1 v       rd1 v   p v 
where rj  shk mi1 p j is a homogeneous polynomial functor of degree j writing k n as k mi1 
k nmi1   we obtain a corresponding decomposition
p  pmi1  r1      rd1  p
where rj  rjmi1 and p  pmi1 and we claim that p has a dense glmi1 orbit here we
use the notation from remark 167
the polynomial bifunctor u v  7 p u  v  is a direct sum of bifunctors of the form u v  7
qu   rv  where q r are schur functors it follows that rj v  is the direct sum of spaces
qk mi1   rv  where q r are schur functors of degrees d  j j respectively hence the elements r1      rd1 have finite strength also note that pmi1  p k mi1  has finite strength so by
corollary 168 we see that the glmi1 orbit of p must be dense
ld1
the tuple r1      rd1  
j1 rjmi1 may not have a dense glmi1 orbit however
there exists a polynomial functor r less than or equal to r1      rd1 with r0  0 an
r  rmi1 and a polynomial transformation
  1      d1   r  r1      rd1
such that r has a dense glmi1 orbit and r  r1      rd1  since p is homogeneous of degree
d  degr the pair r p  has a dense orbit in rmi1  pmi1 by 6 lemma 453 hence by
corollary 163 there exists an mi  mi1  ld and a linear map i  k mi mi1   w i such that
ri rmi mi1   0 and p i pmi mi1   q i 
since polynomial transformations between polynomial functors with zero constant term map zero
to zero the first equality implies that for all j  1     d  1
rj i rjmi mi1   rj i j rmi mi1    j ri rmi mi1    j 0  0
thus informally applying the map i makes p specialise to the required q i  while the terms
r1      rd1 are specialised to zero

remark 332 note that the element e  e constructed above has only finitely many nonzero entries
in each row and in each column

remark 333 fix an integer k  0 then we have the following strengthening of the previous
1 k
theorem we have x1      xk  q  l1      lk  p for every l1      lk  p  s
  p with a dense
gl orbit here q is defined as before in variables distinct from x1      xk  to see this note that a
1 k
1
tensor in s
  p with a dense gl orbit is of the form l1      lk  p where l1      lk  s
are linearly independent and p  p has a dense gl orbit by acting with an invertible element of
e as in example 182 we may assume that li  xi  take n0  k similar to induction step in the
proof of the previous theorem there exists an integer m0  k and a linear map   k m0 k  k n0
such that the linear map 0  idk    k k  k m0 k  k n0 satisfies p 0 pm0  qn0  0 we now
proceed as in the proof of the theorem with these m0  n0  0 to find the result

proof of theorem 191 existence of p the existence of a minimal p among all elements with a dense
gl orbit follows directly from propositions 321 and 331

34 maximal tensors next we construct maximal elements with respect to  of p for any
pure polynomial functor p  we start with nway tensors then do schur functors and finally general
polynomial functors let d  1 be an integer and let t d be the polynomial functor sending v 7 v d

with p1  p2      t
and by assumption we can specialize rd1 to pi using an element of e for all i
combined this yields a specialization of rd to p note here that xij1 7 xi and xijk 7 lijk for
k  1 in such a way that xl occurs when ranging over k in only finitely many lijk when i  l and
xl does not occur in lijk when i  l this means that the specialization of rd to p indeed goes via

an element of e so for all d  1 the space t
has a maximal element with respect to 


lemma 342 let p be a schur functor of degree d  1 then there exists a tensor r  p such
that p  r for all p  p

 let r be the component in p of rd from the
previous lemma then p  r for all p  p

p  r for all p  p 

4 further examples
in this section we give more examples we prove that tensors in p with a dense gl orbit for a
single equivalence class when p has degree  2 we compare candidates for minimal tensors in a direct
sum of s d s of distinct degrees and we construct maximal elements in p for all p with p 0  0

example 411 take p  s 1  s 1  then a pair v w  s
 s
has one of the following forms
1
1 the pair v w with v w  s
linearly independent vectors
1
2 the pair u u with u  s nonzero and     p1  or
3 the pair 0 0

in the first case the pair v w has a dense gl orbit and is equivalent to x1  x2  when vw  0
for some    k then this also holds for all specialisations of v w so the poset of equivalence
classes is given by
x1  x2 
p1
0 0
1
where a point     p1 corresponds to the class of u u with u  s
nonzero and all points in
1
p are incomparable


example 412 take p  s 2  by proposition 331 each infinite quadric
x
p
aij xi xj
1ij

of infinite rank specialises to the quadric q  x1 x2  x3 x4     via a suitable linear change of
coordinates here each variable is only allowed to occur in only finitely many of the linear forms that
x1  x2     are substituted by conversely it is not difficult to see that q specialises to p as well by

z1  z2  z2c1  z2c2          z2c1  z2c  z4c1  z4c    
where y2ibj  xa2ib2icj for i  0 and 1  j  2b and z2icj  xa2i1b2icj for i  0 and
1  j  2c by the previous examples each of the entries in this latter tuple independently specialises
to any tensor in the same space so the entire tuple also specialises to any other tuple in p  so the
tuple with a dense gl orbit again form a single equivalence class

42 nonhomogeneous polynomial functors the proof of proposition 331 relies on the fact
that p is homogeneous apart from the slight generalisation from remark 333 we dont know if
such a result holds in a more general setting
