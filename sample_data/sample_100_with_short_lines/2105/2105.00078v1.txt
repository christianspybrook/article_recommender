introduction

ergodic optimization is the branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of
the properties of the set of invariant probability measures that maximize the
value of the integral with respect to a fixed at least continuous potential a see
for instance bll13 gar17 jen06 and jen19 the underlying dynamics
of the abovementioned papers is given by the shift map this is the classical
ergodic optimization framework
here we are interested in discretetime linear dynamical systems acting on
a separable banach space x we point out that the dynamics of a bounded
linear operator has some features which are quite different from the dynamics

of the shift for instance if v  x is a periodic point for t  x  x then
the collection of all vectors in the onedimensional subspace generated by v are
also periodic points nowadays there exists substantial work on the dynamics
of bounded linear operators acting on banach spaces see for instance bm09
bcd 18 bm20 gs91 gm14 gp11
in statistical mechanics the influence of the temperature temp  0 is de1
scribed by considering the potential temp
a it is common to introduce the
1
parameter t  temp  the gibbs state associated with the potential t a will be
denoted by t a  when the potential is of hlder class several nice properties
can be derived for its corresponding gibbs states see for instance pp90 in
lmsv19 the authors show the existence of t invariant probabilities with full
support using the gibbs state point of view
given a hlder potential a we call equilibrium state for a an invariant one
that maximizes a variational principle of pressure to be defined later for
the case when the dynamics is given by the shift several papers addressed the
question of showing that a gibbs state for a is an equilibrium state for a as well
see for instance pp90 in the first part of our paper we will be interested in
equilibrium states they are invariant by the dynamics governed by the bounded
linear operator t  the second part of the paper is dedicated to the topic of
ergodic optimization
several results in ergodic optimization were developed using tools of thermodynamical formalism for compact and polish metric spaces see for instance
bll13 bgt18 gar17 gt12 jen06 jmu06 jmu07 this is so because
maximizing probabilities for a potential a appear in a natural way as the limit
of equilibrium states when the temperature temp  1t goes to zero which is
the same to say that t   an invariant probability obtained as an accumulation point as the limit of a subsequence tn   is called a ground
state they are special in some sense because in addition they maximize the
entropy among all the maximizing probability measures of the potential a see
bll13 clt01 fv18 jmu05 kem11
in the case of the uniqueness of such accumulation point we say that there
exists selection of probability at zero temperature this is the case for example when the maximizing probability is unique one can show that for a
generic hlder potential the maximizing probability is unique see for instance
clt01 a very important result in the area shows that generically in the
class of hlder continuous potentials the maximizing probability has support
in a unique periodic orbit see con16
in bre03 cgu11 and lep05 it was proved without assuming uniqueness of the maximizing probability the existence of a unique accumulation point
at zero temperature in the context of subshifts of finite type under the assumption that the potential depends only on finite coordinates se also bgt18
and gt12 for another kind of examples where there exists selection at zero
temperature
in bcl 11 and ver07 the authors present examples of a hlder continuous potential where selection at zero temperature does not occur

for the shift map in the noncompact setting similar results were proved
showing the existence of ground states the existence of accumulation points at
zero temperature results in this direction were obtained for countable markov
shifts satisfying the socalled bip property topologically transitive countable
markov shifts and full shifts defined on the lattice rn see for instance fv18
jmu05 kem11 lmms15 lv20a sv20
the study of subactions and calibrated subactions provides important tools
in the study of maximizing measures associated with hlder continuous or even
continuous potentials and its corresponding supports this is so because a subaction provides tools to identify the support of maximizing probabilities see
bll13 clt01 several works addressed this issue in the context of xy
models expanding maps of the circle subshifts of finite type and even in noncompact settings such as shifts defined on polish spaces a helpful tool used to
find subactions associated with a potential satisfying certain regularity is the
socalled ma potential see for details bcl 11 cf19 clt01 gar17 gl08
jmu07 lmms15 lmst09
the dynamics of bounded linear operators on banach spaces see bm09
bcd 18 gil20 gp11 present some special properties which are significantly
different from the ones for the shift and continuous maps acting on polish
spaces questions of topological nature as expansivity shadowing transitivity and structural stability in this linear setting were addressed in bcd 18
bm20 gil20 we refer the reader to the first part of lmsv19 for a short
account of some basic definitions and results concerning the theory of linear
dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension
for the discretetime dynamical action of a bounded linear operator t  x 
x on a banach space x the paper gm14 present results about the existence of
t invariant probability measures with full support in the case that x is reflexive
and separable an extension of this result for a more general setting including
nonreflexive separable banach spaces was presented in lmsv19 this was
obtained via the classical tool in thermodynamic formalism known as ruelleperronfrobenius theorem it was assumed that the kernel of the bounded
linear operator l is nontrivial and of finite dimension in order to define this
operator it was necessary in lmsv19 to fix an a priori probability on the
kernel of t with some properties
for most of the reasoning of the present paper we consider similar assumptions as in lmsv19 we introduce the concepts of entropy and pressure in the
setting of linear dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension our first goal
is to show that for a given potential a  x  r satisfying some mild regularity
assumptions the gibbs state a obtained in theorem 1 in lmsv19 is in fact
an equilibrium state associated with a ie it is satisfied a variational principle
of pressure and the supremum is attained at a 
our second goal is to present results on the topic of ergodic optimization
we prove that the accumulation points of the family of probability measures
ta t1  when t goes to  are maximizing probability measures for a we
point out the existence of accumulation points is not a trivial matter this will
require assuming some properties for the potential a in order to be able to show
3

that a certain sequence of probabilities is tight for some of our results we will
need some more strong assumptions on the a priori probability measure than
the ones considered in lmsv19 moreover we show the existence of calibrated
subactions when the potential is at least hlder continuous our most important new assumption is to suppose that the banach space x has a schauder
basis which is a property satisfied by a wide class of banach spaces such as
c0 r lp r 1  p   and any separable hilbert space h moreover we
present examples concerning frequently hypercyclic and devaney chaotic operators l  x  x which are defined on the banach spaces x  c0 r or
x  lp r 1  p   this class of operators which were also considered in
lmsv19 are given by the equation
lxn n1   n xn1 n1 
where n n1 is a sequence of real numbers satisfying suitable conditions see
for instance bm09 bcd 18 bm20 gp11 this type of operator is known
in the classical mathematical literature as weighted shift
at the end of the paper we introduce the concept of ma potential in
the setting of linear dynamics taking advantage of the ma potential we
prove the existence of calibrated subactions associated with hlder continuous
potentials under the assumption that the set of maximizing measures is nonempty furthermore we show that it is not necessary to assume the hypothesis
of summable variations on the potential in order to guarantee the result in the
last section we also present some examples where is possible to get an explicit
expression for the calibrated subaction and is guaranteed the selection at zero
temperature
the paper is organized as follows
in section 2 we introduce basic definitions and state the main results to be
obtained in the paper
in section 3 we prove the existence of ground states in the matter of linear
dynamics on vector spaces of infinite dimension more precisely in section 31
appears the proof of theorem 1 which guarantees that any gibbs state is in
fact an equilibrium state in section 32 appears the proof of theorem 2 which
guarantees the existence of ground states finally in section 34 we present a
particular example in the setting of weighted shifts
in section 4 we show existence of calibrated subactions using the ma
potential more precisely in section 41 appears the proof of theorem 3 and in
section 42 we present some examples to illustrate the theory
the proofs of some of our results in the setting linear dynamics are similar
to the analogous ones for the shift in this case we will just briefly mention to
the reader references for the proof for some other results the proofs are quite
different and we provide full details in this case

main results

in this section we present some basic definitions that are required for our reasoning and we also state the main results of the paper consider a banach space
x equipped with the norm k  kx  given a bounded linear operator t  x  x
we denote by kt kco the conorm of t  which is given by
kt kco  infkt xkx  kxkx  1 
it is known that for any injective operator t is true that kt kco  0 moreover for each x  x we have that kt kcokxkx  kt xkx  kt kopkxkx 
where kt kop is the operator norm of t  from this follows the existence of
1
the limit limn kt n kco  n  indeed the limit exists as a consequence of the
subadditivity of the sequence of real numbers kt n kco n1 
hereafter we assume that the banach space x can be decomposed as the
direct sum
x  kert   e 
where kert  denotes the kernel of t  which is assumed of finite dimension
then defining
pt   infkt xkx  kxkx  1 x  e 

1

it follows that pt   0 and pt kxkx  kt xkx for each x  e furthermore under the assumption that for each n  n the banach space x admits a
decomposition of the form
x  kert n   en 
where en1  en  it follows that pt n   0 besides that as a consequence
of the subadditivity of the sequence pt n n1  it follows the existence of the
1
limit limn pt n  n 
p
it is known that the convergence of the series n1 pt n  to a real number
implies that the dynamical system t  x  x is devaney chaotic and frequently
hypercyclic see for details bm09 gp11 in particular the above implies that
the dynamical system t is topologically transitive under the assumption that
x is a separable banach space
for each x  x  0 and any n  n we use the following notation
t n x  t n x  v  x  t n v  x 
assuming that t is surjective but not injective we obtain that the set t 1 x
is a nonempty and nonsingleton set moreover for each v  t 1 x it is
satisfied the expression
t 1 x  kert   v  z  v  z  kert  
in other words t 1 x is isometrically isomorphic to kert  this property
will be quite useful in the definition of the ruelle operator in the same way as
in lmsv19

denote by cx the set of continuous functions from x into r and by cb x
the set of bounded continuous functions from x into r the set cb x equipped
with the uniform norm k  k  which is given by kk  supx  x  x

where
vtn a  supax  ay  t i x  t i y 1  i  n 
we denote by sv t x the set of potentials with summable variations that
is the ones satisfying the equation in 2
given a function   cx and   0 1 define

a function  is called hlder continuous if hol
   the set of all
the hlder continuous functions from x into r is denoted by h x and the
set of all the bounded hlder continuous functions is denoted by hb x
given t as above we consider an a priori probability measure  on the
kernel of t whose support is all the kernel for instance when the kernel has
dimension one we could take  as the gaussian distribution on r which is
isomorphic to the kernel of t  with mean zero and variance 1 more precisely
2
taking   f dr with f r  12 er 2 
definition 2 we say that a probability  has strong adapted tails if for any
  0 there exists a sequence of positive numbers n n1 such that
p

n1 pt n  pt n    
2 the sequence n n1 belongs to l1 r

the above conditions are stronger than the ones presented in the definition of
adapted measure that appears in lmsv19 any probability measure satisfying
the conditions of definition 2 is also an adapted measure as defined in lmsv19
now we define a transfer operator acting on the set cb x which will help
us to find the socalled equilibrium states and ground states via the existence
of gibbs states and the variational principle given a bounded above potential
a  h x and an a priori borelian probability measure  supported on
kert  and satisfying the strong adapted tails property the ruelle operator la

we say that the potential a is normalized for the a priori probabilty  if

denote by bx the set of finite borelian measures on x by wellknown
properties of the dual operator see for instance lmsv19 we can define the
dual ruelle operator la as the map that assigns to each   bx the probability la  which for each   cb x satisfies

following the proof of the main theorem in lmsv19 with a modification
in the part that guarantees the existence of the main eigenfunction we adapt
the reasoning of section 3 in css19 to the linear dynamics setting it is not
difficult to check that for any bounded above potential a  h x  sv t x
there is an eigenvalue a  0 and a strictly positive eigenfunction a  hb x
associated with a  moreover under the assumption that la 1  1 it is
possible to guarantees the existence of a gibbs state a ie a fixed point of the
operator la 
the hypothesis on lmsv19 was that the potential was bounded above
and below and we will need here for some of our results that a is just bounded
above
note that even in the case when a is not a normalized potential the above
claim implies the existence of an eigenprobability a for the dual ruelle operator la  associated with the same eigenvalue a  the probability a has
the same support of the gibbs state associated with the associated normalized
potential to be defined below indeed since the potential
a  a  loga   loga  t   loga  
is a normalized potential one gets that la a  a  thus denoting a  a  it
follows that a  1a da satisfies the desired property we call a the associated
normalized potential for a
we say that a is the gibbs state for the nonnormalized potential a a
is the conformal measure associated with a and a  0 is the main eigenvalue
of la 
hereafter we use the notation px for the set of borelian probability measures on x and we denote by pt x the ones that are invariant by the action
of t 
definition 3 given an a priori probability measure  supported on the kernel
of t  and   pt x the entropy of  is defined as
o
nz
 l u 
0
d  u  cb x u  0 
4
h   inf
log
u
x

remark 1 the values of h  are nonpositive and for the measure  of
maximal entropy the value h   0 in this last case we can guarantee the
existence of such  because the potential b  0 is a normalized potential
when considering the symbolic space 1 2 dn the shift   1 2 dn 
1 2 dn and taking  as the counting measure on 1 2  d the real positive
value one obtains from the analogous expression to 4 using ruelle operator
etc is exactly the kolmogorovshannon entropy see lo1 lmms15 sv20
if we take  as the normalized counting probability on 1 2  d then we get
that the value obtained from 4 is the kolmogorovshannon entropy minus the
value log d therefore a non positive number as explained in lmms15
when the set of preimages of any point with respect to the dynamics is not
a countable set it is not appropriate to define entropy via dynamical partitions
this happens for instance when considering the shift acting on the symbolic
space m n  where m is a compact metric space like the case where m is the
unitary circle then alternatively one can define entropy via the information
provided by the ruelle operator which depends on an a priori probability
measure  as above in 4 and taking the ruelle operator associated with the
potential which is constant equal to zero we point out that in the general
case it is required to take  as a probability and not a measure in order for the
expression 4 to be welldefined  by taking  as a probability not a infinite
measure the value we obtain in 4 is nonpositive and the maximal possible
value of the entropy of an invariant probability is the value zero we refer the
reader to lmms15 sv20 for more details
in this way it is natural to adapt this point of view in our setting defining
entropy of an t invariant probability via 4 it is important to notice that 4
depends on the socalled a priori probability measure hence fixing a probability for instance the natural standard gaussian measure on kert  such
definition results in a topological invariant with respect to the map t 
definition 4 given a bounded above potential a  h x  sv t x we call
the pressure of a the value

the first result of our paper claims that given a potential a satisfying suitable conditions see lmsv19 for the assumptions the set of gibbs states
associated with a is contained into the set of equilibrium states for a and
p a  loga  where a is the main eigenvalue of the transfer operator la 
actually in lmsv19 the authors assume that the potential a defining the
transfer operator is bounded and hlder continuous however as we already

8

mentioned the proof in lmsv19 also guarantees the existence of such gibbs
states when the potential a is hlder continuous and bounded above
the precise statement of our first result is the following
theorem 1 consider a separable banach space x and a bounded linear operator t  x  x such that t is surjective but not bijective assume also that
x
 kert n en  with en1  en  for each n  n and moreover suppose that
p
n 
  for each bounded above potential a  h x  sv t x
n1 pt 
denote the gibbs state associated with a by a  then the following variational
principle is satisfied
z
ada 
p a  loga   h a  
x

that is the gibbs state a associated with a is also an equilibrium state for
a
theorem 1 is widely known in the mathematical literature as the variational
principle of pressure or the ruelle theorem this result will be a quite useful
instrument throughout the paper we will use it as a tool to find the socalled
maximizing measures and ground states of the potential a in the setting of linear
dynamics below we establish conditions in order to guarantees the existence of
such measures we would like to point out to the reader that the proof of this
variational principle depends exclusively on properties of the transfer operator
defined in 3 however we include it in order to facilitate the understanding
of the theory in the setting that we are interested
definition 5 a schauder basis for the banach space x is a sequence ek k1
of vectors in x such that for each x  x there is a unique sequence of real
numbers k k1 satisfying
lim

n

x

n
x

k1

k ek

x

first note that any banach space equipped with a schauder basis results
in a separable space furthermore it is widely known that any schauder basis
for x induces a corresponding basis of coordinate functions for the dual space
x   which is given by a sequence k k1 on x   such that for each i j  n it
p
is satisfied j ei   ij  hereafter we use the notation x  k1 k ek when
the vector x  x satisfies the limit in 5 for the values k  k x for each
k  n actually note that the sequence k k1 is a total subset of x   ie if
k x  0 for each k  n it follows that x  0
there are several examples of banach spaces equipped with a schauder basis
for instance x  c0 r lp r 1  p   and x  h where h is an
arbitrary separable hilbert space these are typical examples of spaces satisfying
that property in particular the set of coordinate functions agrees with the
schauder basis itself when x  h is an arbitrary separable hilbert space
moreover in the last case the schauder basis is called as hilbert basis of h
9

definition 6 consider a banach space x equipped with a schauder basis
ek k1 and coordinate functions k k1  define the set
xij  x  x  j  i   j  1
we say that a potential a  cx satisfies the summability condition if for
each i  n is satisfied

x

esupax xxij

j1

in particular the socalled summability condition implies that for each i  n
it is satisfied the property limj supax  x  xij    hence in
that case we get supa   and therefore the potential a cannot be a
bounded below potential
definition 7 given a potentialr a  cx a measure max  pt x is called
a maximizing measure for a if x admax  ma where
nz
o
ma  sup
ad    pt x 
7
x

we denote by pmax a the set of invariant probability measures attaining
the supremum in 7 which is usually called as the set of maximizing measures
of a
it is important to point out that for any potential a in cx satisfying the
socalled summability condition we have ma   however even assuming
that condition we can have that pmax a   in the following example we
present a case where the set of maximizing measures is a nonempty subset of
pt x the above under strong assumptions in the behavior of the potential
example 1 when v is such that t k v  v the probability measure 
e with
support in the periodic orbit v t v t 2v  t k1 v of the form

e 

k1
1 x
 j
k j0 t v

pk1
at j v  ma if for all j 
is t invariant then in this case k1 j0
0 1 2  k  1 we have that at j v  ma it follows that 
e is maximizing
for a
in order to prove the existence of ground states and maximizing measures in
the case of bounded above potentials belonging to the set h x  svx we
will take advantage of certain properties of gibbs states which are consequences
of the main theorem in lmsv19 the next theorem claims that under suitable
assumptions for the potential a the set of ground states is a nonempty set
10

note that this is a nontrivial claim this is so by the lack of compactness of
the banach space x and also by the fact that the closed balls are not compact
in such vector spaces by the theorem of riesz
the statement of the result is as follows
theorem 2 let x be a banach space equipped with a schauder basis ek k1
and consider t  x  x a bounded linear operator surjective but not bijective
assume
also that x  kert n   en  with en1  en  for each n  n
p
n 
and
  then for any potential a  h x  sv t x
n1 pt 
satisfying the summability condition the family of equilibrium states ta t1
has accumulation points at infinity  denoted generically by   the probability
 will be maximizing for a
our second interest in this paper is to be able to locate the union of the
supports of maximizing measures associated with a fixed potential a  cx
a tool widely used for this purpose in the classic literature on ergodic optimization is based on calibrated subactions in order to use this tool some
hypotheses are needed all of this of course for the case where pmax a is
a nonempty set the last theorem provides conditions for the existence of
maximizing probabilities
we would like to mention that some results about the existence of maximizing measures where the underlying space is not compact for a certain class of
potentials defined on some polish spaces with bounded expansive metrics were
presented in jmu07
another class of potentials where pmax a is a nonempty set is the following
definition 8 assume that the potential a belongs to cx we say that a
satisfies the maximizing property if there are vector subspaces y z  x such
that x  y  z dimy    and for each x  xy  xz belonging to x with
xy  y and xz  z we have
ax  axy  

8

and
lim

kxy kx 

axy    

9

note that the maximizing property for a implies that supa   in
lemma 4 we prove that under suitable conditions of regularity for the potential
a the maximizing property implies that pmax a is a nonempty set
in lemma 3 we prove that pmax a 6  when there exist ground states the
last claim in theorem 2
given a the property pmax a 6  will guarantee that the subaction obtained via the ma potential is welldefined 
the socalled subactions are also known in the mathematical literature as
revelations for details see gl08 jen06 jen19
definition 9 given a potential a  cx we say that a continuous function
v  cx is a subaction associated with a if satisfies the following inequality
v  t  v  a  ma 
11

10

there are continuous potentials a without a subaction see for instance
jen06 in general some regularity of the potential a is required for the
existence of subactions see clt01
it is easy to see that for any maximizing probability  for a and each subaction v associated with a the support of  is contained in the set
a  x  x  v t x  v x  ax  ma  0 

11

it is also true that in the case the support of a probability  is contained in
the set a then  is a maximizing probability for a see clt01
in this way a subaction can help to find explicitly the support of a maximizing measure see for instance clt01 bll13 gar17
definition 10 let v be a subaction for a if for any x  x there exists a
point y  t 1 x which attains the equality in 10 ie
v x  v y  ay  ma 
we say that v is a calibrated subaction
there are cases where one can show the existence of maximizing probabilities
for continuous potentials even if we cannot apply the ruelleperronfrobenius
theorem formalism in this case we can consider maximizing probabilities
without talking about ground states also known in the mathematical literature
as limits at temperature zero subactions will be helpful anyway see the
expression in 11 in example 2 we will consider a potential which is not
bounded but exhibits an explicit subaction
in order to prove the existence of subactions we introduce an additional tool
known in the classical mathematical literature as ma potential for details see
clt01 gl08 and section 3 in clo14 for the case of the finite shift
definition 11 given a potential a  h x we define the ma potential a
associated with a as the map given by

at j x is the nth ergodic sum of the potential

we claim that under the assumptions in theorem 3 we have that a x y
belongs to  0 for any pair of points x y  x for details of the proof see
section 41
now we will present conditions to guarantee the existence of subactions associated with hlder continuous potentials a via the use of the ma potential
the statement of our third main result is the following

theorem 3 consider x a banach space and t  x  x a bounded linear
operator surjective but not injective assume p
that x  kert n   en  with

  suppose
n1 pt 
also that a  h x and pmax a is a nonempty set then for each x  x
the map y  a x y belongs to h x and it is a calibrated subaction for a
an example of a potential a where the hypotheses of the above theorem are
satisfied is ax  kx  vkx  where v is a fixed point for t  in this case the
probability with support on v is maximizing for a see example 2 for a more
complete discussion

existence of equilibrium states and maximizing measures

in this section we present the proof of theorem 1 which asserts the existence of
equilibrium states for the gibbs states obtained in the ruelleperronfrobenius
theorem formalism we also present an example in the context of weighted
shifts see for instance bm09 bcd 18 bm20 gp11 this will be proved in
subsection 31
subsection 32 is dedicated to another topic we propose two different roads
to guarantees the existence of maximizing measures the first one through the
existence of the socalled ground states for potentials satisfying a condition of
decay called in this paper the summability condition the second one using
the socalled maximizing property in which we assume in some way that the
potential attains its maximum on a finite dimensional subspace of x our
purpose is to be able to set conditions such that the ma potential is welldefined 
we assume throughout the section that x is a separable banach space
t  x  x is a bounded linear operator surjective but not bijective we
also assume that p
for each natural number n we get x  kert n   en  with
n 
en1  en  and

a variational principle

theorem 1 claims existence of an equilibrium state for each hlder continuous
potential a with summable variations first note that by lmsv19 it is
guaranteed existence of the eigenvalue a  0 a strictly positive eigenfunction

candidate to be the equilibrium state associated with the potential a the next
result is the first step in order to prove that claim

accumulation points at zero temperature

in this subsection we present the proof of theorem 2 which is the second main
result of our paper our strategy is to adapt a classical result used for finding
accumulation points of families of probability measures defined on noncompact
metric spaces satisfying suitable hypothesis widely known in the mathematical
literature as prohorovs conditions see for instance pro56 pro61 in order
to apply the result to our setting it is necessary to define an adequate family
of compact sets with large enough mass in other words we need to find sets
with measure close to one for all the members of the family ta t1  we have
to show that the family of equilibrium states ta t1 is tight
throughout this section we assume that the space x is equipped with a
fixed schauder basis ek k1  that is for any x  x there is a unique sequence
of real numbers k k1 satisfying equation 5 furthermore we assume that
for each k  n it is satisfied the equality k  k x where k k1 is the
corresponding basis of coordinate functions for the dual space x  
consider a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers mi i1  given
k  n we define
16
k  m1   mk   x  
now we define the function k  x  rk assigning to each point x  x
the value k x  m1 x  mk x given any set of the form ek 
qk
k
i1 ai  bi   r  we say that ck ek  is a cylindrical set generated by ek and
k  if it is of the form
1
ck ek   
ek   x 
k

17

we point out that the definition of cylindrical sets given above is a particular
case of the one that appears on page pp 406 in pro61 it is easy to check that
for any k  n and each finite family of bounded closed intervals ai  bi ki1 
the set defined by
k

x  x  ai  mi x  bi  
i1

is a cylindrical set indeed we have
k

by lemma 3 in pro61 we can guarantee that a family of borel probability
measures s ss on x results in a tight family if and only if for any   0
there exists a compact set k  x and a finite family of linear functionals k
which we choose as defined by 16 such that for each s  s it is satisfied
the inequality
s 1
18
k k k   1   
in the following lemma we show that any cylindrical set of the form 17
satisfies a kind of upper gibbs inequality this will be one of the main tools to
prove the existence of accumulation points for the family of equilibrium states
15

lemma 2 consider a bounded above potential a  h x  sv t x and a
qk
collection of borel sets ek k1 of the form ek  i1 ai  bi  where ai i1 is
a strictly decreasing sequence of real numbers and bi i1 is a strictly increasing
sequence of real numbers with a1  b1  then there is a constant c  1 such
that for each k  n and any x
e belonging to the cylindrical set ck ek  it is
satisfied the following inequality
a ck ek 
c 
esk aexk loga 

19

furthermore we have c  e4vt a 
proof in order to simplify our reasoning we assume first that a is a normalized
potential and after that we prove the result for an arbitrary potential the
above assumption guarantees that la 1  1 and la a   a  since ck ek 
is a closed subset of x there exists a function   cx such that
1ck ek     1 
therefore it follows that for any x
e  ck ek  it is satisfied

20

now assume that a  h x  sv t x is not a normalized potential we
consider its corresponding normalization
a  a  loga   loga  t   loga  

16

where the potential a  hb x and the value a  0 satisfy the equation
la a   a a  it is easy to check that a  h x  sv t x la 1  1
and a  a see for instance lmsv19
note that for any k  n and each x

besides that since la a   a a  we have
z
ealoga zv dz v  t 1 x

then is not difficult to check that for any x y  x is satisfied  loga x
loga y  vt a a similar reasoning to the one used in the case of the
function u in the proof of item a of theorem 1 in lmsv19 the above
implies that suploga   infloga   vt a and vt a  3vt a thus
from 20 it follows immediately that
k

hence choosing the constant c as the value e4vt a  we get 19 and the
proof is finished
remark 2 note that lemma 2 guarantees that for any set xij of the form
described by definition 6 we have
a xij 
 e4vt a 
eaexloga 
the above is true because xij   1 j  1 j  j j  1 this
inequality will be of great importance in the proof of theorem 2
take k as in 16 now we are able to present a collection of compact sets
k    0 1 satisfying 18 for the family of equilibrium states ta t1 
given k  n and a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers ni i1  we
define the sets

xk  x  x  l x  0 l 
 m1   mk 

and

o
n
kk  x  x  mi x  nmi  1  i  k  xk  x

therefore the set kk is a nonempty compact subset of the banach space
x furthermore it is not difficult to check that

now we are able to present the proof of the second main result of this paper
17

proof of theorem 2 first note that given k  n k  m1   mk  and
y  x we have
k y   m1 y   mk y 
 m1 y  xk   mk y  xk 
 k y  xk  
then for each k  n the set kk defined in 21 satisfies

consider the potential b  0 which obviously belongs to the set h x

from the above reasoning it follows that the family of equilibrium states
ta t1 is tight for more details see lemma 3 in pro61 therefore it follows
from the prohorovs theorem the existence of a sequence tn n1  such that
the sequence of equilibrium states tn a n1 is convergent with a limit denoted
by  see for instance bil99 pro56
it is important to point out that the limits of different subsequences do not
have necessarily to be the same
remark 3 in the case that kert n   spane1   en  the condition 6 can
be replaced by the condition

x

esupax xx1n    

n1

note that in this case the summability only depends on the behavior of the
first component of x with respect to the schauder basis ek k1  for example
this property is satisfied in the case of weighted shifts

maximizing measures

in this section we will show the existence of maximizing measures associated
with a certain class of potentials in the framework of linear dynamical systems
on banach spaces of infinite dimension this will be achieved under two different
assumptions first we prove that the socalled ground states whose existence
was obtained in section 32 are maximizing measures this will be proved for
potentials a satisfying the hypothesis of theorem 2 after that we prove the
existence of maximizing measures under the assumption that the potential a
satisfies the maximizing property see definition 8 in these two cases it will
follow see lemma 5 that the ma potential only takes nonpositive values
which is one of the main requirements which will be used in the proof of theorem
3
the following lemma guarantees the existence of maximizing measures under the conditions of theorem 2
lemma 3 assume that  is a ground state obtained from the existence
claimed by theorem 2 then we have that   pmax a
proof the proof of this lemma follows from theorem 1 and the fact that
h   0 for any   pt x indeed it is not difficult to check that ma 
limt logt ta  see for instance bcl 11 lmms15 therefore for any

20

  p x we have
logtn a 
tn
z
h tn a 
 lim
adtn a

nn
tn
x
z

adtn a
nn x
z

ad  ma 

ma  lim

x

the above implies that   pmax a
in the next lemma we also guarantee the existence of maximizing measures
but in this case we assume the socalled maximizing property
lemma 4 consider a potential a  h x satisfying the maximizing property
and let y z be the subspaces of x satisfying 8 and 9 if
y  spanv  t k1 v
for some periodic point v  x of period k it follows that pmax a 6 
proof consider subspaces y z  x satisfying the hypothesis of this lemma
note that under these assumptions all the points in the subspace y are periodic
points of period k
given a point x  x consider the values
mn a x 

1
sn ax
n

and
ma x  lim sup mn a x 
n

it is not difficult to verify that ma  supxx ma x see for instance
jmu07 moreover ma xy   mk a xy   ma when xy belongs to y 
indeed this is true because ma xy  is the value of the integral of a with
pk1
respect to the periodic measure k1 j0 t j xy  
from the limit in 9 there is a constant m  0 such that for each x  x
with kxy k  m 
ma xy   ma  1 
25
define the set xm  x  x  kxy kx  m  note that given a point
x  xm  we can express such point as x  xy  xz where xy  y has norm less
than or equal to m and xz  z ie xm  ym  z where ym  y  y 
kykx  m  on other hand since any point in y is a periodic point of period
k it follows that
k1



t j ym  
26
t j ym  
y0 
j0

j0

21

which implies that the set y0  y is compact and invariant by the action of t 
note that for each x  x such that xy  y  y0  it is valid the inequality
kxy k  m  which implies 25 thus taking supremum on all the points xy 
y  y0 and using 8 we obtain that
ma x 

sup
xx
xy y y0

sup

ma xy   ma  1 

27

xy y y0

on other hand we have
sup ma x  sup ma xy   ma 

28

xy y0

xx
xy y0

where the first one of the inequalities is a consequence of 8 and the second
one follows from the fact that all the points belonging to the t invariant set y0
are in fact periodic points of period k
by inequalities 27 and 28 we have supxx ma x  ma therefore
using that ma  supxx ma x see for instance jmu07 it follows that
sup ma x  ma
xx

furthermore by 8 we have
sup ma x  sup ma xy   ma

xx

xy y0

the above guarantees the existence of a maximizing measure supported on
the compact set y0  which in fact is the limit in the weak topology of periodic
measures supported on periodic points belonging to y0 
note that lemmas 3 and 4 imply that pmax a is a nonempty set we claim
that it will follow from all of the above that the ma potential is welldefined
there exist a finite supremum in expression 12 and only takes nonpositive
values
lemma 5 assume that pmax a is a nonempty set then
sn a  ma  0 

29

in particular the ma potential a associated with a is welldefined and
takes only takes values in the set  0
proof assume that the potential
a satisfies the first condition of the lemma
p
n 
since we are assuming that 
pt
   it follows that the dynamics
n1
t is devaney chaotic which implies that
sup ma x 
xx

sup
xperx

22

ma x  ma 

30

where perx is the set of periodic points of x moreover the last inequality in
30 follows from the fact that for any periodic orbit v  t k1 v is satisfied
the inequality
z

k1
x
t j v  ma 
ad

thus by 30 we get 29

an example weighted shifts

in this section we present particular cases where the assumptions of theorem
1 are true we will consider the socalled weighted shifts in this section see for
details bm09 bcd 18 bm20 gp11 lmsv19
consider the normed space c0 r which is the set of sequences of real numbers xn n1 satisfying limn xn  0 equipped with the norm
kxkc0 r  sup xn  
n1

and the
normed space lp r 1  p   which is the set of sequences satisp
fying n1 xn p   equipped with the norm
kxklp r 


x

n1

xn p

 p1



c0 r and lp r 1  p   are separable banach spaces which are
equipped with the schauder basis ek k1  where ek  ik i1  moreover in
the case 1  p   the space lp r is reflexive as well
consider c c  r satisfying 0  c  c and a sequence n n1  such that
n  c c  for each n  n for each pair of natural numbers k n define
kn  k    kn1 
now fixing the number n define
dn  infkn  k  n 
the weighted shift l  x  x where x  c0 r or x  lp r 1 
p   is given by the linear map lxn n1   n xn1 n1  it is wellknown that the asymptotic behavior of the values kn characterize the topological
properties of the weighted shift l see remark 1 in lmsv19 and bm09
bcd 18 bm20 gp11 for details indeed taking pln   dn  for each
n
p n  
the map p satisfies definition 1 thus the convergence of the series 
d
n1 n
to a real number implies that the weighted shift l is devaney chaotic and
topologically transitive
under the assumptions above the ruelle operator defined in 3 is given by

23

the next propositions are a consequence of the main theorems of this paper
under some strong assumptions in the values kn and dn 
proposition 1 let x be c0 r or lp r 1  p   and l  x  x a
weighted shift assume also that one of the following conditions is satisfied
1

i limn dn  n 
p n 1
ii sup
 k  n  
n1 k 

then for each bounded above potential a  h x  sv l x the gibbs
state a associated with a satisfies
z
loga   h a  
ada  p a 
x

proof by lemma 2 in lmsv19 items i and ii are equivalent to the property
p


  thus our claim follows from theorem 1 indeed this is
n1 dn 
true because pln   dn  for each n  n
proposition 2 let x be c0 r or lp r 1  p   and l  x  x a
weighted shift assume also one of the following conditions
1

i limn dn  n 
p n 1
ii sup
 k  n  
n1 k 

then for any bounded above potential a  h x  sv l x satisfying the
summability condition the family of equilibrium states ta t1 has accumulation points at infinity which belongs to the set pmax a
proof the proof follows the same reasoning already used in the proof of proposition 1
remark 4 note that proposition 2 implies the existence of maximizing measures in the setting of weighted shifts which in particular will guarantee that
the ma potential is welldefined by lemma 5

existence of subactions and some examples

in this section theorem 3 will be proved we will also present some properties
of the ma potential and moreover we will show some explicit examples where
calibrated subactions and maximizing measures do exist moreover we show
an explicit example in which there is selection at zero temperature the first
one of our examples concerns the existence of a calibrated subaction in the
framework of weighted shifts on the space l1 r the other examples concern
the uniqueness of the maximizing measure for potentials defined on weighted
shifts in the spaces c0 r and lp r 1  p

the ma potential

in this subsection we present the proof of theorem 3 and also some results
concerning the behavior of the ma potential we will adapt for the linear
dynamics framework results from gl08
we assume throughout this section that x is a separable banach space
t  x  x is a bounded linear operator surjective but not bijective we also
assume
that for each value of n we get x  kert n   en  with en1  en 
p
and n1 pt n   

proof of theorem 3 fix a certain point x  x we want to prove that the
map a x  is a subaction in order to do that fixing another point y  x
we consider   0 n  n and x  t n y such that kx  x kx   then we
get
sn1 a  max   sn a  max   ay  ma 
31
since t n1 x   t y taking supremum in 31 first in the left side and
after that in the right side we obtain
sup

sup

mn x t m t y
kxx kx 

sm amax   sup

sup

nn x t n y
kxx kx 

sn amax ayma 

taking the limit when  goes to 0 in both sides of the above inequality it
follows that
a x t y  a x y  ay  ma 
that is the map a x  is a subaction
on other hand taking supremum in 31 first on the right side and after
that on the left side and subsequently taking the limit when  goes to 0 we
obtain that
a x t y  a x y  ay  ma 
therefore a x  is a calibrated subaction the above shows that the
potential a is cohomologous to the constant ma via the ma potential
on other hand we will get that a x   h x as a consequence of the
assumption a  h x indeed given   0 and y 1  y 2  x it follows that
for each n  n x1  t n y 1  and x2  t n y 2  satisfying kx  x1 kx   and
kx  x2 kx   we have

pt j  ky 1  y 2 k

pt n  ky 1  y 2 k
x 

thus taking the supremum on x1 and x2  after that taking the supremum
on all the natural numbers n and finally taking the limit when  goes to 0 in the first and in the second one  on the above expressions we get
a x y 1   a x y 2   hol
a


x

n1


pt n  ky 1  y 2 k
x 

in an analogous way we can also prove that
a x y 2   a x y 1   hol
a


x

n1


pt n  ky 1  y 2 k
x 

the above implies that a x   h x and in particular a x y  r
for each y  x and this is the end of the proof
now we present an interesting property of the ma potential the proof is
valid on the general framework of linear dynamics on banach spaces of infinite
dimension it shows a relation of the ma potential with a general subaction v 
analogous results on the framework of classical ergodic optimization appeared
in clt01 and gl08
proposition 3 suppose that the potential a  h x and pmax a is a nonempty set let v  h x be a general subaction for a  h x and a the
ma potential for a then for any pair of points x y  x we get
a x y  v y  v x 

32

proof fix the points x y  x first note that for any point x  x we have
 
v x  v x   hol
v kx  x kx 

moreover since v is subaction it follows that for each n  n it is also
satisfied the inequality
v t n x   v x   sn a  max  
26

then given   0 n  n and x  t n y such that kx  x kx   we
have
v y  v x  v t n x   v x
 
 v t n x   v x   hol
v kx  x kx

 sn a  max   hol
v 

therefore taking the supremum among all the points x  t n y satisfying
that kx  x kx   and after that taking the supremum among all natural
numbers n and finally taking the limit when  goes to 0 we get 32

explicit examples of subactions and uniqueness of
maximizing measure

in this subsection we present explicit examples of a calibrated subactions
associated with bounded above hlder continuous potentials in some examples
we guaranteed selection at temperature zero temperature
example 2 for fixed c  1 consider the operator l  l1 r  l1 r given by
lxn n1   c xn1 n1 
taking v  cn1 n1  it follows that for any   r we get
lv  lv  v 
that is v is a fixed point for l for each   r consider the unbounded
hlder continuous potential
ax   kx  vkl1 r 
it follows that the delta dirac measure v is the unique maximizing probability
measure for a and ma  0
we want to find a subaction associated with the potential a ie a function
v such that for all x is satisfied
v lx  ax  v x

33

assuming that c  2 and taking v x  ax for each x  l1 r we want
to show that 33 is true note that for x  xn n1  l1 r we have

the next examples present cases in which it can be guaranteed selection at

ax   rkx  vkx  kx  vkx 
it follows that a  h1 x moreover the delta dirac measure v is the
unique maximizing probability measure for a and ma  0 therefore there
exists selection of probability at zero temperature

example 4 for fixed c0  c1  1 and either x  lp r or x  c0 r consider
the operator l  x  x given by
lxn n1   ci xn1 n1 
where i  0 1 is the unique number such that n  2k  i for some k  n  0
then
l2 xn n1   c0 c1 xn2 n1 
taking
v  1 0 c0 c1 1  0 c0 c1 2  0 c0 c1 3  0 
and
w  0 c0 c0 c1 1  0 c0 c0 c1 2  0 c0 c0 c1 3  0  
it follows that lv  w and l2 v  v ie v and w are periodic points of period
two for the map l given 1  2  the points of the form 1 v  2 w are points
of period two which generate a linear subspace of periodic points of period two
consider the potential
ax  r kx  vkx kx  vkx  r kx  wkx kx  wkx  
where r was defined above
we have that a  h1 x the periodic orbit v w of period two is such
that 12 v  12 w  and it is the unique maximizing probability measure for the
potential a and ma  0
example 5 for fixed c  1 and either for x  lp r or x  c0 r consider
the operator l  x  x given by
lxn n1   c xn1 n1 
denote w  x the infinitedimensional vector space of the form
w   x1  0 x2  0  0 xn  0   x  x 
define the potential
ax  rdx x w  dx x w  
where r was defined above and dx x w   infkx  wkx  w  w  then
a  h1 x and any   pl x with support contained in w  is maximizing
for a for instance the probability measure tv  1  tlv  t  0 1 where
v  1 0 c2  0 c4  0  0 c2n  0  
is a maximizing measure for the potential a
