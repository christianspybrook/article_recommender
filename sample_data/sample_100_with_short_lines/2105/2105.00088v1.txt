abstract
homeostasis represents the idea that a feature may remain invariant despite changes in some
external parameters we establish a connection between homeostasis and injectivity for reaction
network models in particular we show that a reaction network cannot exhibit homeostasis if a
modified version of the network which we call homeostasisassociated network  is injective we
provide examples of reaction networks which can or cannot exhibit homeostasis by analyzing
the injectivity of their homeostasisassociated networks

introduction

coined by cannon 3 in 1926 the idea of homeostasis has its roots in the work of claude bernard 2
and refers to a regulatory mechanism by which a feature maintains a steady state that is not perturbed by changes in the environment often homeostasis involves the use of negative feedback
loops that help restore a feature to its steady state at the scale of a whole organism homeostasis manifests itself in many forms some prominent examples include the maintenance of body
temperature blood sugar level concentration of ions in body fluids with changes in the external environment homeostasis is also exhibited in intracellular metabolism where certain concentration
remain almost unperturbed with change in concentrations of amino acids 22
as noted in 22 homeostasis does not imply that the whole system remains invariant with
change in external variables in fact changes in external variables can cause changes in certain
internal variables while other internal variables remain almost unchanged in recent years there
has been a lot of interest in identifying and analyzing homeostasis in mathematical models of
biological interaction systems 13 18 22 20 11 25 some of this renewed interest started with the
mathematical analysis of homeostasis in the context of the folate and methionine metabolism 19
22
while there is no universally accepted mathematical definition of homeostasis here we focus
mostly on the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis for inputoutput systems as introduced by golubitsky and stewart in 13 and further refined in 28 12 our main interest is to analyze homeostasis
from the point of view of reaction network theory 7 8 29
this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define reaction networks and related
notions including the notion of injective reaction network in section 3 we introduce homeostasis
as the capacity of a feature to be robust to change in the parameters of the system we present
a procedure for checking whether a reaction network may admit homeostasis by constructing a
1

modified network and checking if it is injective see theorem 34 we also describe a sufficient
condition for perfect homeostasis see theorem 35 in section 4 we present several examples
of reaction networks for which their capacity to exhibit homeostasis can be analyzed using the
procedure described in section 3

euclidean embedded graphs and reaction networks

an euclidean embedded graph is a directed graph g  v e where v  rn and e are the sets of
vertices and edges respectively associated with every edge y y    e is a source vertex y  v
and a target vertex y   v  an edge y y    e will also be denoted by y  y   e
a reaction network is a euclidean embedded graph g  v e where v  rn0 and e is the
set of edges that correspond to reactions in the network 4 5 an alternative way of describing a
reaction network is by specifying a set of species and a set of reactions for example consider the
set of species x1  x2  and the set of reactions 2x1  3x2  x1  x2  3x1  the corresponding
euclidean embedded graph lies in r20 and has two edges one edge from 2 0 to 0 3 and one
edge from 1 1 to 3 0 where the vertex vectors are formed by the coefficients of the species x1
and x2 on the reactant side and product side respectively
the stoichiometric subspace of a reaction network is the linear subspace given by spany  
y  y  y   e given a point x0  rn0  the positive stoichiometric compatibility class of x0 is
the affine subspace x0  s  rn0 
there exist many choices for modelling the kinetics of reaction networks the most common
one is based on the law of massaction 27 14 29 15 7 where associated with each reaction
y  y  there is a rate constant kyy  0 and the dynamics of the network is given by
dx

where x  rn0 and xy  xy11 xy22    xynn  let k  kyy yy e denote the vector of rate constants and f x k denote the righthand side of equation 1 the jacobian corresponding to the
dynamical system 1 is given by the matrix

where x  x1  x2   xn  and fi x k is the righthand side of the dynamics corresponding to
species xi  a point x0  rn0 is said to be an equilibrium of 1 if
x

an equilibrium point x0  rn0 of 1 is said to be complex balanced if for every vertex y in the
reaction network we have

an equilibrium x0  rn0 is said to be a linearly stable equilibrium of 1 if the eigenvalues of the
jacobian of 1 evaluated at the point x0 have negative real parts it is known from 24 theorem
52 and 8 1522 that complex balanced equilibria are linearly stable
recall the f x k denotes the right hand side of equation 1 now consider the function
x  f x k a reaction network g is said to be injective if the function x  f x k corresponding
to the dynamics given by 1 is injective for all k a point x0  rn0 is said to be an equilibrium
of 1 if f x0  k  0 it follows that an injective reaction network cannot have multiple equilibria
in general it is extremely difficult to determine whether the function x  f x k is injective or
not a necessary and sufficient condition for a reaction network to be injective is given by theorem
31 in 6 which we state here
theorem 21 consider a reaction network g with species given by x1  x2   xn  let jx k
denote the jacobian corresponding to the dynamics generated by g then g is injective if and only
if detjx k is nonzero for every x  rn0 and for all choice of rate constants k further by
theorem 32 in 6 there is a onetoone correspondence between the coefficients in the expansion
of detjx k and products of the form dety 1  y 2   y n dety 1  y 1  y 2  y 2   y n  y n  for all
choices of n reactions in g
corollary 22 consider a reaction network g with species x1  x2   xn  then g is injective if
and only if products of the form dety 1  y 2   y n dety 1  y 1  y 2  y 2   y n  y n  for any choice
of n reactions are all of the same sign and at least one such product is nonzero
proof follows from theorem 21
a good tool for analyzing injectivity is the directed species reaction graph abbreviated as dsr
graph first introduced by banaji and craciun in 1 in what follows we describe some terminology
in the context of dsr graphs we will denote a negative edge in the dsr graph with a dashed
line and a positive edge with a bold line let c denote the length of a cycle in the dsr graph a
cycle is an ecycle if the number of positive edges has the same parity as the c
2  otherwise it is an

le2i  where le denotes the stoichiometric label of
le2i1

the edge e we will say that two cycles have an odd intersection if their orientation is compatible
and every component of their intersection contains an odd number of edges figure 1 shows the
dsr graph for a modified enzymesubstrate network
theorem 23 a dsr criterion 1 consider a reaction network g suppose the following
conditions are satisfied
1 every ecycle is a scycle in the dsr graph of g
2 no two ecycles contain an odd intersection in the dsr graph of g
3 there exists a choice of n reactions y 1  y 1  y 2  y 2  y 3  y 3   y n  y n  in g such that
dety 1  y 2  y 3   y n dety 1  y 1  y 2  y 2  y 3  y 3   y n  y n  6 0
then g is injective
consider the dsr graph in figure 1 this has two cycles given by es  ep ees 
eseses  ep  and es  eseses  ep p p  sses 
es both these cycles are ecycles and scycles since the number of positive edges has the same

e  s  es es  e  p p  s e   p  
parity as half the length of the respective cycle the intersection of these two ecycles is the path
e  s  es  es  es  e  p  and this is not an odd intersection since it contains two
edges which is an even number further if we choose four reactions from the network given by
the following e  s  es es  e  p
  
then we have dety

therefore by theorem 23 this reaction network is injective

homeostasis

the ability of a feature to remain invariant when certain parameters of the system are changed
is the essential idea behind homeostasis a common example of homeostasis is exhibited when an
organism maintains its body temperature despite fluctuations in the temperature of the environment the temperature of the body varies linearly with temperature for low and high values of
the environment temperature however for moderate values of the environment temperature the
body temperature remains approximately constant this variation of body temperature with the
environment resembles the shape of a chair 19 18 in 13 this chair form provides inspiration for a definition of homeostasis in the context of singularity theory in particular the idea of
homeostasis corresponds to the derivative of an output homeostasis variable with respect to an
external input being zero at a certain point as outlined in 13 we consider the following setup
let x  x1  x2   xn  and consider
dx
 fx 
dt

given by
dx1
 f1 x1  x2   xn   
dt
dx2
 f2 x1  x2   xn 
dt
 


4

dxn
 fn x1  x2   xn 
dt
as in 13 throughout this paper we assume that the variable x1 is the input variable and the
output variable which may or may not exhibit homeostatis is xn  we will also assume that there
exists a linearly stable equilibrium of 4 given by x0  0  by the implicit function theorem there
exists solutions x in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium x0  0  satisfying fx   0 in
particular this implies that x depends continuously on  in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium
x0  0  recall the definition of homeostasis from 13
definition 31 consider a dynamical system of the form 4 and let jx denote its jacobian
assume that x1  x2   xn  be a linearly stable equilibrium of 4 at    we say that we have
infinitesimal homeostasis at x1  x2   xn   if detb

 0 where b is the n1n1
x1 x2 xn 

minor of j obtained by deleting its first row and last column

remark 32 as remarked in 28 there exists several forms of homeostasis specifically definition 31 refers to infinitesimal homeostasis which requires the derivative of the inputoutput
function to be zero at a point the idea of perfect homeostasis refers to the situation when the
derivative of the inputoutput function vanishes on an entire interval the notion of near perfect
homeostasis refers to the situation when the inputoutput function is approximately constant in a
neighbourhood of a point
definition 33 consider a reaction network g the homeostasisassociated reaction network of
g denoted by g is obtained from g as follows
step 1 for each reaction in g involving the species x1  modify the reaction such that
stoichiometric coefficient of x1 in the reactant is the same as the stoichiometric coefficient of
x1 in the product
step 2 add the reaction xn  x1 
theorem 34 consider a reaction network g with species x1  x2   xn  let g be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of g if the graph g satisfies the conditions 1 2 and 3 in theorem 23
then the massaction dynamical system generated by g cannot exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis
with input x1 and output xn  for any choices of rate constants
proof let j and j  denote the jacobians coresponding to the dynamical systems generated by g
and g respectively step 1 of the procedure in definition 33 makes the first row of j  zero step
2 of definition 33 generates a nonzero element in the top right corner of the j  therefore the
jacobian j  has the first row consisting entirely of zeros except the last element in addition j 
has the same n  1  n  1 minor b as obtained by deleting the first row and last column of
5

  we get that detj   kn1 detb where kn1 is the rate
j expanding along the first row of j
constant corresponding to the reaction xn  x1  by theorem 23 g is injective therefore by
theorem 21 we have detj x 6 0 for every x  rn0  this implies that detbx 6 0 for every
x  rn0 and hence g cannot exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis for any choices of rate constants
on the other hand if the graph g fails to satisfy condition 3 in theorem 23 then we have
detj x  0 for every x  rn0  which implies that detbx  0 for every x  rn0  therefore
we obtain
theorem 35 consider a reaction network g with species x1  x2   xn  let g be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of g if the graph g does not satisfy condition 3 in theorem 23 then
any massaction dynamical system generated by g must exhibit perfect homeostasis with input x1
and output xn  at any linearly stable equilibrium
in particular note that if a network satisfies condition 3 in theorem 23 then the dimension of
its stoichiometric subspace is n which implies the following
corollary 36 consider a reaction network g with species x1  x2   xn  let g be the homeostasisassociated reaction network of g if the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace of g is less than
n then any massaction dynamical system generated by g must exhibit perfect homeostasis with
input x1 and output xn  at any linearly stable equilibrium

remark 37 recall that the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis as described by definition 31
assumes the existence of a linearly stable equilibrium x1  x2   xn  for a massaction system
generated by a reaction network g this implicitly says that the dimension of the stoichiometric
subspace of g must be n in other words the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis as described by
definition 31 cannot ever apply to a massaction system that has one or more linear conservation
laws ie for which the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace of g is less than n

examples

the goal of this section is to demonstrate examples of reaction networks that can or cannot exhibit
infinitesimal homeostasis using the procedure outlined in definition 33

41

a reaction network that does not exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis for any
choice of network parameters

the biological motivation for the following example comes from sequestration networks as defined
in 16 10 in particular they find instances of such networks in the transcription mechanism of
ecoli the trp operon contains genes that encode for the amino acid tryptophan the operon is
turned off or on depending upon the levels of tryptophan when the tryptophan levels are low
it is turned off and when the levels of tryptophan are high it is turned on in the presence
of tryptophan the trp repressor can bind to the operon sites and prevent the expression of the
operon this can be seen as a sequestration reaction x1  x2   where x1 is the tryptophan
and x2 is the trp operon taking our cue from this we consider the following sequestration network

note that when we apply step 1 of the procedure listed in definition 31 to the reaction x4  x1 
we get the reaction x4   step 2 of the procedure then adds the reaction x4  x1  as a
consequence we get the homeostasisassociated network g1  where the reaction x4  x1 has a
larger rate constant as compared to the rate constant of the same reaction in g1  the dsr graph
corresponding to the network g1 is given in figure 2 this dsr graph possesses exactly one oriented
cycle given by x3   x3  x4    x4   x4  x1   x1   x1  x2  x1   x2  
x2  x3    x3  which is an ocycle as a consequence conditions 1 and 2 in theorem 23
are satisfied in addition if we choose four reactions from g1 given by x1  x2  x1  x2  x3

the network g2 does not have all the inflowoutflow reactions but the stoichiometric subspace is

let us analyze the dsr graph corresponding to the network g 2 as shown in figure 3 since
condition is not satisfied for the dsr graph of g 2  there is a possibility that the network g2 can
exhibit infinitesimal homeostasis in particular g2 generates a dynamical system given by the

the determinant of the n  1  n  1 minor of j2 obtained by deleting its first row and last

point given by x1  21  x2  14  x3  43    21  the jacobian at this point is given by

the jacobian j2 has eigenvalues given by 1  1

negative and hence the equilibrium is linearly stable therefore the network g2 exhibits infinitesimal

the steadystate corresponding to equation 11 is given by x1  x2  x3   2  2  1  given this
steadystate parametrization one
 can show that
 the jacobian with   1 has all negative eigenval7 17

 therefore the point  12  12  1 is linearly stable

every term of the form dety1  y2  y3 dety1  y1  y2  y2  y3  y3  from this network is zero and
hence the deteminant of the jacobian is zero this implies that the determinant of b which is
the n  1  n  1 minor of the jacobian obtained by deleting its first row and last column is
zero by theorem 35 we get that the network g3 has perfect homeostasis at this linearly stable
equilibrium

discussion

in this paper we have analyzed the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis as introduced in 13
from the point of view of reaction network models in particular we have described a relationship
between infinitesimal homeostasis and network injectivity as well as a relationship between perfect
homeostasis and the structure of the set of reaction vectors moreover since injectivity of a network
can be studied by looking at its directed species reaction graph dsr graph 1 we have discussed
how the dsr graph can be used to analyze homeostasis
an interesting direction for future work would be the analysis of possible relationships between
homeostasis and especially perfect homeostasis and absolute concentration robustness acr
10

the notion of acr was first introduced in 23 and refers to systems where the value of one of
the variables eg species concentration is the same for all positive steady states of the system
at first these two notions seem almost identical but the acr framework does not allow for any
changes in parameter values a deeper exploration of the mathematical relationships between
homeostasis and absolute concentration robustness may uncover other networklevel conditions for
homeostasis
another promising direction for future work is the use of various forms of steady state parametrizations 21 9 to analyze infinitesimal homeostasis given a certain steady state parametrization the
fact that the derivative of the output variable with respect to an input variable is zero at an equilibrium manifests itself as a property of a system of algebraic equations whose analysis could provide
useful insights into the behaviour of the system possible candidates for this work include toric 17
and rational 26 steady state parametrizations
