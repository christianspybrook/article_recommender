abstract
ai has the potential to revolutionize many areas of healthcare
radiology dermatology and ophthalmology are some of the
areas most likely to be impacted in the near future and they
have received significant attention from the broader research
community but ai techniques are now also starting to be used
in in vitro fertilization ivf in particular for selecting which
embryos to transfer to the woman the contribution of ai to
ivf is potentially significant but must be done carefully and
transparently as the ethical issues are significant in part
because this field involves creating new people
we first give a brief introduction to ivf and review the use of ai
for embryo selection we discuss concerns with the
interpretation of the reported results from scientific and
practical perspectives we then consider the broader ethical
issues involved we discuss in detail the problems that result
from the use of blackbox methods in this context and advocate
strongly for the use of interpretable models importantly there
have been no published trials of clinical effectiveness a problem
in both the ai and ivf communities and we therefore argue
that clinical implementation at this point would be premature
finally we discuss ways for the broader ai community to

become involved to ensure scientifically sound and ethically
responsible development of ai in ivf

1 introduction
in vitro fertilization ivf is a clinical technique which has
revolutionized the treatment of infertility the process
involves fertilizing the egg in a laboratory and replacing the
resultant embryo into the uterus natural fertilization and
conception is an inefficient process with low chances of a live
birth for any particular embryo the solution both in nature
and with medical treatment is to create multiple embryos so

that ultimately one will probably implant in nature the cost is
time to pregnancy or in the event of no embryos implanting
the pain of childlessness in clinical practice the cost is
additionally measured in dollars to increase the efficiency of
clinical practice much attention has been given to selecting
the embryo that is most likely to implant a recent innovation
in the laboratory is timelapse imaging of the embryo in
culture over a number of days this gives rise to thousands of
visual data points and with it the promise of augmenting the
embryo selection process with artificial intelligence aibased models in this paper we provide an overview of the
ivf process review current approaches to using ai in embryo
selection discuss ethical issues of using ai in this specific field
and make proposals for the ethical implementation of this
new technology we finish with encouragement for ai
researchers to collaborate with fertility clinicians to take this
research forward in a meaningful and ethical way

2 the in vitro fertilization ivf process
each year millions of couples who suffer from infertility pin
their hopes of starting or growing their family on ivf 1
heavily criticized by many at first as an unethical human
experiment 2 the technique has become one of the most
successful therapeutic innovations of the past halfcentury
leading to over 9 million babies born since the first ivf birth
in 1978 1 the limit of ivfs success however is reflected in
the millions more whose hopes have not been fulfilled
particularly for those with advancing age and comorbidities
but also for every couple who tries success is not guaranteed
on average across all age groups the live birth rate per
treatment cycle is 261 in the uk 3
to maximize the chance of retrieving a good quality egg
and subsequent embryo women are given hormone
treatment to stimulate development of multiple eggs which
are then harvested inseminated and the resultant embryos
cultured in the laboratory for 26 days typically 24 would
reach the blastocyst stage around day 5 or 6 the
embryologist would then select 1 blastocyst for transfer to the
uterus any unused embryos thought to be viable are then
frozen for use later in case the initial transfer following egg
collection is unsuccessful or if successful for a future sibling
4 it is important to note that competitive embryo selection
is unique to ivf and does not occur in nature ivf clinics are
keen to improve on current embryo selection strategies in
order to maximise the chance of pregnancy at an early stage of
the couples treatment
early embryo development at the preimplantation stage is
a very dynamic process hours after fertilisation two
pronuclei are formed carrying dna material contributed by
the sperm and the egg the pronuclear membrane breaks
down shortly before the first cell division leading to a 2cell
embryo as cells continue to divide they become more
compact with increased celltocell interaction from 3 days
postfertilization on day 4 the embryo reaches the morula

stage where borders between cells become invisible during
the next 1 to 2 days cells separate into 2 layers with a
growing cavity formed between them at this point the
embryo is called a blastocyst the outer layer of cells also
known as the trophectoderm will become part of the placenta
following implantation while the inner layer inner cell mass
will become the fetus both layers hatch out of the shell
around the embryo zona pellucida before implantation into
the uterus
traditional embryo selection is based on several snapshot
observations of an embryo under a microscope at specific
time points during culture figure 1 considering the
dynamic nature of embryo development the static nature of
the information collected in this method limits the accuracy of
embryo selection 5
examples of other developments to select embryos more
likely to implant include 1 allowing embryos to selfdeselect
via extended culture in the laboratory 6 2 metabolomic
profiling of spent culture media 7 or 3 adding extra genetic
testing such as preimplantation genetic testing for
aneuploidy pgta which is controversial because of its
invasive nature and diagnostic imperfection 8

evaluation of embryo quality by the embryologist is limited by
considerable interoperator variability due to the current mix
of objective and subjective measures in assessment and
human factors such as being influenced by confounders 9
however the availability of numerous data points made
available by recent advances such as with timelapse
videography 10 has enabled novel parameters to be
measured for embryo selection 11 12 13 debate is still
ongoing regarding the best approach of using such timelapse
images for embryo selection 14

3 ai as an embryo selection tool to improve
the success rate per transfer
the application of ai in ivf has the potential to provide more
objective more rapid and potentially more accurate
evaluation of key steps in the ivf process to make it more
reproducible and repeatable when compared with a purely
human approach 15 in particular ai for embryo selection
has attracted much interest and potentially holds much
promise 16
the type of ai that can help embryo selection is machine
learning ml  models that can automatically learn and
adapt as they are exposed to more data whether images or
other data this is particularly useful when there is access to
lots of data but we do not immediately know how to leverage
it to make better predictions or when we cannot manually
process it all to generate meaningful knowledge potential
variables include morphological features such as cleavage of
the embryo cells blastomeres fragmentation morphokinetic
features including time intervals between certain features
and clinical factors such as age of the woman or cause of
infertility 17 computer vision cv allows large amounts of
image data to be automatically analyzed by algorithms and
rapid recent advances in this field offer great promise to
improve embryo selection

4 current state of research on the use of ai to
select embryos
we searched medline embase and google scholar for fulltext studies evaluating ai to select embryos using the strategy
included in the appendix we checked the citations of papers
we identified in the search for any publications we might have
missed
studies evaluating ai for embryo selection make
impressive accuracy claims for their ml models 18 19 one
commonly reported performance measure is the receiver
operating characteristic roc curve which shows how a tests
sensitivity and specificity correlate at different thresholds
the area under this curve auc indicates the tests
performance an auc 09 usually indicates outstanding
performance and the ml models from the studies cited above
surpass this benchmark
studies that evaluate the efficacy of ai models for embryo
selection do so for 2 types of outcomes a outcomes
meaningful to the patient such as a live birth or a fetal
heartbeat positive pregnancy or b agreement with the
existing standard which in this case would be assessment by
embryologists one of the challenges of using live birth as the
meaningful outcome ground truth is that a potentially viable
embryo can result in either a live birth or no live birth
depending on other nonembryo factors such as the health of
the mother
tran cooke and illingworths 18 study belongs to the
former category they evaluated a model called ivy which

rates how likely an embryo is to lead to a fetal heartbeat fh
pregnancy on a confidence scale of 0 definitely will not
implant to 1 definitely will implant their roc curves auc
was 093 however as kantor benmeir and buxboim 20
point out the majority of the embryos on which the algorithm
had been trained and tested were of such poor quality that
they would have been discarded in any event thereby
artificially inflating the auc as kantor benmeir and
buxboim explain the clinical need is to identify the embryo
with the highest chance of success among a set of embryos
that appear to be potentially viable and not from embryos
which embryologists readily discard
khosravi et als study 19 on the other hand belongs to
the latter category they categorized embryos into 3 groups 
good fair and poorquality embryos according to a
consensus of multiple embryologists they then evaluated
their ai algorithms ability to identify the good and the poorquality embryos but not the fairquality embryos for this
task the algorithm achieved 9694 accuracy this was better
than the performance of individual embryologists however
broad categorizations into good or poor quality are of
limited benefit when trying to find the best embryo in a group
of similarquality embryos
the above analyses of khosravi et al 19 and tran cooke
and illingworths 18 studies demonstrate the importance of
understanding exactly how researchers test their algorithms
before drawing conclusions from headline statistics these
studies are important steps to investigate efficacy the ability
to produce a specified outcome in experimental
circumstances to develop the tool and establish proof of
principle however they are only a prelude to testing in the
clinic when curchoe et al 21 reviewed how the results of ai
studies in reproductive medicine relate to reallife clinical
practice they highlighted four pitfalls that are common
throughout the literature small sample sizes imbalanced
datasets nongeneralizable settings and limited performance
metrics
furthermore to date no ai studies for embryo selection
using a randomized controlled trial rct have been
published though 1 is registered 22 the lack of rcts
appears to be typical of much of ai in medicine 23 the
problem of lack of evidence before implementation is
compounded by the ivf industry which is notorious for
aggressively marketing unproven clinical and laboratory addons 24 25 the problem is compounded because clinicians
who do not have an adequate understanding of ai will find it
difficult to critically navigate the literature which contains
unfamiliar concepts and terminology
many ai studies for embryo selection use uninterpretable
blackbox machine learning models these models are
either too complicated for any human to understand or they
are proprietary  in which case comprehension of such a
model is not possible for outsiders 26 specifically many
studies in this field use neural networks that are not

interpretable and not designed to be interpretable eg chen
et al 27 other approaches use interpretable features
whether they are labeled manually by doctors or labeled by
neural networks whose output can be manually verified but
combine them in uninterpretable ways such as using
principal component analysis pca preprocessing which
forces a dependence on all variables followed by a machine
learning method such as a neural network or random forest
28 29 the work of leahy et al 30 is interesting because
the model is decomposable into separate neural network
models that each extract different information eg
measurements of an embryo that can be directly checked by
an embryologist combining these separate models into an
interpretable combined model to form the final prediction
would be something we could potentially recommend if their
final combined model was interpretable such as a scoring
system or sparse decision tree then each piece of the whole
system would be directly checkable by an embryologist for
correctness and thus interpretable a third category of studies
use fully interpretable features eg measurements of the
embryo taken by embryologists but use older techniques
that are not particularly accurate and do not explicitly
optimize for interpretability for instance the models are not
sparse these works generally do not apply any computer
vision techniques relying instead on humans to estimate
measurements from the embryo images examples include the
works of raef maleki and ferdousi 31 and morales et al
32 who created interpretable handcalculated features and
applied a variety of classical machine learning algorithms to
them
the opaqueness or blackbox nature of ai models is
problematic for two main types of reasons ethical and
epistemic which we will describe next

5 ethical concerns with blackbox ai models
51 failure to perform randomized
controlled trials
the most important ethical issue facing the adoption of ai
assisted ivf is the need for careful rcts against best current
approaches whilst 1 rct has been registered 22 it is
premature to implement a technology in the clinical setting
before the trial results are made available no matter how
promising a new intervention appears to be the gold standard
for evaluation is the rct failing to do such trials risks
harming patients as does failing to perform systematic
reviews of existing evidence and failing to publish negative
results 33
both blackbox and interpretable models must be
systematically studied using rcts even highly promising
interventions can do more harm than good 33

52

equipoise

the ethical justification for rcts is that equipoise exists
between the proposed new intervention and existing care
equipoise exists when the new intervention is not known or
reasonably believed to be significantly better or worse than
the existing intervention for embryo selection equipoise
would therefore exist if the use of ai for selection is neither
known to be better or worse in achieving successful
pregnancies than existing approaches from the literature it
is very difficult to determine whether equipoise exists for ai
models and blackbox models in particular one would need
to determine exactly when ai would be used eg for obvious
cases for nonobvious cases only how it would be used in
the context of the clinic eg does the clinician always follow
the ai prediction and for what populations and what
settings the reported aucs would be representative as we
discuss below blackbox models have serious problems with
robustness and as discussed above auc values reported from
published studies cannot necessarily be trusted also since
interpretable ai methods have not been heavily developed we
cannot assess the value of interpretability in the decisionmaking process in other words we currently cannot assess
whether a humanai centaur could be better than either one
alone this information would be essential to the question of
equipoise and whether to conduct an rct
validation studies would help to assess these questions
typically these are conducted on a new sample from a
different clinic than the ai method was trained on however
we are not aware of any such validation studies

53

compromised shared decisionmaking

an important concern centers on the use of opaque ai models
potentially compromising shared decisionmaking and
patientcentered medicine more broadly over the past few
decades the accepted model of clinical practice has shifted
from a paternalistic one where the clinicians opinion and
recommendation are simply accepted by the patient to one of
shared decisionmaking where this power and informational
asymmetry is reduced to the benefit of patient autonomy 34
clinical ai models that are opaque so that medical
explanations for a models recommendation are inaccessible
compromise this shared decisionmaking due to the inability
of the clinician and the patient to understand the models
decision 35 while there have been some counterarguments
raised as to whether shared decisionmaking is truly
compromised by opaque ai models 36 application of ai in
embryo selection should be guided by an awareness of such
potential dangers it will be important to fully explain what is
known about how the ai model comes to a decision nature
and size of dataset reasons for confidence in prediction
possible alternative lines of justification etc and further
examine how interactions between clinicians and patients
may change both at the point of embryo selection as well as at
the point of implantation failure clinicians should explain the

basis of how embryos are selected for transfer whether it is
clinical or aiassisted if information that is traditionally
conveyed to the patient as to why a particular embryo is
selected  for example the number and symmetry of the cells
or if the cells are fragmented and therefore what the chances
of implantation are and why implantation may fail  are no
longer accessible shared decisionmaking might indeed be
compromised existing measures of shared decisionmaking
and decision quality such as the decision conflict scale 37
the option scale 38 and the sure test 39 among other
patientreported measures can be used to guide such an
evaluation
it is important however not to overstate this concern
firstly aiassisted decisionmaking should be compared to
the status quo current expert judgment is based on
biologically meaningful measures which although more
broadly communicable than decisions of opaque models are
not very accurate for predicting a live birth aiassisted
decisionmaking may not be worse but may also not be
better more importantly autonomy requires understanding
information relevant and meaningful to ones values knowing
the basis of a prediction cleavage rate symmetry etc is not
relevant what is relevant are the risks sideeffects and
benefits and the confidence attached to these assessments
however blackbox ai has the potential to significantly
undermine shared decisionmaking in a way that
interpretable ai does not although they are marketed and
approved as decision aids to the clinician where the decision
finally rests with the clinicians blackbox ai will in practice
have the potential to introduce a new form of paternalism
machine paternalism it is known that people tend to be
complacent about use of automation 40 and tend to be
accepting of ai in a role when they are familiar with ai in that
role or when they believe it performs well in that role 41 in
practice it is hard to see how clinicians will challenge the
deliverances of blackbox ai indeed doing so without good
reason might open them up to legal liability so in practice
blackbox ai risks instrumentalizing the clinicians in a way
that interpretable ai does not while interpretable ai is an
enhancement of human decisionmaking blackbox ai is a
replacement for it

54 misrepresentation of patient values
another ethical issue concerns potential harms from a
misrepresentation of patientvalues in the decision process
for example there are reported differences between early
morphokinetic profiles between male and female embryos
42 43 44 45 and other traits might be similarly
differentially represented at this early stage models for
embryo selection run the risk of systematically selecting for
these traits if they are perceived by the model to be correlated
with implantation success for example if a patient prefers
that sex be randomly selected this model may run counter to
those values if such models are opaque this systematic

favoring of particular traits may not be detected at the time of
decisionmaking and so cannot be corrected for in a way that
it could be with interpretable models if we know exactly
which interpretable characteristics of the embryo are
correlated with various traits it would be much easier to
detect them at the time of decisionmaking otherwise it may
take considerable time for such a bias to be detected as a
result of the use of ai because it will require large scale
statistically significant changes to manifest in evaluation and
a causal analysis that determines that the cause of bias was
indeed the use of ai and not another source
if some of these traits are ethically salient ones for the
patient then this creates a scenario where the patients values
may not be sufficiently represented to guide the decisionmaking process for embryo selection such concerns have also
been raised for other clinical models 46 calling for the
design of such systems to be valueflexible so that in clinical
settings both clinicians and patients are 1 aware of what
metrics are driving a models recommendations either
directly or as a proxy for some other medical facttrait and
2 able to appropriately reflect the patients values in the
decision process either directly through the model or in
subsequently adjusting the recommendation
again it is important not to overstate this concern the
patients own values could be inserted into ai algorithms eg
preference for sex and other nondisease characteristics and
ai might bring to the surface the importance of these values in
decisionmaking of course valuing and selecting nondisease
traits such as sex or intelligence raises the debate around
designer babies but some have argued that such selection is
permissible 47 or even a moral obligation when it relates to
the wellbeing of a future child 48 49 50

55

health and wellbeing of future children

such potential biasing of aiselection might also have impacts
on the health or wellbeing of future children for example it
is possible that some disadvantageous trait such as increased
risk of cancer or mental disorder correlates with a higher
chance of implantation however this risk might be present
unknowingly in ordinary clinical decisionmaking this also
underscores the importance of clinical trials not merely
measuring implantation or even healthy live birth but longterm wellbeing of the child created by ivf through longterm
decades follow up
reproduction is also unique because selection determines
who will come into existence this creates the socalled nonidentity problem which has spawned decades of unresolved
philosophical debate sparked by 51 imagine embryo a has
a higher chance of implantation but unknowingly a higher
chance of cancer later in life than embryo b ai selects a a is
born but gets cancer at the age of 30 was a harmed by the
decision to select a rather than b no a different person b
would have been otherwise selected provided that the
disadvantageous trait or genes do not make as life so bad as

to have been not worth living then a cannot be harmed by
selection on this ground greater risks can be taken in embryo
selection than with interventions on a specific embryo such
as a which do risk harm to a specific individual 52
nonetheless some have argued that parents and clinicians
still have a moral obligation to select the embryo with the best
chance of the best life 48 49 50

56 impacts of disvaluing disability
there is a general problem with embryo selection raised by
disability activists any kind of selection based on predicted
health or wellbeing discriminates against the disabled and
expresses a negative message about the value of their lives the expressivist objection 53 for example screening for
down syndrome has been said to express a negative view
about the value of people with down syndrome 54 this
applies not only to ai selection but to clinical selection more
generally and there are numerous responses 53 however
ai might considerably expand the scope of this objection any
trait that lowers chance of implantation might result in
selection against that group eg sex as previously discussed
the best response to these concerns would be to monitor
such effects and ensure social responses that reinforce the
equality of all people including people with disabilities thus
rather than forgoing selection it is better to ensure there are
sufficient social resources so that all existing people have a
reasonable chance of a good life 50
interpretable ai may allow issues of bias to be identified
earlier and in a more actionable way specifically if we
discover interpretable features that can be linked to various
outcomes it is easier to monitor for possible bias and avoid it

57 societal impacts of ai for embryo
selection
successful ai models might be deployed at scale and if such
models systematically favor certain traits represented in early
morphokinetic profiles this might impact society even if
wouldbe parents might not care about the sex of their future
child and might be willing to accept a higher likelihood of one
sex for a higher likelihood of implantation success this will
still have societal ramifications through a skewed population
ratio the scale of these ramifications will correlate with rates
of ivf use in the future the more individuals opt for ivf the
greater the impact while such possibilities are at this stage
mostly speculative they represent a scale of impact that is
significant and should therefore be considered since blackbox models do not aim to identify specific aspects of an
embryo with specific traits it might make these issues more
difficult to detect until it is too late and there are societallevel
impacts in this regard interpretable ai may allow earlier
detection of systematic favouring of certain traits
further if aiassisted ivf works better for some races than
others this could have serious societal implications while
such differences should be monitored whether a blackbox or

interpretable ai method is used interpretable ai may help to
detect such issues more easily for instance if the ai model is
known to leverage factors that differ among ethnic groups
eg the relationship of age to fertility

58 blackbox models pose a responsibility
gap
the final ethical issue concerns a potential erosion of ethical
and legal accountability through the use of opaque ai models
if it is determined that clinicians cannot be held responsible
for injuries sustained by the patient due to a reliance on
opaque ai models the responsibility for this class of errors
would need to be borne by another agent in the absence of
institutionalized accountability mechanisms that hold other
agents like model developers responsible this creates a
responsibility gap when it comes to the use of ai models
the most straightforward case in which accountability is
required would be repeated implantation failure or low
success rates due to suboptimal embryo selection processes
andor injury being sustained by the patient as a result of
implementation of a model recommendation either to the
mother through surgical complications or the child when
heshe is born  wrongful life or birth under such
circumstances if the patient seeks an account of what
happened or advances a charge of negligence against the
clinician the decisionmaking process needs to be explicable
traditionally if a charge of negligence is advanced experts
assess the clinicians decisionmaking process and depending
on whether they deem this to be medically reasonable the
clinician is either acquitted or held culpable if ai models used
for embryo selection reason in uninterpretable ways it is
unclear how a court might evaluate the doctors decisionmaking and subsequently it would be unclear how
responsibility for injury may be adjudicated 55 56

6 epistemic concerns with blackbox ai
models
there are technical challenges posed by blackbox or opaque
systems it is unclear how we might assess the reliability of
the models predictions eliminate potentially confounding
factors at the decisionmaking point and assess to what
extent the models accuracy is representative in a given usecase in a field where addon clinical offerings are already
widespread despite inadequate evidence of effectiveness this
epistemic problem is especially troubling 25

61 blackbox models create information
asymmetries
the use of blackbox models creates an information
asymmetry between the company selling the tool and the
clinicians having to make daily decisions as to which embryo
to transfer using such models would force the embryologist
to abrogate decisionmaking to programs they themselves do

not understand it is not possible to fully evaluate whether to
trust these complex models without an understanding of their
reasoning processes

incubators and culture medium amongst other potential
variables this gives ai companies a great deal of economic
power over clinics potentially increasing treatment costs

62 confounders are rampant

65 overall troubleshooting is difficult for
blackbox models

if we do not understand what a blackbox model is doing it is
entirely possible that its predictions are based on confounders
that should not be used as predictors confounders are often
difficult to detect and cause models not to generalize when
coupled with a poor choice for evaluation metric the
confounding might not be noticed 57 58
let us construct a simple example where an obvious
confounder and a standard but illchosen evaluation metric
provide a situation where a useless model would appear to be
excellent in this example the confounder is the mothers age
and the metric is overall auc not the auc for an individual
couple it is largely possible that the mothers age is a major
factor in predictions what if it were the sole factor so that a
model based on an image of the embryo is predictive of
mothers age only if the model were a mere proxy for age
and we did not know it it would be entirely useless in
discriminating between embryos from the same couple yet it
may still score highly on auc because age alone is predictive
of success in implantation and we may be fooled into thinking
that it is a good model here there are two problems that
combine to be worse than either alone a mismatched
evaluation metric and an inscrutable model that does not
reveal the problem with either the predictions or the metric

63 realtime errorchecking is harder with
blackbox models
the two problems discussed above information asymmetry
and the possibility of confounders lead to a third problem
namely the difficulty of errorchecking the model in realtime
as it makes predictions in the clinic we would want the
clinician to be able to determine whether the model is
reasoning in a way that is obviously wrong and catch new
problems immediately should they arise for instance after a
change in camera setting an algorithm might suddenly start
thinking that the shape of a current embryo looks like an
embryo from the training set with a completely different
shape a clinician could potentially catch that problem
immediately if they knew the reasoning process of the model

64 the economics of buying into a brittle
model does not favor clinicians or patients
a potential consequence of the problems of information
asymmetry and confounders listed above would be that blackbox model performance may be brittle to changes from the
system it was trained on and thus would likely be limited to
the ecosystem in which it has been shown to work this
means that a clinic using this model would need to buy into
that ecosystem ovarian stimulation regimens use of

if the model were more interpretable it might be easier to
troubleshoot broad problems in the model beyond serious
issues that might be noticed in realtime usage this includes
ethical concerns such as sex disability or racial bias as we
discussed as well as epistemic issues with accuracy or subtle
confounding if interpretability reveals flawed reasoning
processes the designer would be forced to alter the model to
use correct reasoning leading potentially to more robustness
across ecosystems

7 interpretable ml as the way forward in
embryo selection
an interpretable ml model is a predictive model that is
constrained so that a human can better understand its
reasoning process 26 59 interpretable ml is a field that
dates to the beginning of ai back to the days of expert
systems the benefits of interpretable models are clear by
understanding the reasoning processes of predictive models
physicians can troubleshoot them and justify their decisions
to patients other physicians and during lawsuits they
would not need to place blind trust in a blackbox model
physicians and interpretable ml models can create a
centaur that leverages both the information in a database
through ml and a humans systemlevel way of thinking
about problems furthermore correlating patient values
chance of disability sex single vs double embryo transfer
and chance of implantation with outcomes can be more easily
accommodated by interpretable models
focusing on increasing the use of interpretable ai models
is an elegant approach to both the epistemic and ethical
concerns by dispelling the opaqueness and allowing precise
explanations of model predictions for instance models that
are not opaque have an advantage because their use preserves
existing mechanisms of accountability to a greater extent by
allowing clinicians to understand model decisions better and
thus retain the responsibility for models that are opaque
revisions to such mechanisms would be necessary this
argument is far from resolved but it is a promising reason to
favor interpretable models over blackbox ones
to the extent that there exists little or no tradeoff between
how interpretable a model is and how accurate it is for
embryo selection interpretable models are thus a promising
solution if it is the case that there is a salient difference in
performance between interpretable and noninterpretable
models alternative solutions to both of the above epistemic
and ethical concerns might have to be developed so that we
may benefit from the higher predictive accuracy of non

interpretable models for now there is no reason to believe
that a salient performance difference between interpretable
and noninterpretable models would exist interpretable
models perform just as well even for benchmark datasets in
computer vision and we will go into more detail on this
important point shortly in fact interpretable models are
easier to troubleshoot as domains change as unusual cases
arise as cases indicating bias need to be investigated and
thus lead to overall better performance of the model
a major question in interpretable ml is what
interpretability metric to use as these metrics must by
definition of interpretability in that domain be domain
dependent for computer vision for natural images there have
been major successful efforts by numerous groups of
researchers to create interpretable neural networks that do
not lose accuracy over their blackbox counterparts these
neural models go well beyond modeling only the attention of
the network that is where the network is looking within an
image and are particularly useful for computer vision
problems such interpretable neural networks could use
different types of logical reasoning processes including

casebased reasoning variations of knearest
neighbors in this case the network would point out which
parts of a test image are similar to prototypical past cases the
prototypical cases are chosen by the network along with the
ways in which images are similar to each other eg chen et
al 27 one could envision an embryologist looking at a test
image of an embryo with an interpretable ml model pointing
out how parts of it look similar to other prototypical known
embryos whose outcome is known casebased reasoning
models have been developed for different problems in
radiology using interpretable ml 60 61 and thus such
methods would be poised for use in embryology

latent space disentanglement where all information
about a single concept such as mothers age or embryo size
density or color is forced to travel through a single node of a
network another way to say this is that each axis of a latent
space where an axis corresponds to activation of a node
represents a concept this helps to understand information
flow through the network eg chen bei and rudin 62
these types of disentangled models could potentially be
useful for separating out the type of equipment the age of the
mother and other pieces of information that might be
embedded within the image of the embryo

networks imbued with logical structure eg
probabilistic decision trees by forcing the network to reason
logically we may be better able to understand its reasoning
process eg wu and song 63 li song and wu 64
there are many challenges still in designing interpretable
neural networks particularly when the domain experts
themselves do not know what constitutes interpretability in
other words there are many directions for future research
for problems involving categorical or real data tabular
data rather than image data time sequence data or text data

interpretable ml models can also be developed these can
potentially take the form of a medical scoring system which
means a small number of integer point values that sum and
translate into a risk eg ustun and rudin 65 for tabular
data neural networks and other forms of blackbox models do
not seem to provide additional accuracy which means that
optimized medical scoring systems might be as accurate as
one could get depending on the dataset 66 67
an interesting direction for future research is to combine
interpretable neural networks for computer vision to handle
the visual data similar to the work of leahy et al 30 with
interpretable models for tabular data rule lists or decision
trees for instance to form a global interpretable model that
handles these heterogeneous data types
one key point that has emerged from past research is that
as long as one can design the interpretability metric carefully
to match the domain interpretable models tend not to lose
accuracy relative to their blackbox counterparts 26 27 as
far as we know modern interpretable ml methods have not
yet been fully applied to ivf

there is no evidence to suggest that blackbox
models are any more accurate than
interpretable models

table 1 summary box of reasons why interpretability
gains an advantage over blackbox models

8 recommendations
81 rigorous evaluation with rcts
researchers must evaluate ai models to select embryos using
the gold standard of rcts against best clinical judgement or
blackbox ai if these have been deployed into practice or
show promising results key outcomes for evaluation include
time to live birth number of embryo transfers before live
birth and associated cost analysis as well as live birth per egg

collection and health of the baby researchers should monitor
the effects of the new technology with postimplementation
surveillance before an rct is performed a validation study
should be performed on data from different clinics than those
used to train the model

82

interpretable ai

programmers should aim to build interpretable machine
learning models where biologically meaningful parameters
guide embryo assessment reducing the risk of hidden biases
in algorithms causing unintended harms to society permitting
better troubleshooting and better enabling clinicians to
counsel their patients on the thinking underlying their
treatment

83

regulatory oversight for interpretable ai

the importance of interpretability should be captured in
mechanisms of regulatory oversight current regulatory
approaches attempt to capture medical ai models as a type of
medical device they should further require either that ai
model developers not produce blackbox models if
interpretable models are shown to have similar performance
or that any blackbox model must come with the nextbest
interpretable model considered and trialed further despite
the fact that the field of assisted reproductive technology
utilizes good practice regulation for many advancements
such that violations are not legally punished this would not
suit the many risks of ai in embryo selection as outlined
above a hard regulatory stance that promotes interpretable
models would be a more advisable approach

84

access to code and data

data and code used to create ml models should be made
publicly accessible this would enable reproducible research
and the advancement of an exciting and important academic
field a highquality public model would at the very least
provide a performance baseline for other models

85

respect for patient privacy and autonomy

procedures should be put in place for securing patient privacy
when data is shared such as data anonymization all patients
who use ai to select embryos should give fully informed
consent including knowledge of limitations and unknowns
use of data and images and harms and benefits as shown by
rcts they should be informed of how a model arrives at a
recommendation where possible patient values should be
inserted into the reasoning process of selection models

86

involving the broader ai community

many young ml researchers are eager to get their hands on
data to try out the latest techniques and are passionate about
using the technology to make the world a better place their

participation should be encouraged currently datasets for
embryo selection are not broadly available a nave release of
such data may do more harm than good potentially inviting
simplistic evaluations of ml techniques that fall prey to many
of the criticisms we have discussed releasing a dataset and
suggesting evaluation criteria for it which reflects actual
practice and takes ethical concerns into account will require
a broader discussion between embryologists ethicists and
researchers in ai and statistics and will also require
addressing privacy concerns this discussion ought to
continue after the data are released nonetheless allowing the
broader ai community to see the data and get involved in
their analysis will ensure that flawed and biased evaluations
do not easily fly under the radar it will also likely bring other
important issues into the open that we have not yet
recognized
we summarize our recommendations in table 2 below

use of replicable interpretable machine learning
tools and data

well designed and conducted rcts

post implementation surveillance

regulatory oversight requiring interpretable ai
whenever possible

funding for public institutions to transparently
develop and evaluate machine learning models and open
access to code used in models

procedures
for
maintaining
security
of
patientembryo data whilst permitting ethical data sharing

fully informed consent to use ai

inclusion of patient values into ai programmes
where possible

participation from the broader ai community

9 conclusion
starting or growing a family is an immensely significant
decision technology which could help individuals who make
that decision realize their goal would be invaluable we see
potential for ai in ivf to help couples have children earlier in
their treatment and at a lower cost however researchers
companies and clinics must ensure that the technology they
promote or adopt brings real measurable benefits to patients
and most importantly does no harm in this article we
highlighted limitations of current ml models and the studies
which evaluate them we drew specific attention to the ethical
concerns that this technology could introduce in its current
form and suggested a path forward in terms of model design
and evaluation most importantly we hope to see
interpretable machine learning models that clinicians could
understand troubleshoot and explain to their patients
rigorously evaluated with rcts we believe these are essential
