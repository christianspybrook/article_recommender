introduction

the unilateral shift on complex separable hilbert space generates two fundamental operator algebras namely the norm closed unital algebra and the
weak operator topology closed algebra the former is naturally isomorphic to
the disc algebra of holomorphic functions on the unit disc continuous to the
boundary while the latter is isomorphic to h   the freely noncommuting
multivariable generalisations of these algebras arise from the freely noncommuting shiftsple1      len given by the left creation operators on the fock
n k
space fn  
k0 c   here the generated operator algebras denoted
an and ln for the norm and weak topologies are known as the noncommutative disc algebra and the freesemigroup algebra they have been studied
extensively with respect to operator algebra structure representation theory
and the multivariable operator theory of row contractions see for example
2 9
higher rank generalisations of these algebras arise when one considers
several families of freely noncommuting generators between which there are
commutation relations in the present paper we consider a very general form
of such relations namely
x
lei lfj 
uijkllfl lek
kl

where le1      len and lf1      lfm are freely noncommuting and u  uijkl
is an nm  nm unitary matrix the associated operator algebras are denoted
au and lu and we classify them up to various forms of isomorphism in terms
2

of the unitary matrices u such unitary relations arose originally in the context of the general dilation theorem proven in solel 12 13 for two row
contractions t1    tn  and s1    sm  satisfying the unitary commutation
relations
for n  m  1 we have u   with   1 and au is the subalgebra of
the rotation calgebra for the relations uv  vu when u is a permutation
unitary matrix arising from a permutation  in snm then the relations are
those associated with a single vertex rank 2 graph in the sense of kumjian
and pask and the algebras in this case have been considered in kribs and
power 5 and power 10 in particular in 10 it was shown that there are 9
operator algebras a arising from the 24 permutations in case n  m  2 in
contrast we see below in section 6 that for general 2 by 2 unitaries u there
are uncountably many isomorphism classes of the unitary relation algebras
au expressed in terms of a nine fold real parametrisation of isomorphism
types
the algebras a are easily defined they are determined by the left regular
representation of the semigroup f
 whose generators are e1      en  f1      fm
subject to the relations ei fj  fl ek where i j  k l on the other hand
the unitary relation algebras
au are generated by creation operators on a
p
2
z graded fock space kl cn k  cm l with relations arising from the
identification u  cn  cm  cm  cn  in particular au is a representation
of the nonselfadjoint tensor algebra of a rank 2 correspondence or a product
system over n2  in the sense of 13 see also 3
in the main results summarised partly in theorem 510 we see that if
au and av are isomorphic then the two families of generators have matching cardinalities furthermore if n 6 m then the algebras are isomorphic if
and only if the unitaries u v in mnm c are unitary equivalent by a unitary
a  b in mn c  mm c as in 10 we term this product unitary equivalence with respect to the fixed tensor product decomposition the case
n  m admits an extra possibility in view of the possibility of generator
exchanging isomorphisms namely that u  are product unitary equivalent
where ijkl  vlkji
the theorem is proven as follows after some preliminaries we identify in
section 3 the character space mau  and the set of wcontinuous characters on lu  these are subsets of the closed unit ball product bn  bm which
are associated with a variety vu in cn  cm determined by u we then define
the core 0u  a closed subset of the realised character space u  mau  and
we identify this intrinsically algebraically in terms of representations of au
3

into t2  the algebra of upper triangular matrices in m2 c the importance
of the core is that we are able to show that the interior is a minimal automorphism invariant subset on which automorphisms act transitively this allows
us to infer the existence of graded isomorphisms from general isomorphisms
to construct automorphisms we first review in section 4 voiculescus construction of a unitary action of the lie group u1 n on the cuntz algebra on
and the operator algebras an and ln  this provides in particular unitary
automorphisms   for   bn  which act transitively on the interior ball
bn  of the character space of an  for these explicit unitary automorphisms
of the ei generated copy of an in au  we establish unitary commutation relations for the tuples  le1       len  and lf1      lfm  when  0 is
a point in the core this enables us to define natural unitary automorphisms
of au itself and in theorem 48 the relative interior of the core is identified as an automorphism invariant set in the gelfand space u  in section
5 we determine the graded and bigraded isomorphisms in terms of product
unitary equivalence to do this we observe that such isomorphisms induce
an origin preserving biholomorphic map between the cores 0u and 0v and
that these maps by a generalised schwarzs lemma are implemented by a
product unitary we then prove the main classification theorem
in section 6 we analyse in detail the case n  m  2 and consider the
special case of permutation unitaries
finally in section 7 we show that the algebra au is contained in a tensor
algebra t x associated with a correspondence x as in 7 moreover at
least when n 6 m every automorphism of au extends to an automorphism
of t x the advantage of the tensor algebra is that its representation
theory is known 7 while this is not the case yet for the algebra au

preliminaries

fix two finite dimensional hilbert spaces e  cn and f  cm and a
unitary mn  mn matrix u the rows and columns of u are indexed by
1     n 1     m u  uijkl and when we write u as an mnmn
matrix we assume that 1     n  1     m is ordered lexicographically
so that for example the second row is the row indexed by 1 2 we also
fix orthonormal bases ei  and fj  for e and f respectively and the matrix

4

u is used to identify e  f with f  e through the equation
x
uijklfl  ek 
ei  fj

equivalently we write
fl  ek 

x

ijklei  fj

for every k l  n we write xk l for e k  f l  using succesive applications of 1 wepcan identifyp
xk l with e k1  f l1  e k2      f lr
whenever k  ki and l  lj 
let f n m u be the fock space given by the hilbert space direct sum

and for e  e and f  f  write le and lf for the shift operators
le ei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fjl  eei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fjl
and
lf ei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fjl  f ei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fjl
where in the last equation we use 1 to identify the resulting vector as a
vector of e k  f l1 
the unital semigroup generated by i le  lf  e  e f  f  is

denoted f
u and the algebra it generates denoted cfu  the norm closure
of cf
u  will be written au and its closure in the weak operator topology
will be written lu  in particular the algebras l and a studied in 10 are
the algebras lu and au for u which is a permutation matrix
the results of section 2 in 5 hold here too with minor changes every
a  lu is the limit in the strong operator topology of its cesaro sums

we can define the algebra ru generated by the right shifts re and rf

and
rf ei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fil  ei1 ei2   eik fj1 fj2   fil f
the techniques of the proof of proposition 23 of 5 can be applied here to
show that the commutant of ru is lu  also mapping ei1  ei2      eik 
fj1  fj2      fjl to fjl  fjl1      fj1  eik  eik1      ei1  we get a

the character space and its core

in the following proposition we describe the structure of the character spaces
mlu  and mau  equipped with the weak topology similar results
were obtained in 5 for algebras defined for higher rank graphs and in 2 for
analytic toeplitz algebras see also 10
it will be convenient to write
x
uijklzk wl

vu  z w  cn  cm  zi wj 
kl

and
u  vu  bn  bm 

4

where bn is the open unit ball of c  we refer to vu as the variety associated
with u
n

proposition 31 1 the linear multiplicative functionals on cf
u  are in
onetoone correspondence with points z w in vu 
2 mau  is homeomorphic to u 
3 for z w  u  write zw for the corresponding character of au 
then zw extends to a w  continuous character on lu if and only if
z w  bn  bm 
proof
part 1 follows immediately from 1 fix   mau  and
write zi  lei  1  i  n and wi  lfj  1  j  m from the
multiplicativity and linearity
pof  and 1
p it follows that z w  vu  since
 is contractive and maps i ai lei to i ai zi  it follows that kzk  1 and
similarly kwk  1 thus z w  u 
for the other direction fix first z w  u with kzk  1 and kwk  1
it follows from the definition of u and from 1 that z w defines a linear
and multiplicative map  on the algebra cf
u  such that lei is mapped into
zi and lfj   wj  abusing notation slightly we write x for lx  for
every x  e k  f l  also for i  i1      ik  and j  j1      jl  we write
ei fj for ei1      eik  fj1      fjl  these elements form an orthonormal
basis for e k  f l and we now set

note that for every x  e k  f l 
hx w i  x

thus for e  e hx le w i  hle x w i  e  x  ex  hew  xi
and similarly hxp

ew  e peifj 2  ekw k2  similarly hw  lf w i 
f w  f  ei fj 2  f kw k2 for f  f  thus if we write
  w kw k then
x  hlx    i

for every x  e k  f l for every k l this shows that  is contractive
and is w  continuous we can therefore extend it to an element of mlu 
also denoted 
the analysis above shows that the image of the map  7 z w  u
defined above on mau  contains vu bn bm  since mau  is compact
and the map is w  continuous its image contains and thus is equal to u 
this completes the proof of 2 to complete the proof of 3 we need
to show that if z w  u and the corresponding character extends to a
w  continuous character on lu  then kzk  1 and kwk  1
for this write l for the w  closed subalgebra of lu generated by le 
e  e  i let p be the projection of f e f u onto f e  c 
e  e  e     then p lp  p lu p and the map t 7 p t p  is a
w  continuous isomorphism of l onto p lu p  the latter algebra is unitarily
equivalent to the algebra ln studied in 2 a w  continuous character of lu
gives rise therefore to a w  continuous character on ln  it follows from 2
theorem 23 that z  bn  similarly one shows that w  bm  
to state the next result we first write uij for the n  m matrix whose
k lentry is uijkl thus the i j row of u provides the n rows of uij 
we then compute

write eij for the n  m matrix whose i jentry is 1 and all other entries are
0 so that heij w zi  zi wj  and write cij for the matrix uij  eij  then
the computation above yields the following
lemma 32 with cij defined as above we have
vu  z w  cn  cm 

hcijw zi  0 for all i j

definition 33 the core of u is the subset given by
0u  z w  bn  bm

cij w  0 cij

for all i j

fix z w  0u  we have uij w  eij w for all i j thus for every k

where
ik is 1 if i  k and 0 otherwise and for a1  a2      an  in c we have

be the vector in cmn defined

by wkl  ki wl  we get uw i  w i  similarly for z we have

p
and for scalars b1      bm we have kl uijklbl zk  bj zi  thus writing zj
for the vector defined by zj kl  lj zk  we have uzj  zj  the vector
w i in cnm  cn  cm is also expressible as i  w where 1      n  is
the standard basis of cn  and similarly zj  z  j  we therefore obtain
lemma 34 which will be useful in section 6
we note also the following companion formula suppose z w  0u 
then as we noted above uzj  zj and thus u zj  zj  writing this
explicitly we have for all i j l
x

lemma 34 let z w be a vector in the core 0u  then
spanzj  w i  1  i  n 1  j  m  keru  i
in particular
i if the core contains a vector z w with z 6 0 then dimkeru  i

ii if the core contains a vector z w with w 6 0 then dimkeru  i 
n
9

iii if the core contains a vector z w with z 6 0 and w 6 0 then
dimkeru  i  m  n  1
we now characterise the core in an algebraic manner in terms of representations into the algebra t2 of upper triangular 2  2 matrices we remark
that nest representations such as these have proven useful in the algebraic
structure theory of nonselfadjoint algebra  11
let   cf
u   t2 with


11 t  12 t 
t

21 t 
then 11 and 22 are characters and 12 is a linear functional that satisfies
12 t s  11 t 12 s  12 t 22 s

9

for t s  cf
u 
we now restrict to the case where 11  22  by proposition 311
both are associated with a point z w in vu  it follows from 9 that 12
is determined by its values on lei and lfj  setting i  12 lei  and j 
12 lfj  we associate with each homomorphism  as discussed above a
quadruple z w   where z w  vu and for every i j

the last equation follows from 1 using 5 we can write the last equation
as

that is

11

the following lemma now follows from the definition of the core

automorphisms of ln and lu

we first derive the unitary automorphisms of ln and an associated with
u1 n these were obtained by voiculescu 14 in the setting of the cuntztoeplitz algebra however the automorphisms restrict to an action of u1 n
on the free semigroup algebra the result is rather fundamental being a
higher dimensional version of the familiar mbius automorphism group on
h   for the readers convenience we provide complete proofs see also the
discussion in davidson and pitts 2 and in 1 10
lemma 41 let   bn and write
i x0  1  kk2 12 
ii   x0  and
iii x1  icn    12 
then

satisfies x  jx  j where j 

proof
part 1 is an easy computation and part 3 follows from the
definition of x1  for 2 note that x12   i       kk2   x20 
and for every      x1    suppose x1   a        then
x20   x12   a2    and it follows that a  x0 as x1  0 and   0 
the lemma exhibits specific matrices x1 is nonnegative in u1 n associated with points in the open ball one can similarly check see 2 or 10 for

11

example that the general form of a matrix z in u1 n is z 



z0 1

z1 1  z 0 2  z1 2  z0 1 
z1 z1  in  1 1  z1 z1  in  2 2 
it is these equations that are equivalent to the single matrix equation z  jz 
j
it is well known that the map x defined on bn by
x  

x1   
   bn 
x0  h i

is an automorphism of bn with inverse x 1  see lemma 49 of 2 and lemma
81 of 10 for example we make use of this in the proof of voiculescus
theorem below
let l1      lp
n be the generators of the norm closed algebra an and for  
n
c write l 
i li  recall that the character space man  is naturally
identifiable with the closed ball bn  with  in this ball providing a character
 for which  li   i  the proof is a reduced version of that given above
for ma 
theorem 42 let   bn and let x1  x0   and x be associated with  as
in lemma 41 then
i there is an automorphism x of ln such that
 l   x0 i  l 1 lx1   h ii

ii the inverse automorphism x
is x 1  and x 1 is the matrix in

and x a  ux aux 
proof
let fn be the fock space for ln  in  ifn  and let l 
in l1    ln  viewed as an operator from c  cn   fn  fn  cn  fn 
to fn  then
lj  il  in  ll  in  l1 l1     ln ln   p0
12

where p0 is the vacuum vector projection from fn to c also since xjx 
j we have
lj  il  lx  in j  ix  in l  y0 y1 j  iy0 y1

y0 y1   in l

where here e1      en is the standard basis for cn 
the operator v  y01 y1 is a row isometry v1    vn  from cn  fn to
fn with defect 1 to see this we compute

considering the path t  t for 0  t  1 and the corresponding path of
partial isometries v it follows from the stability of fredholm index that the
index of v and l coincide and so in fact v is a row isometry thus v1      vn
are isometries with orthogonal ranges
we now have a contractive algebra homomorphism an  lfn  determined by the correspondence lei  vi  i  1     n in fact it is an algebra

thus far we have followed voiculescus proof 14 the following argument
shows that  is an automorphism and is an alternative to the calculation
suggested in 14 the calculation shows that
  x  x 
we have
  x l    x0 in  l 1 h iin  lx1  
 x0  h i1h i  hx1  i   l 

where


x1

 x 
x0  h i
x0  h i

write x for the contractive endomorphism  of an as constructed
above it follows that the composition   x 1  x is a contractive
endomorphism which by the remarks preceding the statement of the theorem induces the identity map on the character space so that     1
for all   bn  such a map must be the identity indeed suppose that we
have the fourier series representation 1 le1   a1 le1      an len  x
where x is a series with terms of total degree greater than one it follows
that
lim t1 t00 1 le1   a1
t0

while
lim t1 t00 le1   1
t0

since the induced map is the identity we have a1  1 and ak  0 for k  2
in this way we see that the image of each li has the form li ti where ti has
only terms of total degree greater than one since li 0 is orthogonal to ti 0
and 1 li  is a contraction we have 1  k1 li 0 k2  kli 0  ti 0 k2 
kli 0 k2  kti 0 k2  1  kti 0 k2  thus ti 0  0 and consequently ti  0
and so the composition  is the identity map
finally we show that  is unitarily implemented define ux on an 0
by ux a0  x a0  x ax0 i  l 1 0 for a  a since x is an
automorphism ux ab0  ux ab0  x ax b0  x aux b0  for
a b  an  and it follows that ux a  x aux  as linear transformations on
the dense space an 0 
14

now v  v1      vn  is a row isometry with defect space spanned by 0 
the map ux maps i  li 0 to x li 0  vi 0 and if w  we1      en  is
a word in e1      en  then
ux w  ux wl1      ln 0  x wl1      ln 0  wv1      vn 0 
since v is a row isometry and 0 is a unit wandering vector for v  it follows
that wv1     vn 0  is an orthonormal set thus ux is an isometry since
the range of ux contains ux an 0  x an 0  an x0 i  l 1 0  an 0
we see that ux is unitary 
remark 43 with the same calculations as in the proof above and slightly
more notation one can show that each invertible matrix z  u1 n defines
an automorphism z and that z  z is an action of u1 n on an and
in particular z x  zx  moreover z  uz is a unitary representation
of u1 n implementing
this as the following calculation indicates



w0 
be the matrix in u1 n associated with   bn
let w 
 w1
as in lemma 41 then
ux uw a0  ux  aw0  l 1 0 
   aw0  l 1 x0 in  l 1 0
   a w0  l 1 x0 in  l 1 0
 xw a w0  l 1 x0 in  l 1 0
 xw aw0 in  x0 in  l 1 lx1   h iin 1 x0 in  l 1 0
 xw aw0 x0 in  w0 l  lx1   h iin1 0
 xw aw0 x0 in  h iin  l0 x1  1 0 

one readily checks that this is the same as uxw a0

it is evident from the last theorem and its proof that the unitary automorphisms of an and ln act transitively on the open subset bn associated
with the weak star continuous characters we shall show that a version of
this holds for the unitary relation algebras with respect to the open core of
the character space as a first step to constructing automorphisms of au we
obtain unitary commutation relations for the ntuples le1      len 
and lf1      lfm  for certain automorphisms  of the copy of an in au

proposition 46 suppose z w  0u  bn  bm  then there is a automorphism z of au that is unitarily implemented and such that for every

where zw is the character associated with z w by proposition 31
proof
let u be the unitary operator implementing  we can view
f n m u as the sum

f n m u 
k

where f e  c  e  e  e     we now let v be the unitary operator
whose restriction to f k  f e is ik  u where ik is the identity operator
on f k  it is easy to check that for every fj 
v lfj v   lfj 
now fix i we shall show by induction that for every k and every  
f k  f e
ik  ulei   lei ik  u
18

for k  0 this is just the fact that u implements  suppose we know this
for k and fix fj  f  then for   f k  f e we have

applying the induction hypothesis this is equal to kl uijkllfl lek ik 
u using 13 this is lei lfj ik  u  lei ik  ulfj  since
f k1  f e is spanned by elements of the form lfj  as above the
equality follows from the relations of lemma 44 it follows that the map
z  x  v xv  defines a unitary endomorphism of au  since  is an
automorphism of an it follows that z gives the desired automorphism 

clearly in proposition 46 we can interchange z and w to get the following where zw  z w 

proposition 47 suppose z w  0u  bn  bm  then there is a unitary
automorphism zw of lu which is a homeomorphism with respect to the
w  topologies and which restricts to an automorphism of au  moreover for
every x  lu 
00 1
19
zw x  zw x
where zw is the character associated with z w as in proposition 31
an automorphism  of au  defines a map on the character space of au 
namely  7   1 thus using proposition 31 we have a homeomorphism
 of u  also since u  bn  bm  is the interior of u   maps u 
bn  bm  onto itself
similarly if  is an automorphism of lu which is a homeomorphism with
respect to the w  topologies then  is a homeomorphism of u  bn  bm 
in the following theorem we identify the relative interior of the core as the
orbit of 0 0 under the group of maps  associated with automorphisms 
theorem 48 for z w  bn  bm the following conditions are equivalent
1 z w  0u 

19

2 there exists a completely isometric automorphism  of lu that is a
homeomorphism with respect to the w  topologies and restricts to an
automorphism of au  such that  0 0  z w
3 there exists an algebraic automorphism  of au such that  0 0 
z w
proof the proof that 1 implies 2 follows from proposition 47 clearly
2 implies 3 it is left to show that 3 implies 1
given a point z w  u  we saw in lemma 35 that for every  
satisfying 11 there is a homomorphism zw  cf
u   t2  for z w 
0 0 equation 11 holds for every pair   since 00 vanishes off a
finite dimensional subspace it is a bounded homomorphism in fact for
every   k00 k  1  kk  kk
given  and z w as in 3 for every    cn  cm  00  1
is a homomorphism on cf
u  and thus it is of the form zw  for some


unique     satisfying 11 write        and note that this
defines a continuous map to prove the continuity suppose n  n    
and write n for 00n n and  for 00  then using the estimate on the
norm of 00  there is some m such that kn k  m for all n and kk  m
for every y  cf
u  n y   y  now fix x  au and   0 there is
some y  cf

such
that kx  y k   and there is some n such that for
u
n  n kn y   y k   thus for such n kn x  xk  2m  1
setting x  lei  we get n   and similarly for  
if z w is not in 0u  then the set of all   satisfying 11 is a subspace
of cn  cm of dimension strictly smaller than n  m and as is shown above
it contains the continuous image under the injective map  of cn  cm 
this is impossible

isomorphic algebras

in this section we shall find conditions for algebras au and av to be isometrically isomorphic the characterisation also applies to the weak star closed
algebras lu 
we start by considering a special type of isomorphism we shall now
assume that the set n m for both algebras is the same in fact by interchanging e and f  we can assume that the corresponding dimensions are the
20

same and the algebras are defined on f n m u and f n m v respectively
this assumption will be in place in the discussion below up to the end of
lemma 55
the algebra au carries a natural z2 grading with the k l labeled subspace being spanned by products of the form lei1 lei2    leik lfi1 lfi2    lfil 
also the total length of such operators provides a natural z grading note
that an algebra isomorphism   au  av which respects the z grading is
determined by a linear map between the spans of the generators
le1      len  lf1      lfm  here we use the same notation for the generators
of au and av  such an isomorphism will be called graded
we now consider two types of graded isomorphisms namely either bigraded as in the following definition or in case n  m bigraded after
relabeling generators
definition 51 i an isomorphism   au  av is said to be bigraded
isomorphism if there are unitary matrices a n  n and b m  m
such that

we write ab for the bigraded isomorphism as in i and ab for the
graded exchange isomorphism

for a bigraded isomorphism and similarly for the other expressions
for unitary permutation matrices the following lemma was proved in 10

definition 53 if u v are mnmn unitary matrices and there exist unitary
matrices a and b satisfying 20 we say that u and v are product unitary

now suppose that a and b are unitary matrices satisfying 20 the

where cgi  agi if gi  e1      en  and cgi  bgi if gi  f1      fm 
proof if the gi s are ordered such that the first ones are from e and the
following vectors are from f  then the result is clear from the definition of
wab  since we can get any other arrangement by starting with one of this
kind and interchanging pairs gl  gl1 successively with gl  e1      en  and
gl1  f1      fm  it is enough to show that that if 22 holds for a given
arrangement of es and f s and we apply such an interchange then it still
holds so we assume gl  ek  gl1  fs and we write g   g1      gl1

completing the proof 

cg  bfs  aek  cg 

the following lemma was proved in 10 section 7 and it shows that the
necessary conditions of lemma 52 are also sufficient conditions on a  b for
the existence of a unitarily implemented isomorphism ab 
23

lemma 55 for unitary matrices a b satisfying 20 and x  au  the
map

x 7 wab xwab
is the bigraded isomorphism ab  au  av  moreover ab extends to
a unitary isomorphism lu  lv  and similar statements holds for graded
exchange isomorphisms when m  n
proof it will suffice to show the equality
ab xwab  wab x
for x  lei and for x  lfj  let x  lfj and apply both sides of the
equation to ei1      eik  fj1      fjl  using lemma 54 we get
ab lfj wab ei1      eik  fj1      fjl

 wab fj  ei1      eik  fj1      fjl 
 wab lfj ei1      eik  fj1      fjl 
this proves the equality for x  lfj  the proof for x  lei is similar 
at this point we drop our assumption that the set n m is the same for
both algebras and write n  m  for the dimensions associated with av  we
shall see in proposition 58 and remark 511i that if the algebras are
isomorphic then necessarily n m  n  m 
given an isomorphism   au  av we get a homeomorphism   u 
v as in the discussion preceeding theorem 48 the arguments used in
the proof of theorem 48 to show that part 3 implies part 1 apply also
to isomorphisms and thus  0 0  0v 
proposition 56 let   au  av be an algebraic isomorphism then
 0u   0v and  0u  bn  bm   0v  bn  bm 

24

proof fix z w in 0u and use theorem 48 to get an automorphism 
of au such that  0 0  z w but then  0 0   z w and as we
noted above this implies that  z w  0v  it follows that  0u   0v
and applying this to 1  the lemma follows 
lemma 57 the map  is a biholomorphic map
proof the coordinate functions for  are z w 7 zw 1 ei  and
z w 7 zw1 fj  where zw is the character associated with z w
by proposition 31 for every y  cf
v  zw y  is a polynomial in z w
for z w  v  and therefore an analytic function each x  av is a norm
limit of elements in cf
v  and thus zw x is an analytic function being
a uniform limit of analytic functions on compact subsets of v  hence for
every z w  v  there is a power series that converges in some non empty
circular neighborhood c of z w that represents zw x on cv  taking
for x the operators 1 ei  and 1 fj  we see that  is analytic the same
arguments apply to 1  
the facts in the following proposition obtained in 10 in the case of
permutation matrices
proposition 58 let   au  av be an algebraic isomorphism and let
  u  v be the associated map between the character spaces suppose
 0 0  0 0 then we have the following
1 n m  n  m  and we shall assume that n  n and m  m
interchanging e and f and changing u to u if necessary
2 there are unitary matrices u nn and v mm such that  z w 
uz v w for z w  u  if n  m it is also possible that  z w 
v w uz
3 if  is an isometric isomorphism then  is a bigraded isomorphism
or if m  n it may be a graded exchange isomorphism
proof the proof of proposition 63 in 10 giving 1 and 2 in the
permutation case is based essentially on schwarzs lemma for holomorphic
map from the unit disc it applies without change to the case of unitary
matrices
25

for 3 we may assume m  m and n  n  from 2 we have for each
lei   lu ei  x where x is a sum of higher order terms since lei  is a
contraction and lu ei is an isometry it follows as in the proof of voiculescus
theorem that x  0 similarly lfj   lv fj and it follows that  is
bigraded 
since every graded isomorphism  satisfies  0 0  0 0 we conclude
the following
corollary 59 every graded isometric isomorphism is bigraded if n 6 m
and otherwise is either bigraded or is a graded exchange isomorphism
theorem 510 the following statements are equivalent for unitary matrices
u v in mn c  mm c
i there is an isometric isomorphism   au  av 
ii there is a graded isometric isomorphism from   au  av 
iii the matrices u v are product unitary equivalent or in case n  m
the matrices u  are product unitary equivalent where ijkl  vlkji 
iv there is an isometric wcontinuous isomorphism   lu  lv 
proof given  in i let z w   0 0 by proposition 56 z w lies in
the interior of 0v  by theorem 48 there is a completely isometric automorphism  of av such that  0 0  z w and therefore 1  0 0  0 0
by proposition 58 1   is a graded isometric isomorphism and ii holds
lemma 52 shows that ii implies iii and lemma 55 that iii implies i
finally iii implies iv follows from lemma 55 and iv implies ii is
entirely similar to i implies ii 
remark 511 the argument at the beginning of the proof of theorem 510
shows that whenever au and av are isomorphic we have n m  n  m 
theorem 512 for n 6 m the isometric automorphisms of au are of the
form ab zw where z w  0u and a  bu  ua  b in case n  m
the isometric automorphisms include in addition those of the form ab zw
where a  b  ua  b

special cases
the case n  m  2

even in the low dimensions n  m  2 there are many isomorphism classes
and special cases note that the product unitary equivalence class orbit ou
of the 4  4 unitary matrix u takes the form
ou  a  bua  b  a b  su2 c
and so the product unitary equivalence classes are parametrised by the set of
orbits u4 cadsu2 c  su2 c this set admits a 10fold parametrisation since as is easily checked u4 c and su2 csu2 c are real algebraic
varieties of dimension 16 and 6 respectively it follows that the isometric isomorphism types of the algebras au admit a 10 fold real parametrisation with
coincidences only for pairs ou ov with u  
we now look at some special cases in more detail let d  dimkerui
case i d  0
for every z w  b2  b2  we have z w  u if and only if the vector
z1 w1  z1 w2  z2 w1  z2 w2 t lies in keru  i thus in case i u is as small as
possible and is equal to
min  b2  0  0  b2 
it follows from lemma 34 that in this case
0u  0 0
by proposition 58 every isometric automorphism of au is graded and the
isometric automorphisms of au are given by pairs a b of unitary matrices
such that a  b either commutes with u or intertwines u and 
case ii d  1
when d  1 it still follows from lemma 34 that
0u  0 0
but now it is possible for u to be larger than min  in fact if the non zero
vector a b c dt spanning keru  i satisfies ad 6 bc then u  min but
27




a b
if ad  bc then the matrix
is of rank one and can be written as
c d
z1  z2 t w1  w2 thus z w  vu and u contains some z w with non
zero z and w
since 0u  0 0 it is still true that isometric isomorphisms and automorphisms of these algebras are graded
case iii d  2
when d  2 it is possible that 0u will contain non zero vectors z w but as
lemma 34 shows it does not contain a vector with both z 6 0 and w 6 0
all other possibilities may occur for example write u1  u2 and u3 for the
three diagonal matrices
u1  diag1 1 1 1 u2  diag1 1 1 1
and
u3  diag1 1 1 1

using the definition of the core we easily see that
0u1  0 0 0u2  0 0 w1 0  w1   1
and
0u3  z1  0 0 0  z1   1

thus the only isometric automorphisms of au1 are graded the isometric automorphisms of au2 are formed by composing graded automorphisms
with automorphisms of the type described in proposition 47 with z  0 0
and w  w1  0 similarly for the automorphisms of au3  we use proposition 46
case iv d  3
in this case we are able to obtain an explicit 2fold parametrization of the
isomorphism types of the algebra au 
every 4  4 unitary matrix u with dimkeru  i  3 is determined by
a unit eigenvector x and its different from 1 eigenvalue so that ux  x
kxk  1   1 and  6 1 suppose u and v are product unitary equivalent
that is
a  bu  va  b
for unitary matrices a b and write x  for the unit eigenvector and eigenvalue of u of course x is determined only up to a multiple by a scalar
28

of absolute value 1 then y  a  bx is a unit eigenvector of v with
eigenvalue  for unit vectors x y in c4  we write x  y if there are unitary
2  2 matrices a b with y  a  bx for the statement of the next
lemma recall that the entries of the vectors x and y in c4 are indexed by
i j  1  i j  2
lemma 61 for a vector x  xij  in c4  write cx for the 2  2 matrix


x11 x12
cx 

x21 x22
then x  y if and only if there are unitary matrices a b such that cx 
acyb in this case we shall write cx  cy
proof suppose y  abxp

a  aij  and b

0 d
and a d  0 then a d the eigenvalues of cx are uniquely determined
once we choose themsuch that a  d and if kxk  1 then a2  d2  1
to
so that 0  a  1 2 and a determines d in this way we associate

each unitary matrix u as above a pair a  with 0  a  1 2  6 1
and   1 using lemma 61 and the discussion preceeding it we have the
following
corollary 62 for every 4  4 unitary matrix u with dimkeru i  3
there are numbers  with   1 and  6 1 and a 0  a  1 2 such
that u and v are product unitary equivalent if and only if they have the same
a 
proof let u and v be unitary matrices with dimkeru  i  3 and let
a  b  be the pairs associated to u and v respectively as above also
write x for the unit eigenvector of u associated to the eigenvalue  and let y
be the unit eigenvector of v associated to 
suppose u and v are product unitarily equivalent then they are unitary
equivalent and thus    write abu  vab for unitary matrices
29

a b as we saw above y can be chosen to be a  bx so that x  y and
by lemma 61 cx  cy it follows that a  b
conversely assume that a  b and    then cx  cy and thus
x  y so we can write y  a  bx for some unitary matrices a b writing
v   a  bua  b  we find that y is the unit eigenvector of v  associated
to  thus v  v   completing the proof 
for every a  as in corollary 62 we let ua  be the following 4  4
matrix

it is a straightforward computation to verify that dimkeru  i  3 and
that  is an eigenvalue of ua  with eigenvector a 0 0 1  a2 12 t  thus
the pair associated to ua  is a  and we have
corollary 63 every matrix u with dimkeru  i  3 is product
 unitary
equivalent to a unique matrix of the form ua  with 0  a  1 2   1
and  6 1
using the definition of the core we immediately get the following
proposition 64 if a  0   1  6 1 then u0 is the union
z1  z2  w1  0  z  b2  w1  1  z1  0 w1 w2   w  b2  z1   1
and
0u0  z1  0 w1  0  z1   1 w1  1
if a 6 0 then
ua  z1  z2  w1  w2  az1 w1  1  a2 12 z2 w2  0 z w  b2  b2 
and
0ua  0 0

30

proof the space ua consists of points z w for which
z1 w1  z1 w2  z2 w1  z2 w2 t  ua z1 w1  z1 w2  z2 w1  z2 w2 t 
that is for which
  1a2  1z1 w1    1a1  a2 12 z2 w2  z1 w1 

  1a1  a2 12 z1 w1      1a2 z2 w2  z2 w2 

if a  0 this implies z2 w2  0 while if a 6 0 then z1 w1  0 0 z2w2  is a fixed
vector for ua  and so for some scalar  z1 w1  z2 w2   1  a2 12  a
the descriptions of ua follows
from the definition of the core and the fact that here c12  c21  0 and

we see that for a  0 we have w2  z2  0 while for a 6 0 z1  z2  w1 
w2  0 
recall that for a 4  4 unitary matrix v we defined the matrix  by
ijkl  vlkji and showed corollary 510 that au and av are isometrically isomorphic if and only if either u and v or u and  are product unitary
equivalent

now it is easy to check that ua
  ua  and so using proposition 33 and previous results we obtain the following

theorem 65 let 0  a b  1 2     1   6 1 then

1 aua and aub are isometrically isomorphic if and only if a  b and
 equals either  or 
2 when a 6 0 the isometric automorphisms of au0 are all bigraded
3 if a  0 then there are isometric isomorphisms that are not graded

permutation unitary relation algebras

with more structure assumed for a class of unitaries u it may be possible to
derive an appropriately more definitive classification of the algebras au  we
indicate this now for the class of permutation unitaries a fuller discussion
is in 10
let   s4  viewed as a permutation of the product set 1 2  1 2 
11 12 21 22 associate with  the matrix u  uijkl where uijkl 
1 if k l  i j and is zero otherwise if   s4 is product conjugate to  in
the sense that    1 with  in s2  s2  then it follows that u and u are
product unitarily equivalent thus we need only consider product conjugacy
classes it turns out that these classes are the same as the product unitary
equivalence classes of the matrices u 
it can be helpful to view a permutation  in snm as a permutation of the
entries of an n  m rectangular array since product conjugacy corresponds
to conjugation through row permutations and column permutations considering this for n  m  2 one can verify firstly that there are at most
9 isomorphism types for the algebras at heta corresponding to the following
permutations
1  id 2  11 12 3  11 22
1
4a  11 22 12 4b  4a
 11 12 22 5  11 12 21 22

6  11 22 12 21 7  11 12 22 21 8  11 12 21 22
the gelfand spaces of the algebras a and l  distinguish all of these algebras except for the pairs 4a  4b  and 7  8  however one can verify
in both cases that neither the pair u v nor the pair u  are product unitary
equivalent theorem 510 now applies to yield the following result from 10
theorem 66 for n  m  2 there are 9 isometric isomorphism classes for
the algebras a and for the algebras l 
to a higher rank graph  d in the sense of kumjian and pask 6 one can
associate nonselfadjoint toeplitz algebra a  l  as in kribs and power 5
in the single vertex rank 2 case it is easy to see that a is equal to the algebra
au for some permutation matrix u   in snm  thus theorem 510 classifies
these algebras in terms of product unitary equivalence restricted to snm as
stated formally in the next theorem in the rank 2 case this is a significant
improvement on the results in 10 which although covering general rank
32

were restricted to the case of trivial core for the character space with  the
permutation for the permutation matrix  which corresponds to generator
exchange we have
theorem 67 let 1 and 2 be single vertex 2graphs with relations determined by the permutations 1 and 2  then the rank 2 graph algebras
a1  a2 are isometrically isomorphic if and only if the pair 1  2 or the
pair 1  2 are product unitary equivalent
it is natural to expect that as in the 2 2 case product unitary equivalence will correspond to product conjugacy

au as a subalgebra of a tensor algebra

let en be the toeplitz extension of the cuntz algebra on and write h for
the fock space associated with e that is h  c  e  e  e    
note that en acts naturally on h  by the shift or creation operators
li  lei  1  i  n in fact le1      len generate en as a c  algebra
consider also the space f f h  hf hf f h   this
space is isomorphic to f e f u and we write w  f f   h  f e f u
for the isomorphism it will be convenient to write wk for the restriction of
w to the summand f k  h which is an isomorphism onto its image note
that for a fixed k wk lei wk  1  i  n  is a set of n isometries with
orthogonal ranges thus it defines a representation k of en on f k h with
k lei   wk lei wk  note that we are using lei for the creation operators
both on h and on f e f u p
this should cause no confusion we also
write  for the representation k k of en on f f   h where 0 is the
representation of en on h
let x be the column space cm en  this is a c  module over en  as a
vector space it is the direct sum of m copies of en  the right module action
of en on x ispgiven by ai   b  ai b and the en valued inner product is
hai  bi i  i ai bi  for every 1  i  n we write si for the operator in
lx defined by
x
si aj m

thus si is an isometry a similar computation shows that these isometries
have orthogonal ranges and thus this family defines a  homomorphism
  en  lx with lei   si  1  i  n making x a c  correspondence
over en in the sense of 8 and 7 once we have a correspondence we can
form x x and more generally x k  recall that to define x x one defines
the sesquilinear form hxy x y  i  hy hx xiy i on the algebraic tensor
product and then lets x  x be the hausdorff completion the right action
of en on x  x is x  y  a  x  y  a and the left action is given by the
map 2 
2 ax  y  ax  y
the definition of x k is similar and the left action map is denoted k 
for k  0 wep
set x 0  en and 0 is defined by left multiplication  also
write  for k k  the left action of en on f x
one can then define the hilbert space x k en h by defining the sesquilinear form hxh y ki  hh hx yiki x y  x k  and applying the hausdorff
completion
now define the map
v  x en h  f  h
by setting
vai   h 

x
i

fi  ai h

it is straightforward to check that this map is a well defined hilbert space
isomorphism by induction we also define maps vk  x k en h  f k  h
by
x
vk1 aj   z 
fj  vk k aj   ih z
23
j

34

for z  x k en h and v0 is the identity map from en en h which is
isomorphic to h and f 0  h  h assume that vk is a hilbert space
isomorphism of x k en h onto f k  h and compute for aj  bj   x
and z z   x k  h
x
hvk1 aj z vk1 bj zi

jj

j

hvk k aj   ih z vk k bj   ih z  i 
x
hz k aj bj   ih z  i 
j

haj   z bj   z  i
thus by induction each map vk is a hilbert space isomorphism and summing up we get a hilbert space isomorphism
x
vk  f x en h  f f   h
v 
k

lemma 71 v is a hilbert space isomorphism and intertwines the actions
of en  that is
v   a  ih    a  v
for a  en 
proof we show that for every p  0 and a  en  we have
vp  p a  ih   p a  vp 

24

the proof will proceed by induction on p for p  0 this is clear so we now
assume that it holds for p for 1  i  n aj   x and z p
x p h we have
vp1 p1lei   ih aj   z  vp1 lei aj   z  lkj uijklfl

using the induction hypothesis again we get p1 lei wp1

ih z  p1 lei vp1 aj z this proves 24 for p1 and the generators

of en  since both p1 and vp1 p1 ih vp1
are  homomorphisms 24
holds for p  1 and every a  en  completing the induction step thus 24
holds for every p and this implies the statement of the lemma 
write l for the vector aj  in x such that al  i and aj  0 if l 6 j
the tensor algebra t x is generated by the operators tl where tl is the
creation operator on f x associated with l  and the c  algebra  en 
the latter algebra is generated as a c  algebra by the operators  li 
where li  is the set of generators of en 
we have
lemma 72 for every 1  i  n and 1  j  m and k  0
i w  vk   li   ih   lei  w  vk 
ii w  vk1  tj  ih   lfj  w  vk 
proof part i follows from 24 and part ii from 23 with j in place
of aj  
recalling that w  v is a unitary operator mapping f x  h onto
f e f u we get
theorem 73 1 the algebra au is unitarily isomorphic to the norm
closed subalgebra of the tensor algebra t x that is generated by
 li  tj  1  i  n 1  j  m
2 the norm closed subalgebra of bf e f u that is generated by
lei  lei  lfj  1  i  n 1  j  m  is unitarily isomorphic to the
tensor algebra t x and contains au 
2 the norm closed subalgebra of bf e f u that is generated by
lei  lfj  lfj  1  i  n 1  j  m  is unitarily isomorphic to a
tensor algebra t y  and contains au 

36

proof
parts 1 and 2 follow from lemma 72 for part 3 note
that one can interchange the roles of e and f  more precisely one defines
the c  module y over empto be y  cn em  and the left action of em on
y by y lfl bk nk1   jk ijkllfj bk ni1  this makes y into a c  correspondence over em and the rest of the proof proceeds along similar lines
as above 
suppose m  1 then x is the correspondence
associated with the
pn
automorphism  of en given by mapping ti to j1 uij tj note that u in
this case is an n  n matrix the tensor algebra t x is the analytic
crossed product en  z and au is unitarily isomorphic to the subalgebra
of this analytic crossed product that can be written an  z  one can also
embed au in t y  as in corollary 733 here em is simply
the classical
p
toeplitz algebra t and y  cn t  with y tz bk k   k ik tz bk i where
tz is the generator of t 
remark 74 since the automorphisms zw and ab of au are both unitarily implemented they can be extended to t x it is easy to check that
they map t x into itself and thus are automorphisms of t x hence
at least when n 6 m every automorphism of au can be extended to an automorphism of the tensor algebra t x that contains it see theorem 512
