multilinear function series in conditionally
free probability with amalgamation
mihai popa
abstract as in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence the
notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complexvalued states are
replaced by positive conditional expectations in this framework the paper
presents several positivity results a version of the central limit theorem and
an analogue of the conditionally free rtransform constructed by means of
multilinear function series

1 introduction
the paper addresses a topic related to conditionally free or shortly using the
term from 2 cfree probability this notion was developed in the 90s see 1
2 as an extension of freeness within the framework of algebras endowed with
not one but two states namely given a family of unital algebras aii  each ai
endowed with two expectations i  i  ai  c their cfree product is the triple
a   where




i a  ii ai is the free product of the algebras ai 
ii   ii i and   i ii i are expectations given by the relations
a a1    an   0
b a1    an   1 a1     n an 



for all aj  aj  j  1     n such that j aj   0 and 1 6    
6 n
a key result is that if the ai are algebras and i  i are positive functionals
then  and  are also positive
in 6 the positivity of the free product maps   is proved for the case
when 1  2 are positive conditional expectations in a common csubalgebra
but 1  2 remain positive cvalued maps a more general situation is indeed
discussed see theorem 3 section 6 from 6 but the question if   re positive
for 12  12 arbitrary positive conditional expectations is left unanswered
a first answer was given in 8 where we showed that for a a algebra the
analogous construction with both  and  valued in a c  subalgebra b of a still
retains the positivity the present paper further develops this result see theorem
23 and also demonstrates the use of multilinear function series in cfree setting

in 2 is constructed a cfree version of voiculescus rtransform which we will
call the c rtransform with the property that c rxy  c rx  c ry if x and y
are cfree elements from the algebra a relative to  and  ie the relations a
and b from the definition of the cfree product hold true for the subalgebras
generated by x and y 
the apparatus of multilinear function series is used in recent work of k dykema
3 and 4 to construct suitable analogues for the r and stransforms in the
framework of freeness with amalgamation we will show that this construction
is also appropriate for the c rtransform mentioned above the techniques used
differ from the ones of 3 the fock space type construction being substituted by
combinatorial techniques similar to 2 and 7 particularly theorems 33 and 36
contain new shorter proves of the results 61613 from 3
the paper is structured in four sections in section 2 are stated the basic
definitions and are proved the main positivity results section 3 describes the
construction and the basic property of the multilinear function series c rtransform
and section 4 treats the central limit theorem and a related positivity property
2 definitions and positivity results
definition 21 let ai ii be a family of algebras all containing the subalgebra
b suppose d is a subalgebra of b and i  ai  d and i  ai  b are conditional expectations i  i we say that the triple a    ii ai  i  i 
is the conditionally free product with amalgamation over bd or shortly the
cfree product of the triples ai  i  i ii if
1 a is the free product with amalgamation over b of the family ai ii
2   ii i and   i ii i are determined by the relations

0

a1 a2    an  

a1 a2     an 

for all ai  ai  i  i such that 1 6 2 6    
6 n and i ai   0
when d  c this definition reduces to the one given in 6 when both b and
d are equal to c this definition was given in 2
when discussing positivity we need a structure on our algebras we will
demand that b and d be c algebras while ai and a are only required to be
algebras
the following results are slightly modified versions of lemma 64 and theorem
65 from 8
lemma 22 let b be a c  algebra and a1  a2 be two algebras containing b
as a subalgebra endowed with positive conditional expectations j  aj  b
j  1 2 if a1      an  a1  an1      anm  a2 and a  aij ij  mnm b

then a is positive
proof the vector space e  b  ker1   ker2  has a bbimodule structure
given by the algebraic operations on a1 and a2  consider the bsesquilinear
pairing
h i  e  e  b
determined by the relations
hb1  b2 i  b1 b2  for b1  b2  b
huj  vj i  j uj vj  for uj  vj  kerj  j  1 2

hu1  u2 i  hu2  u1 i  0 for u1  ker1  and u2  ker2 
hb uj i  huj  bi  0 for all b  b uj  aj

with this notation we have that aij  hai  aj i hence it suffices to show that
ha ai  0 for all a  e
indeed for an element a  b  u1  u2 with b  b uj  kerj  j  1 2 we
have
ha ai  hb  u1  u2  b  u1  u2 i
 hb bi  hu1  u1 i  hu2  u2 i

 b b  1 u1 u1   2 u2 u2 
 0






theorem 23 let b be a c algebra and d a c subalgebra of b suppose that
a1  a2 are algebras containing b each endowed with two positive conditional
expectations j  aj  b and j  aj  d j  1 2 and consider the cfree
product a    i12 ai  i  i 
then the maps  and  are positive



proof the positivity of  is by now a classical result in the theory of free probability with amalgamation over a c  algebra for example see 9 theorem 356
for the positivity of  we have to show that a a  0 for any a  a
any element of a can be written as
a

where sjk  ajk 1 k 6 2 k 6

definition 25 let a be an algebra respectively a algebra b a subalgebra subalgebra of a and d a subalgebra subalgebra of b suppose a is endowed
with the conditional expectations   a  d and   a  d

a ai ii are free with respect to

we will denote by bhi the noncommutative algebra of polynomials in the

the symbol  if i is a family of indices bhi ii i will denote the algebra of
polynomials in the noncommuting variables ii and with coefficients from b
we will identify bhi ii i with the free product with amalgamation over b of

if a is a algebra and b is with the c  algebra bhi will also be considered
with a algebra structure by taking     if x is a selfadjoint element from a
we define the conditional expectations
x  x  bhi  b

given by x f   f x and x f   f x  for any f   bhi
corollary 26 suppose that a is a algebra and x and y are cfree selfadjoint
elements of a such that the maps x  x and y  y are positive then the
maps xy and xy are also positive
proof the positivity of xy is an immediate consequence of the fact that x
and y are free with amalgamation over b with respect to  it remains to prove
the positivity of xy 
since the maps x  bh1 i  b and y  bh2 i  b are positive from
theorem 23 so is
x x y  y  bh1 i b bh2 i  bh1  2 i  b

remark also that

iz  bhi  f  7 f x  y   bh1 i b bh2 i

is a positive bfunctional
the conclusion follows from the fact that the cfreeness of x and y is equivalent
to
xy  x x y  y   ixy 

3 multilinear function series and the c rtransform
let a be a algebra containing the c  algebra b endowed with a conditional

generally fails to keep track of all the possible moments of x a solution to
this inconvenience was proposed in 3 namely the momentgenerating multilinear function series of x before defining this notion we will briefly recall the
construction and several results on multilinear function series

where the second summation is done over all ktuples p1      pk  1 such that
p1      pk  n and qj  p1      pj1 
one can work with elements of m ulb as if they were formal power series the
relevant properties are described in 3 proposition 23 and proposition 26 as in
3 we use 1 respectively i to denote the identity elements of m ulb relative
to multiplication respectively composition in other words 1  1 0 0     and
i  0 idb  0 0     we will also use the fact that an element   m ulb has
an inverse with respect to formal composition denoted h1i  if and only if  has
the form 0 1  2      with 1 an invertible element of l1 b
definition 31 with the above notation the momentgenerating multilinear function series mx of x is the element of m ulb such that

given an element   m ulb the multilinear function series r is defined

in the case of scalar cfree probability an analogue of the voiculescus rtransform is developed in 2 in order to avoid confusions we will denote it
by c r
the c rtransform has the property that it linearizes the cfree convolution of
pairs of compactly supported measures in particular if x and y are cfree
elements from some algebra a then
c

rxy  c rx  c ry 

if the algebra a is endowed with the cvalued states   and x is a selfadjoint
element of a then see 2 the coefficients c rm m  0 of c rx are defined by

the following analytical description of c r also shows that it is unique and

before proving the theorem remark that the righthand side of 33 is welldefined and unique since 1  i is invertible with respect to the formal multiplication i  ii is invertible with respect to formal composition and its inverse has
0 as first component see 3 we will need the following auxiliary result
lemma 34 let  be an element of m ulb and i the identity element with
respect to formal composition i  0 idb  0 0

remark 35 up to a shift in the coefficients equation 33 is similar to the result
in the case b  c from 2 theorem 51
let x be a selfadjoint element of a if a is endowed with two bvalued conditional expectations   the element x will have two momentgenerating multilinear function series one with respect to  that we will denote by mx  and one
with respect to  denoted mx  for brevity we will use the notation c rx for the
multilinear function series c rmx mx

the pair of conditional expectations   then

the blocks bp and bq of  are said to be crossing if there exist i  j  k  l
in hni such that i k  bp and j l  bq 
the partition  is said to be noncrossing if all pairs of distinct blocks of 
are not crossing we will denote by n c2 n the set of all noncrossing partitions
of hni whose blocks contain exactly 2 elements and by n cs n the set of all
noncrossing partitions of hni whose blocks contain at most s elements
let now  be a noncrossing partition of hni and b and c be two blocks of
 we say that b is interior to c if there exist two indices i  j in hni such
that i j  c and b  i  1     j  1 the block b is said to be outer if it is
not interior to any other block of  in a noncrossing partition of hni the block
containing 1 is always outer
consider now an element x of a let  be a partition from n c2 n  1 n 
odd and b1  1 k be the block of  containing 1 we define by recurrence

b by its unitisation consider the symbol  the algebra bhi of polynomials
in  with coefficients from b as defined before and consider also the linear space
bb generated by the set b1 b2  b1  b2  b with the bbimodule structure
given by
a1 b1 b2 a2  a1 b1 b2 a2 
for all a1  a2  b1  b2  b
lemma 43 for any positive bsesquilinear pairing h i on bb there exists a
positive conditional expectation   bhi  b such that for any b1  b2  b one
has that
b1 b2   hb1  b2 i
proof without loss of generality we can suppose that b is unital otherwise we
can replace b by its unitization
consider the full fock bimodule over bb

with the pairing given by

note that the blinear operators a1  a2  f hi  f hi described by the
relations
a1 b 
a1 a1       an b 

a2 b 
a2 a1       an b

h a1 ia2       an b

are selfadjoint to each other in the sense that
ha1 e1  e2 i  he1  a2 e2 i

for any e1  e2  f hi therefore s  a1  a2 is selfadjoint
moreover for any a b  b
h1 sa bs1i 




has1 bs1i
haa1  a2 1 ba1  a2 1i

and the conclusion follows by setting p  h1 ps1i for all p  bhi



corollary 44 the maps  and  from theorem 41 are positive if and only if
for any b  b one has that xb bx  0 and xb bx  0

multilinear function series cfree probability with amalgamation 15

proof one implication is trivial since if  and  are positive then
xb bx  xb bx  bx bx  0
and
xb bx  xb bx  bx bx  0
suppose now that xb bx  0 and xb bx  0 for all b  b we will
use the same argument as in 9 and 8
consider the set of selfadjoint symbols i i1  on each bbimodule bi b we
have the positive bsesquilinear pairings h i and h i determined by
hai  bi i
hai  bi i

as shown in lemma 43 the above bsesquilinear pairings determine positive
conditional expectations 1  i  ai  b where ai  bhi i be the algebras of
polynomials in  with coefficients from b i  1
for   bhi  b a conditional expectation and   0 note with d  the
dilation with  of   ie
d  b1     bn   n1  b1     bn 
remark that if  is positive then d  is also positive
with the notations above consider as in definition 21 the conditionally free
product a    ii ai  i  i  the elements i i1 are conditionally free
in a so theorem 41 implies that



 


lim  1 
n  d 1 1 n

lim  1

we have that i1 i  0 since it is the free product of states see for example
9 hence the positivity of 
also theorem 24 and corollary 26 imply that 1 n  0 therefore   0
