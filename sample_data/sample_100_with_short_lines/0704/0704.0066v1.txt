abstract
possible algebraic commutation relations in the lagrangian quantum theory of free
scalar spinor and vector fields are considered from mathematical viewpoint as sources of
these relations are employed the heisenberg equationsrelations for the dynamical variables
and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables with
respect to some class of lagrangians the paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all heisenberg
equations the simultaneous fulfillment of the heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible this problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical
variables similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case that
implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations the introduction of
the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations
in particular the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal
ordering as a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an
effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values the standard bilinear commutation
relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and
do not contradict to the existing data

introduction

the main subject of this paper is an analysis of possible algebraic commutation relations
in the lagrangian quantum theory1 of free fields these relations are considered only from
mathematical viewpoint and physical consequence of them like the statistics of manyparticle systems are not investigated
the canonical quantization method finds its origin in the classical hamiltonian mechanics 9 10 and naturally leads to the canonical anticommutation relations 3 11 12 these
relations can be obtained from different assumptions see eg 1 1315 and are one of the
basic corner stones of the presentday quantum field theory
theoretically there are possible also noncanonical commutation relations the best
known example of them being the socalled paracommutation relations 1618 but however
it seems no one of the presently known particlesfields obeys them
in the present work is shown how different classes of commutation relations understood
in a broad sense as algebraic connections between creation andor annihilation operators
arise from the lagrangian formalism when applied to three types of lagrangians describing
free scalar spinor and vector fields their origin is twofold one one hand a requirement for
uniqueness of the dynamical variables that can be calculated from lagrangians leading to
identical eulerlagrange equation entails a number of specific commutation relations on
another hand any one of the socalled heisenberg relationsequations 3 11 implies corresponding commutation relations for example the paracommutation relations arise from
the heisenberg equations regarding the momentum operator when charge symmetric lagrangian is employed2 the combination of the both methods leads to strong generally
incompatible restrictions on the admissible types of commutation relations
the introduction of the concept of vacuum combined with the mentioned uniqueness of
the operators of the dynamical variables changes the situation and requires a redefinition
of these operators in a way similar to the one known as the normal ordering 1 3 11 12
which is its special case some natural assumptions reduce the former to the letter one in
particular in that way are excluded the paracommutation relations however this does not
reduce the possible commutation relations to the canonical ones further the requirement
to be available an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean expectation values to
which reduce all predictable results in the theory puts new restriction whose only realistic
solution at the time being seems to be the standard canonical anticommutation relations
the layout of the work is as follows
sect 2 gives an idea of the momentum picture of motion and discusses the relations
between the creation and annihilation operators in it and in heisenberg picture in sect 3
are reviewed some basic results from 1315 part of which can be found also in papers like 1
3 11 12 in particular the explicit expression of the dynamical variables via the creation
1

in this paper we considered only the lagrangian canonical quantum field theory in which the quantum
fields are represented as operators called field operators acting on some hilbert space which in general
is unknown if interacting fields are studied these operators are supposed to satisfy some equations of
motion from them are constructed conserved quantities satisfying conservation laws etc from the viewpoint
of presentday quantum field theory this approach is only a preliminary stage for more or less rigorous
formulation of the theory in which the fields are represented via operatorvalued distributions a fact required
even for description of free fields moreover in nonperturbative directions like constructive and conformal
field theories the main objects are the vacuum mean expectation values of the fields and from these are
reconstructed the hilbert space of states and the acting on it fields regardless of these facts the lagrangian
canonical quantum field theory is an inherent component of the most of the ways of presentation of quantum
field theory adopted explicitly or implicitly in books like 18 besides the lagrangian approach is a source
of many ideas for other directions of research like the axiomatic quantum field theory 3 7 8
2
ordinary 3 11 the commutation relations are postulated and the validity of the heisenberg relations is
then verified we follow the opposite method by postulating the heisenberg equations and then looking for
commutation relations that are compatible with them

and annihilation operators are presented without assuming some commutation relations or
normal ordering and it is pointed to the existence of a family of such variables for a given
system of eulerlagrange equations for free fields the last fact is analyzed in sect 4
where a number of its consequences having a sense of commutation relations are drawn
the heisenberg relations and the commutation relations between the dynamical variables
are reviewed and analyzed in sect 5 it is pointed that the letter should be consequences
from the former ones arguments are presented that the heisenberg equation concerning
the angular momentum operator should be split into two independent ones representing its
orbital and spin parts respectively
sect 6 contains a method for assigning commutation relations to the heisenberg equations it is shown that the heisenberg equation involving the orbital part of the angular
momentum gives rise to a differential not algebraic commutation relation and the one concerning the spin part of the angular momentum implies a complicated integrodifferential
connections between the creation and annihilation operators special attention is paid to
the paracommutation relations whose particular kind are the ordinary ones which ensure
the validity of the heisenberg equations concerning the momentum operator partially is
analyzed the problem for compatibility of the different types of commutation relations derived it is proved that some generalization of the paracommutation relations ensures the
fulfillment of all of the heisenberg relations
sect 7 is devoted to consequences from the commutation relations derived in sect 6
under the conditions for uniqueness of the dynamical variables presented in sect 4 generally these requirements are incompatible with the commutation relations to overcome
the problem it is proposed a redefinition of the dynamical variables via a method similar to
and generalizing the normal ordering this of course entails changes in the commutation
relations the new versions of which happen to be compatible with the uniqueness conditions
and ensure the validity of the heisenberg relations
the concept of the vacuum is introduced in sect 8 it reduces practically the redefinition of the operators of the dynamical variables to the one obtained via the normal ordering
procedure in the ordinary quantum field theory but without additional suppositions does
not reduce the commutation relations to the standard bilinear ones as a last step in specifying the commutation relations as much as possible we introduce the requirement the theory
to supply an effective way for calculating vacuum mean values of antinormally ordered
products of creation and annihilation operators to which are reduced all predictable results
in particular the mean values of the dynamical variables the standard bilinear commutation
relation seems to be the only ones know at present that survive that last condition however
their uniqueness in this respect is not investigated
sect 9 deals with the same problems as described above but for systems containing at
least two different quantum fields the main obstacle is the establishment of commutation
relations between creationannihilation operators concerning different fields argument is
presented that they should contain commutators or anticommutators of these operators
the major of corresponding commutation relations are explicitly written and the results
obtained turn to be similar to the ones just described only in multifield version
section 10 closes the paper by summarizing its main results
the books 13 will be used as standard reference works on quantum field theory of
course this is more or less a random selection between the great number of textbooks and
papers on the theme to which the reader is referred for more details or other points of view
for this end eg 4 12 19 or the literature cited in 14 12 19 may be helpful

object the einsteins summation convention over indices repeated on different levels is
assumed over the whole range of their values
at last we ought to give an explanation why this work appears under the general title
lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture when in it all considerations are
done in fact in heisenberg picture with possible but not necessary usage of the creation and
annihilation operators in momentum picture first of all we essentially employ the obtained
in 1315 expressions for the dynamical variables in momentum picture for three types of
lagrangians the corresponding operators in heisenberg picture which in fact is used in this
paper can be obtained via a direct calculation as it is partially done in eg 1 for one of
the mentioned types of lagrangians the important point here is that in heisenberg picture
it suffice to be used only the standard lagrangian formalism while in momentum picture one
has to suppose the commutativity between the components of the momentum operator and
the validity of the heisenberg relations for it see below equations 26 and 27 since for
the analysis of the commutation relations we intend to do the fulfillment of these relations is
not necessary they are subsidiary restrictions on the lagrangian formalism the heisenberg
picture of motion is the natural one that has to be used for this reason the expression for the
dynamical variables obtained in 1315 will be used simply as their heisenberg counterparts
but expressed via the creation and annihilation operators in momentum picture the only
real advantage one gets in this way is the more natural structure of the orbital angular
momentum operator as the commutation relations considered below are algebraic ones it
is inessential in what picture of motion they are written or investigated

the momentum picture

since the momentum picture of motion will be used only partially in this work below is
presented only its definition and the connection between the creationannihilation operators
in it and in heisenberg picture details concerning the momentum picture can be found
in 20 21 and in the corresponding sections devoted to it in 1315
let us consider a system of quantum fields represented in heisenberg picture of motion
by field operators i x  f  f i  1     n  n acting on the systems hilbert space
f of states and depending on a point x in minkowski spacetime m  here and henceforth
all quantities in heisenberg picture will be marked by a tilde wave   over their kernel
symbols let p denotes the systems canonical momentum vectorial operator defined via
the energymomentum tensorial operator t  of the system viz
z

t0 x d3 x
21
p

x0 const

since this operator is hermitian p  p  the operator

where x0  m is arbitrarily fixed and x  m 3 is unitary ie u  x0  x   ux x0  
u 1 x x0    ux x0 1 and via the formulae
x 7 x x  ux x0  x 

23

x 7 ax  ux x0    x  u

realizes the transition to the momentum picture here x is a state vector in systems hilbert
space of states f and x  f  f is observable or not operatorvalued function of x  m
which in particular can be polynomial or convergent power series in the field operators
i x respectively x x and ax are the corresponding quantities in momentum picture
in particular the field operators transform as
i x 7 i x  ux x0   i x  u 1 x x0 

25

notice in 22 the multiplier x  x0  is regarded as a real parameter in which p is
linear generally x x and ax depend also on the point x0 and to be quite correct one
should write x x x0  and ax x0  for x x and ax respectively however in the most
situations in the present work this dependence is not essential or in fact is not presented
at all for that reason we shall not indicate it explicitly
the momentum picture is most suitable in quantum field theories in which the components p of the momentum operator commute between themselves and satisfy the heisenberg
relationsequations with the field operators ie when p and i x satisfy the relations
 p  p   0

 i x p   i i x

here a b  a  b  b  a  being the composition of mappings sign is the commutatoranticommutator of operators or matrices a and b
however the fulfillment of the relations 26 and 27 will not be supposed in this paper
until sect 6 see also sect 5

let a
s k and as k be the creationannihilation operators of some free particular field
see sect 3 below for a detailed explanation of the notation we have the connections

further it will be assumed 
s k and s k to be defined in heisenberg picture indepen
dently of a
s k and as k by means of the standard lagrangian formalism what concerns

the operators a
s k and as k we shall regard them as defined via 29 this makes them
independent from the momentum picture of motion the fact that the sodefined operators

a
s k and as k coincide with the creationannihilation operators in momentum picture
under the conditions 26 and 27 will be inessential in the almost whole text

the notation x0  for a fixed point in m  should not be confused with the zeroth covariant coordinate
0 x of x which following the convention x   x  is denoted by the same symbol x0  from the context
it will always be clear whether x0 refers to a point in m or to the zeroth covariant coordinate of a point
x  m

on the solutions of the corresponding eulerlagrange equations besides if the opposite is
not stated explicitly no other restrictions like the anticommutation relations are supposed
to be imposed on the above lagrangians and a technical remark for convenience the fields

 
  and  and their charge conjugate    and   respectively are considered as
independent field variables
let l denotes any one of the lagrangians 31 and l resp l  the corresponding
to it lagrangian given via 33 resp 34 physically the difference between l and l is
that the particles for l are antiparticles for l and vice versa both of the lagrangians l
and l are not charge symmetric ie the arising from them theories are not invariant under
the change particleantiparticle or in mathematical terms under some of the changes

 
           unless some additional hypotheses are made contrary to
this the lagrangian l is charge symmetric and consequently the formalism on its base
is invariant under the change particleantiparticle4

where          for respectively scalar spinor and vector field
since the creation and annihilation operators are defined only on the base of eulerlagrange equations 1 3 1115 we can assert that these operators are identical for the la
grangians l  l and l  we shall denote these operators by a
s k and as k with the

convention
that a
s k resp as k creates a particle resp antiparticle with 4momenp
tum  m2 c2  k2  k polarization s see below and charge q resp q6 and as  k
resp a
s k annihilatesdestroys such a particle resp antiparticle here and henceforth
3
k  r is interpreted as antiparticles 3momentum and the values of the polarization index
s depend on the field considered s  1 for a scalar field s  1 or s  1 2 for respectively
massless m  0 or massive m 6 0 spinor field and s  1 2 3 for a vector field7 since
massless vector fields modes with s  3 may enter only in the spin and orbital angular momenta operators 15 we for convenience shall assume that the polarization indices s t   
take the values from 1 to 2j  1  0m 1  0j  where j  0 12  1 is the spin for scalar spinor
and vector field respectively and 0m  1 for m  0 and 0m  0 for m 6 08 if the value
s  3 is important when j  1 and m  0 it will be commentedconsidered separately of
course the creation and annihilation operators are different for different fields one should
write eg j a
k for a
s k but we shall not use such a complicated notation and will
s
assume the dependence on j to be an implicit one

besides under the same assumptions the lagrangian l does not admit quantization via anticommutators commutators for integer halfinteger spin field while l and l do not make difference between
integer and halfinteger spin fields
5
rigorously speaking the eulerlagrange equations for the lagrangian 34b are identities like 0  0 
see 22 however bellow we shall handle this exceptional case as pointed in 14
6
for a neutral field we put q  0
7
for convenience in 14 we have set s  0 if m  0 and s  1 2 if m 6 0 for a spinor field for a massless
vector field one may set s  1 2 thus eliminating the unphysical value s  3 for m  0  see 1 11 15



in 13 for a scalar field the notation 
0 k and 0 k is used for a1 k and a1 k respectively
8
in this way the case j s m  1 3 0 is excluded from further considerations if j m  1 0 and
q  0 the case considered further in this work corresponds to an electromagnetic field in coulomb gauge
as the modes with s  3 are excluded 15 however if the case j s m  1 3 0 is important for some
reasons the reader can easily obtain the corresponding results by applying the ones from 15

the following settings will be frequently used throughout this chapter



0 for scalar field
1 for q  0 neutral hermitian field
j  12 for spinor field
 

0 for q 6 0 charged nonhermitian field

a technical remark must be make at this point the equations 39312 were derived in 1315 under some additional conditions represented by equations 26 and 27
which are considered bellow in sect 5 and ensure the effectiveness of the momentum picture of motion 21 used in 1315 however as it is partially proved eg in 1 when the
quantities 39312 are expressed via the heisenberg creation and annihilation operators
see 29 they remain valid up to a phase factor and without making the mentioned
assumptions ie these assumptions are needless when one works entirely in heisenberg picture for this reason we shall consider 39312 as pure consequence of the lagrangian
formalism
 and l       are denoted
we should emphasize in 311 and 312 with s


the spin and orbital respectively operators for l  which are the spacetimeindependent
parts of the spin and orbital respectively angular momentum operators 14 23 if the last


operators are denoted by s  and l  the total angular momentum operator of a system
with lagrangian l is 23





m  l  s   l  s





    

315



 and hence l

and s   s
  l  iff s  is a conserved operator or equivalently iff
the systems canonical energymomentum tensor is symmetric11
going ahead see sect 6 we would like to note that the expressions 39c and consequently the lagrangian l are the base from which the paracommutation relations were
first derived 16
and a last remark above we have expressed the dynamical variables in heisenberg picture
via the creation and annihilation operators in momentum picture if one works entirely in
heisenberg picture the operators 29 representing the creation and annihilation operators
in heisenberg picture should be used besides by virtue of the equations

some of the relations concerning as  k eg the eulerlagrange and heisenberg equations
are consequences of the similar ones regarding a
s k in view of 29 we shall consider 39
312 as obtained form the corresponding expressions in heisenberg picture by making the



replacements 
s k 7 as k and s k 7 as k so 39312 will have up to a
phase factor a sense of dynamical variables in heisenberg picture expressed via the creationannihilation operators in momentum picture
10

for the explicit form of these functions see 1315 see also equation 657 below
in 1423 the spin and orbital operators are labeled with an additional left superscript  which for brevity


is omitted in the present work as in it only these operators not s  and l  will be considered notice


the operators s  and l are generally timedependent while the orbital and spin ones are conserved as
a result of which the total angular momentum is a conserved operator too 14 23

on the uniqueness of the dynamical variables

let d  p  q s  l denotes some dynamical variable viz the momentum charge
spin or orbital operator of a system with lagrangian l since the eulerlagrange equations
for the lagrangians l  l and l coincide see 36 we can assert that any field satisfying
these equations
admits at least three classes of conserved operators viz d   d  and d  

1


2 d  d  moreover it can be proved that the eulerlagrange equations for the lagrangian
l   l   l

   6 0

41

do not depend on    c and coincide with 36 therefore there exists a two parameter
family of conserved dynamical variables for these equations given via
d   d    d 

   6 0

42

evidently l  l 1  1 and d   d 1  1  since the eulerlagrange equations 36 are linear
2 2
2 2
and homogeneous in the cases considered we can without a lost of generality restrict the
parameters    c to such that
    1
43
which can be achieved by an appropriate renormalization by a factor 12  of the field
operators thus any field satisfying the eulerlagrange equations 36 admits the family
d      1 of conserved operators obviously this conclusion is valid if in 41 we
replace the particular lagrangians l and l see 31 and 33 with any two lagrangians
of one and the same field variables which lead to identical eulerlagrange equations however the essential point in our case is that l and l do not differ only by a full divergence
as a result of which the operators d are different for different pairs       112
since one expects a physical system to possess uniquely defined dynamical characteristics
eg energy and total angular momentum and the eulerlagrange equations are considered
in the framework of lagrangian formalism as the ones governing the spacetime evolution of
the system considered the problem arises when the dynamical operators d    1 are
independent of the particular choice of  and  ie of the initial lagrangian one starts off
simple calculation show that the operators 42 under the condition 43 are independent
of the particular values of the parameters  and  if and only if
d   d  

44

some consequences of the conditions 44 will be considered below as well as possible ways
for satisfying these restrictions on the lagrangian formalism
combining 39312 with 44 for respectively d  p  q s  l  we see that a
free scalar spinor or vector field has a uniquely defined dynamical variables if and only if

in 46 is retained the constant factor q as in the neutral case it is equal to zero and
consequently the equation 46 reduces to identity
since the eulerlagrange equations do not impose some restrictions on the creation and
annihilation operators the equations 4548 can be regarded as subsidiary conditions
on the lagrangian formalism and can serve as equations for partial determination of the
creation and annihilation operators the system of integral equations 4548 is quite
complicated and we are not going to investigate it in the general case below we shall
restrict ourselves to analysis of only those solutions of 4548 if any for which the
integrands in 4548 vanish this means that we shall replace the system of integral
equations 4548 with respect to creation and annihilation operators with the following

1j  in 412 and 413 notice by virtue of 314 the equations 412 and 413 are
identically valid for j  0 ie for scalar fields since all polarization indices enter in 45
and 46 on equal footing we do not sum over s in 49411 but in 412 and 413
we have retain the summation sign as the modes with definite polarization cannot be singled
out in the general case one may obtain weaker versions of 49413 by summing in them
over the polarization indices but we shall not consider these conditions below regardless of
the fact that they also ensure uniqueness of the dynamical variables
at first consider the equations 49411 since for a neutral field q  0 we have

as k  a
s k which physically means coincidence of fields particles and antiparticles
the equations 49411 hold identically in this case

excluding some special cases eg neutral scalar field q  0 and j  0 the equations 415 and 421 are unacceptable from many viewpoints the main of them is that they
are incompatible with the ordinary anticommutation relations see eg eg 1 11 12 18
or sect 6 in particular equations 613 bellow for example 421 means that the acts of
creation and annihilation of antiparticles with identical characteristics should be mutually
independent which contradicts to the existing theory and experimental data
now we shall try another way for achieving uniqueness of the dynamical variables for
free fields since in 49413 naturally appear anticommutators between creation and
annihilation operators and these anticommutators vanish under the standard normal ordering 1111218 one may suppose that the normally ordered expressions of the dynamical
variables may coincide let us analyze this method
recall 1 3 11 12 the normal ordering operator n for free field theory is a linear
operator on the operator space of the system considered such that to a product composition
c1      cn of n  n creation andor annihilation operators c1     cn it assigns the operator
1f c1     cn  here 1      n  is a permutation of 1     n all creation operators
stand to the left of all annihilation ones the relative order between the creationannihilation
operators is preserved and f is equal to the number of transpositions among the fermion
operators j  12  needed to be achieved the justdescribed order normal order of the
operators c1      cn in c1     cn 13 in particular this means that




n a
s k  at p  as k  at p




n a
s k  at p  at p  as k

and consequently we have


n as  k a
t p  0




n as  k  a
t p  as k  at p



n as  k  a
t p  at p  as k


n a
s k at p  0

422

423

due to   12j  1 see 37 in fact below only the equalities 422 and 423
not the general definition of a normal product will be applied
applying the normal ordering operator to 49  410  417 and 418 we in view
of 423 get the identity 0  0 which means that the conditions 49 410 412
and 413 are identically satisfied after normal ordering this is confirmed by the application
of n to 39 and 310 which results respectively in see 422

we have slightly modified the definition given in 1 3 11 12 because no anticommutation relations are
presented in our exposition till the moment in this paper we do not concern the problem for elimination of

the unphysical operators a
3 k and a3 k from the spin and orbital momentum operators when j  1 for
details see 15 where it is proved that for an electromagnetic field j  1 and q  0 one way to achieve this

is by adding to the number f above the number of transpositions between a

therefore the normal ordering ensures the uniqueness of the momentum and charge operators

as a consequence of these equalities the action of n on the lhs of 411 vanishes combining this result with the mentioned fact that the normal ordering converts 412 and 413
into identities we see that the normal ordering procedure ensures also uniqueness of the spin
and orbital operators if we redefine them respectively as

heisenberg relations

the conserved operators like momentum and charge operators are often identified with the
generators of the corresponding transformations under which the action operator is invariant 1 3 11 12 this leads to a number of commutation relations between the components
of these operators and between them and the field operators the relations of the letter
set are knownreferred as the heisenberg relations or equations both kinds of commutation relations are from pure geometric origin and consequently are completely external to
the lagrangian formalism one of the reasons being that the mentioned identification is in

general unacceptable and may be carried out only on some subset of the systems hilbert
space of states 23 24 therefore their validity in a pure lagrangian theory is questionable
and should be verified 11 however the considered relations are weaker conditions than
the identification of the corresponding operators and there are strong evidences that these
relations should be valid in a realistic quantum field theory 111 eg the commutativity between the momentum and charge operators see below 518 expresses the experimental fact
that the 4momentum and charge of any system are simultaneously measurable quantities
it is known 1 11 in a pure lagrangian approach the field equations which are usually
identified with the eulerlagrange 14 are the only restrictions on the field operators besides
these equations do not determine uniquely the field operators and the letter can be expressed
through the creation and annihilation operators since the last operators are left completely
arbitrary by a pure lagrangian formalism one is free to impose on them any system of
compatible restrictions the best known examples of this kind are the famous canonical
anticommutation relations and their generalization the socalled paracommutation relations 16 18 in general the problem for compatibility of such subsidiary to the lagrangian
formalism system of restrictions with for instance the heisenberg relations is open and
requires particular investigation 11 for example even the canonical anticommutation
relations for electromagnetic field in coulomb gauge are incompatible with the heisenberg
equation involving the total angular momentum operator unless the gauge symmetry of this
field is taken into account 11  84 however the paracommutation relations are by construction compatible with the heisenberg relations regarding momentum operator see 16
or below subsect 61 the ordinary approach is to be imposed a system of equations on
the creation and annihilation operators and then to be checked its compatibility with eg
the heisenberg relations in the next sections we shall investigate the opposite situation
assuming the validity of some of the heisenberg equations the possible restrictions on
the creation and annihilation operators will be explored for this purpose below we briefly
review the heisenberg relations and other ones related to them
consider a system of quantum fields i x i  1     n  n where i x denote the
components of all fields and their hermitian conjugates and p  q and m be its
momentum charge and total angular momentum operators respectively the heisenberg
relationsequations for these operators are 1 3 11 12

of the field operators under 4rotations if  i  6 0 it is a convention whether to put
 i   1 or  i   1 for a fixed i
we would like to make some comments on 53 since its rhs is a sum of two operators
the first second characterizing the pure orbital spin angular momentum properties of
the system considered the idea arises to split 53 into two independent equations one
involving the orbital angular momentum operator and another concerning the spin angular
momentum operator this is supported by the observation that it seems no process is known
for transforming orbital angular momentum into spin one and vv without destroying the

recall there are lagrangians whose classical eulerlagrange equations are identities however their
correct and rigorous treatment 22 reveals that they entail field equations which are mathematically correct

however as particular calculations demonstrate 51415 neither the spin resp orbital

with m satisfying 53 these operators are not conserved ones such a representation
is in agreement with the equations 312 according to which the operator 57 enters additively in the expressions for the orbital operator15 the physical sense of the operator 57
is that it represents the orbital angular momentum of the system due to its movement as a
whole respectively the operator 58 describes the systems angular momentum as a result
of its internal movement andor structure
since the spin orbital angular momentum is associated with the structure movement
of a system in the operator 58 are mixed the spin and orbital angular momenta these
quantities can be separated completely via the following representations of the operators

from 513 and 512 is clear that the operators mor
 and m so defined are conserved
contrary to 57 and 58 and do not depend on the validity of the heisenberg relations 51 contrary to expressions 511 in momentum picture
the problem for whether the operators 512 and 513 satisfy the equations 54
and 55 respectively will be considered in sect 6
there is an essential difference between 54 and 55 the equation 55 depends on
i
the particular properties of the operators i x under 4rotations via the coefficients ii
see 525 below while 54 does not depend on them this is explicitly reflected in 511
and 512 the former set of equations is valid independently of the geometrical nature of the
fields considered while the latter one depends on it via the spin polarization functions
ss 
ss 

k and l
k similar remark concerns 53 on one hand and 51 and 52 on
another hand the particular form of 53 essentially depends on the geometric properties
of i x under 4rotations the other equations being independent of them
it should also be noted the relation 53 does not hold for a canonically quantized
electromagnetic field in coulomb gauge unless some additional terms it its rhs reflecting
the gauge symmetry of the field are taken into account 11  84
as it was said above the relations 5153 are from pure geometrical origin however
the last discussion concerning 5458 reveals that the terms in braces in 53 should be
connected with the momentum operator in the pure lagrangian approach more precisely
on the background of equations 311a312c the heisenberg relation 53 should be
replaced with
x 
i
ii
514
i x
 i x m   x  i x p   x  i x p   i
j

which is equivalent to 53 if 51 is true an advantage of the last equation is that it is valid
in any picture of motion in the same form while 53 holds only in heisenberg picture16
obviously 514 is equivalent to 55 with msp
 defined by 58
the other kind of geometric relations mentioned at the beginning of this section are
connected with the basic relations defining the lie algebra of the poincar group 7 pp 143
147 8 sect 71 they require the fulfillment of the following equations between the components p of the momentum and m of the angular momentum operators 3 5 7 8
 p  p   0

 m  p   i p   p 

 m  m   i  m   m   m   m 

515
516
517

we would like to pay attention to the minus sign in the multiplier i in 516 and 517
with respect to the above references where i stands instead of i in these equations when
16

in other pictures of motion generally additional terms in the rhs of 53 will appear ie the functional
form of the rhs of 53 is not invariant under changes of the picture of motion contrary to 514

a representation of the lie algebra of the poincar group is considered this difference in the
sign is insignificant as it can be absorbed into the definition of m  however the change
of the sign of the angular momentum operator m 7  m  will result in the change
i 7 i in the rhs of 53 this means that equations 515 516 and 53 when
considered together require a suitable choice of the signs of the multiplier i in their right
hand sides as these signs change simultaneously when m is replaced with  m  since
equations 53 516 and 517 hold when m is defined according to the noethers
theorem and the ordinary anticommutation relations are valid 1315 we accept these
equations in the way they are written above
to the relations 515517 should be added the equations 3 p 78
 q p   0

 q m   0

518
519

which complete the algebra of observables and express respectively the translational and
rotational invariance of the charge operator q physically they mean that the charge and
momentum or the charge and angular momentum are simultaneously measurable quantities
since the spin properties of a system are generally independent of its charge or momentum
one may also expect the validity of the relations17
 s  p   0
 s  q  0

520
521

but as the spin describes in a sense some of the rotational properties of the system
equality like  s  l   0 is not likely to hold indeed the considerations in 1315 reveal
that 520 and 521 but not the last equation are true in the framework of the lagrangian
formalism with added to it standard anticommutation relations notice if 520 and 521
hold then respectively 516 and 519 are equivalent to
 l  p   i p   p 
 q l   0

522
523

it is intuitively clear not all of the commutation relations 5153 and 515521
are independent if d denotes some of the operators p  q m  s or l and the
commutators  i x d  i  1     n  are known then in principle one can calculate the
commutators  1 x     n x d  where  1 x     n x is for example any
functionfunctional bilinear in 1 x     n x to prove this fact one should apply the
identity a b  c  a b  c  b  a c a suitable number of times in particular if
d1 and d2 denote any two distinct operators of the dynamical variables and  i x d1 
is known then the commutator  d1  d2  can be calculated explicitly for this reason we
can expect that
i equation 51 implies 515 516 518 520 and 522
ii equation 52 implies 518 519 521 and 523
iii equation 53 implies 516 517 and 519
besides 53 may possibly entail equations like 517 with s or l for m  with an exception
of m in the lhs ie

 s  m   i  s   s   s   s
524

 l  m   i  l   l   l   l
17

recall s resp l  is the conserved spin resp orbital operator not the generally nonconserved
spin resp orbital angular momentum operator 23

where    2i       with   being the dirac matrices 1 25 is proved in 1315
respectively besides in loc cit is proved that equations 524 hold for scalar and vector
fields but not for a spinor field18
thus we see that the heisenberg relations 5153 are stronger than the commutation
relations 515523 when imposed on the lagrangian formalism as subsidiary restrictions

types of possible commutation relations

in a broad sense by a commutation relation we shall understand any algebraic relation
between the creation and annihilation operators imposed as subsidiary restriction on the
lagrangian formalism in a narrow sense the commutation relations are the equations 613
with   1 written below and satisfied by the bose creation and annihilation operators as
anticommutation relations are known the equations 613 with   1 written below and
satisfied by the fermi creation and annihilation operators the last two types of relations
are often referred as the bilinear commutation relations 18 theoretically are possible also
trilinear commutation relations an example being the paracommutation relations 16 18
represented below by equations 618 or 620
generally said the commutation relations should be postulated alternatively they
could be derived from equivalent to them different assumptions added to the lagrangian
formalism the purpose of this section is to be explored possible classes of commutation
relations which follow from some natural restrictions on the lagrangian formalism that are
consequences from the considerations in the previous sections special attention will be paid
on some consequences of the charge symmetric lagrangians as the free fields possess such a
symmetry 1 3 11 12
as pointed in sect 3 the eulerlagrange equations for the lagrangians l  l and l
coincide and in quantum field theory the role of these equations is to be singled out the
independent degrees of freedom of the fields in the form of creation and annihilation operators




a
s k and as k which are identical for l  l and l  further specialization of these
operators is provided by the commutation relations in broad sense which play a role of field
equations in this situation with respect to the mentioned operators
before proceeding on we would like to simplify our notation as a spin variable s say is
always coupled with a 3momentum one k say we shall use the letters l m and n to denote
pairs like l  s k m  t p and n  r q equipped with this convention we shall write



eg
as rk we set lm  st 3 k  p and a summation sign like
p al for as k and al forp
d3 k where the range of the polarization variable s will
l should be understood as
s
be clear from the context see eg 39312

the problem for the validity of assertions iiii or equations 524 in the general case of arbitrary
fields lagrangians is not a subject of the present work

made in sect 5 that the assertion i before 524 holds for the fields investigated here
below we shall study only those solutions of 6264 for which the integrands in them
vanish ie we shall replace the systems of integral equations 6264 with the following
systems of algebraic equations see the above convention on the indices l and m and do not
sum over indices repeated on one and the same level

impose on the creation and annihilation operators

provide a solution of any one of the equations 610612 in a sense that due to 37
and 68 with    any set of operators satisfying 613 converts 610612 into
identities
besides this conclusion remains valid also if the normal ordering is taken into account






ie if in this particular case the changes am  a
m 7 am  am and am  am 7 am  am
are made in 610612
now we shall demonstrate how the trilinear relations 612 lead to the paracommutation relations equations 612 can be split into different kinds of trilinear commutation
relations into infinitely many ways for example the system of equations
    
al  am  am    1   lm a
614a
l 0
    
al  am  am    1   lm a
614b
l 0
    
614c
al  am  am    1   lm al   0
    
614d
al  am  am    1   lm al   0

provides an evident solution of 612 however it is a simple algebra to be seen that
these relations are incompatible with the standard anticommutation relations 613 and

in this sense are not suitable as subsidiary restrictions on the lagrangian formalism for
our purpose the equations
    
al  am  am    2lm a
615a
l 0
    

al  am  am    2 lm al  0
615b
    

al  am  am    2 lm al  0
615c
    
al  am  am    2lm a
615d
l 0

and their hermitian conjugate provide a solution of 612 which is compatible with 613
ie if 613 hold the equations 615 are converted into identities
the idea of the paraquantization is in the following generalization of 615
    
al  am  an    2ln a
616a
m 0
    
al  am  an    2 ln a
616b
m 0
    

al  am  an    2 lm an  0
616c
    

al  am  an    2lm an  0
616d

which reduces to 615 for n  m and is a generalization of 613 in a sense that any set
of operators satisfying 613 converts 616 into identities the opposite being generally not
valid19
suppose that the field considered consists of a single sort of particles eg electrons or
photons created by bl  al and annihilated by bl  al   then the equation hermitian
conjugated to 615a reads
bl  bm  bm    2lm bm 
617

this is the main relation from which the paper 16 starts the basic paracommutation
relations are 1618 26
bl  bm  bn    2lm bn

618a

bl  bm  bn    0

618b

the first of them is a generalization stronger version of 617 by replacing the second index
m with an arbitrary one say n and the second one is added by hands in the theory as
an additional assumption obviously 618 are a solution of 615 and therefore of 612
in the considered case of a field consisting of only one sort of particles
the equations 615 contain also the relativistic version of the paracommutation relations when the existence of antiparticles must be respected 18 sec 181 indeed noticing


that the fields particles resp antiparticles are created by bl  a
l resp cl  al  and
annihilated by bl  al  resp cl  a
l  from 615 and the hermitian conjugate to them
equations we get
bl  bm  bm    2lm bm

cl  cm  cm    2lm cm

619a

bl  cm  cm  

cl  bm  bm  

619b



2 lm bm



2 lm cm 

generalizing these equations in a way similar to the transition from 617 to 618 we
obtain the relativistic paracommutation relations as cf 616

19

bl  bm  bn    2lm bn

bl  bm  bn    0

620a

cl  cm  cn  
bl  cm  cn  

 2lm cn

cl  cm  cn    0

620b

 2 ln bm

cl  bm  bn    2 ln cm 

620c

other generalizations of 615 are also possible but they do not agree with 613 moreover it is easy
to be proved any other nontrivial arrangement of the indices in 616 is incompatible with 613

the equations 620a resp 620b represent the paracommutation relations for the fields
particles resp antiparticles as independent objects while 620c describe a pure relativistic
effect of some interaction or its absents between fields particles and antiparticles and
fixes the paracommutation relations involving the bl s and cl s as pointed in 18 p 207
where bl is denoted by al and cl by bl  the relations 617 and 620 for   1 resp
  1 are referred as the parabose resp parafermi commutation relations 18 this
terminology is a natural one also with respect to the commutation relations 616 which
will be referred as the paracommutation relations too
as first noted in 16 the equations 613 provide a solution of 620 or 618 in the
nonrelativistic case but the latter equations admit also an infinite number of other solutions
besides by taking hermitian conjugations of some of the equations 618 or 620 and
applying generalized jacobi identities like
a b  c  a c  b  2 b c  a1  0

a b c    b c a    c a b    0
a b  c  b c  a  c a  b  0   1

a b  c d   a b  c  d  a b  d  c1

 6 0

    1

621

 6 0

one can obtain a number of other paracommutation relations for which the reader is referred
to 16 18 26
of course the paracommutation relations 616 in particular 618 and 620 as their
stronger versions do not give the general solution of the trilinear relations 612 for
instance one may replace 612 with the equations

   


al  am  an   a
622a
m  an    21   ln am  0

   


al  am  an   a
622b
m  an    21   lm an  0

and their hermitian conjugate which in terms of the operators bl and cl introduced above
read
bl  bm  bn   cm  cm    21   lm bn

623a

cl  bm  bn   cm  cm    21   lm cn 

623b

and supplement these relations with equations like 618b obviously equations 616 convert 622 into identities and consequently the standard paracommutation relations 620
provide a solution of 623 on the base of 623 or other similar equations that can be
obtained by generalizing the ones in 610612 further research on particular classes of
trilinear commutation relations can be done but however this is not a subject of the present
work
let us now pay attention to the fact that equations 610 611 and 612 are generally
different regardless of existence of some connections between their solutions the cause for
this being that the momentum operators for the lagrangians l  l and l are generally
different unless some additional restrictions are added to the lagrangian formalism see
sect 4 a necessary and sufficient condition for 610612 to be identical is
 


a
l  am  am   am  am    0

624

which certainly is valid if the condition 49  viz


am  a
m   am  am   0

625

ensuring the uniqueness of the momentum operator are holds if one adopts the standard
bilinear commutation relations 613 then 625 and hence 624 is identically valid but
in the framework of eg the paracommutation relations 616 or 620 in other form the
equations 625 should be postulated to ensure uniqueness of the momentum operator and
therefore of the field equations
on the base of 610 or 611 one may invent other types of commutation relations
which will not be investigated in this paper because we shall be interested mainly in the
case when 610 611 and 612 are identical see 624 or more generally when the
dynamical variables are unique in the sense pointed in sect 4

62

restrictions related to the charge operator

the consequences of the heisenberg relations 52 involving the charge operator for a charged
field q 6 0 and hence   0  see 37 will be examined in this subsection in terms of
creation and annihilation operators it is equivalent to 1 1315

using 627629 and 68 with     1 or simply 626 one can easily verify
the validity of the equations
 p  q  0  l  q  0

 s  q  0  m  q  0

630

where the operators p  q s  l and m are calculated from one and the same
initial lagrangian according to 39312 this result confirms the validity of assertion ii
before 524 for the fields considered
following the above considerations concerning the momentum operator we shall now
replace the systems of integral equations 627629 with respectively the following stronger
systems of algebraic equations by equating to zero the integrands in 627629
  




al  am  a
631a
m  am  am   lm al  0
  




631b

633a
m  am    2lm al  0
   




633b
al  am  am   a
 0
m  am    2lm al

these trilinear commutation relations are similar to 610612 and consequently can be
treated in analogous way
by invoking 68 it is a simple algebra to be proved that the standard bilinear commutation relations 613 convert 631633 into identities thus 613 are stronger version
of 631633 and in this sense any type of commutation relations which provide a
solution of 631633 and is compatible with 613 is a suitable candidate for generalizing 613 to illustrate that idea we shall proceed with 633 in a way similar to the
derivation of the paracommutation relations from 612
obviously the equations cf 614 with   0 as now q 6 0



a

634b

and their hermitian conjugate provide a solution of 633 but as a direct calculations shows
they do not agree with the standard anticommutation relations 613 a solution of 633
compatible with 613 is given by the equations 615 with   0 as the field considered is
charged one  see 37 therefore equations 616 with   0 also provide a compatible
with 613 solution of 633 from where immediately follows that the paracommutation
relations 620 with   0 convert 633 into identities to conclude we can say that the
paracommutation relations 620 in particular their special case 613 ensure the simultaneous validity of the heisenberg relations 51 and 52 for free scalar spinor and vector
fields
similarly to 622 one may generalize 633 to

   


al  am  an   a
635a
m  an    2ln am  0

   



al  am  an   am  an    2lm an  0
635b
which equations agree with 613 615 616 and 620 but generally do not agree
with 622 with   0 unless the equations 616 with   0 hold
more generally we can assert that 633 and 612 with   0 hold simultaneously if
and only if 615 with   0 is fulfilled from here again it follows that the paracommutation relations ensure the simultaneous validity of 51 and 52
let us say now some words on the uniqueness problem for the heisenberg equations
involving the charge operator the systems of equations 631633 are identical iff

   

636
al  am  am   a
m  am    0

which in particular is satisfied if the condition


am  a
m   am  am   0

637

ensuring the uniqueness of the charge operator see 410  is valid evidently equations 636 and 624 are compatible iff


    
 
638
al  am  am    0 a
l  am  am    0

which is a weaker form of 415 ensuring simultaneous uniqueness of the momentum and
charge operator

63

restrictions related to the angular momentum operators

it is now turn to be investigated the restrictions on the creation and annihilation operators
that follow from the heisenberg relations 53 concerning the angular momentum operator
they can be obtained by inserting the equations 311 and 312 into 53 as pointed
in sect 5 the resulting equalities however depend not only on the particular lagrangian
employed but also on the geometric nature of the field considered the last dependence
ss m k and lss m k see
being explicitly given via 525 and the polarization functions 

also 314
consider the terms containing derivatives in 53

639

if i k denotes the fourier image of i x ie

with  being a normalization constant then the fourier image of 639 is


 
or
l  i k   k  i k

641

comparing this expression with equations 312 we see that the terms containing derivatives
in 312 should be responsible for the term 639 in 5320 for this reason we shall suppose
that the momentum operator m admits a representation

 and m satisfy the relations 54 and 55 respectively
thus we shall replace 53 with the stronger system of equations 5455 besides
sp
we shall admit that the explicit form of the operators mor
 and m are given via 513
and 512 for the fields investigated in the present work
let us consider at first the orbital heisenberg relations 54 which is independent
of the particular geometrical nature of the fields studied substituting 513 and 640
into 54 using that i k with k2  m2 c2  is a linear combination of 
s k with classical
not operatorvalued functions of k as coefficients 1 1315 and introducing for brevity the

remark instead of 647649 one can write similar equations in which the operator
 n is deleted and the factor  1 or  1  respectively is added on their right
or

hand sides these manipulations correspond to an integration by parts of some of the terms
in 644646
the main difference of the obtained trilinear relations with respect to the previous ones
considered above is that they are partial differential equations of first order
the relations 649 agree with the equations 616 in a sense that if 616 hold
then 649 become identically valid indeed since

for a c 1 function f  the
due to 650 643 and the equality dx
dx f x  x dx


application of the operator  m   n to 616 and subsequent setting n  m
entails 649 in particular this means that the paracommutation relations 620 and
moreover the standard anticommutation relations 613 convert 649 into identities
therefore the orbital heisenberg relations 54 hold for scalar spinor and vector fields
satisfying the bilinear or para commutation relations
it should be noted the paracommutation relations are not the only trilinear commutation
relations that are solutions of 649 as an example we shall present the trilinear relations

which reduce to 614 for n  m do not agree with 613 but convert 649 into identities
see 651 other example is provided by the equations 622 which are compatible with
the paracommutation relations and as a result of 651 convert 649 into identities prima
facie one may suppose that any solution of 612 provides a solution of 649 but this is
not the general case a counterexample is provided by the commutation relations

   


al  am  an   a
653
m  an    21   ln am  0


which reduce to 612 for n  m satisfy 649 with 
l for l  and do not satisfy 649


with l for l see 651 and cf 622


from 513 follows that the operator mor
 is independent of the lagrangian l  l or

l one starts off if and only if see 411

this condition ensures the coincidence of the systems of equations 647 648 and 649

systems is expressed by the weaker equations

for the difference of all previously considered systems of integral equations like 62
64 627629 and 644646 the systems 658660 cannot be replaced by ones
consisting of algebraic or differential equations the cause for this state of affairs is that
in 658660 enter polarization modes with arbitrary s and s and generally one cannot
diagonalize the integrands with respect to s and s  moreover for a vector field the modes
with s  s are not presented at all see 314 that is why no commutation relations can
be extracted from 658660 unless further assumptions are made without going into
details below we shall sketch the proof of the assertion that the commutation relations 616
convert 660 into identities for massive spinor and vector fields21 in particular this entails
that the paracommutation and the bilinear commutation relations provide solutions of 660
let 616 holds combining it with 660 we see that the latter splits into the equations
the equations 658660 are identities for scalar fields as for them i  0 and vit k  1 which
reflects the absents of spin for these fields

inserting here 657pwe see that one needs the explicit definition of vis k and formulae for

sums like ii k  s vis kvis
 k  which are specific for any particular field and can
be found in 1315 in this way applying 525 37 and the mentioned results from 1315
one can check the validity of 661 for massive fields in a way similar to the proof of 53
in 1315 for scalar spinor and vector fields respectively
we shall end the present subsection with the remark that the equations 417 and 418
which together with 415 ensure the uniqueness of the spin and orbital operators are
sufficient conditions for the coincidence of the equations 658 659 and 660

inferences

to begin with let us summarize the major conclusions from sect 6 each of the heisenberg
equations 5153 the equations 53 being split into 54 and 55 induces in a natural
way some relations that the creation and annihilation operators should satisfy these relations can be chosen as algebraic trilinear ones in a case of 51 and 52 see 610612
and 631633 respectively but for 54 and 55 they need not to be algebraic and
are differential ones in the case of 54 see 647649 and integral equations in the case
of 55 see 658660 it was pointed that the cited relations depend on the initial
lagrangian from which the theory is derived unless some explicitly written conditions hold
see 624 637 and 655 in particular these conditions are true if the equations 49
413 ensuring the uniqueness of the corresponding dynamical operators are valid since
the charge symmetric lagrangians 34 seem to be the ones that best describe free fields
the arising from them commutation relations 612 633 649 and 660 were studied in more details it was proved that the trilinear commutation relations 616 convert
them into identities as a result of which the same property possess the paracommutation
relations 620 and in particular the bilinear commutation relations 613 examples of trilinear commutation relations which are neither ordinary nor para ones were presented some
of them like 614 634 and 652 do not agree with 613 and other ones like 616
622 and 635 generalize 620 and hence are compatible with 613 at last it was
demonstrated that the commutators between the dynamical variables see 515523 are
uniquely defined if a heisenberg relation for one of the operators entering in it is postulated
the chief aim of the present section is to be explored the problem whether all of the
reasonable conditions mentioned in the previous sections and that can be imposed on the
creation and annihilation operators can hold or not hold simultaneously this problem is
suggested by the strong evidences that the relations 5153 and 515523 with a
possible exception of 53 more precisely of 55 in the massless case should be valid in
a realistic quantum field theory 1 3 7 8 11 12 besides to the arguments in loc cit we
shall add the requirement for uniqueness of the dynamical variables see sect 4

as it was shown in sect 6 the relations 51 52 54 and 55 are compatible if
one starts from a charge symmetric lagrangian see 34 which best describes a free field
theory in particular the commutation relations 616 and hence 620 and 613 ensure
their simultaneous validity22 for that reason we shall investigate below only commutation
relations for which 51 52 54 and 55 hold it will be assumed that they should be
such that the equations 610612 631633 647649 and 658660 respectively hold
consider now the problem for the uniqueness of the dynamical variables and its consistency with the commutation relations just mentioned for a charged field it will be assumed
that this uniqueness is ensured via the equations 49411
the equation 415 viz
am  a
71
m   0
is a necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the momentum and charge
operators see sect 4 and the notation introduced at the beginning of sect 6 before
commenting on this relation we would like to derive some consequences of it applying
consequently 68 for    71 and the identity
a b  c  a b  c  b  a c

72

for     we in view of 71 obtain



 



a
m  am  am    am  am  am    1  am  am   am




 

 
a
m  am  am    am  am  am    1  am  am   am 

73

forming the sum and difference of 612a for   0 and 633a we see that the system
of equations they form is equivalent to
 
a
l  am  am    0



a
l  am  am    0






 
a
l  am  am    2lm al  0 al  am  am    2lm al  0

74a
74b

combining 74b for l  m with 73 we get


 


1  am  a
m   am  2am  0 1  am  am   am  2am  0

75

obviously these equations reduce to
a
m 0

76

for bose fields as for them   1 see 37 since the operators 76 describe a completely
unobservable field or more precisely an absence of a field at all the obtained result means
that the theory considered cannot describe any really existing physical field with spin j  0 1
such a conclusion should be regarded as a contradiction in the theory for fermi fields j  21
and   1 the equations 75 have solutions different from 76 iff a
m are degenerate
operators ie with no inverse ones in which case 74a is a consequence of 75 and 71
see 68 and 73 too
the source of the above contradiction is in the equation 71 which does not agree with
the bilinear commutation relations 613 and contradicts to the existing correlation between
creation and annihilation of particles with identical characteristics m  t p in our case
as 71 can be interpreted physically as mutual independence of the acts of creation and
annihilation of such particles 1  101
at this point there are two ways for repairing of the theory on one hand one can
forget about the uniqueness of the dynamical variables in a sense of sect 4 after which
22

the special cases when 55 may not hold for a massless field will not be considered below

the formalism can be developed by choosing eg the charge symmetric lagrangians 34
and following the usual lagrangian formalism in fact this is the way the parafield theory is
build 1618 on another hand one may try to change something at the ground of the theory
in such a way that the uniqueness of the dynamical variables to be ensured automatically
we shall follow the second method as a guiding idea we shall have in mind that the
bilinear commutation relations 613 and the related to them normal ordering procedure
provide a base for the presentday quantum field theory which describes sufficiently well
the discovered elementary particlesfields on this background an extensive exploration of
commutation relations which are incompatible with 613 is justified only if there appear
some evidences for fieldsparticles that can be described via them in that connection it
should be recalled 17 18 it seems that all known particlesfields are described via 613
and no one of them is a para particlefield
using the notation introduced at the beginning of sect 4 we shall look for a linear
mapping operator e on the operator space over the systems hilbert space f of states such
that
e d    e d  
77

as it was shown in sect 4 an example of an operator e is provided by the normal ordering
operator n  therefore an operator satisfying 77 always exists to any such operator e
there corresponds a set of dynamical variables defined via
d  e d  

78

let us examine the properties of the mapping e that it should possess due to the requirement 77
first of all as the operators of the dynamical variables should be hermitian we shall
require

79
e b  e b  
for any operator b which entails

d   d

710

due to 39312 and 78
as in sect 4 we shall replace the soarising integral equations with corresponding algebraic ones thus the equations 45420 remain valid if the operator e is applied to their
left hand sides
consider the general case of a charged field q 6 0 so the analogue of 415 reads

711
e am  a
m   0

which equation ensures the uniqueness of the momentum and charge operators respectively
the condition 411 transforms into







m  
n eam  a
 0
712
n    eam  an  
nm

which by means of 711 can be rewritten as cf 416

 


 n eam  a
n    eam  an

at the end equations 417 and 418 now should be written as

these equations can be satisfied if we generalize 711 to cf 420

for any s and s  at last the following stronger version of 716

e am  a
n   0

716

717

for any m  t p and n  r q ensures the validity of 714 and 715 and thus of the
uniqueness of all dynamical variables
it is time now to call attention to the possible commutation relations the replacement
d   d   d  7 d  e d    e d    e d   results in corresponding changes in the
whole of the material of sect 6 in particular the systems of commutation relations 610
612 631633 647649 and 658660 should be replaced respectively with23

due to the uniqueness conditions 711714 one can rewrite the terms eam  a
m
in 718721 in a number of equivalent ways eg see 711


eam  a
m    eam  am  

1
eam  a
m

722

consider the general case of a charged field q 6 0 and hence   0 the system of
equations 718719 is then equivalent to
 

al  eam  a
723a
m   0
 


al  eam  a
723b
m    lm al  0

 

723c
al  eam  a
m    lm al  0

these commutation relations ensure the simultaneous fulfillment of the heisenberg relations 51 and 52 involving the momentum and charge operators respectively to ensure
also the validity of 720 with   0 and consequently of 54 we generalize 723 to

 
724a
al  eam  a
n   0
 




al  eam  an    lm an  0
724b

 

al  eam  a
724c
n    lm an  0

for any l  s k m  t p and n  t q see also 651 in the way pointed in
sect 6 one can verify that 724 for any l  s k m  t p and n  r p entails 721
and hence 55 at last to ensure the validity of all of the mentioned conditions and a
23

to save some space we do not write the hermitian conjugate of the belowwritten equations

suitable transition to a case of hermitian field for which q  0 and   1 see 37 we
generalize 724 to

 

725a
al  eam  a
n     ln am  0
 




al  eam  an     ln am  0
725b
 




al  eam  an    lm an  0
725c
 


al  eam  a
725d
n    lm an  0

where l m and n are arbitrary as a result of 717 which we assume to hold and  al  
 a
l see 37 the equations 725a and 725c resp 725b and 725d become identical
when   1 and hence al   a
l  for   0 the system 725 reduces to 724 recalling
2j
that   1 see 37 we can rewrite 725 in a more compact form as
 

2j1
al  eam  a
726a
 ln a
n    1
m 0

 
2j1
 lm a
726b
al  eam  a
n    1
n  0
since the last equation is equivalent to see 717 and use that   12j 
 


2j1
al  ea
ln a
m  an    1
m  0

726b 

it is evident that the equations 726a and 726b coincide for a neutral field
let us draw the main moral from the above considerations the equations 717 are
sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the dynamical variables while 726 are such
conditions for the validity of the heisenberg relations 5155 in which the dynamical
variables are redefined according to 78 so any set of operators a
l and e which are
simultaneous solutions of 717 and 726 ensure uniqueness of the dynamical variables
and at the same time the validity of the heisenberg relations
consider the uniqueness problem for the solutions of the system of equations consisting
of 717and 726 writing 717 as


eam  a
n    ean  am  

1
eam  a
n  
2

727

which reduces to 722 for n  m and using   12j see 37 one can verify that 726
is equivalent to

 


al  ea
728a
m  an     2ln am  0

 
 

al  eam  an     2 ln am  0
728b
 



al  ea
728c
m  an     2 lm an  0
 


al  eam  a
728d
n     2lm an  0

the similarity between this system of equations and 616 is more than evident 728 can
be obtained from 616 by replacing   with e  
as it was said earlier the bilinear commutation relations 613 and the identification of
e with the normal ordering operator n 
e  n

729

convert 727728 into identities by invoking 68 for    the reader can check
this via a direct calculation see also 423 however this is not the only possible solution

of 727728 for example if in the particular case one defines an antinormal ordering
operator a as a linear mapping such that



aa
m  an   an  am




aa
m  an   am  an



aam  a
n   an  am

730



aam  a
n   am  an 

then the bilinear commutation relations 613 and the setting e  a provide a solution
of 727728 to prove this apply 68 for    evidently a linear combination of
n and a together with 613 also provides a solution of 72772824 other solution
of the same system of equations is given by e  id and operators a
l satisfying 616 in



particular the paracommutation relations 620 and am  an  an  am  the problem
for the general solution of 727728 with respect to e and a
l is open at present
let us introduce the particle and antiparticle number operators respectively by see 727
79 and 316

if we admit a

as it was demonstrated in 1315 the anomalous commutation relations are rejected if one works with the

if m  l these relations reduce to 732 due to 739
we shall end this section with the remark that the conditions for the uniqueness of
the dynamical variables and the validity of the heisenberg relations are quite general and
are not enough for fixing some commutation relations regardless of a number of additional
assumptions made to reduce these conditions to the system of equations 727728

state vectors vacuum and mean values

until now we have looked on the commutation relations only from pure mathematical viewpoint in this way making a number of assumptions we arrived to the system 727728 of
commutation relations further specialization of this system is however almost impossible
without making contact with physics for the purpose we have to recall 1 3 11 12 that
the physically measurable quantities are the mean expectation values of the dynamical
variables in some state and the transition amplitudes between different states to make
some conclusions from these basic assumption of the quantum theory we must rigorously
said how the states are described as vectors in systems hilbert space f of states on which
all operators considered act
for the purpose we shall need the notion of the vacuum or more precisely the assumption
of the existence of unique vacuum state vector known also as the noparticle condition
before defining rigorously this state which will be denoted by x0  we shall heuristically
analyze the properties it should possess
first of all the vacuum state vector x0 should represent a state of the field without any
particles from here two conclusions may be drawn i as a field is thought as a collection
of particles and a missing particle should have vanishing dynamical variables those of the
vacuum should vanish too or more generally to be finite constants which can be set equal


are
to zero by rescaling some theorys parameters and ii since the operators a
l and al
interpreted as ones that annihilate a particle characterize by l  s k and charge q or q
respectively and one cannot destroy an absent particle these operators should transform
the vacuum into the zero vector which may be interpreted as a complete absents of the field
thus we can expect that

d x0   0

a
l  x0 

0

81a
al   x0 

 0

81b


are interpreted as ones creating a particle characfurther as the operators a
l and al

terize by l  s k and charge q or q respectively state vectors like a
l  x0  and al  x0 
should correspond to 1particle states of course a necessary condition for this is

x0 6 0

82

due to which the vacuum can be normalize to unit
h x0  x0 i  1

83

where hi  f  f  c is the hermitian scalar inner product of f more generally if

ma
l1  al2     is a monomial only in i  n creation operators the vector

l1 l2   ma
l1  al2     x0 

84

may be expected to describe an iparticle state with i1 particles and i2 antiparticles i1 i2 

 
i where i1 and i2 are the number of operators a
l and al  respectively in mal1  al2    
moreover as a free field is intuitively thought as a collection of particles and antiparticles
it is natural to suppose that the vectors 84 form a basis in the hilbert space f but the
validity of this assumption depends on the accepted commutation relations for its proof
when the paracommutation relations are adopted see the proof of 18 p 26 theorem i1
accepting the last assumption and recalling that the transition amplitude between two
states is represented via the scalar product of the corresponding to them state vectors it
is clear that for the calculation of such an amplitude is needed an effective procedure for
calculation of scalar products of the form


 

hl1 l2  m1 m2  i  h x0  ma
l1  al2      m am1  am2     x0 i

85

with m and m being monomials only in the creation operators similarly for computation
of the mean value of some dynamical operator d in a certain state one should be equipped
with a method for calculation of scalar products like


 

hl1 l2   dm1 m2  i  h x0  ma
l1  al2      d  m am1  am2     x0 i

86

supposing for the moment the vacuum to be defined via 81 let us analyze 8186
besides the validity of 727728 will be assumed
from the expressions 78 and 39312 for the dynamical variables it is clear that
the condition 81a can be satisfied if
eam  a
n  x0   0

87

which in view of 727 is equivalent to any one of the equations

ea
m  an  x0   0


ea
m  an   x0   0

88a
88b

equation 87 is quite natural as it expresses the vanishment of all modes of the vacuum
corresponding to different polarizations 4momentum and charge it will be accepted hereafter
by means of 88 and the commutation relations 728 in the form 742 in particular 732 one can explicitly calculate the action of any one of the operators 733738
on the vectors 84 for the purpose one should simply to commute the operators nlm or
nl  nll  with the creation operators in 84 according to 742 resp 732 until they
act on the vacuum and hence giving zero
p as a result of 88 and 742 resp 732 in

these equations and similar but more complicated ones with an arbitrary monomial in the

creation operators for a
are the base for the particle interpretation of the quantum
l or al

theory of free fields for instance in view of 89 and 810 the state vectors
p al  x0  and
al   x0  are interpreted as ones representing particles with 4momentum  m2 c2  k2  k
and charges q and q respectively similar multiparticle interpretation can be given to the
general vectors 84 too
the equations 89812 completely agree with similar ones obtained in 1315 on the
base of the bilinear commutation relations 613
by means of 87 the expression 86 can be represented as a linear combination of
terms like 85 indeed as d is a linear combinations of terms like eam  a
n  by means of
the relations 728 we can commute each of these terms with the creation resp annihilation

 

   
operators in the monomial m a
m1  am2     resp  mal1  al2      m al1  al2    
and thus moving them to the right resp left until they act on the vacuum x0  giving
the zero vector  see 87 in this way the matrix elements of the dynamical variables
in particular their mean values can be expressed as linear combinations of scalar products

of the form 85 therefore the supposition 87 reduces the computation of mean values
of dynamical variables to the one of the vacuum mean value of a product composition
of creation and annihilation operators in which the former operators stand to the right of
the latter ones such a product of creation and annihilation operators can be called their
antinormal product cf the properties 730 of the antinormal ordering operator a
the calculation of such mean values like 85 for states   6 x0  however cannot
be done on the base of 727728 87 and 81a unless additional assumption are
made for the purpose one needs some kind of commutation relations by means of which
the creation resp annihilation operators on the rhs of 85 to be moved to the left resp
right until they act on the left resp right vacuum vector x0  as a result of this operation
the expressions between the two vacuum vectors in 85 should transform into a linear
combination of constant terms and such with no contribution in 85 examples of the last
type of terms are eam  a  and normally ordered products of creation and annihilation
operators an alternative procedure may consists in defining axiomatically the values of all
or some of the mean values 85 or more stronger the explicit action of all or some of the
operators entering in the rhs of 85 on the vacuum26 it is clear both proposed schemes
should be consistent with the relations 727728 81b and 8788
let us summarize the problem before us the operator e in 727728 has to be fixed
and a method for computation of scalar products like 85 should be given provided the
vacuum vector x0 satisfies 81b 82 83 and 87 two possible ways for exploration
of this problem were indicated above


consider the operator e supposing eam  a
n  to be a function only of am and an 






we in view of 81b can write eam  an   f am  an   b with b  an upper sign or
b  am lower sign and some functions f   applying 727 we obtain do not sum over l

  
eam  a
l   f am  al   al



  
ea
l  am   f am  al   al




 
ea
m  al   f am  al   al



 
eal   a
m   f am  al   al 

since e is a linear operator the expression eam a
n  turns to be a linear and homogeneous

which
immediately
implies
f  a b   a for operators a and
function of am and a
n
b and some constants   c for future convenience we assume   1 which can be
achieved via a suitable renormalization of the creation and annihilation operators27 thus
the last equations reduce to

evidently these equations convert 727 87 and 88 into identities comparing 815
and 422 we see that the identification
e n

816

of the operator e with the normal ordering operator n is quite natural however for our
purposes this identification is not necessary as only the equations 815 not the general
definition of n  will be employed
26
27

such an approach resembles the axiomatic description of the scattering matrix 1 7 8
since   0 orand   0 implies d  0 due to 78 these values are excluded for evident reasons

as a result of 815 the commutation relations 728 now read



a

in a sense these relations are one half of the paracommutation relations 616 the

the
relations 817 are identical with 616 for   0 as noted in 26 the
i
l
remarks following theorem 2 in sec 1 this is a quite exceptional case from the viewpoint
of parastatistics theory by means of 68 for    one can verify that equations 817
agree with the bilinear commutation relations 613 ie 613 convert 817 into identities
the equations 815 imply the following explicit forms of the number operators 731
and the transition operators 740

as a result of them the equations 733736 are simply a different form of writing of 424
425 428 and 429 respectively
let us return to the problem of calculation of vacuum mean values of antinormal ordered
products like 85 in view of 81b and 83 the simplest of them are
h x0  idf  x0 i  

h x0  m  x0 i  0

820

where   c and m resp m  is any monomial of degree not less than 1 only in the

 
 
creation resp annihilation operators eg m  a
l  al  al1 al2  al1 al2  these equations
with   1 are another form of what is called the stability of the vacuum if xi denotes an
iparticle state i  n  0 then by virtue of 820 and the particle interpretation of 84
we have
h xi  x0 i  i0 
821
ie the only nonforbidden transition into from the vacuum is from into the vacuum
more generally if xi 0 and x0j  denote respectively i particle and j  antiparticle states
with x00  x0  then
822
h xi 0  x0j  i  i 0 0j  
ie transitions between two states consisting entirely of particles and antiparticles respectively are forbidden unless both states coincide with the vacuum since we are dealing with
free fields one can expect that the amplitude of a transitions from an i particle  j  antiparticle state xi j  into an i particle  j  antiparticle state xi j  is
h xi j   xi j  i  i i j  j  

823

but however the proof of this hypothesis requires new assumptions vide infra
let us try to employ 817 for calculation of expressions like 85 acting with 817
and their hermitian conjugate on the vacuum in view of 81b we get


a
m  an  al  ln idf  x0   0


an  a
 lm idf  x0   0
m  al





  lm idf  x0   0
am  a
n  al   ln idf  x0   0 an  am  al

824

these equalities as well as 817 cannot help directly to compute vacuum mean values
of antinormally ordered products of creation and annihilation operators but the equations 824 suggest the restrictions28
al   a
m  x0   lm x0


a
l  am  x0    lm x0


a
l  am  x0   lm x0

al   am  x0    lm x0

825

to be added to the definition of the vacuum these conditions convert 824 into identities
and in this sense agree with 817 and consequently with the bilinear commutation relations 613 recall 16 18 the relations 825 are similar to ones accepted in the parafield
theory and coincide with that for parastatistics of order p  1 however here we do not suppose the validity of the paracommutation relations 620 or 616 equipped with 825
one is able to calculate the rhs of 85 for any monomial m resp m  and monomials
m resp m of degree 1 deg m  1 resp deg m  129 indeed 825 81b and 83
entail


h x0 al   a
m  x0 i  h x0 al  am  x0 i  lm



 am  x0 i   lm
h x0 a
l  am  x0 i  h x0 al

m1  am2      x0 i  0
l  mam1  am2      x0 i  h x0 al

deg m  2
deg m  2
826

hereof the equation 823 for i  j   1 resp i  j   1 and arbitrary i and j  resp i
and j   follows
however it is not difficult to be realized the calculation of 85 in cases more general
than 820 and 826 is not possible on the base of the assumptions made until now30 at
this point one is free so set in an arbitrary way the rhs of 85 in the mentioned general
case or to add to 817 and possibly 825 other commutation relations by means of
which the rhs of 85 to be calculated explicitly other approaches eg some mixture
of the just pointed ones for finding the explicit form of 85 are evidently also possible
since expressions like 85 are directly connected with observable experimental results the
only criterion for solving the problem for calculating the rhs of 85 in the general case
can be the agreement with the existing experimental data as it is known 1 3 11 12 at
present almost all of them are satisfactory described within the framework of the bilinear
commutation relations 613 this means that from physical point of view the theory
should be considered as realistic one if the rhs of 85 is the same as if 613 are valid
or is reducible to it for some particular realization of an accepted method of calculation
eg if one accepts some commutation relations like the paracommutation ones which are
a generalization of 613 and reduce to them as a special case see eg 620 it should
be noted the conditions 81b83 and 825 are enough for calculating 85 if 616
or its versions 617 or 620 are accepted cf 16 the causes for that difference are



replacements like a
m  an  7 2am an  when one passes from 616 to 817 the existence

of terms like an  a
m al in 616 are responsible for the possibility to calculate 85

since the operators a
are generally degenerate with no inverse ones we cannot say that 824
l and al
implies 825
29
for deg m  0 resp deg m  0  see 820
30
it should be noted the conditions 81b83 and 825 are enough for calculating 85 if the relations 616 or their version 620 are accepted cf 16 the cause for that difference is in replacements






like a
m  an  7 2am  an  when one passes from 616 to 817 the existence of terms like an  am  al
in 616 is responsible for the possibility to calculate 85 in case 616 hold
28

if evidences appear for events for which 85 takes other values one should look eg
for other commutation relations leading to desired mean values as an example of the last
type can be pointed the following anomalous bilinear commutation relations cf 613

which should be imposed after expressions like eam  a
n  are explicitly calculated these
relations convert 817 and 825 into identities and by their means the rhs of 85 can be
calculated explicitly but as it is well known 1 3 11 12 27 they lead to deep contradictions
in the theory due to which should be rejected31
at present it seems the bilinear commutation relations 613 are the only known commutation relations which satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and simultaneously provide
an evident procedure for effective calculation of all expressions of the form 85 besides
for them and for the paracommutation relations the vectors 84 form a base the fock
base for the systems hilbert space of states 18 in this connection we want to mention
that the paracommutation relations 616 or their conventional version 620 if imposed
as additional restrictions to the theory together with 817 reduce in this particular case
to 613 as the conditions 825 show that we are dealing with a parafield of order p  1
ie with an ordinary field 17 1832
ending this section let us return to the definition of the vacuum x0  it generally
depends on the adopted commutation relations for instance in a case of the bilinear commutation relations 613 it consists of the equations 81a83 while in a case of the
paracommutation relations 616 or other ones generalizing 613 it includes 81a83
and 825

commutation relations for
several coexisting different free fields

until now we have considered commutation relations for a single free field which can be
scalar or spinor or vector one the present section is devoted to similar treatment of a
system consisting of several not less than two different free fields in our context the
fields may differ by their masses andor charges andor spins eg the system may consist
of charged scalar field neutral scalar field massless spinor field massive spinor field and
massless neural vector field it is a priori evident the commutation relations regarding only
one field of the system should be as discussed in the previous sections the problem is to be
derivedpostulated commutation relations concerning different fields it will be shown the
developed lagrangian formalism provides a natural base for such an investigation and makes
superfluous some of the assumptions made for example in 17 p b 1159 left column or
in 18 sec 121 where systems of different parafields are explored
to begin with let us introduce suitable notation with the indices     1 2     n
will be distinguished the different fields of the system with n  n n  2 being their
number and the corresponding to them quantities let q  and j  be respectively the charge
31

as it was demonstrated in 1315 a quantization like 827 contradicts to is rejected by the charge
symmetric lagrangians 34

notice as a result of 817 the relations 616 correspond to 728 for e  a with a being the

91

suppose l is the lagrangian of the field for definiteness we assume l for all
 to be given by one and the same set of equations viz 31 or 33 or 34 to save
some space below the case 34 corresponding to charge symmetric lagrangians will be
considered in more details the reader can explore other cases as exercises
since the lagrangian of our system of free fields is

the dynamical variables are

d

93

and the corresponding system of eulerlagrange equations consists of the independent equations for each of the fields of the system see 36 with l for l this allows an introduction
of independent creation and annihilation operators for each field the ones for the th field

will be denoted by a
s k and as k notice the values of the polarization variables
generally depend on the field considered and therefore they also are labeled with index
 for the th field for brevity we shall use the collective indices l  m and n  with

l   s  k etc in terms of which the last operators are a
l and al  respectively the
particular expressions for the dynamical operators d  are given via 39312 in which
the following changes should be made

the content of sections 4 and 5 remains valid mutatis mutandis viz provided the just
pointed changes 94 are made and the integral dynamical variables are understood in
conformity with 93

commutation relations connected with the momentum operator
problems and their possible solutions

in sections 68 however substantial changes occur for instance when one passes from 612
or 615 to 616 we shall consider them briefly in a case when one starts from the charge
symmetric lagrangians 34

provide a solution of 95 in a sense that they convert it into identity as it was said in
sect 6 the equations 96 resp 97 for a single field ie for    agree resp disagree
with the bilinear commutation relations 613

similar to the transition from 615 to 616 its essence is in the generalization of expres and   l m a
sions like am  a
l  when passing from 615 to 616 the indices l and
m 
m are changed so that the obtained equations to be consistent with 613 of course the
numbers  and  are preserved because this change does not concern the field regarded but
the situation with 97 is different in two directions
i if we change the pair m  m  in am  a
 with m  n  then with what the numm 



ber  should be replace with   or  or with something else similarly if the mentioned

solved by requiring an agreement of the resulting generalization of 616 in the particular
case with the bilinear commutation relations 613 so how shall 613 be generalized for
several not less than two different fields obviously here we meet an obstacle similar to
the one described in i above with the only change that  should stand for  
let bl and cl denote some creation or annihilation operator of the field consider the
problem for generalizing the anticommutator bl  cl   this means that we are looking
for a replacement
bl  cl  7 f  bl  cm   

98

where the functions f  are such that
f  bl  cm   



 bl  cl  

99

unfortunately the condition 99 is the only restriction on f  that the theory of free fields
can provide thus the functions f   subjected to equation 99 become new free parameters
of the quantum theory of different free fields and it is a matter of convention how to choosefix
them

it is generally accepted 18 appendix f the functions f  to have forms maximum
similar to the anticommutators they generalize more precisely the functions

are usually considered as the only candidates for f   notice in 910  are functions in
 and  not in l andor m  besides if we assume  to be function only in  and  
then the general form of  is
  u   1  u   v  1    

u  v   c

912

due to 91 and 911 in view of 613 the value   1 resp   1 corresponds
to quantization via commutators resp anticommutators of the corresponding fields
call attention now on the numbers   which originate and are associated with each term
bl  cm   with every change 98 one can associate a replacement
  7 gbl  cm   

913

where the function g is such that
gbl  cm   



  

914

of course the last condition does not define g uniquely and consequently the function
g satisfying 914 enters in the theory as a new free parameter suppose as a working
hypothesis similar to 910911 that g is of the form
gbl  cm       

915

where   are complex numbers that may depend only on  and  and are such that
     

916

besides if we suppose   to be functions only in   and    then
   x    y     1  x  y     

x  y   c

917

as a result of 91 and 916
let us summarize the above discussion if we suppose a preservation of the algebraic
structure of the bilinear commutation relations 613 for a system of different free fields
then the replacements

a reasonable further specialization of  and   may be the assumption their ranges

which means that the th and th fields are treated on equal footing and there is no a

if both of the restrictions 921 and 923 are imposed on 920 then the arbitrariness of

when free fields are considered as in our case no further arguments from mathematical
or physical nature can help for choosing a particular combination      from the four
possible ones according to 925 for a fixed pair   to end the above considerations of
 and    we have to say that the choice

however nothing can prevent us to make other choices compatible with 918 in the theory of free
fields for instance one may set      and    21       

is known as the normal case 18 appendix f in it the relative behavior of bose resp
fermi fields is as in the case of a single field ie they are quantized via commutators resp
anticommutators as       1 0 resp       1 0 and the one of bose and
fermi field is as in the case of a single fermi field viz the quantization is via commutators as

      1 0 all combinations between 
 and 01 different from 926 are referred
as anomalous cases above we supposed the pair   to be fixed if  and  are arbitrary
the only essential change this implies is in 925 where the choice of the subscripts   0
and 1 may depend on  and  in this general situation the normal case is defined as the one
when 926 holds for all  and  all other combinations are referred as anomalous cases
such are for instance the ones when some fermi and bose operators satisfy anticommutation
relations eg 919 with   1 for     0 or some fermi fields are subjected to
commutation relations like 919 with   1 for     1 for some details on this
topic see for instance 18 appendix f 7 chapter 20 and 27 sect 44 fieldsoperators
for which   1 resp   1 with  6  are referred as relative parabose resp
parafermi in the parafield theory 17 18 one can transfer this terminology in the general
case and call the fieldsoperators for which   1 resp   1 with  6  relative
bose resp fermi fieldsoperators
further the relations 919 will be referred as the multifield bilinear commutation relations and it will be assumed that they represent the generalization of the bilinear commutation relations 613 when we are dealing with several not less than two different quantum
fields the particular values of  and   in them are insignificant in the following if one
likes one can fix them as in the normal case 926 moreover even the definition 919
of   is completely inessential at all as   always appears in combinations like   l m
see 919 or similar relations like 927 below which are nonvanishing if    but
then       so one can freely write   for   in all such cases
equipped with 919 and 918 we can generalize 97 in different ways for example
the straightforward generalization of 616 is

  
927a
al  am  an    2l n a
0
m

   
927b
0
al  am  an    2  l n a
m

  
927c
al  am  an    2  l m a
n  0

   
927d
al  am  an    2l m a
n  0
however generally the relations 919 do not convert 927 into identities the reason is
that an equalityidentity like cf 68
bl  cm  dn   bl  cm   dn   cm  bl  dn  

928

where bl  cm and dn are some creationannihilation operators and   c can be valid
only for
  

  1

 6 0

929

which in particular is fulfilled if    and   1 so the agreement between 919
and 927 depends on the concrete choice of the numbers   there exist cases when even
the normal case 926 cannot ensure 919 to convert 927 into identities eg when the
th field and th fields are fermion ones and the th field is a boson one moreover it can
be proved that 919 and 927 are compatible in the general case if unacceptable equalities

like a
l  am  0 hold
one may call 927 the multifield paracommutation relations as from them a corresponding generalization of 618 andor 620 can be derived for completeness we shall record

the multifield version of 620

for details regarding these multifield paracommutation relations the reader is referred to 17
18 where the case          0 is considered
we leave to the reader as exercise to write down the multifield versions of the commutation relations 622 or 623 which provide examples of generalizations of 97 and hence
of 919 and 927

92

commutation relations connected with the charge and
angular momentum operators

in a case of several not less than two different fields the basic trilinear commutation relations 633 which ensure the validity of the heisenberg relation 52 concerning the charge
operator read

l  0

m

931b

of course these relations hold only for those fields which have nonvanishing charges ie
in 931 is supposed see 91
  0   0

  q  q  6 0

932

the problem for generalizing 931 for these fields is similar to the one for 97 in the
case of nonvanishing charges    0 without repeating the discussion of subsect 91
we shall adopt the rule 918 for generalizing anticommutation relations between creationannihilation operators of a single field by its means one can obtain different generalizations of 931 for instance the commutation relations

and their hermitian conjugate contain 931 and 635 as evident special cases and agree
with 919 if    and    1 besides the multifield paracommutation relations 927 for charged fields          0 convert 933 into identities and in this
sense 933 agree with contain as special case 927 for charged fields as an example
of commutation relations that do not agree with 927 for charged fields and consequently
with 933 we shall point the following ones

  
934a
0
al  am  an    l n a
m

   

934b
al  am  an     l n am  0

which are a multifield generalization of 634

the consideration of commutation relations originating from the orbital heisenberg
equation 54 is analogous to the one of the same relations regarding the charge operator
the multifield version of 649 is

applying 651 with m for m and n for n one can check that the multifield paracommutation relations 927 convert 935 into identities and hence provide a solution of 935
and ensure the validity of 54 when system of different free fields is considered an example
of a solution of 935 which does not agree with 927 is provided by the following multifield
generalization of 652

which provides a solution of 95 notice the evident multifield version of 653 agrees
with 95 but disagrees with 935 when the lower signs are used
at last the multifield exploration of the spin heisenberg relations 55 is a mutatis
mutandis see 935 version of the corresponding considerations in the second part of subsect 63 the main result here is that the multifield bilinear commutation relations 919
as well as their para counterparts 927 ensure the validity of 55

commutation relations between the dynamical variables

the aim of this subsection is to be discussedproved the commutation relations 515524
for a system of at least two different quantum fields from the viewpoint of the commutation
relations considered in subsections 91 and 92
to begin with we rewrite the heisenberg relations 51 52 and 54 in terms of
creation and annihilation operators for a multifield system 1 11

reduces to almost trivial algebraic calculations further we assert that any system of commutation relations considered in subsect 91 entails 945 as these relations always imply 95
or similar multifield versions of 610 and 611 in the case of the lagrangians 31 or 33
respectively and on its turn 95 implies 51 the required result follows from the last
assertion and the remark that 51 and 938 are equivalent as an additional verification
of the validity of 945 the reader can prove them by invoking the identity 68 and any
system of commutation relations mentioned in subsect 91 in particular 919 and 927

lagrangians 31 or 33 are employed which is equivalent to 939 the equations 947
hold if some of these systems is valid alternatively one can prove via a direct calculation
that the commutation relations arising from the charge operator entail the validity of 947

with bl  cl  a
l  al  al  al  and similar but more complicated ones involving the other
angular momentum operators it generally depends on the particular field considered and
will be omitted
as it was said in subsect 63 the heisenberg relations concerning the angular momentum
operators do not give rise to some algebraic commutation relations for the creation and
annihilation operators for this reason the only problem is which of the commutation
relations discussed in subsections 91 and 92 imply the validity of the equations 949 or
part of them the general answer of this problem is not known but however a direct
calculation by means of 97 if it holds and 68 shows the validity of 949 since 919
and 927 imply 97 this means that the multifield bilinear and para commutation relations
are sufficient for the fulfillment of 949
to conclude let us draw the major moral of the above material the multifield bilinear
commutation relations 919 and the multifield paracommutation relations 927 ensure
the validity of all standard commutation relations 945 947 and 949 between the
operators of the dynamical variables characterizing free scalar spinor and vector fields

commutation relations under the uniqueness conditions

as it was said at the end of the introduction to this section the replacements 94 ensure the
validity of the material of sect 4 in the multifield case correspondingly the considerations
in sect 7 remain valid in this case provided the changes

as one can expect the relations 953a953d can be obtained from the multifield paracommutation relations 927 via the replacement   7 e   it should be paid special
attention on the equation 953e it is due to the fact that in the expressions for the dynamifor  6  and it corresponds to
cal variables do not enter crossfieldproducts like al a
m
the condition ii in 17 p b 1159 the equality 953e is quite important as it selects only
that part of the  etransformed multifield paracommutation relations 927 which is compatible with the bilinear commutation relations 919 see 928 and 929 besides 953e
makes 953a953d independent of the particular definition of  see 911
the equations 952 are the only restrictions on the operator e examples of this operator

of basic vectors of the form 959 by means of the basic properties 958 of the vacuum
one is able to calculate the simplest forms of the vacuum mean values 960 viz the multifield versions see 951 of 820 and 826 but more general such expression cannot
be calculated by means of 957958 prima facie one can suppose that the multifield
commutation relations 919 which ensure the vectors 959 to form a base of the systems
hilbert space of states can help for the calculation of 960 in more complicated cases in
fact this is the case which works perfectly well and covers the available experimental data
in this connection we must mention that the applicability of 919 for calculation of 960
is ensured by the compatibilityagreement between 919 and 957 by means of 68 for
    one can check that 919 converts 957 into identities36
the commutation relations 957 admit as a solution also the multifield version of the
anomalous bilinear commutation relations 827 but it as we said earlier leads to contradictions and must be rejected the existence of solutions of 957 different from it and 919
seems not to be investigated if there appear date which do not fit into the description by
means of 919 one should look for other if any solutions of 957 or compatible with 957
effective procedures for calculating vacuum mean values like 960

conclusion

in this paper we have investigated two sources of algebraic commutation relations in the
lagrangian quantum theory of free scalar spinor and vector fields the uniqueness of the
dynamical variables momentum charge and angular momentum and the heisenberg relationsequations for them if one ignores the former origin which is the ordinary case the
paracommutation relations or some their generalizations seems to be the most suitable candidates for the most general commutation relations that ensure the validity of all heisenberg
equations the simultaneous consideration of the both sources mentioned reveals however
their incompatibility in the general case the outlet of this situation is in the redefinition
of the operators of the dynamical variables similar to the normal ordering procedure and
containing it as a special case that operation ensures the uniqueness of the new redefined
dynamical variables and changes the possible types of commutation relations again the
commutation relations connected with the heisenberg relations concerning the redefined
momentum operator entail the validity of all heisenberg equations
36

recall equations 919 and 927 or 953a953d for  6  are generally incompatible for instance
excluding some special cases like systems consisting of only fermi bose fields or one fermi bose field and
arbitrary number of bose fermi fields the only operators satisfying 919 and 927 for  6  and having
normal spinstatistics connection are such that bm  bn  0 with  6  and bm and cn being any
creationannihilation operators which in particular means that no states with two particles from different
fields can exist

further constraints on the possible commutation relations follow from the definitionintroduction of the concept of the vacuum vacuum state vector they practically reduce the
redefined dynamical variables to the ones obtained via normal ordering procedure which
results in the explicit form 817 of the admissible commutation relations in a sense
they happen to be one half of the paracommutation ones as a last argument in the way
for finding the unique true commutation relations we require the existence of procedure
for calculation of vacuum mean values of antinormally ordered products of creation and
annihilation operators to which the mean values of the dynamical variables and the transition
amplitudes between different states are reduced we have pointed that the standard bilinear
commutation relations are at present the only known ones that satisfy all of the conditions
imposed and do not contradict to the existing experimental data
the consideration of a system of at least two different quantum free fields meets a new
problem the general relations between creationannihilation operators belonging to different fields turn to be undefined the cause for this is that the commutation relations for any
fixed field are well defined only on the corresponding to it hilbert subspace of the systems
hilbert space of states and their extension on the whole space as well as the inclusion in
them of creationannihilation operators of other fields is a matter of convention when free
fields are concerned formally this is reflected in the structure of the dynamical variables
which are sums of those of the individual fields included in the system under consideration
we have however presented argument by means of which the a priori existing arbitrariness in the commutation relations involving different field operators can be reduced to the
standard one these relations should contain either commutators or anticommutators of
the creationannihilation operators belonging to different fields a free field theory cannot
make difference between these two possibilities accepting these possibilities the admissible
commutation relations 957 for system of several different fields are considered they turn
to be corresponding multifield versions of the ones regarding a single field similarly to the
single field case the standard multifield bilinear commutation relations seem to be the only
known ones that satisfy all of the imposed restrictions and are in agreement with the existing
data
