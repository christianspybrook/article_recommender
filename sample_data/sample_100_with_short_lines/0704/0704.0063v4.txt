1 introduction
neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches with great perspectives to test particle
physics beyond the standard model there is immense scope to use 0 decay for constraining neutrino masses
leftrightsymmetric models interactions involving rparity breaking in the supersymmetric model and
leptoquark scenarios as well as effective lepton number violating couplings experimental limits on 0 decay
are not only complementary to accelerator experiments but at least in some cases competitive or superior to the
best existing direct search limits the steadily improving experimental limits on the halflife of 0 can be
translated into more stringent limits on the parameters of these new physics scenarios
in the process of beta decay an unstable nucleus decays by converting a neutron in the nucleus to a proton and
emitting an electron and an antineutrino in order for beta decay to be possible the final nucleus must have a
larger binding energy than the original nucleus for some nuclei such as germanium76 the nuclei with atomic
number one higher have a smaller binding energy preventing beta decay from occurring in the case of
germanium76 the nuclei with atomic number two higher selenium76 has a larger binding energy so the
double beta decay process is allowed in double beta decay two neutrons in the nuclei are converted to protons
and two electrons and two antineutrinos are emitted it is the rarest known kind of radioactive decay it was
observed for only ten isotopes for some nuclei the process occurs as conversion of two protons to neutrons with
emission of two neutrinos and absorption of two orbital electrons double electron capture if mass difference
between the parent and daughter atoms is more than 1022 kev two electron masses another branch of the
process becomes possible with capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron and at last when
the mass difference is more then 2044 kev four electron masses the third branch of the decay arises with
emission of two positrons  decay
the processes described above are also known as two neutrino double beta decay as two neutrinos or antineutrinos are emitted if the neutrino is a majorana particle meaning that the antineutrino and the neutrino are
actually the same particle then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur in 0 decay the emitted
neutrino is immediately absorbed as its antiparticle by another nucleon of the nucleus so the total kinetic
energy of the two electrons would be exactly the difference in binding energy between the initial and final state
nuclei

experiments have been carried out and proposed to search for 0 decay mode as its discovery would indicate
that neutrinos are indeed majorana particles and allow a calculation of neutrino mass while the twoneutrino
mode 11 is allowed by the standard model of particle physics the neutrinoless mode 0 12 requires
violation of lepton number l2 this mode is possible only if the neutrino is a majorana particle ie the
neutrino is its own antiparticle double beta decay the rarest known nuclear decay process can occur in different
modes

2 double beta decay a rare process
the process arises in certain cases of evena nuclei where a is the mass number and is the sum of the number of
protons and neutrons a  z  n for evena nuclei the strong pairing force between like nucleons neutrons
like to be paired with other neutrons in a given nucleus with the same true for protons the binding energy of
eveneven nuclei even number of protons and even number neutrons is larger than that of oddodd nuclei odd
numbers of protons and neutrons this fact results in two separate parabolas on a plot of binding energy one
parabola for eveneven nuclei and one for oddodd consequently one occasionally finds a situation where two
eveneven nuclei for a given mass number a are stable against ordinary beta decay however the heavier nucleus
is not fully stable and can decay to the lighter nucleus via normal double beta decay a secondorder process
whereby the nuclear charge changes by two units the ground state of the eveneven nuclei is 0 positive parity
and the nuclear transition is 00

one particular type of experimental approach that hopes to determine if the neutrino is a massive majorana
particle is the search for neutrinoless double beta decay this type of experiment is perhaps the only feasible
method for determining if the neutrino is a majorana or dirac particle while neutrinoless double beta decay has
not yet been experimentally discovered searches have been conducted for many years with many continuing
today in fact the next generation of double beta decay experiments is currently being designed and developed
and involves a tremendous increase in the amount of source material to be studied on the order of a halfton or
more in neutrinoless double beta decay an antineutrino emitted at the first vertex is absorbed at the second as
2

seen in the figure below or that a virtual neutrino emitted by a neutron is absorbed by the second neutron
participating in the double beta decay

the two neutrino mode is allowed in standard model the neutrinoless mode can occur only if neutrinos have
masses of the majorana type the decay rate is proportional to the squared mass in other words the half life is
inversely proportional to the squared mass experimentally one can distinguish the two modes in the two
neutrino mode the electrons take away only a fraction of the energy q released in the decay the sum energy
spectrum is continuous extending from 0 to q in the neutrinoless mode the total energy q is carried away by the
electrons and the sum energy spectrum is a peak centered at q with a width given by the instrumental resolution

the decay rate for 2  decay which is allowed in the standard model of physics is given by

the ideal 0decay experiment has the following dream features the lowest possible background the best
possible energy resolution the greatest possible mass of the parent isotope detection efficiency near 100 for
valid events a unique signature and the lowest possible construction cost the next sections review experiments
in such an effort from the isotope 76ge
3 international germanium experiment igex
the nuclear double beta decay is a unique ground to investigate the nature and properties of the neutrino the
neutrinoless decay mode if it exists would provide an unambiguous evidence of the majorana nature of the
neutrino its nonzero mass and the nonconservation of lepton number after implication from solar and
atmospheric neutrino oscillation results that neutrinos have nonzero mass the process of neutrinoless double
beta decay has become the most relevant place to test the neutrino mass scale and its hierarchy pattern to
achieve high sensitivity limits of the effective majorana electron neutrino mass derived from the neutrinoless halflife lower bound required for such new objectives it will require a large number of double beta emitter nuclei a

very low background and a sharp energy resolution in the qvalue region and effective methods to disentangle
signal from noise a typical example of this type of search was the igex the international germanium
experiment igex was a search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76ge employing large amounts of
hpge detectors isotopically enriched to 86 in 76ge in the first phase of the experiment three detectors of 07
kg active volume each were operated one in the homestake gold mine 4000 mwe other in the baksan
neutrino observatory 660 mwe and the other in the canfranc underground laboratory laboratory 2 at 1380
mwe a conservative lower bound on the neutrinoless halflife of about 1024 years was derived
the international germanium experiment igex took data at the canfranc underground laboratory in spain at
a depth of 2450 mwe in a search of neutrinoless double beta decay three germanium detectors rg1 rg2
and rg3 of 2 kg each enriched to 86 in 76ge were used efforts were made to reduce part of the radioactive
background by discriminating it from the expected signal by comparison of the shape of the pulses psd of both
types of events the method was applied to the data recorded by two ge detectors of the igex which has
produced one of the two best current sensitivity limits for the majorana neutrino mass parameter in the second
phase three large detectors 2 kg each were fabricated with improvements derived from the analysis of data of
phase 1 they are installed in the canfranc underground laboratory laboratory 3 at 2450 mwe inside a low
background shielding consisting of 40 cm of lead a pvc box silicone sealed and flushed with nitrogen 2mm of
cadmium 20 cm of polyethylene and an active veto plastic scintillators a pulse shape discrimination psd
technique capable to distinguish single site events  decay events for example from multisite events the most
dominant background events is implemented new limits on the neutrinoless halflife and the neutrino mass
parameter were thus obtained from here
in large intrinsic ge detectors the charge carriers take 300  500 ns to reach their respective electrodes these
drift times are long enough for the current pulses to be recorded at a sufficient sampling rate the current pulse
contributions from electrons and holes are displacement currents and therefore dependent on their instantaneous
velocities and locations accordingly events occurring at a single site decay events for example have
associated current pulse characteristics which reflect the position in the crystal where the event occurred more
importantly these singlesite events sse frequently have pulse shapes that differ significantly from those due to
the background events that produce electronhole pairs at several sites by multicomptonscattering process for
example the socalled multisite events mse consequently pulseshape analysis was used to distinguish
between these two types of energy depositions since dbd events belong to the sse class of events and will
deposit energy at a single site in the detector while most of the background events belong to the mse class of
events and will deposit energy at several sites it provided a rejection of  60  of the events in the region of
interest accepting the criterion that those events having more than two lobes cannot be due to dbd event

igex spectrum with and without the psd background rejection
the igex detectors had the initial objective of the detection of the double beta decay of 76ge at the end of 1999
certain modifications were made to adapt the detectors to the detection at low energy where the signal of wimps
weak interacting massive particles is relevant the shielding shared by three igex detectors 2 kg germanium
detectors isotopically enriched to 86 in 76ge and the cosme detector included from inside to outside 40 cm
of lead a pvc box silicone sealed and flushed with nitrogen 2 mm of cadmium plastic scintillators working in
anticoincidence with the ge detectors and 20 cm of polyethylene the shielding was modified on july 2001 as it
included only one 2 kg germanium detector inside a more efficient neutron shielding these techniques of passive
5

and active shielding along with the extreme radiopurity of the detectors and their components allowed a low
energy background as well as a low enough threshold which are unique in this type of detectors so very stringent
contour limits for cross sections and masses of dark matter particles interacting with ge nuclei through spinindependent interactions were derived from here the need to understand and reject backgrounds in gediode
detector doublebeta decay experiments thus gave rise to the development of the pulse shape analysis technique in
such detectors to distinguish dbd singlesite energy deposits from the multiplesite deposits henceforth the
analysis was extended by dbd people to segmented ge detectors to study the effectiveness of combining
segmentation with pulse shape analysis to identify the multiplicity of the energy deposits
the igex calculations for a lower bound to the halflife for the neutrinoless mode where there were fewer than
31 candidate events 90 confidence level under a peak having fwhm  4 kev and centered at 203856 kev

where n is the number of parent nuclei t is the counting time and c is the upper limit on the number of 0decay counts consistent with the observed background to improve the sensitivity of m by a factor of 100 the

over present experiments so that tc must also be improved by that amount since practical counting times can
only be increased by a factor of 2 to 4 the background should be reduced by a factor of 25 to 50 below present
levels these are approximately the target parameters of the next generation neutrinoless doublebeta decay

doublebeta decay experiment published in phys rev d volume 65 2002 092007 by h v klapdorkleingrothaus a dietz and i v krivosheina begins with starting from their incorrectly determined halflife
limit the authors claim a range of effective neutrino mass of 033135 ev in response the igex collaboration
came out stating that kkdk selected only the 5251 moleyears of the igex data that had been subjected to psd
and obtained t120  711024 y using the maximum number of counts 31 from the entire 117 moleyears of data
which was erroneous and unjustified in another case kkdk also decided to arbitrarily use the entire igex data
set prior to psd selection from which they obtained 0 a bound of t120  11  1025 y for which there was no
scientific justification for selecting only psd corrected data on one hand and totally ignoring the psd corrected
data on the other hand in the conclusion of kkdk it states the igex paper  apart from the too high halflife
limits presented as a consequence of an arithmetic error  is rather incomplete in its presentation in response to
this paper the igex collaboration published the article the igex experiment revisited a response to the critique
of klapdorkleingrothaus dietz and krivosheina where they stated that there was absolutely no arithmetic error
6

and that the analysis of the published igex data presented in kkdk stands illegitimate to obtain a much shorter
bound on the halflife they arbitrarily analyzed two  halves of the data separately instead of having 4881025 y
in the numerator ln2 nt they used 221025 y yet they used the 90 cl upper limit on the number of counts
under the peak obtained by igex from all of the data in another analysis they ignored the fact that 5251
moleyears were corrected with psd and treated the complete uncorrected data set naturally the lower limits on
t12o 76ge obtained by these completely unjustified procedures are shorter than that obtained from properly
analyzing the complete data set this paper henceforth states the lower limit quoted by igex t120  157  1025
years is correct and that there was no arithmetical error as claimed in the critical view article
4 the heidelberg  moscow experiment
the heidelbergmoscow experiment at the gran sasso underground laboratory is now claimed to be the most
sensitive neutrinoless double beta decay experiment worldwide it has contributed in an extraordinary way to the
research in neutrino physics and particularly to beyond standard model physics and limits for the latter are
competing with those from the largest highenergy accelerators the emphasis on the first indication for
neutrinoless double beta decay is found in the heidelbergmoscow experiment giving first evidence of the lepton
number violation and a majorana nature of the neutrinos the neutrinoless double beta decay could answer
questions to the absolute scale of the neutrino mass and the fundamental character of the neutrino whether it is a
dirac or a majorana particle

entrance of the highway tunnel under gran sasso mountain
with the support of the lngs the experimental building of the experiment was built between halls a and b in
gran sasso into which the first enriched 76ge detector the first highpurity enriched 76ge detector worldwide
was installed in july 1990  first preparation work had been done since 1989 in a provisional tent in hall c the
full amount of five enriched 76ge detectors of in total 11 kg was finally installed in 1995 and were operated since
1996 with a newly developed pulse shape discrimination method
high purity germanium crystals enriched by germanium76 isotope up to 86 are used as the main detecting
elements five coaxial detectors with the total weight of 115 kg 125 moles in the active volume of detectors are
used each detector is located in a separate cryostat made of electrolytic copper with low content of radioactive
impurities the quantity of other designed materials iron bronze light material insulators is minimized in order
to reduce the feasible radioactive impurities contribution to the total background of the detectors the detectors
were located in two separate shielded boxes one of them 270 mm thick is made of electrolytic copper detector

of low background boliden lead detectors  1235 each setup is coated with stainless steal casing nonradioactive pure nitrogen was blown through casings to reduce radon emanation contribution to reduce neutron
background the casing with detectors 1235 was coated with borated polyethylene and two anticoincidence
plates of plastic scintillator were located over the casing in order to reduce muon component the setup was
located in gran sasso underground laboratory italy at a depth of 3500 metres of water equivalent of the lab

collecting data allow to record each event  the number or numbers of acted detector amplitude and pulse shape
and anticoincidence veto the heidelbergmoscow experiment with five enriched 8688 highpurity ptype
germanium detectors of in total 1096 kg of active volume used the largest source strength of all double beta
experiments at present and reached a record low level of background the detectors were the first highpurity ge
detectors ever produced the degree of enrichment was checked by investigation of tiny pieces of ge after crystal
production using the heidelberg mptandem accelerator as a mass spectrometer
the detectors except detector  4 were operated in a common pb shielding of 30 cm which consisted of an inner
shielding of 10 cm radiopure lc2grade pb followed by 20 cm of boliden lead the whole setup was placed in an
airtight steel box and flushed with radiopure nitrogen in order to suppress the 222rn contamination of the air the
shielding was improved in the course of the measurement the steel box operated since 1994 centered inside a 10cm boronloaded polyethylene shielding to decrease the neutron flux from outside an active anticoincidence
shielding was placed on top of the setup since 1995 to reduce the effect of muons detector  4 was installed in a
separate setup which had an inner shielding of 275 cm electrolytical cu 20 cm lead and boronloaded
polyethylene shielding below the steel box but no muon shielding the setup was kept airtight closed since
installation of detector 5 in february95 since then no radioactive contaminations of the inner of the
experimental setup by air and dust from the tunnel could occur

in the heidelbergmoscow group presented a paper concerning measurement of the 214bi spectrum in the energy
region around the qvalue of 76ge neutrinoless doublebeta decay in this work they presented the measurements
of the 214bi spectrum from a 226ra source with a high purity germanium detector their attention was mostly
focused on the energy region around the qvalue of 76ge neutrinoless doublebeta decay 2039006 kev the
results of the measurement strongly relates to the first indication for neutrinoless double beta decay of 76ge an
analysis of the data collected during ten years of measurements by the heidelbergmoscow experiment at gransasso underground laboratory yields a first indication for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76ge an
important point of this analysis is the interpretation of the background in the region around the qvalue of the
double beta decay 2039006 kev as containing several weak photopeaks it was suggested and has been shown
that four of these peaks are produced by a contamination from the isotope 214bi whose lines are present
throughout the heidelbergmoscow background spectrum
in this work they performed a measurement of a 226ra source with a highpurity germanium detector the aim of
this work was to study the spectral shape of the lines in the energy region from 2000 to 2100kev and most
important to show the difference in this spectral shape when changing the position of the source with respect to
the detector and to verify the effect of tcs true coincidence summing for the weak 214bi lines seen in the
heidelbergmoscow experiment the activity of the 226ra source is 952kbq the isotope 226ra appears in the
238
u natural decay chain and from its decays also 214bi is produced the spectrum of 214bi is clearly visible in
the 226ra measured spectrum 214bi is a naturally occurring isotope it is produced in the 238u natural decay chain
through the  decay of 214pb and the alpha decay of 218at with a subsequent  reaction 214bi decays then into
214
po the branching ratio with respect to the  decay into 210tl is 99979 the decay however does not lead
directly to the ground state of 214po but to its excited states from the decays of those excited states to the ground
state the well known spectrum of 214bi is obtained which contains more than hundred lines
in the table given below one can see in the energy region around the qvalue of the 0 decay 20002100kev
four lines and one e0 transition with energy 20167kev are expected the e0 transition can produce a
conversion electron or an electronpositron pair but it could not contribute directly to the spectrum in the
considered energy region if the source is located outside the detector active volume

the intensity of each line is defined as the number of emitted photons with the corresponding energy per 100
decays of the parent nuclide the considerations for the measurement were the efficiency of the detector which
depends on the size of the detector and on the distance sourcedetector and the effect called true coincidence
summing tcs the lifetimes of the atomic excited levels are much shorter than the resolving time of the
detector if two gammarays are emitted in cascade there is a certain probability that they will be detected
9

together if this happens then a pulse will be recorded which represents the sum of the energies of the two
individual photons instead of two separated pulses with different energies the tcs effect can result both in
lower peakintensity for fullenergy peaks and in bigger peakintensity for those transitions whose energy can be
given by the sum of two lowerenergy gammarays in this case the lines at 20107 kev and 20167 kev can be
given by the coincidence of the 609312 kev photon strongest line intensity  461 with the 140150kev
photon intensity  127 or with the 140798kev photon intensity  215 the degree of tcs depends on
the probability that two gammarays emitted simultaneously will be detected simultaneously which is a function
of the detector geometry and of the solid angle subtended at the detector by the source and for this the intensities
of the two lines mentioned above 201071kev and 20167kev are expected to depend on the position of the
source with respect to the detector
the 226ra ray spectra were measured using a ray spectroscopy system based on an hpge detector installed in
the operation room of the heidelbergmoscow experiment in gran sasso underground laboratory italy
the coaxial germanium detector had an external diameter of 52cm and 49cm height the distance between the
top of the detector and the copper cap was kept at 35cm the relative detection efficiency of the detector was
23 and the energy resolution being 36kev for the energy range 20002100kev the measurement of 214bi
spectrum with a high purity germanium detector in the energy region around the qvalue of 76ge neutrinoless
doublebeta decay 2039006kev was done with the 226ra source used for the measurements positioned in a first
step the source was positioned on the top of the detector directly in contact with the copper cap close geometry
and in a second step the source was moved 15cm away from the detector cap far geometry the results of the
measurements show that if the source is close to the detector the intensities of the weak bi lines in the energy
region 2000 2100kev are not in the same ratio as reported by table of isotopes the results of the analysis of the
data collected by the heidelbergmoscow experiment with all the five detectors yielding a first indication for the
neutrinoless double beta decay of 76ge shows that four 214bi lines are present in the energy region from 2000 to
2080kev many other strong lines from the same isotope are present in the spectrum due to the presence of
bismuth in the experimental setup especially in the copper in the vicinity of the ge crystals

the above figure shows the sum spectrum of the 76ge detectors 1234 and 5 over the period august

in a paper by klapdorkleingrothaus dietz harney and krivosheina hereafter referred to as kdhk evidence is
claimed for zeroneutrino doublebeta decay in 76 ge the high quality data upon which this claim is based was
compiled by the 2 careful efforts of the heidelbergmoscow collaboration and is well documented however the
analysis in kdhk makes an extraordinary claim and therefore requires very solid substantiation according to
another paper comment on evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay ceaalseth et al they state that a
large number of issues were not addressed in kdhk some of which are
1 there is no null hypothesis analysis demonstrating that the data require a peak furthermore no simulation has
been presented to demonstrate that the analysis correctly finds true peaks or that it would find no peaks if none
existed monte carlo simulations of spectra containing different numbers of peaks are needed to confirm the
significance of any found peaks
2 there are three unidentified peaks in the region of analysis that have greater significance than the 2039kev
peak there is no discussion of the origin of these peaks
3 there is no discussion of how sensitive the conclusions are to different mathematical models there is a
previous heidelbergmoscow publication that gives a lower limit of 19  1025 y 90 confidence level this is
in conflict with the best value of a newer kdhk paper of 15  1025 y this indicates a dependence of the
results on the analysis model and the background evaluation
in this paper they state that a number of other cross checks of the result should also be performed for example
there is no discussion of how a variation of the size of the chosen analysis window affects the significance of the
hypothetical peak there is no relative peak strength analysis of all the 214bi peaks quantitative evaluations
should be made on the four 214bi peaks in the region of interest there is no statement of the net count rate of the
peaks other than the 2039kev peak there being no presentation of the entire spectrum is difficult to compare
relative strengths of peaks there is no discussion of the relative peak strengths before and after the singlesiteevent cut
on the other hand the heidelbergmoscow group claims that the signal found at q is consisting of single site
events and is not a  line the signal does not occur in the ge experiments not enriched in the double beta emitter
76
ge while neighbouring background lines appear consistently in these experiments on this basis they translated
the observed numbers of events into halflives for neutrinoless double beta decay
the heidelbergmoscow experiment continued regularly from 1990 till 2003 the analysis of the full data taken
with the heidelbergmoscow experiment in the period 2 august 1990 until 20 may 2003 is presented the
completed heidelbergmoscow 76ge experiment 717 kg y after 13 years of operation presents their mass
calculation limit status as m ev  024  058  99997 cl with the best value of 04 ev 95 cl

5 the proposed majorana experiment
while an unambiguous interpretation of all of the neutrino oscillation experiments is not yet possible it is
abundantly clear that neutrinos exhibit properties not included in the standard model namely mass and flavor
mixing accordingly sensitive searches for neutrinoless doublebeta decay 0decay are more important than
ever experiments with large quantities of ge isotopically enriched in 76ge have thus far proven to be the most
sensitive specifically the heidelbergmoscow and igex experiments with lower limits in halflife sensitivities
191025 y and 161025 y respectively a new generation of experiments will be required to make significant
improvements in sensitivity one of which is the proposed majorana experiment
the majorana experiment is a nextgeneration ge doublebeta decay search which will employ 500 kg of ge
isotopically enriched to 86 in ge in the form of 200 detectors in a closepacked array for high granularity
each crystal will be electronically segmented with each region fitted with pulseshape analysis electronics a
halflife sensitivity is predicted of 42  1027 years or  m  002  007 ev depending on the nuclear matrix
elements used to interpret the data the majorana experiment is proposed for a us deep underground laboratory
and requires very little rd as it stands on the technical shoulders of the igex experiment and other previous
successful doublebeta decay and lowbackground experiments furthermore new segmented ge detector
technology has recently become commercially available while pacific northwest national laboratory
pnnluniversity of south carolina usc researchers have developed new pulseshape discrimination
techniques
several configurations have been evaluated with respect to cryogenic performance and background reduction and
rejection it will concentrate on a conventional modular design using ultralow background cryostat technology
developed by igex it will also utilize new pulseshape discrimination hardware and software techniques
developed by the majorana collaboration and detector segmentation to reduce background the heidelbergmoscow and igex experiments both utilized germanium enriched to 86 in 76ge and operated deep
 11 

underground the projection for the majorana is that the background will be reduced by a factor of 65 over the
early igex results prior to pulse shape analysis from 02 to 0003 kev1 kg1 y1 this will occur mainly by the
decay of the internal background due to cosmogenic neutron spallation reactions that produce 56co 58co 60co
65
zn and 68ge in the germanium by limiting the time above ground after crystal growth careful material selection
and electroforming copper cryostats one component of the background reduction will arise from the
segmentation and granularity of the detector array
most of the compton continuum consists of single compton scatterings followed by escape of the scattered
gamma ray whereas fullenergy events at typical gammaray energies are primarily comprised of multiple
scattering sequences followed by a photoelectric absorption the peaktocompton ratio can therefore be
enhanced by requiring a recorded event to correspond to more than one interaction within the detector before its
acceptance in germanium detectors this selection is usually accomplished by subdividing the detector into
several segments or providing several adjacent independent detectors and seeking coincident pulses from two or
more of the independent segments when coincidences are found the output from all detector segments is
summed and recorded the resulting spectrum is made up only of the fullenergy peak lying above a featureless
continuum that is greatly suppressed and has no abrupt compton edges new ge experiments must not simply be
a volume expansion of igex or heidelbergmoscow they must have superior background rejection and better
electronic stability the summing of 200 individual energy spectra can result in serious loss of energy resolution
for the overall experiment which can be avoided by segmenting ntype intrinsic ge detectors advanced psd
techniques and electronic stability in measurement

the above figure depicts a standard ge detector segmentation scheme this is the configuration of the sega
detector undergoing tests by the majorana collaboration a configuration with sixazimuthalsegment by twoaxialsegment geometry is shown in the above figure
efforts are thus on with the majorana experiment for the search of neutrinoless double beta decay that would give
a new shape to the standard model of physics majorana cannot not simply be a volume expansion of igex but
must have superior background rejection as it was conclusively shown that the limiting background in at least
some previous experiments has been cosmogenic activation of the germanium itself it is necessary to mitigate
those background sources cosmogenic activity fortunately has certain factors which discriminate it from the
signal of interest for example while 0 decay would deposit 2 mev between two electrons in a small
perhaps 1 mm3 volume internal 60co decay deposits about 318 kev endpoint in beta energy near the decaying
atom while simultaneous 1173 kev and 1332 kev gammas can deposit energy elsewhere in the crystal most
probably both in more than one location for a total energy capable of reaching the 2039 kev regionofinterest a
similar situation exists for internal 68ge decay thus depositionlocation multiplicity distinguishes doublebeta
decay from the important long lived cosmogenics in germanium isotopes such as 56co 57co 58co and 68ge are
produced at a rate of roughly 1 atom per day per kilogram on the earths surface only 60co and 68ge have both
the energy and halflife to be of concern to pursue the multiplicity parameter firstly the detector current pulse
shape carries with it the record of energy deposition along the electric field lines in the crystal that is the radial
 12 

dimension of cylindrical detectors this information may be exploited through pulseshape discrimination
secondly the electrical contacts of the detector may be divided to produce independent regions of charge
collection the ability of new techniques to be easily calibrated for individual detectors makes them practical for
large detector arrays calibration for singlesite event pulses was trivially accomplished by collecting pulses from
thorium ore the 261447kev gamma ray from 208tl produces a largely singlesite doubleescape peak at 159247
kev the psd discriminator was then calibrated to the properties of the doubleescape peak a slightly improved
doubleescape peak was be made from the 26al gamma ray of 293822kev the doubleescape appears at
191622 kev only about 120 kev away from the expected region of interest for 0decay the obvious and
direct use of pulse shape discrimination and segmentation is the rejection of cosmogenic pulses in the germanium
itself however the approach should be also effective on gamma rays from the shielding and structural materials
the background effects of neutrons of both high energy cosmic muon generated and low energy fission and
n from rock could be protected by the segmentation and granularity of the detectors these neutrons could
also produce other unwanted activities like the formation of 3h and 14c in nitrogen from high and low energy
neutrons respectively fortunately majorana detectors will not be surrounded by nitrogen at high density

the gerda germanium detector assembly which is another next generation 76ge double beta decay
experiment at the gran sasso underground laboratory has projected a sensitivity in the halflife of the 0decay mode which is less than the proposed majorana experiment in conclusion the majorana project has been
designed in a compact modular way such that it can be built and operated with high confidence in the approach
and the technology the initial years of construction will allow alternate cooling methods to be employed if they
have an advantage and should they be shown to overcome longterm concerns due to surface contamination
muoninduced ions and diffusion the majorana collaboration has made an extensive analysis of the predicted
backgrounds and their impact on the final sensitivity of the experiment the majorana experiment represents a
great increase in ge mass over igex with new segmented ge detectors and the newest electronic systems for
pulseshape discrimination their conclusion is that with 500 kg of ge enriched to 86 in the isotope 76ge the
majorana array operating over 10 years including construction time can reach a lower limit on t120 of 41027
years this corresponds to an upper bound of  m  of 0038  0007ev one advantage of 76ge is that it may
well be a candidate for a future more reliable microscopic calculation of the 0  decay nuclear matrix element
6 conclusion
neutrinoless double beta decay is thus one of the most sensitive approaches with great perspectives to test particle
physics beyond the standard model the possibilities to use 0 decay for constraining neutrino masses left
right symmetric models susy and leptoquark scenarios as well as effective lepton number violating couplings
have been reviewed it is a very sensitive probe to the lepton number violating terms in the lagrangian such as the
majorana mass of the light neutrinos righthanded weak couplings involving heavy majorana neutrinos as well
as higgs and other interactions involving violation of chirality conservation
 13 

in search for neutrinoless double beta decay 76ge as the source material has multiple advantages it has high
resolution  4 kev at q with no background from 2 mode a huge leap in sensitivity is possible applying
ultralow background techniques and 0  signal discrimination there can be a phased approach in the
experiment with the increment of target mass the source and detector are the same material thereby reducing
background and maintaining the 4 geometry and the only way to scrutinize 0  dbd claim on short time scale
since it tests t12 and not m the consequences of neutrinoless double beta decay are 1 total lepton number
violation the most important consequence of the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay is that lepton
number is not conserved this is fundamental for particle physics 2 majorana nature of neutrino another
fundamental consequence is that the neutrino is a majorana particle both of these conclusions are independent of
any discussion of nuclear matrix elements 3 effective neutrino mass the matrix element enters when we derive
a value for the effective neutrino mass  making the most natural assumption that the 0 decay amplitude is
dominated by exchange of a massive majorana neutrino
