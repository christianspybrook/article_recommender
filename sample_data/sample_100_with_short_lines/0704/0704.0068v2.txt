a note about the kiz
i1 functions
branko j maleevi
in the article 10 a petojevi verified useful properties of the ki z functions
which generalize kurepas 1 left factorial function in this note we present
simplified proofs of two of these results and we answer the open question stated
in 10 finally we discuss the differential transcendency of the ki z functions

a petojevi 7 p 3 considered the family of functions

for rz  0 especially for kurepas function kz it is true that kz  1 m0 1 1 z
for rz  0 according to 10 for various of values of parameters v m s a z from 1
different special functions as presented in 10 are obtained a petojevi has considered in the article 10 p 1640 the following sequence of functions

ki z 

1 m0 1 1 z

 i  1  1 m0 1 1 i  1

1 m1 1 1 i

for i  n and rz  i on the basis of the definition in 3 the following representation via kurepas function is true

for i  n and rz  i  1 note that k0  0 2 p 297 and therefore k1 z  kz
for rz  0 analytical and differentialalgebraic properties of kurepas function
kz are considered in articles 1  12 and in many other articles on the basis
of wellknown statements for kurepas function kz using representation 4 in
many cases we can get simple proofs for analogous statements for ki z functions
for example it is a wellknown fact that it is possible to analytically continue kurepas function to a meromorphic function with simple poles at integer points z  1
and z  m m  3 2 p 303 3 p 474 residues of kurepas function at
these poles have the following form 2

for kurepas function kz the infinite point is an essential singularity 3 hence
on the basis of 4 each function ki z is meromorphic with simple poles at integer
points z  i and z  i  m m  2 on the basis of 4 we have

for each ki z function the infinite point is an essential singularity therefore we get
theorem 33 from 10 next it is a wellknown fact that for kurepas function
the following asymptotic relation kx  x is true for real x such that x  
and where x is the gamma function 2 p 299 hence for fixed i  n and real
x  i1 on the basis of 4 we get

therefore we get theorem 36 from 10 next we give a solution to the open
problem stated in question 37 in 10 namely the following formula in the article
8 p 35 is given
ei1  i  1z 1  zz 1

for values z  c1 2 3 4    and i  1 in the previous formula eiz
and z a are exponential integral and incomplete gamma function respectively 8
then for fixed i  n and values z  ci i  1 i  2 i  3    on the basis of
4 and 10 we get

a note about the ki z
i1 functions

finally at the end of this note let us emphasize one differentialalgebraic fact for
the sequence of functions ki z on the basis of the formula 17 from the article
10 we can conclude that each ki z function satisfies the following recurrence relation i1 kiz  1  i1 kiz  z  i the previous relation can be used
to verify the differential transcendency of these functions as discussed in 11 12
therefore we can conclude that each ki z function is a differential transcendental
function ie it satisfies no algebraic differential equation over the field of complex rational functions
