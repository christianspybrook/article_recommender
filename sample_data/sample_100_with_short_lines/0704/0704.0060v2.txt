abstract
we investigate the coulomb excitation of lowlying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate
energy collisions elab  10  500 mevnucleon it is shown that the cross sections for the e1 and
e2 transitions are larger at lower energies much less than 10 mevnucleon retardation effects
and coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 mevnucleon and
as high as 500 mevnucleon implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed

unstable nuclei are often studied with reactions induced by secondary radioactive beams
examples of these reactions are elastic scattering fragmentation and coulomb excitation
by heavy targets coulomb excitation is specially useful since the interaction mechanism is
very well known 1 it is the result of electromagnetic interactions of a projectile zp ap 
with a target zt at  one of the participating nuclei is excited as it passes through the
electromagnetic field of the other here we will only consider the excitation of the projectile as is of interest in studies carried out in heavy ion facilities around the world eg
lnscatania nsclmsu gsi ganil riken etc in coulomb excitation a virtual photon with energy e is absorbed by the projectile because in pure coulomb excitation the
participating nuclei stay outside the range of the nuclear strong force the excitation cross
section can be expressed in terms of the same multipole matrix elements that characterize excitedstate gammaray decay or the reduced transition probabilities b ji  jf 
hence coulomb excitation amplitudes are strongly coupled with valuable nuclear structure information therefore this mechanism has been used for many years to study the
electromagnetic properties of lowlying nuclear states 1
coulomb excitation cross sections are large if the adiabacity parameter satisfies the condition

where a0 is half the distance of closest approach in a headon collision for a projectile
velocity v and ex  f i is the excitation energy this adiabatic cutoff limits the possible
excitation energies below 12 mev in subbarrier collisions a possible way to overcome this
limitation and to excite highlying states is to use higher projectile energies in this case
the closest approach distance at which the nuclei still interact only electromagnetically is
of order of the sum of the nuclear radii r  rp  rt  where p refers to the projectile
and t to the target for very high energies one has also to take into account the lorentz
contraction of the interaction time by means of the lorentz factor   1  v 2 c2 12  with
c being the speed of light for such collisions the adiabacity condition eq 1 becomes

from this relation one obtains that for bombarding energies around and above 100
mevnucleon states with energy up to 1020 mev can be readily excited 3
an appropriate description of coulomb excitation at intermediate energies elab

10  500 mevnucleon has been described in ref 2 in this energy region neither the
nonrelativistic coulomb excitation formalism described in ref 1 nor the relativistic one
formulated in refs 3 4 are appropriate this is discussed in details in ref 2 where it
is shown that the correct values of the coulomb excitation cross sections differ by up to
3040 when compared to the nonrelativistic and relativistic treatments used to calculate
experimental observables cross sections gammaray angular distributions etc
we follow the formalism of ref 2 to calculate cross sections for coulomb excitation from
energies varying from 10 to 500 mevnucleon these are the energies where most radioactive
beam facilities are or will be operating around the world the calculated cross sections will
be of useful guide for future experiments we also compare the accurate calculations with
those obtained by using simple analytical formulas and test the regime of their validity

are the reduced transition probabilities in these equations   1 sin2 with  being
the deflection angle a0  zp zt e2 m0 v 2 and a  a0  the complex functions s  are
integrals along coulomb trajectories corrected for retardation their calculation and how
they relate to the nonrelativistic and relativistic theories are described in details in ref 2
here we will introduce another comparison tool for the total cross section which is obtained
by integration of eq 3 over scattering angles the code coulint 2 was used to calculate
the orbital integrals s  and the cross sections of eq 3 for more details see ref 2
using the theory described in ref 4 it is easy to show that approximate values of the
cross sections for e1 e2 and m1 transitions can be obtained by means of the relations

here we will only consider the excitation of the lowest lying states in light and medium
heavy nuclei for nuclear masses a  20 the tunl nuclear data evaluation web site
was of great help 5 the electromagnetic transition rates at the tunl database are
given in weisskopf units and are transformed to the appropriate b ii  if values

comparison a few medium mass nuclei as well as a few stable nuclei were included in the
calculation other data were taken from refs 6 7 8 9
some cases of nuclei far from the stability line are very interesting and deserve further
study possibly using the method of coulomb excitation for example it is well known that
nuclei with open shells tend to have be2 values greater than 10 wu whereas nuclei with
shell closure of neutrons or protons tend to have distinctly smaller be2 values typical
examples of the latter category are the doubly magic nuclei

values are 317 and 158 wu respectively according to an empirical formula adjusted
to a global fit of the known transition rates the values of first excited 2 level e2  and

c based on this formula is at least one order of magnitude

larger than what is observed experimentally in a coulomb dissociation experiment 9 the
anomalously strong hindrance of the

16

c transition is not well explained theoretically this

is just an example of the power of coulomb excitation as a tool to access the new physics
inherent of poorly known rare nuclear species
another example is the strong e1 transition in

11

be

11

be is an archetype of a halo nu

cleus and exhibits the fastest known dipole transition between bound states in nuclei the
be1 transition strength between the ground and the only bound excited state at 032
mev was determined from lifetime measurements by millener et al to be 0116 e2 fm2 11
however coulomb excitation experiments have obtained a much smaller value of the be1
which is still a matter of investigation 12 13 14 it is thus seems clear that predictions
based on traditional nuclear structure and reaction theory often yields results in disagree4

ment with experimental data in spite of that when proper corrections are accounted for
eg channelcoupling nuclear excitation relativistic corrections coulomb excitation of radioactive beams is a powerful complementary tool to investigate electromagnetic properties
of nuclei far from the stability line
in table 1 we compare our calculations with several experimentally obtained cross sections
for coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei the units of energy are mev the laboratory
energy is in mevnucleon the bvalues are in units of e2 fm2  and the cross sections are
in millibarns the last two columns give the calculated cross sections obtained by using
eqs 3 and 5 respectively since the cross sections of eq 5 are functions of the minimum
impact parameter the values reported in the table have been calculated according to the
experimental angular ranges reported in the seventh column except for the

11

be case for

which the discrepancy between theory and experiment is known see discussion above the
calculated cross sections are close to the experimental values nonetheless the calculated
cross sections tend to be smaller than the experimental ones for

ar projectiles this is worrisome because the b values were extracted

from the experimentally obtained cross sections using equations similar to eq 5 these
experimental bvalues would have to be larger by 10  30 according to our calculations
it is important to stress the fact that many experimental data on unstable nuclei collected
up to now have been analyzed by means of theoretical tools dwba and coupledchannels
codes which do not include relativistic dynamics the inclusion of relativistic kinematics
is straightforward this problem was first addressed in ref 15 where it was shown
that the analysis of experimental data at intermediate energies without a proper treatment
of relativistic dynamics leads to wrong values of electromagnetic transition probabilities
we should stress that a full theoretical treatment of relativistic dynamics of strong and
electromagnetic interactions in manybody systems is very difficult and still does not exist

table 1 cross sections for coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei the units of energy
are mev the laboratory energy is in mevnucleon the bvalues are in units of e2 fm2 
and the cross sections are in millibarns the data for different experiments numbered 1 to
12 were collected from the references listed in column 1 the last two columns give the
calculated cross sections obtained by using eqs 3 and 5 respectively
in figure 1 we show a comparison between the experimental data and our calculations
we notice that the cross sections calculated with help of eq 5 are not much different than
those calculated with eq 3 they are systematically lower up to 10 than the exact
calculation following eq 3 as we discuss below this is not always the case specially for
the excitation of highlying states in fact this is a good check of eq 3 which is done in a
very different way than the analytical calculations of eq 5 but as we will see below this
agreement is not always the case specially when one includes small impact parameters for
which the sensitivity to the relativistic corrections is higher see ref 2 the dashed curve
in figure 1 is a guide to the eye it helps to see that the experimental cross sections are on
average larger than the calculated ones either with eq 3 open circles or with eq 5 open
triangles

table 2  cross sections in mb for coulomb excitation of projectiles incident on pb
targets at bombarding energies ranging from 10 to 500 mevnucleon the energy units are
mev the laboratory energy is in mevnucleon the bvalues are in units of e2 fm2

the cross sections for coulomb excitation of numerous projectiles incident on pb targets
at bombarding energies ranging from 10 to 500 mevnucleon are shown in table 2 these
cross sections were calculated assuming that the detectors collect events from all possible
coulomb scattering events in a real experimental situation the angular distribution is
restricted to angular windows reducing the available cross sections only the lowest lying
transitions have been considered ie from the ground to the first excited states one
observes that some cross sections are very large specially for

11

be

18

ne

30

ne and

54

ni

for these and other similar cases the measurements are easy to perform with a large
number of eventssecond even with modest intensities cases such as

16

c are well within

the experimental possibilities in most radioactive beam facilities
table 2 also shows that except for m1 excitations the coulomb excitation cross sections
decrease steadily as the energy increases from 10 to 500 mevnucleon based on these
numbers alone one could conclude that coulomb excitation of lowlying states in contrast
to the case of highlying states eg giant resonances 4 are better suited for studies at low
energies however reactions at lower energies while are less influenced by contamination due
to nuclear breakup 12 14 can give rise to large highorder effects 21 the interpretation
of data could be distorted as in the case of coulomb dissociation of 8 b at low energy 24
which was completely misinterpreted in terms of firstorder calculations in some situations
when higherorder effects are relevant the effect of the nuclear breakup cannot be neglected
either 22 23 thus the choice of the incident energy would depend on the experimental
conditions identification of gammarays from deexcitation using doppler shift techniques
are often more advantageous at higher energies moreover except for few cases eg

11

c the

magnetic dipole transitions are much smaller than those for e1 and e2 transitions even
for m1 transitions the measurements are under the possibility of most new experimental
facilities

the comparison of the exact calculations using eq 3 solid lines and the approximations
5 dashed lines are shown in figs 2ad for 11 be
case as well as for

12

11

b

54

ni and 16 o respectively the

16

o

c in table 2 was included for comparison with a highlying excited

state we see from figs 2a and 2b that the approximations in eq 5 work quite well for
the m1 multipolarity and reasonably well within 20 at 10 mevnucleon and 5 at 50
mevnucleon for the e1 cases but they fail badly at low and intermediate energies for

and 54 ni and of the

projectiles incident on pb targets as a function of the laboratory energy

the e2  fig 2c the reason is that the e2 coulomb field tidal field is very sensitive
to the details of the collision dynamics at low energies these conclusions can be deceiving
since even for the e1 and m1 cases the approximations in eq 5 may strongly differ from
the exact calculations if the excitation energy is large see discussion in ref 2 this is
shown in figure 2d where we plot the coulomb excitation cross section of the ex  1309
mev state in

16

o in this case the cross sections based on eq 5 is a factor of 10 smaller

than the exact calculation at 10 mevnucleon at 100 mevnucleon this difference drops
to 10 which still needs to be considered with care
in summary in this article we have used the formalism of ref 2 to predict the cross
sections for coulomb excitation of several light projectiles with electromagnetic transitions
found in the literature listed in the tunl database 5 and for a few other selected cases
these estimates will be useful for planing coulomb excitation experiments at present and
future heavy ion facilities it is evident that the inclusion of relativistic effects combined

10

with coulomb distortion are of the utmost relevance the cross section inferred by using
nonrelativistic or pure relativistic treatments can be wrong by up to 30 even at 100
mevnucleon as shown here and in ref 2 finally the use of coulomb excitation to
produce nuclei in highlying states is an important tool to study particle emission processes
for example the excitation of

18

ne and its subsequent decay by twoproton emission is a

process of large theoretical and experimental interest experimental work in this direction
is in progress 25
