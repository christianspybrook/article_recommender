we study the twoparticle wave function of paired atoms in a fermi gas with tunable interaction
strengths controlled by feshbach resonance the cooper pair wave function is examined for its
bosonic characters which is quantified by the correction of bose enhancement factor associated
with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators an example is given for a threedimensional uniform gas two definitions of cooper pair wave function are examined one of which
is chosen to reflect the offdiagonal long range order odlro another one corresponds to a pair
projection of a bcs state on the side with negative scattering length we found that paired atoms
described by odlro are more bosonic than the pair projected definition it is also found that at
kf a1  1 both definitions give similar results where more than 90 of the atoms occupy the
corresponding molecular condensates

introduction

recent advancement in the control of feshbach
molecules has given rise to many new experimental observations in the world of ultracold atomic gas 1 2 3 4 5
at sufficiently low temperatures fermionic atoms are
known to form pairs under an attractive interaction the
interaction strength can be manipulated by tuning magnetic fields near feshbach resonance which is characterized by a detuning energy between the close channel
bound state energy and the open channel collision threshold a positive detuning leads to a negative scattering
length in this regime paired atoms are loosely bound
upon negative detuning the scattering length becomes
positive and atoms can form bound molecules which
could further condense into a bec state unlike bosonic
molecules the statistics of interacting fermionic atoms is
dictated by pauli exclusion principle the ground state is
thus made up of a large number of modes even at zero
temperature one usually uses a bcs state to approximate the ground state at which fermions are paired up
according to their natural orbits 6 this is very different
from bec formed by pure bosons at zero temperature
which is well described by a single mode wave function
we may however expect upon a strong enough interaction paired fermionic atoms become so tightly bound
that they look just like bosons 7 in that case one natural question to ask is how alike are a fermionic pair and
a boson in this paper we address this question by constructing a cooper pair creation operator and examine
its bosonic properties across resonance
one fundamental feature that distinguishes fermions
from bosons is the commutation relation between their
creation and annihilation
operators for bosons the


commutator
c
c
is
one
while the anticommuta

is one for fermions for composite twotor c c
particles the corresponding commutator is not exactly
one 8 9 10 a useful indicator measuring the deviation
from the bosonic commutation relation is the m pairs

normalization factor m defined by h0 c m c m 0i 
m m  where 0i is the vacuum state the value of m
reflects the correction of bose enhancement factor and
was used to study ground state excitons statistics 8 9
and the connection to quantum entanglement 10 the
key quantity was shown to be the ratio m1 m which
goes to one for a perfect boson this ratio will be one
of our primary indicators of the bosonic characters of
cooper pairs
however there has been an ambiguity in defining the
explicit form of a cooper pair wave function ortiz et al
11 have given a discussion at length on this matter in
12 yang showed that offdiagonal long range order exists in a superconducting state and is characterized by a
dominant eigenvector of the twoparticle density matrix
the eigenvector is sometimes recognized as a cooper pair
wave function on the other hand the pair projection
wave function of a bcs state 13 is also a candidate
both cooper pair wave functions will be examined in
this paper their bosonic characters are compared and
we shall discuss their suitability as a bosonic mode in a
fermi gas
in this paper we employ the onechannel approach to
discuss the crossover phenomena at zero temperature 11
15 16 17 specifically a bcs state will be used as our
ground state wave function

here n and n are the annihilation operators of two spin
components of fermonic atoms n denotes the quantum
number of pairing orbit and n and n are amplitudes
subjected to normalization constraint n 2  n 2  1
the number
p of atoms in each spin component is given
by n  n n 2  in this paper we will use the solution
of n  n in homogeneous systems for trapped systems
the amplitudes can be determined by methods described
in refs 18 19

bosonic tests

we begin by reviewing some tests on the bosonic characters of a particle operator consider the annihilation
operator of a composite particle defined by

eq 3 gives the number of composite particles existing
in the gas to quantify how bosonic
 the c molecule is
we study the commutator c c   note however only
expectation value of the commutator is given in eq 4
not the commutator itself how close the expectation
value to unity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for c to be bosonic to actually compare c with a
pure boson operator we adopt the views pointed out in
refs8 9 10 it was suggested that the bosonic characters should be quantified by the normalization factor
m  where
h0 c m c m 0i  m m 

5

m is obviously 1 if c is a perfect boson it is often more
convenient to look at the ratio m1 m  since
r
m 
c m i 
m m  1i  m i 
6
m1
where m i is a correction term orthogonal to m  1i
and it has the norm given by
m
m1
hm m i  1  m
 m  1

7
m1
m
so we see that the ratio m1 m plays the role of a
correction of bose enhancement factor with respect to a
many body state it tells us how the gas differs from
being bosonic when one more pair of atoms is added
to or removed from a m pairs gas the closer it is to
one the less a correction it is the criterion of a perfect
boson is m1 m  1 only then is hm m i zero in
this paper we will examine the case with m  n  which
is the number of atoms of one of the spin components in
the gas
in the case of fermions and if n  1 combescot et al

where z0 can be solved from the equation 9

from this last equation the ratio can be solved numerically in refs 8 9 the correction factor in 6 has been
studied in exciton systems here we will apply eq 9 to
atomic cooper pairs with n defined in the next section
one of the general features is that the n 1 n would
deviate more from unity when the density of atoms increases this is because when the pair density is large
atoms within each pair would see the pauli effect from
atoms in nearby pairs
it is useful to indicate the meaning of eqs 8 and
9
a simple model let us consider k 2 
p through
1
 k kc  for k  kc and zero otherwise where kc is
the extension of the wave function in momentum space
such that the two particle wave function has a spatial
radius  1kc  it can then be shown that eq 9 reads
n 1
n
n 6 2

noting that 1kc
is the spatial volume of our pair wave
function n is the maximum number of pairs in a total
volume v  the second term in eq 10 is thus the volume
occupied by all cooper pairs over the total volume in
the bcs limit where a cooper size is large kc  fermi

cooper pair wave functions

we now discuss two choices of n in defining the
cooper pair wave functions first it was shown in
12 that the long range correlation r1  r1   
r2  r2     in a paired state is reflected in the eigenvalue decomposition of the two particle density matrix

note that the bcs state given in eq 16 is in fact a

the second term in c  c is smaller than unity while
the first term is of order n  so as long as the number
of particles is large the second term can be dropped in
the large n limit c  c is just the eigenvalue given in
11 we remark that eq 13 was also recognized by
leggett 20 as a form of cooper pair wave function and
recently salasnich et al have made use of the definition
to calculate the condensate fraction 15
there is however another way of defining a cooper
pair based on the single pair projection from a bcs state

where the integration can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals 16 the fermi momentum is defined

as kf  6 2 
 which is the reciprocal of the interatomic distance an important dimensionless parameter
is kf a1  the bcs limit is indicated by kf a1

1 the bec limit corresponds to kf a  1 and the
1
crossover occurs at kf a  0 15 16 some integrals
used are listed in the appendix for reference
using eq 21 for k and k  we evaluate eq 14
15 and eq 19 20 in fig 1 we plot the fraction
of condensation in the gas as a function of the dimensionless parameter kf a1  with either choice of k 
the fraction goes to one in the bec limit kf a1  1
notice that c  c n is an appreciably higher fraction
than c  c  n  showing a dominant condensation of
atoms into the pair wave function defined in 12


the expectation value of the commutator h c c  i as
a function of kf a1 is shown in fig 2 again both
definitions of k give unity in the bec limit but eq
15 is always closer to one than eq 20
next we calculate the factor n 1 n  by solving
eq 9 numerically for k and k  we obtain the ratios
n 1 n and n 1 n from eq 8 these ratios are
shown in fig 3 as a function of kf a1  we see that
n 1 n is closer to one throughout the transition region together with the tests based on expectation values
above k defined eq 13 seems to be a more suitable
choice for the bosonic description of paired atoms
our calculations indicate an interesting region roughly
at 2  kf a1  2 where cooper pairs transit from being nonbosonic to bosonic note that it does not require

conclusion

to conclude three indicators were used to quantify
the bosonic characters of a cooper
 pair
 in an interacting fermi gas  a hc  ci b h c c  i c n 1 n 
two different definitions of a cooper pair were examined
n  n n and n  n n  our calculations suggest
that the latter one provides a better description of the
cooper pairs as bosonic particles moreover as the fraction of composite particles goes to one in the bec limit
the gas is basically in its simplest single mode it appears
that using either one of the two definitions makes little

fig 4 color online momentum distribution in units of
kf  of two different cooper pair wave functions k  k k
blue line and k  k k red dashed line in a the bcs
limit two definitions differ significantly while in c the bec
limit two definitions overlap see text

differences in the strong coupling regime kf a1  1
this is consistent with the results in ref 11 in which
the authors addressed the similarity of both definitions
as shown in fig 4 the difference between 13 and 18
on the bcs side is that the former only takes into account of a few momentum states on the fermi surface
whereas the latter one takes the average of all states inside the fermi sphere in a weakly interacting gas only
atoms lying on the fermi surface interact effectively the
composite particle based on 13 would thus be more
bosonic since it takes into account the dominant correlated states in the deep bec limit the fermi sphere is
totally smeared out and either choice of n would weigh
different momentum states on an almost equal footage
resulting in the merge of two different pictures
if the system is not in the bec limit we have shown
that the bosonic character of a cooper pair depends on
how the pair wave function is defined our work here
is an attempt to identify what definition is more effective to reveal a cooper pair as a boson from an experimental point of view it is interesting to search for
observables associated with c or c   so that one can
probe the the quantum statistics of cooper pairs directly
we also remark that our method can in principle be extended to nonuniform systems however the coefficients
n and n  which are calculated from the natural orbits

5
18 19 do not have closed forms for analytical discussions the question how a trapping potential affects the
bosonic properties of cooper pairs is an open problem
for future studies

the integrals are expressed in terms of k and e which
are respectively the complete elliptic integral of the first
and second kind we also need pn  legendre function of
the first kind of degree n
