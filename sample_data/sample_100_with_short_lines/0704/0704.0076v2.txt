1 introduction
it took thirtyseven years from the discovery of a tiny cp violating effect of order
103 in kl      1 to a first observation of a breakdown of cp symmetry outside
the strange meson system a large cp asymmetry of order one between rates of
initial b 0 and b 0 decays to jks was measured in summer 2001 by the babar and
belle collaborations2 a sizable however smaller asymmetry had been anticipated
twenty years earlier 3 in the framework of the kobayashimaskawa km model
of cp violation4 in the absence of crucial information on b quark couplings the
asymmetry was observed in a timedependent measurement as suggested5 thanks
to the long b 0 lifetime and the large b 0 b 0 mixing6 the measured asymmetry
fixing in the standard phase convention7 the sine of the phase 2  21  
2argvtb vtd  of the topquark dominated b 0 b 0 mixing amplitude was found to
be in good agreement with other determinations of cabibbokobayasimaskawa
ckm parameters89 including a recent precise measurement of bs bs mixing10

 which seems to be unable
this showed that the ckm phase   3   argvub
to account for the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry11 is the dominant
source of cp violation in flavorchanging processes with this confirmation the next
pressing question became whether small contributions beyond the ckm framework
occur in cp violating flavorchanging processes and whether such effects can be
observed in beauty decays
one way of answering this question is by overconstraining the ckm unitarity
triangle through precise cp conserving measurements related to the lengths of the

sides of the triangle an alternative and more direct way focusing on the origin
of cp violation in the ckm framework is to measure  and  in a variety of b
decay modes different values obtained from asymmetries in several processes or
values different from those imposed by other constraints could provide clues for
new sources of cp violation and for new flavorchanging interactions such phases
and interactions occur in the low energy effective hamiltonian of extensions of the
standard model sm including models based on supersymmetry12
in this presentation we will focus on the latter approach based primarily on
cp asymmetries using also complementary information on hadronic b decay rates
which are expected to be related to each other in the ckm framework in the
next section we outline several of the most relevant processes and the theoretical
tools applied for their studies quoting numerous papers where these ideas have
been originally proposed and where more details can be found13 sections 3 4 and
5 describe a number of methods in some detail summarizing at the end of each
section the current experimental situation section 6 discusses several tests for np
effects while section 7 concludes
2 processes methods and new physics effects
whereas testing the km origin of cp violation in most hadronic b decays requires
separating strong and weak interaction effects in a few golden modes cp asymmetries are unaffected by strong interactions for instance the decay b 0  jks
is dominated by a single treelevel quark transition b  ccs up to a correction
smaller than a fraction of a percent14151617 thus the asymmetries measured
in this process and in other decays dominated by b  ccs have already provided a
rather precise measurement of sin 2181920
sin 2  0678  0025

this value permits two solutions for  at 213 and at 687 timedependent angular studies of b 0  jk 0 21 and timedependent dalitz analyses of b 0 
dh0 d  ks      h0   0   22 measuring cos 2  0 have excluded the
second solution at a high confidence level implying
  213  10

since b 0  jks proceeds through a ckmfavored quark transition contributions to the decay amplitude from physics at a higher scale are expected to be
very small potentially identifiable by a tiny direct asymmetry in this process or in
b   jk  23
another process where the determination of a weak phase is not affected
by strong interactions is b   dk   proceeding through treelevel amplitudes
b  cus and b  cs the interference of these two amplitudes from d0 and d0
which can always decay to a common hadronic final state leads to decay rates and
a cp asymmetry which measure very cleanly the relative phase  between these

amplitudes2425 the trick here lies in recognizing the measurements which yield
this fundamental cpviolating quantity physics beyond the sm is expected to have
a negligible effect on this determination of  which relies on the interference of two
tree amplitudes
b decays into pairs of charmless mesons such as b   or b   and
b  k or b  k   involve contributions of both tree and penguin amplitudes which carry different weak and strong phases142627 contrary to the case
of b  dk the determination of  and  using cp asymmetries in charmless b
decays involves two correlated aspects which must be considered its dependence
on strong interaction dynamics and its sensitivity to potential new physics np
effects this sensitivity follows from the ckm and loop suppression of penguin amplitudes implying that new heavy particles at the tev mass range replacing the
w boson and the topquark in the penguin loop may have sizable effects28  in
order to claim evidence for physics beyond the sm from a determination of  and
 in these processes one must handle first the question of dynamics there are two
approaches for treating the dynamics of charmless hadronic b decays
1 study systematically strong interaction effects in the framework of qcd
2 identify by symmetry observables which do not depend on qcd dynamics
the first approach faces the difficulty of having to treat precisely long distance
effects of qcd including final state interactions remarkable theoretical progress
has been made recently in proving a leadingorder in 1mb  factorization formula
for these amplitudes in a heavy quark effective theory approach to perturbative
qcd293031 however there remain differences between ways of treating in different approaches power counting the scale of wilson coefficients endpoint quark distribution functions of light mesons and nonperturbative contributions from charm
loops32 also the nonperturbative input parameters in these calculations involve
nonnegligible uncertainties these parameters include heavytolight form factors
at small momentum transfer lightcone distribution amplitudes and the average
inverse momentum fraction of the spectator quark in the b meson the resulting
inaccuracies in calculating magnitudes and strong phases of amplitudes prohibit a
precise determination of  from measured decay rates and cp asymmetries also
the calculated rates and asymmetries cannot provide a clear case for physics beyond the sm in cases where the results of a calculation deviate slightly from the
measurements
in the second approach one applies isospin symmetry to obtain relations among
several decay amplitudes for instance using the distinct behavior under isospin of
tree and penguin operators contributing in b   a judicious choice of observables permits a determination of  or   2        33 the same analysis
applies in b decays to pairs of longitudinally polarized  mesons in case that an
observable related to the subdominant penguin amplitude is not measured with
sufficient precision it may be replaced in the analysis by a ckmenhanced su3related observable in which a large theoretical uncertainty is translated to a small

error in  the precision of this method is increased by including contributions of
higher order electroweak penguin amplitudes which are related by isospin to tree
amplitudes3435 with sufficient statistics one should also take into account isospinbreaking corrections of order md  mu qcd  0023637 and an effect caused by
the  meson width38 a similar analysis proposed for extracting  in b  k 3940
requires using flavor su3 instead of isospin for relating electroweak penguin contributions and tree amplitudes3541 while flavor su3 is usually assumed to be
broken by corrections of order ms  md qcd  03 in this particular case a
rather precise recipe for su3 breaking is provided by qcd factorization reducing
the theoretical uncertainty in  to only a few degrees42
charmless b decays which are sensitive to physics beyond the sm 28  provide a
rich laboratory for studying various signatures of np a large variety of theories have
been studied in this context including supersymmetric models models involving
treelevel flavorchanging z or z  couplings models with anomalous threegaugeboson couplings and other models involving an enhanced chromomagnetic dipole
operator4344 the following effects have been studied and will be discussed in
section 6 in a modelindependent manner
1 within the sm the three values of  extracted from b   b  k and
b   dk  are equal as we will explain these three values are expected to be
different in extensions of the sm involving new low energy fourfermion operators
behaving as i  32 in b   and as i  1 in b  k
2 other signatures of anomalously large i  1 operators contributing to
b  k are violations of isospin sum rules holding in the sm for both decay rates
and cp asymmetries in these decays454647

3 timedependent asymmetries in b 0   0 ks  b 0  ks and b 0    ks
and in other b  s penguindominated decays may differ substantially from the
asymmetry sin 2 sin mt predicted approximately in the sm264348 significant
deviations are expected in models involving anomalous s  1 operators behaving
as i  0 or i  1
4 an interesting question which may provide a clue to the underlying new
physics once deviations from sm predictions are observed is how to diagnose the
value of i in np operators contributing to s  1 charmless b decays we will
discuss an answer to this question which has been proposed recently49

3 determining  in b  dk
in this section we will discuss in some length a rather rich and very precise method
for determining  in processes of the form b  d k   which uses both charged
and neutral b mesons and a large variety of final states it is based on a broad idea
that any coherent admixture of a state involving a d0 from b  cus and a state
with d0 from b  cs can decay to a common final state2425 the interference
between the two channels b  d0 k   d0  fd and b  d0 k   d0

fd  involves the weak phase difference  which may be determined with a high
theoretical precision using a suitable choice of measurements effects of d0 d0
mixing are negligible50 while some of these processes are statistically limited
combining them together is expected to reduce the experimental error in  in
addition to quasi twobody b decays the d or d in the final state may be
accompanied by any multibody final state with quantum numbers of a kaon25
each process in this large class of neutral and charged b decays is characterized
by two pairs of parameters describing complex ratios of amplitudes for d0 and d0

in threebody decays of b and d mesons such as b  dk and d  k the two
pairs of parameters rb  b  and rf  f  are actually functions of two corresponding
dalitz variables describing the kinematics of the above threebody decays the
sensitivity of determining  depends on rb and rf because this determination relies
on an interference of d0 and d0 amplitudes for d decay modes with rf  1 see
discussion below the sensitivity increases with the magnitude of rb 
for each of the eight subclasses of processes b 0  d k 0  one may
study a variety of final states in neutral d decays the states fd may be divided
into four families distinguished qualitatively by their parameters rf  f  defined in
eq 3

3 fd  flavor state53 k     k     0  etc rf  tan2 c 
4 fd  3body selfconjugate state54 ks      rf  f vary across the dalitz
plane
in the first family cpodd states occur in cabibbofavored d0 and d0 decays
while cpeven states occur in singly cabibbosuppressed decays the second family
of states occurs in singly cabibbosuppressed decays the third family occurs in
cabibbofavored d0 decays and in doubly cabibbosuppressed d0 decays while
the last state is formally a cabibbofavored mode for both d0 and d0 
the parameters rb and b in b  d k  depend on whether the b meson
is charged or neutral and may differ for k vs k  55 and for d vs d  where a
neutral d can be observed in d  d 0 or d  d56 the ratio rb involves
a ckm factor vub vcs vcb vus   04 in both b  and b 0 decays and a colorsuppression factor in b  decays while in b 0 decays both b  cus and b  cs
amplitudes are colorsuppressed a rough estimate of the colorsuppression factor in
these decays may be obtained from the colorsuppression measured in corresponding
ckmfavored decays b  d d  d d  where the suppression is found to
be in the range 03  0557 thus one expects rb b 0   04 rb b    03

05rb b 0  in all the processes b 0  d k 0  we note that threebody b 
decays such as b   d0 k   0  are not colorsuppressed making these processes
advantageous by their potentially large value of rb which varies in phase space5859
the above comparison of rb b   and rb b 0  may be quantified more precisely
by expressing the four ratios rb b 0 rb b   in b  d k  in terms of reciprocal ratios of known magnitudes of amplitudes60

and neglecting the second amplitude on the righthandside which is pure
annihilation62 this amplitude is expected to be suppressed by a factor of four or
five relative to the other two amplitudes appearing in 6 which are colorsuppressed

this agrees with values of rb b 0  near 04 and rb b   between 01 and 02 note
that in spite of the expected larger values of rb in b 0 decays from the point
of view of statistics alone without considering the question of flavor tagging and
the efficiency of detecting a ks in b 0  d k 0  b  and b 0 decays may fare
comparably when studying  this follows from 5 because the statistical error on
 scales roughly as the inverse of the smallest of the two interfering amplitudes
we will now discuss the actual manner by which  can be determined using
separately three of the abovementioned families of final states fd  we will mention advantages and disadvantages in each case for illustration of the method we
will consider b   fd k   we will also summarize the current status of these

in order to avoid dependence of rcp on errors in d0 and dcp branching ratio

 up to a discrete ambiguity in practice this method is sensitive to rb

rcp  rcp 2  1  rb  this becomes very difficult for charged b decays
where one expects rb  01  02 but may be feasible for neutral b decays where
rb  04 an obvious signature for a nonzero value of rb would be observing a
difference between rcp and rcp which is linear in this quantity

studies of b   dcp k   b   dcp k  and b   dcp

rcp  rcp at 26 standard deviations measured in b   dcp k  64 is probably a statistical fluctuation a larger difference is anticipated in b 0  dcp k 0 
as the value of rb in this process is expected to be three or four times larger than
in b   dk   see eq 7 higher statistics is required for a measurement of 
using this method

where a multiplicative correction 1  orb rf   101 has been neglected in 14
these two observables involve three unknowns rb  b  f and  one assumes
rf to be given by the measured ratio of doubly cabibbosuppressed and cabibbo
favored branching ratios thus one needs at least two flavor states fd and fd

for which two pairs of observables rf  af  and rf   af   provide four equations
for the four unknowns rb  b  f  b  f    the strong phase differences f  f 
can actually be measured at a   charm factory67 thereby reducing the number of
unknowns to three
while the decay rate in the numerator of rf is rather low the asymmetry af
may be large for small values of rb around 01 as it involves two amplitudes with
a relative magnitude rf rb 
so far only upper bounds have been measured for rf implying upper limits
on rb in several processes rb b   dk    02686970 rb b   d k   
0268 rb   dk    0471 and rb b 0  dk 0   046372 further constraints on rb in the first three processes have been obtained by studying d decays
into cpeigenstates and into the state ks      using rb b 0  dk 0 rb b  
dk    37  03 in 7 and assuming that rb b   dk   is not smaller
than about 01 one may conclude that a nonzero measurement of rb b 0  dk 0 
should be measured soon the signature for b 0  d0 k 0 events would be two
kaons with opposite charges
33 fd  ks    
the amplitude for b   ks     d k  is a function of the two invariantmass
variables m2  pks  p 2  and may be written as
ab   ks     d k    f m2  m2   rb eib  f m2  m2  

16

in b  decay one replaces m  m     the function f may be written as a
sum of about twenty resonant and nonresonant contributions modeled to describe
the amplitude for flavortagged d0  ks     which is measured separately7374
this introduces a modeldependent uncertainty in the analysis using the measured
function f as an input and fitting the rates for b   ks     d k  to the
parameters rb  b and  one then determines these three parameters
the advantage of using d  ks     decays over cp and flavor states is
being cabibbofavored and involving regions in phase space with a potentially large
interference between d0 and d0 decay amplitudes the main disadvantage is the
uncertainty introduced by modeling the function f

the second analysis are correlated with smaller values of the extracted parameters rb

the nonzero asymmetry measured in b 0  k    provides first evidence for
an interference between penguin p   and tree t   amplitudes with a nonzero relative strong phase such an interference occurs also in b   k   0 where no
asymmetry has been observed an assumption that other contributions to the latter asymmetry are negligible has raised some questions about the validity of the
ckm framework in fact a colorsuppressed tree amplitude c   also occurring in
b   k   0 86 resolves this puzzle if this amplitude is comparable in magnitude
to t   indeed several studies have shown that this is the case9091929394 also implying that colorsuppressed and colorfavored ewp amplitudes are of comparable
magnitudes35 for consistency between the two cp asymmetries in b 0  k   
and b   k   0  the strong phase difference between c  and t  must be negative
and cannot be very small95 this seems to stand in contrast to qcd calculations
using a factorization theorem293194
the small asymmetry acp b   k   0  implies bounds on the sine of the
strong phase difference c between t   c  and p   the cosine of this phase affects
rc  1 involving the decay rates for b   k 0   and b   k 0    a question
studied recently is whether the two upper bounds on  sin c  and  cos c  are consistent with each other or perhaps indicate effects of np consistency was shown

that these i  1 corrections are suppressed by a small ratio of nonpenguin to
penguin amplitudes and are therefore negligible100 indeed this sum rule holds
experimentally within a 5 error101 one expects the other sum rule 37 to hold

relations between cp asymmetries in b  k and b   following from
approximate flavor su3 symmetry of qcd 102 are not expected to hold as precisely as isospin relations but may still be interesting and useful an important
question relevant to such relations is how to include su3breaking effects which
are expected to be at a level of 2030 here we wish to discuss two su3 relations proposed twelve years ago103104 one of which holds experimentally within
expectation providing some lesson about su3 breaking while the other has a an
interesting implication for future applications of the isospin analysis in b  
a most convenient proof of su3 relations is based on using a diagramatic
approach in which diagrams with given flavor topologies replace reduced su3

that while the b isospin triangle is roughly equalsided the b triangle is squashed

with constraints on  from cp conserving measurements related to the sides of the
unitarity triangle89 the values of  obtained in b  d k  and b  k
are consistent with those extracted in b     but are not yet sufficiently
precise for testing small np effects in charmless b decays further experimental
improvements are required in particular in the former two types of processes
while the value of  in b  d k  is not expected to be affected by np
the other two classes of processes involving penguin loops are susceptible to such
effects the extraction of  in b    assumes that  is the phase of a i 
32 tree amplitude while an additional i  32 ewp contribution is included
using isospin the extracted value could be modified by a new i  32 effective
operator originating in physics beyond the sm but not by a new i  12 operator
similarly the value of  extracted in b  k is affected by a potential new i  1
operator but not by a new i  0 operator because the amplitude 28 playing
an essential role in this method is pure i  1

charmless s  1 b and bs decays are particularly sensitive to np effects as
new heavy particles at the tev mass range may replace the the w boson and topquark in the penguin loop dominating these amplitudes28 the sum rule 36 for

from isospin considerations it is only affected by quadratic i  1 amplitudes

the sum rule cannot be separated from sm corrections which are by themselves at

hadronic uncertainties at a level of several percent of order 2    02 it has been
pointed out some time ago105 that it is difficult to separate these hadronic uncertainties within the sm from np contributions to decay amplitudes if the latter are
small in the next subsection we will discuss indirect experimental evidence showing
that np contributions to s and c must be small corrections to s  cp sin 2
and values for the asymmetries c have been calculated in the sm using methods

for   2 which can be argued for several of the above decays using qcd
arguments106107 or su3 fits109 note that while p is measurable in certain
decay rates up to first order corrections c and  involve sizable hadronic uncertainties in qcd calculations in contrast to this expectation the central values measured for s are negative for all decays see table iii consequently one finds an
averaged value sin 2eff  05300520 to be compared with sin 2  06780025
two measurements which seem particularly interesting are cp sks  039018
where a positive correction of a few percent to sin 2 is expected in the sm106107
and cp s0 ks  033  021 where a rather large positive correction to sin 2 is
expected shifting this asymmetry to a value just above 0890
while the current averaged value of sin 2eff is tantalizing experimental errors
in s and c must be reduced further to make a clear case for physics beyond the
sm assuming that the discrepancy between improved measurements and calculated values of s and c persists beyond theoretical uncertainties can this provide a clue to the underlying new physics since many models could give rise to
a discrepancy284344 one would seek signatures characterizing classes of models
rather than studying the effects in specific models one way of classifying extensions
of the sm is by the isospin behavior of the new effective operators contributing to
b  sq q transitions
64 diagnosis of i for new physics operators
fourquark operators in the effective hamiltonian associated with np in b  sq q
transitions can be either isoscalar or isovector operators we will now discuss a study
proposed recently in order to isolate i  0 or i  1 operators thus determining
corresponding np amplitudes and cp violating phases49 we will show that since s
and c in the above processes combine i  0 or i  1 contributions separating
these contributions requires using also information from other two asymmetries
which are provided by isospinreflected decay processes
two s  1 charmless b or bs  decay processes related by isospin reflection

a proof of this relation uses a sign change of clebschgordan coefficients under m 
m49 the description 48 applies in particular to pairs of processes involving
all the b 0 decay modes listed in table iii and b  decay modes where final states
are obtained by isospin reflection from corresponding b 0 decay modes decay rates

one may take one step further under the assumption that strong phases associated with np amplitudes are small relative to those of the sm and can be
neglected110 this assumption which must be confronted by data is reasonable
because rescattering from a leading b  scc amplitude is likely the main source
of strong phases while rescattering from a smaller b  sq q np amplitude is then
a secondorder effect in the convention 55 where the strong phase of bp is set

violating phase of a i  1 np amplitude and the imaginary part of a i  0 np
amplitude in certain cases eg b  k or b    ks  stringent upper bounds on
sm contributions to b and a may suffice if some of the four measured asymmetries

conclusion there exists ample experimental evidence in pairs of isospinreflected
b  s penguindominated decays that potential np amplitudes must be small
assuming that these amplitudes involve negligible strong phases and assuming that
small sm nonpenguin contributions are calculable or can be strictly bounded one
may determine the magnitude and cp violating phase of a np i  1 amplitude
and the imaginary part of a np i  0 amplitude in each pair of isospinreflected
decays
65 null or nearlynull tests
we have not discussed null tests of the ckm framework111 evidence for physics
beyond the standard model may showup as small nonzero asymmetries in processes where they are predicted to be extremely small in the ckm framework a
wellknown example is b      0  where the cp asymmetry is expected to be a
small fraction of a percent including ewp amplitudes3435 we have only discussed
exclusive hadronic b decays where qcd calculations involve hadronic uncertainties a more robust calculation exists for the direct cp asymmetry in inclusive
radiative decays b  xs  found to be smaller than one percent112 the current
upper limit on this asymmetry is at least an order of magnitude larger113
timedependent asymmetries in radiative decays b 0  ks  0  for a ks  0
invariantmass in the k  region and for a larger invariantmass range including
this region are interesting because they test the photon helicity predicted to be
dominantly righthanded in b 0 decays and lefthanded in b 0 decays105114 the
asymmetry suppressed by ms mb  is expected to be several percent in the sm
and can be very large in extensions where spinflip is allowed in b  s while
dimensional arguments seem to indicate a possible larger asymmetry in the sm
of order qcd mb  10115 calculations using perturbative qcd 116 and qcd
factorization 117 find asymmetries of a few percent the current averaged values
for the k  region and for a larger invariantmass range including this region are

cp violation in beauty decays

surements must be improved in order to become sensitive to the level predicted in
the sm or to provide evidence for physics beyond the sm
7 summary
the standard model passed with great success numerous tests in the flavor sector
including a variety of measurements of cp asymmetries related to the ckm phases
 and  small potential new physics corrections may occur in s  0 and s 
1 penguin amplitudes affecting the extraction of  and modifying cpviolating
and isospindependent asymmetries in s  1 b 0 decays and isospinrelated b 
decays higher precision than achieved so far is required for claiming evidence for
such effects and for sorting out their isospin structure
similar studies can be performed with bs mesons produced at hadron colliders
and at e e colliders running at the 5s resonance timedependence in bs 
ds k  and bs  j or bs  j measures  and the small phase of the
bs bs mixing amplitude119 comparing timedependence and angular analysis in
bs  j with b  s penguindominated processes including bs   bs 
k  k   bs  k 0 k 0 provides a methodic search for potential np effects work
on bs decays has just begun at the tevatron120 one is looking forward to first
results from the lhc
