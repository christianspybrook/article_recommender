abstract
this paper considers the propagation of shallowwater solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variablecoefficient kortewegde vries equation we use the whitham averaging method using
a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations this general
approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of
isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography
and bottom friction modeled by the chezy law but also importantly to study the
effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration in particular it is shown that the combined
action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with
the same initial amplitude this nonlocal effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions
within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth
which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to
the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media

introduction

there have been many studies of the propagation of water waves over a slope sometimes
also subject to the effects of bottom friction many of these works have considered linear
waves or have been numerical simulations in the framework of various nonlinear longwave
model equations our interest here is in the propagation of weakly nonlinear long water
1

waves over a slope simultaneously subject to bottom friction a combination apparently
first considered by miles 1983ab albeit for the special case of a single solitary wave or a
periodic wavetrain an appropriate model equation for this scenario is the variablecoefficient
perturbed kortewegde vries kdv equation see grimshaw 1981 johnson 1973ab

here ax t is the free surface elevation above the undisturbed depth hx and cx 
p
ghx is the linear long wave phase speed the bottom friction term on the righthand
side is represented by the chezy law modelling a turbulent boundary layer here cd is a
nondimensional drag coefficient often assumed to have a value around 001 miles 1983ab
other forms of friction could be used see for instance grimshaw et al 2003 but the chezy
law seems to be the most appropriate for water waves in a shallow depth in 1 the first
two terms on the lefthand side are the dominant terms and by themselves describe the
propagation of a linear long wave with speed c the remaining terms on the lefthand
side represent respectively the effect of varying depth weakly nonlinear effects and weak
linear dispersion the equation is derived using the usual kdv balance in which the linear
dispersion represented by  2 x2  is balanced by nonlinearity represented by a here we
have added to this balance weak inhomogeneity so that cx c scales as h2  3 x3  and weak
friction so that cd scales with hx within this basic balance of terms we can cast 1
into the asymptotically equivalent form

this form shows that in the absence of friction term ie when cd  0 equation 2
has two integrals of motion with the densities proportional to h14 a and h12 a2  these
are often referred to as laws for the conservation of mass and momentum however
these densities do not necessarily correspond to the corresponding physical entities indeed
to leading order the momentum density is proportional to the wave action flux while
the mass density differs slightly from the actual mass density this latter issue has been
explored by miles 1979 where it was shown that the difference is smaller than the error
incurred in the derivation of equation 4 and is due to reflected waves
our main concern in this paper is with the behaviour of an undular bore over a slope
in the presence of bottom friction using the perturbed kdv equation 2 where we were
2

originally motivated by the possibility that the behaviour of a tsunami approaching the
shore might be modeled in this way the undular bore solution to the unperturbed kdv
equation can be constructed using the wellknown gurevichpitaevskii gp 1974 approach
see also fornberg and whitham 1978 in this approach the undular bore is represented
as a modulated nonlinear periodic wave train the main feature of this unsteady undular
bore is the presence of a solitary wave which is the limiting wave form of the periodic
cnoidal wave at its leading edge the original initialvalue problem for the kdv equation is
then replaced by a certain boundaryvalue problem for the associated modulation whitham
equations we note however that so far the simplest xtsimilarity solutions of the
modulation equations have been used for the modelling of undular bores in various contexts
see grimshaw and smyth 1986 smyth 1987 or apel 2003 for instance these solutions
while effectively describing many features of undular bores are degenerate and fail to capture even qualitatively some important effects associated with nonselfsimilar modulation
dynamics in particular in the classical gp solution for the resolution of an initial jump
in the unperturbed kdv equation the amplitude of the lead solitary wave in the undular
bore is constant twice the value of the initial jump on the other hand the modulation
solution for the undular bore evolving from a general monotonically decreasing initial profile
shows that the lead solitary wave amplitude in fact grows with time gurevich krylov and
mazur 1989 gurevich krylov and el 1992 kamchatnov 2000 as we shall see the very
possibility of such variations in the modulated solutions of the unperturbed kdv equation
has a very important fluid dynamics implication in a general setting the undular bore lead
solitary wave cannot be treated as an individual kdv solitary wave but rather represents a
part of the global nonlinear wave structure in other words while at every particular moment
of time the lead solitary wave has the spatial profile of the familiar kdv soliton generally
the temporal dependence of its amplitude cannot be obtained in the framework of single
solitary wave perturbation theory
in the unperturbed kdv equation the growth of the lead solitary wave amplitude is
caused by the spatial inhomogeneity of the initial data here however the presence of a
perturbation due to topography andor friction serves as an alternative andor additional
cause for variation of the lead solitary wave amplitude thus in the present case the
variation in the amplitude will have two components which generally of course cannot be
separated because of the nonlinear nature of the problem one is local described by the
adiabatic perturbation theory for a single solitary wave and the other one is nonlocal which
in principle requires the study of the full modulation solution depending on the relative
values of the small parameters associated with the slope friction and spatial nonuniformity
of the initial modulations we can take into account only one of these components or a
combination of them
the structure of the paper is as follows first in section 2 we reformulate the basic model
1 as a constantcoefficient kdv equation perturbed by terms representing topography
and friction then we derive in section 3 the associated perturbed whitham modulation
equations using methods recently developed by kamchatnov 2004 next in section 4 this
whitham system is integrated in the solitarywave limit our purpose here is primarily to
obtain the equation of a multiple characteristic which defines the leading edge of a shoaling
undular bore in the case when the modulations due to the combined action of the slope and
bottom friction are small compared to the existing spatial modulations due to nonuniformity
of the initial data as a byproduct of this integration we reproduce and extend the known
3

results on the adiabatic variation of a single solitary wave miles 1983ab then in section
5 we carry out an analogous study of a cnoidal wave propagating over a gradual slope and
subject to friction a case studied previously by miles 1983 b but under the restriction of
zero mean flow which is removed here finally in section 6 we study effects of a gradual
slope and bottom friction on the front of an undular bore which represents a modulated
cnoidal wave transforming into a system of weakly interacting solitons near its leading edge

problem formulation

for the purpose of the present paper it is convenient to recast 2 into the standard kdv
equation form with constant coefficients modified by certain perturbation terms thus we

in this form the governing equation 7 has the structure of the integrable kdv equation
on the lefthand side while the separate effects of the varying depth and the bottom friction
are represented by the two terms on the righthand side this structure enables us to use
the general theory developed in kamchatnov 2004 for perturbed integrable systems
for much of the subsequent discussion it is useful to assume that hx  constant
cd  0 for x  0 in the original equation 1 which corresponds to f t   gt   0 for
t  0 in 7 we shall also assume that a  0 for x  0 at t  0 which corresponds to
u  0 for x  0 on x   t  see 6 then we shall propose two types of initialvalue
problem for 1 and correspondingly for 7
a let a solitary wave of a given amplitude a0 initially propagating over a flat bottom
without friction ie a soliton described by an unperturbed kdv equation enter the variable
topography and bottom friction region at t  0 x  0 fig 1 a
b let an undular bore of a given intensity propagate over a flat bottom without friction
the corresponding solution of the unperturbed kdv equation will be discussed in section
5 let the lead solitary wave of this undular bore have the same amplitude a0 and enter
the variable topography and bottom friction region at t  0 x  0 fig 1b
in particular we shall be interested in the comparison of the slow evolution of these
two initially identical solitary waves in the two different problems described above the
expected essential difference in the evolution is due to the fact that the lead solitary wave
in the undular bore is generally not independent of the remaining part of the bore and can
exhibit features that cannot be captured by a local perturbation analysis the wellknown
example of such a behaviour when a solitary wave is constrained by the condition of being
a part of a global nonlinear wave structure is provided by the undular bore solution of the
kdvburgers kdvb equation

figure 1 isolated solitary wave a and undular bore b entering the variable topographybottom friction region
indeed the undular bore solution of the kdvb equation 9 is known to have a solitary
wave at its leading edge see johnson 1970 gurevich  pitaevskii 1987 avilov krichever
 novikov 1987 and this solitary wave a is asymptotically close to a soliton solution
of the unperturbed kdv equation and b has the amplitude say a0  that is constant in
time at the same time it is clear that if one takes an isolated kdv soliton of the same
amplitude a0 as initial data for the kdvburgers equation it would damp with time due
to dissipation the physical explanation of such a drastic difference in the behaviour of an
isolated soliton and a lead solitary wave in the undular bore for the same weakly dissipative
kdvb equation is that the action of weak dissipation on an expanding undular bore is
twofold on the one hand the dissipation tends to decrease the amplitude of the wave
locally but on the other hand it squeezes the undular bore so that the interaction ie
momentum exchange between separate solitons within the bore becomes stronger than in
the absence of dissipation and this acts as the amplitude increasing factor the additional
momentum is extracted from the upstream flow with a greater depth see benjamin and
lighthill 1954 as a result in the case of the kdvb equation an equilibrium nonzero
value for the lead solitary wave amplitude in the undular bore is established of course
for other types of dissipation a stationary value of the lead soliton amplitude would not
necessarily exist but in general due to the expected increase of the soliton interactions near
the leading edge the amplitude of the lead soliton of the undular bore would decay slower
than that of an isolated soliton indeed the presence here of variable topography as well
can result in an additional nonlocal amplitude growth
while the problem a can be solved using traditional perturbation analysis for a single
solitary wave which leads to an ordinary differential equation along the solitary wave path
see miles 1983ab the undular bore evolution problem b requires a more general approach
which can be developed on the basis of whithams modulation theory leading to a system of
three nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations of the first order since the whitham
5

method being equivalent to a nonlinear multiple scale perturbation procedure contains the
adiabatic theory of slow evolution of a single solitary wave as a particular albeit singular
limit it is instructive for the purposes of this paper to treat both problems a and b using
the general whitham theory

modulation equations

the original whitham method whitham 1965 1974 was developed for conservative constantcoefficient nonlinear dispersive equations and is based on the averaging of appropriate conservation laws of the original system over the period of a singlephase periodic travelling
wave solution the resulting system of quasilinear equations describes the slow evolution
of the modulations ie of the mean value the wavenumber the amplitude etc of the periodic travelling wave here that approach is extended to the perturbed kdv equation 6
following the general approach of kamchatnov 2004 which extends earlier results for certain specific cases see gurevich and pitaevskii 1987 1991 avilov krichever and novikov
1987 and myint and grimshaw 1995 for instance
we suppose that the evolution of the nonlinear wave is adiabatically slow that is the
wave can be locally represented as a solution of the corresponding unperturbed kdv equation
ie 7 with zero on the righthand side with its parameters slowly varying with space and
time the onephase periodic solution of the kdv equation can be written in the form

that is the solution 10 is parameterized by the zeroes 1  2  3 of the polynomial p 
in a modulated wave the parameters 1  2  3 are allowed to be slow functions of x and
t  and their evolution is governed by the whitham equations for the unperturbed kdv
equation the evolution of the modulation parameters is due to a spatial nonuniformity
of the initial distributions for j  j  1 2 3 and the typical spatiotemporal scale of the
modulation variations is determined by the scale of the initial data
in the case of the perturbed kdv equation 7 the evolution of the parameters 1  2  3
is caused not only by their initial spatial nonuniformity but also by the action of the
weak perturbation so that generally at least two independent spatiotemporal scales for
the modulations can be involved however at this point we shall not introduce any scale
separation within the modulation theory and derive general perturbed whitham equations
assuming that the typical values of f t  and gt  are oj t j x within the
modulation theory
it is instructive to first introduce the whitham equations for the perturbed kdv equation

where pj and qj are the standard expressions for the conserved densities kruskal integrals
and fluxes of the unperturbed kdv equation just as in the whitham 1965 theory for
unperturbed dispersive systems the number of conservation laws required is equal to the
number of free parameters in the travelling wave solution which is three in the present case

the system 21 describes slow evolution of the parameters j in the cnoidal wave solution
10
along with these derived perturbed conservative form of the whitham equations we
introduce the wave conservation law which is a general condition for the existence of slowly
modulated singlephase travelling wave solutions 10 see for instance whitham 1974 and
must be consistent with the modulation system 21 this conservation law has the form

because the actual wavenumber and frequency related to the physical variables x t are
different quantities from those in 23 but are related through the transformations 3 6 
the wave conservation law 22 can be introduced instead of any of three inhomogeneous
averaged conservation laws comprising the whitham system 21
it is known that the whitham system for the homogeneous constantcoefficient kdv
equation can be represented in diagonal riemann form whitham 1965 1974 by an appropriate choice of the three parameters characterising the periodic travelling wave solution
in fact in our solution 7 the parameters j have already been chosen so that they coincide
with the riemann invariants of the unperturbed kdv modulation system introducing them
explicitly into the perturbed system 21 we obtain see kamchatnov 2004

are the whitham characteristic velocities corresponding to the unperturbed kdv equation
it should be noted that the straightforward realisation of the above lucid general algorithm for obtaining perturbed modulation system in diagonal form is quite a laborious task
in fact to derive system 24 the socalled finitegap integration method incorporating the
integrable structure of the unperturbed kdv equation has been used the modulation system 24 in a more particular form corresponding to specific choices of the perturbation term
was obtained by myint and grimshaw 1995 using a multiplescale perturbation expansion
in that latter setting the wave conservation law 22 is an inherent part of the construction
while in the averaging approach used here it can be obtained as a consequence of the system
24
to obtain an explicit representation of the whitham equations for the present case of
equation 7 we must substitute the perturbation r from the righthand side of 7 and
perform the integration 17 with u given by 10 from now on we are going to consider
only the flows where u  0 so that the perturbation term assumes the form

the equations 27  31 provide a general setting for studying the nonlinear modulated
wave evolution over variable topography with bottom friction in the absence of the perturbation terms ie when f t   0 gt   0 the system 27 31 indeed coincides with
the original whitham equations whitham 1965 for the integrable kdv dynamics in that
case the variables 1  2  3 become riemann invariants so in this general perturbed case
we shall call them riemann variables
it is important to study the structure of the perturbed whitham equations 27  31 in
two limiting cases when the underlying cnoidal wave degenerates into i a smallamplitude
sinusoidal wave linear limit when 2  3 m  0 and ii into a solitary wave when
2  1 m  1 since in both these limits the oscillations do not contribute to the mean
flow they are infinitely small in the linear limit and the distance between them becomes
infinitely long in the solitary wave limit one should expect that in both cases one of the
whitham equations will transform into the dispersionless limit of the original perturbed
kdv equation 7 ie

we see that in both cases one of the riemann variables taken with inverted sign coincides
with the solution of the dispersionless equation 32 recall that in the derivation of the
whitham equations we assumed u  0 everywhere namely u  hui  1 when 2  3
m  0 and u  hui  3 when 2  1 m  1
to conclude this section we present expressions for the physical wave parameters such as
the surface elevation wave amplitude a mean elevation hai speed and wavenumber in terms
of the modulation solution j x t  using 6 and 10 we obtain for the wave amplitude

where the dependence of hui on j x t  j  1 2 3 is given by 18 and x  xx t
t  t x t by 3 6 in order to obtain the physical wavenumber  and the frequency 
we first note that the phase function x t  defined in 11 is replaced by a more general
expression defined so that k  x and kv  t are the wavenumber and frequency in
the x  t coordinate system then we define the physical phase function x t  x t

note that the physical frequency is the wavenumber in the x  t coordinate system
and that the physical phase speed is  since the validity of the kdv model 1 requires
inter alia that the wave be rightgoing it follows from this expression that the modulation
solution remains valid only when hv  6g of course the validity of 1 also requires that
the amplitude remains small and this would normally also ensure that v remains small

modulation solution in the solitary wave limit

in this section we shall integrate the perturbed modulation system 27 along the multiple
characteristic corresponding to the merging of two riemann variables 2 and 1  as we shall
see later this characteristic specifies the motion of the leading edge of the shoaling undular
bore in the case when the perturbations due to variable topography and bottom friction can
be considered as small compared with the existing spatial modulations within the bore at
the same time as the case 2  1  ie m  1 corresponds to the solitary wave limit in the
travelling wave solution 10 our results here are expected to be consistent with the results
from the traditional perturbation approach to the adiabatic variation of a solitary wave due
to topography and bottom friction see miles 1983ab
in the limit m  1 the periodic solution 10 of the kdv equation goes over to its solitary
wave solution

are the solitary wave amplitude and velocity respectively the solution 38 depends on two
parameters 1 and 3 whose adiabatic slow evolution is governed by the reduced modulation
system 34 it is important that the second equation in this system is decoupled from
the first one hence evolution of the pedestal 3 on which the solitary wave rides can
be found from the solution of this dispersionless equation by the method of characteristics
when 3 x t  is known evolution of the parameter 1 can be found from the solution of
the first equation 34 as a result we arrive at a complete description of adiabatic slow
evolution of the solitary wave parameters taking account of its interaction with the given
pedestal
however it is important to note here that while this description of the adiabatic evolution
of a solitary wave is complete as far as the solitary wave itself is concerned it fails to describe
the evolution of a trailing shelf which is needed to conserve total mass see for instance
johnson 1973b grimshaw 1979 or grimshaw 2006 this trailing shelf has a very small
amplitude but a very large length scale and hence can carry the same order of mass as
the solitary wave but note that the momentum of the trailing shelf is much smaller than
that of the solitary wave whose adiabatic deformation is in fact governed to leading order by
conservation of momentum or more precisely by conservation of wave action flux strictly
speaking conservation only in the absence of friction
the situation simplifies if the solitary wave propagates into a region of still water so
that there is no pedestal ahead of the wave that is 3  0 in x   t  but then since
3  0 is an exact solution of the degenerate whitham system 34 for this solitary wave
configuration we can put 3  0 both in the solitary wave solution

this expression determines implicitly the dependence of x on t along the solitary wave path
and provides the desired equation for the multiple characteristic of the modulation system

the formula 50 yields the restriction for the relative amplitude   ah  2 which is
clearly beyond the applicability of the kdv approximation wave breaking occurs already
at   07 see whitham 1974 in the frictionless case cd  0 equation 48 gives
ah  a0 h0 h2  and so the expression 50 for the speed must fail as h  0 it is interesting
to note that this failure of the kdv model as h  0 due to appearance of infinite and
further negative solitary wave speeds is not apparent from the expression 48 for the
solitary wave amplitude and the implication is that the model cannot be continued as
h  0 curiously this restriction of the kdv model seems never to have been noticed before
in spite of numerous works on this subject note that taking account of bottom friction
leads to a more complicated formula for the solitary wave speed as a function of h but the
qualitative result remains the same
it is straightforward to show from 46 or 48 that

it follows immediately that for a wave advancing into increasing depth hx  0 the amplitude decreases due to a combination of increasing depth and bottom friction however for
a wave advancing into decreasing depth there is a tendency to increase the amplitude due
to the depth decrease but to decrease the amplitude due to bottom friction hence whether
or not the amplitude increases is determined by which of these effects is larger and this in
turn is determined by the slope the depth and the consolidated drag parameter cd a0 h0 
to illustrate let us consider the bottom topography in the form

which satisfies the condition h0  h0  the parameter  characterizes the slope of the bottom in this case the formula 48 becomes

if  6 13 one can see now that if   13 then the bottom friction term is relatively

which is independent of the initial amplitude a0  this expression is consistent with the smallamplitude kdv approximation as long as 3  1cd is order unity simple inspection of

thus for 13    12 as for the case   13 the amplitude will increase as the depth
decreases in spite of the presence of sufficiently small friction however for   13 even
although there is usually some initial growth in the amplitude eventually even small bottom
friction will rtake effect and the amplitude decreases to zero we note that if   13 then

the integral 0 h3 dx in 48 diverges logarithmically as h  0 which just slightly modifies
the result 55 for h  h0 and implies growth of the amplitude  ln hh as h  0

these expressions 56 57 were obtained by miles 1983ab using wave energy conservation
as above note however that in miles 1983ab the numerical coefficient is 154 rather
than 158 thus these results obtained from the whitham theory are indeed consistent at
the leading order with the traditional perturbation approach for a slowlyvarying solitary
wave

adiabatic deformation of a cnoidal wave

next we consider a modulated cnoidal wave 10 in the special case when the modulation does
not depend on x while this case is strictly speaking impractical as it assumes there is an
infinitely long wavetrain it can nevertheless provide some useful insights into the qualitative
effects of gradual slope and friction on undular bores which are locally represented as cnoidal
waves in the absence of friction the slow dependence of the cnoidal wave parameters on t
was obtained by ostrovsky  pelinovsky 1970 1975 and miles 1979 see also grimshaw
2006 assuming that the surface displacement had a zero mean ie hui  0 while
the effects of friction were taken into account by miles 1983b using the same zeromean
displacement assumption however this assumption is inconsistent with our aim to study
undular bores where the value of hui is essentially nonzero hence we need to develop a
14

more general theory enabling us to take into account variations in all the parameters in the
cnoidal wave such a general setting is provided by the modulation system 27
thus we consider the case when the riemann variables in 27 do not depend on the
variable x so that the general whitham equations become ordinary differential equations
in t  which can be conveniently reformulated in terms of the original spatial xcoordinate
using the relationship 44

where all variables are defined above in section 3 see 28 29 30 this system can be readily

indeed the wave conservation law 22 in absence of xdependence assumes the form

the equation set 59 61 62 comprise a closed modulation system for three independent
modulation parameters say m p and m while this system is not as convenient for further
analysis as the system 27 in riemann variables it does not have a restriction u  0 inherent
in 27 and allows for some straightforward inferences regarding the possible existence of
modulation solutions with zero mean elevation that is with m  0 indeed one can see
that the solution with the zero mean is actually not generally permissible when cd 6 0 a
situation overlooked in miles 1983b indeed m  0 immediately then implies that p  0
by 61 but then due to 59 we have all three modulation parameters fixed which is clearly
inconsistent with the remaining equation 62 except for the trivial case m  0 p  0
q  0 however in the absence of friction when cd  0 equation 61 uncouples and
permits a nontrivial solution with a zero mean in general when cd  0 equations 61
62 can be easily integrated to give

then using 18 19 59 one readily gets the formula for the variation of the modulus m
and hence of all the other wave parameters as a function of h

figure 2 dependence of the modulus m on the physical space coordinate x in the cases
without and with bottom friction in the xindependent modulation solution
formula 64 generalises to the case m 6 0 ie d 6 0 the expressions of ostrovsky 
pelinovsky 1970 1975 miles 1979 and grimshaw 2006 note that in grimshaw 2006
the zero mean restriction in actually not necessary we note here that again with cd  0
equation 5 implies conservation of hbi and hb 2 i the averaged wave action flux which
together with 59 also yield 64
the physical frequency  and wavenumber  in the modulated periodic wave under study
are given by the formula 37 and we recall here that k  2l is constant see 59 as
discussed before at the end of section 3 we must require that the phase speed stays positive as
the wave evolves and here that requires that the physical wavenumber   0 since ah and
hence hv 6g is supposed to be small within the rangeof applicability of the kdv equation
2 the expression 37 implies the behaviour    gh which of course agrees with the
well known result for linear waves on a sloping beach see johnson 1997 for instance this
effect will be slightly attenuated for the nonlinear cnoidal wave since v h6g  0 but the
overall effect will be a squeezing of the cnoidal wave a result important for our further
study of undular bores next we study numerically the combined effect of slope and friction
on a cnoidal wave
as we have shown in the presence of chezy friction m 6 0 and we have also assumed
that u  0 which is necessary when we come to study undular bores now we use the
stationary modulation system 58 in riemann variables which was derived using this assumption we solve the coupled ordinary differential equation system 58 for the case of a

figure 4 dependence of the surface elevation amplitude a on the space coordinate x dashed
line corresponds to the frictionless case and solid line to the case with bottom friction
on x is shown for both cases we see that for the frictionless case m  1 with decrease
of depth ie the wave crests assume the shape of solitary waves when one approaches the
shoreline when cd 6 0 the modulus also grows with decrease of depth but never reaches
unity the dependence on x of the mean surface elevation hai for the cases without and
with friction is shown in fig 3 we have checked that the wavelength l 59 is constant
for both solutions also one can see from fig 3 right that the value h14 hai  d is indeed
conserved in the frictionless case but is not constant if friction is present the same holds
true for the value h12 ha2 i   but we do not present the graph here finally in fig 4 the
dependence of the physical elevation wave amplitude a on the spatial coordinate x is shown
one can see that the amplitude adiabatically grows with distance in the frictionless case
due to the effect of the slope without friction but not unexpectedly gradually decreases
in the case when bottom friction is present where the decrease for these parameter settings
is comparable in magnitude to the effect of the slope in both cases the main qualitative
17

changes occur in the wave shape and the wavelength
overall we can infer from these results that the main local effect of a slope and bottom
friction on a cnoidal wave along with the adiabatic amplitude variations is twofold a wave
with a m  1 at x  0 tends to transform into a sequence of solitary waves as x decreases
and at the same time the distance between subsequent wave crests tends to decrease this
is in sharp contrast with the behaviour of modulated cnoidal waves in problems described
by the unperturbed kdv equation where growth of the modulus m is accompanied by an
increase of the distance between the wave crests generally in the study of behaviour of
unsteady undular bores in the presence of a slope and bottom friction we will have to deal
with the combination of these two opposite tendencies

undular bore propagation over variable topography
with bottom friction
gurevichpitaevskii problem for flatbottom zerofriction case

we now turn to the problem b outlined in section 2 we study the evolution of an undular
bore developing from an initial surface elevation jump   0 located at some point x0  0
as discussed below the undular bore will expand with time so that at some t  t0 its lead
solitary wave enters the gradual slope region which begins at x  0 see fig 1b we assume
that for x  0 one has h  h0  constant and cd  0 we shall first present a formulation
of the gurevichpitaevskii problem for the perturbationfree kdv equation and reproduce
the wellknown similarity modulation solution describing the evolution of the undular bore
until the moment it enters the slope we emphasize that although this formulation and
especially this similarity solution are known very well and have been used by many authors
some of the inferences important for the present application to fluid dynamics have not been
widely appreciated as far as we can discern pertinent to our main objective in this paper
we undertake a detailed study of the characteristics of the whitham modulation system in
the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore solution and show that the boundary conditions of gurevichpitaevskii type permit only two possible characteristics configurations
implying two qualitatively different types of the leading solitary wave behaviour next we
shall show how this gurevichpitaevskii formulation of the problem applies to the perturbed
modulation system in the form 27 and finally we will study the effects of the perturbation
on the modulations in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore
in the case of a flat frictionless bottom the original equation 1 becomes the constantcoefficient kdv equation which can be cast into the standard form

the evolution 69 leads to wavebreaking of the rprofile at some   b  with the
consequence that the dispersive term in the kdv equation then comes into play and an
undular bore forms which can be locally represented as a singlephase travelling wave this
travelling wave is modulated in such a way that it acquires the form of a solitary wave at the
leading edge      and gradually degenerates via the nonlinear cnoidalwave regime to
a linear wave packet at the trailing edge      it is important that this undular bore
is essentially unsteady ie the region          expands with time

the characteristic velocities in 72 are given by 31 we stress that although analytical
expressions 70 and 10 as well as 72 and the homogeneous version of 27 are identical
they are written for completely different sets of variables both dependent and independent
the riemann invariants rj   are subject to special matching conditions at the free
boundaries      defined by the conditions m  0 trailing edge and m  1 leading
edge formulated in gurevich and pitaevskii 1974 see also kamchatnov 2000 or el

these equations 75 essentially represent kinematic boundary conditions for the undular
bore see el 2005 indeed the double characteristic velocity v2 r1  r3  r3   v3 r1  r3  r3  can
be shown to coincide with the linear group velocity of the smallamplitude kdv wavepacket
while the double characteristic velocity v2 r1  r1  r3   v1 r1  r1  r3  is the soliton speed
one might infer from this gp formulation of the problem that since the leading edge of
the undular bore specified by 75 77 is a characteristic of the modulation system then
the value of the double riemann invariant r   r2  r1 is constant then on considering an
undular bore propagating into still water where r  0 one would obtain from the matching
condition 74 at the leading edge that r3   0 and thus the amplitude of the lead solitary
wave a  2r3 r1   r  would always be constant as well however this contradicts
the general physical reasoning that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave should be allowed
to change in the case of general initial data the apparent contradiction is resolved by noting
that the leading edge specified by 75 77 can be an envelope of the characteristic family
ie a caustic rather than necessarily a regular characteristic and hence there is no necessity
for the double riemann invariant r  to be constant along the curve      in general case
on the other hand since the leading edge is defined by the condition m  1 the wave form
at the leading edge will coincide with the spatial profile of the standard kdv soliton thus
we arrive at the conclusion that in general the amplitude of the leading kdv solitary wave
will vary even in the absence of the perturbation terms of course in the unperturbed kdv
equation such varying solitary waves cannot not exist on their own and require the presence
of the rest of the undular bore we also stress that these variations of the leading solitary
wave in the undular bore as described here have a completely different physical nature to
the variations of the parameters of an individual solitary wave due to small perturbations as
described in section 4 they are caused by nonlinear wave interactions within the undular
bore rather than by a local adiabatic response of the solitary wave to a perturbation induced
by topography and friction importantly for our study however it will transpire that the
action of these same perturbation terms on the undular bore can lead to both a local and a
nonlocal response of the leading solitary wave

undular bore developing from an initial jump

next we consider the simplest solution of the modulation system which describes an undular
bore developing from an initial discontinuity placed at the point x  x0  in    variables we have the initial conditions

for   0 

 0  0

for   0 

78

where   0 is a constant then on using 69 the initial conditions 78 are readily
translated into the freeboundary matching conditions 73 74 for the riemann invariants
because of the absence of a length scale in this problem the corresponding solution of the
modulation system must depend on the selfsimilar variable    alone which reduces
the modulation system to the ordinary differential equations

this modulation solution 81 82 see fig 5a represents the replacement due to averaging over the oscillations of the unphysical formal threevalued solution of the dispersionless
kdv equation ie of the hopf equation which would have taken place in the absence of
the dispersive regularisation by the undular bore we see that 82 describes an expansion
fan in the characteristic  plane and thus is a global solution substituting 81 82
into the travelling wave solution 70 one obtains the asymptotic wave form of the undular
bore see fig 5b which then can be readily represented in terms of the original physical
variables using the relationships 68
the equations of the trailing and leading edges of the undular bore are determined from
82 by putting m  0 and m  1 respectively

the leading solitary wave amplitude is 0  2r3 r1   2 which is exactly twice the height
of the initial jump this corresponds to the amplitude of the surface elevation a  3h0  see
68 note that to get the leading solitary wave of the same initial amplitude a0 as for the
21

separate solitary wave considered in section 4 one should use the jump value 0  a0 3h0 
  where 
   3h0 2 is the initial discontinuity in the surface

structure of the undular bore front

we are especially interested in the behaviour of the modulation solution 81 82 in the
vicinity of the leading edge      this behaviour is essentially determined by the
manner in which the pair of characteristics corresponding to the velocities v2 and v1 merge
into a multiple eigenvalue v  of the modulation system at     
first one can readily infer from the modulation solution 81 82 that the phase velocity
c  2r1  r2  r3   21  m  v2  m 0 for m  1 and c  v2 for m  1 thus
any individual wave crest generated at the trailing edge of the undular bore moves towards
the leading edge ie for any crest m  1 as    thus for any particular wave crest
except for the very first one the solitary wave status is achieved only asymptotically as
  
without loss of generality we assume in this section that   1 in 81 82 first as
we have already mentioned the characteristic family 2  dd  v2 is an expansion fan in
the    plane

behaviour outside the undular bore it follows from the matching condition 74 and the
limiting structure 34 of the characteristic velocities of the whitham system that the
characteristics from the family 3 match with the hopf equation characteristics dd  6r
carrying the value of the riemann invariant r  0 corresponding to still water upstream the
undular bore therefore the sought external characteristics are simply vertical lines   c3 
the qualitative behaviour of the characteristics from the family 3 is shown in fig 6b
it is clear from the asymptotic behaviour of the characteristics that the edge characteristic
     corresponding to the motion of the leading solitary wave intersects only with
characteristics of the family 3 carrying the riemann invariant value r3  0 into the undular
bore domain since according to the matching condition 80 r3  0 everywhere along the
edge characteristic one can infer that the leading solitary wave motion is completely specified
by its amplitude at   0 indeed in this case the leading edge represents a genuine multiple
characteristic of the modulation system along which the riemann invariant r   r2  r1 is
a constant given the constant value of r1  1 for the solution 82 one infers that the
amplitude of the lead soliton of the selfsimilar undular bore 0  2r3  r    2 is also a
constant value thus in the undular bore evolving from an initial jump the leading solitary
wave represents an independent soliton of the kdv equation of course this fact follows
directly from the modulation solution 82 but now we have established its meaning in the
context of the characteristics which will play an important role below
next we discuss the structure of the undular bore front in the case when the initial
profile  0 is not a simple jump discontinuity and instead has the form of a monotonically
decreasing function for instance 12 when   0 and  0  0 for   0 in that case
the modulation solution for the undular bore no longer possesses xtsimilarity as in the

jump resolution case and as a result the speed and therefore the amplitude of the lead
solitary wave is not constant for instance for the aforementioned squareroot initial profile
the amplitude of the lead solitary wave grows as  2 see gurevich krylov and mazur 1989
or kamchatnov 2000 clearly such an amplitude variation is impossible if the leading edge
   was a regular characteristic carrying a constant value of the riemann invariant r   as
discussed above however the gp matching conditions 73 77 admit another possibility
the leading edge curve is the envelope of the characteristic families 1  dd  v1 and 2 
dd  v2 merging when m  1 this configuration is shown in fig 7a in this case the
behaviour of the modulus m in the vicinity of the leading edge is given by the asymptotic
formula found in gurevich  pitaevskii 1974

where the function r   6 constant is assumed to be known another specific feature of
this general configuration is that dr12 d   as     see fig 7b  also found in
gurevich  pitaevskii 1974 see also kamchatnov 2000 which is in drastic contrast with
similarity solution see fig 6a this particular difference was discussed in relation with
undular bores in the kdvburgers equation in gurevich and pitaevskii 1987
in summary we see from 92 that the structure of the modulation solution in the vicinity of the leading edge of an undular bore defined as a characteristic envelope is qualitatively
different compared to that for the similarity case see 85 the more general but qualitatively similar to 92 asymptotic formula which takes into account small perturbations
due to a variable topography and bottom friction will be derived later at the moment
it is important for us that in this configuration when the leading edge is a characteristic
envelope rather than just a characteristic the value r   and thus the leading solitary wave
amplitude are allowed to vary
the analysis of the corresponding modulation solution in gurevich krylov and mazur
1989 showed that while in the case of an initial jump the wave crests generated at the
trailing edge reach the leading edge and therefore transform into solitary waves only
asymptotically as t   for the more general case of decreasing initial data each wave
24

crest generated at the trailing edge reaches the leading edge in finite time and replaces
overtakes the existing leading solitary wave this process is manifested as a continuous
amplitude growth of the apparent leading solitary wave as in classical soliton theory
an alternative explanation of the leading solitary wave amplitude growth can be made in
terms of the momentum exchange between the instantaneous leading solitary wave and
solitary waves of greater amplitude coming from the left indeed as the rigorous analysis of
lax levermore and venakides showed see lax levermore and venakides 1994 and the
references therein the whole modulated structure of the undular bore can be asymptotically
described in terms of the interactions of a large number of kdv solitons initially packed
into a nonoscillating largescale initial profile
this latter interpretation is especially instructive for our purposes our point is that
the specific cause of the enhanced soliton interactions resulting in amplitude growth at the
leading edge is not essential it can be largescale spatial variations of the initial profile as
just described but it could also equally well be an effect of small perturbations in the kdv
equation itself indeed in the weakly perturbed kdv equation the local wave structure
of the undular bore must be described to leading order by the periodic solution 70 of
the unperturbed kdv equation so if one assumes the gp boundary conditions analogous to
73  77 for the perturbed modulation system 27 one invariably will have to deal with
one of the two possible types of the characteristics behaviour shown in figs 7a and 8a
in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore because this qualitative behaviour
is determined only by the structure of the gp boundary conditions and by the associated
asymptotic structure of the characteristic velocities of the whitham system for 1  m  1
which are the same for both unperturbed and perturbed modulation systems next we will
show that by using the knowledge of this qualitative behaviour of the characteristics one
is able to construct the asymptotic modulation solution for the undular bore front in the
presence of variable topography and bottom friction even if the full solution of the perturbed
modulation system is not available

gurevichpitaevskii problem for perturbed modulation system

we investigate now how the gp matching problem applies to the perturbed modulation
system 27 as in the original gp problem we postulate the natural physical requirement
that the mean value hui is continuous across the undular bore edges which represent free
boundaries and are defined by the conditions m  0 trailing edge x  x  t  and m  1
leading edge x  x  t  also we consider propagation of the undular bore into still
water hence huixx  t   0 now using the explicit expression 18 for hui in terms of
complete elliptic integrals and calculating its limits as m  0 and m  1 one has

such a way that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave in the undular bore was exactly a0
in the flatbottom zerofriction region see section 62
this freeboundary matching problem is then complemented by the kinematic conditions
explicitly defining the boundaries x  x  t  these are formulated using the multiple
characteristic directions of the perturbed modulation system 27 in the limits as m  0

deformation of the undular bore front due to variable topography and bottom friction

finally we study the effects of gradual slope and bottom friction on the leading front of the
selfsimilar expanding undular bore described in sections 62 63 the result will essentially
depend on the relative values of the small parameters appearing in the problem we note
that in general there are three distinct relevant small parameters

cd  1

the first small parameter is determined by the ratio of the equilibrium depth in the flat
bottom region to the distance from the beginning of the slope region to the location of the
initial jump discontinuity in the surface displacement this measures the typical relative
spatial variations of the modulation parameters in the undular bore when it reaches the
beginning of the slope the second and third parameters are contained in the kdv equation
1 itself and measure the values of the slope and bottom friction respectively in terms of
the transformed variables appearing in 7 f t    gt   cd see 8 generally
we assume   cd the possible orderings   cd or cd   can be then considered as
particular cases

26

to obtain a quantitative description of the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular
bore we perform an expansion of the whitham modulation system 27 for 1  m  1

 we recall that in this formula x  is given by 49 and x is defined by 3 in terms of
the original physical independent variables x and t
summarising if the conditions  cd   are satisfied the lead solitary wave of the
undular bore behaves as an individual noninteracting solitary wave adiabatically varying
under small perturbation due to variable topography and bottom friction the modulation
solution in the vicinity of the leading edge also varies adiabatically however its qualitative
structure considered in section 64 see figs 56 remains unchanged
in a sharp contrast with the described case of adiabatic deformation of an undular bore
front is case ii when the second term in the lefthand side of 106 contributes to the
leading order ie to the motion of the leading edge itself namely we have
li
d
   vi

i  1 2

115

now d dt 6  which means that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave a  2 varies
essentially differently compared to the case of an isolated solitary wave indeed the term
 in the righthand side of 115 is responsible for local adiabatic variations of the solitary
wave while the term vi li  x describes nonlocal parts of the variations associated with
the wave interactions within the undular bore using asymptotic formulae 103 implying
v2  0 v1  0 and the condition limx0 dl12dx   along with l2  l1  it is not
difficult to show that this nonlocal term is always nonnegative  ie the lead solitary wave
in the undular bore propagating over a gradual slope with bottom friction always moves
faster and therefore has greater amplitude than an isolated solitary wave of the same
initial amplitude in the beginning of the slope indeed as we have shown in section 5 the
presence of a slope and bottom friction always result in squeezing the cnoidal wave hence
increasing momentum exchange between solitary waves in the vicinity of the leading edge
of the undular bore and acceleration of the lead solitary wave itself the situation here is
qualitatively analogous to that described in section 64 where the general global modulation
solution for the unperturbed kdv equation was discussed similarly to that case the leading
edge now represents a characteristic envelope  a caustic otherwise we are back in the case
i implying d dt    see fig 6a
29

unlike the case of adiabatic variations of the leading edge determination of the function
 t  requires now knowledge of the full solution of the perturbed modulation system 27
with the matching conditions 93 while the analytic methods to construct such a solution
for inhomogeneous quasilinear systems are not available presently it is instructive to assume
that d dt   is a known function of t and to study the structure of the solution in
close vicinity of the leading edge with an account of the explicit form 103 of the velocity
corrections equations 115 assume the form

conclusions

we have studied the effects of a gradual slope and turbulent chezy bottom friction on the
propagation of solitary waves nonlinear periodic waves and undular bores in shallowwater
flows in the framework of the variablecoefficient perturbed kdv equation the analysis has
been performed in the most general setting provided by the associated whitham equations
describing slow modulations of a periodic travelling wave due to the slope bottom friction
and spatial nonuniformity of initial data this modulation theory developed in general form
for perturbed integrable equations in kamchatnov 2004 was applied here to the perturbed
kdv equation and allowed us to take into account slow variations of all three parameters
in the cnoidal wave solution the particular timeindependent solutions of the perturbed
modulation equations were shown to be consistent with the adiabatically varying solutions
for a single solitary wave and for a periodic wave propagating over a slope without bottom
friction obtained in ostrovsky  pelinovsky 1970 1975 and miles 1979 1983a it was
shown however that the assumption of zero mean elevation used in these papers for the
description of slow variations of a cnoidal wave ceases to be valid in the case when the
turbulent bottom friction is present in this case a more general solution was obtained
numerically improving the results of miles 1983b
30

further the derived full timedependent modulation system was used for the description of the effects of variable topography and bottom friction on the propagation of undular
bores in particular on the variations of the undular bore front representing a system of
weakly interacting solitary waves by the analysis of the characteristics of the whitham
system in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore two possible configurations
have been identified depending on whether the leading edge of the undular bore represents a
regular characteristic of the modulation system or its singular characteristic ie a caustic
the first case was shown to correspond to adiabatically slow deformations of the classical gurevichpitaevskii modulation solution and is realised when the perturbations due to
variable topography and bottom friction are small compared with the existing spatial nonuniformity of modulations in the undular bore which is supposed to be formed outside the
region of variable topographybottom friction in the case when modulations due to the
external perturbations are comparable in magnitude with the existing modulations in the
undular bore the leading edge becomes a caustic and this situation was shown to correspond to enhanced solitary wave interactions within the undular bore front these enhanced
interactions have been shown to lead to a nonlocal leading solitary wave amplitude growth
which cannot be predicted in the frame of the traditional local adiabatic approach to propagation of an isolated solitary wave in a variable environment as we mentioned in the
introduction one of our original motivations for this study was the possibility to model a
shoreward propagating tsunami as an undular bore in this context we would suggest that
the second scenario described above is the more relevant which has the implication that
the growth and eventual breaking of the leading waves in a tsunami wavetrain cannot be
modeled as a local effect for that particular wave but is determined instead by the whole
structure of the wavetrain
