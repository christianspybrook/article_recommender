abstract
we performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole
approximation dda we prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum
of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d when the latter is in the range of dda
applicability moreover the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for noncubically shaped scatterers therefore for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are
much smaller than for noncubically shaped the relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size hence convergence of dda for large enough scatterers is
quadratic in the common range of d extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a
wide range of d finally we discuss a number of new developments in dda and their
consequences for convergence

1 introduction
the discrete dipole approximation dda is a wellknown method to solve the light
scattering problem for arbitrary shaped particles since its introduction by purcell and
pennypacker1 it has been improved constantly the formulation of dda summarized by
draine and flatau2 more than 10 years ago is still most widely used for many applications3
partly due to the publicly available highquality and userfriendly code ddscat4 although
modern improvements of dda as discussed in detail in section 2f exist they are still in the
research stage because they are not widely used in real applications
dda directly discretizes the volume of the scatterer and hence is applicable to arbitrary
shaped particles however the drawback of this discretization is the extreme computational
complexity of dda although it is significantly decreased by advanced numerical
techniques25 that is why the usual application strategy for dda is single computation
where a discretization is chosen based on available computational resources and some
empirical estimates of the expected errors34 these error estimates are based on a limited
number of benchmark calculations3 and hence are external to the light scattering problem
under investigation such error estimates have evident drawbacks however no better
alternative is available some results of analytical analysis of errors in computational
electromagnetics are known eg 67 however they typically consider the surface integral
equations to the best of our knowledge such analysis has not been done for volume integral
equations such as dda
usually errors in dda are studied as a function of the size parameter of the scatterer x
at a constant or few different total numbers of dipoles n eg 28 only a small number of
papers directly present errors versus discretization parameter eg d  the size of a single
dipole917 the range of d typically studied in those papers is limited to a 5 times difference
between minimum and maximum values with the exception of two papers1112 where it is 15
times those plots of errors versus discretization parameter are always used to illustrate the
performance of a new dda formulation and compare it with others no conclusions about the
convergence properties of dda as a function of d have been made based on these plots to
our knowledge no theoretical analysis of dda convergence has been performed but only a
few limited empirical studies have appeared in the literature
in this paper we perform a theoretical analysis of dda convergence when refining the
discretization section 2 we derive rigorous theoretical bounds on the error in any measured
quantity for any scatterer in section 3 we present extensive numerical results of dda
computations for 5 different scatterers using many different discretizations these results are
discussed in section 4 to support conclusions of the theoretical analysis we formulate the
conclusions of the paper in section 5 in a followup paper18 which from now on we refer to
as paper 2 the theoretical convergence results are used for an extrapolation technique to
increase the accuracy of dda computations

2 theoretical analysis
in this section we analyze theoretically the errors of dda computations we formulate the
volume integral equation for the internal electric field and its operator counterpart in
section 2a and its discretization in section 2b section 2c contains integral and discretized
formulae for measured quantities that are the final goal of any light scattering simulation we
derive the main results in section 2d where we consider errors of the traditional dda
formulation2 without shape errors which are considered separately in section 2e finally in
2

section 2f we discuss some recent dda improvements from the viewpoint of our
convergence theory

aintegral equation
throughout this paper we assume the expi t  time dependence of all fields the scatterer
is assumed dielectric but not magnetic magnetic permittivity   1  and the electric
permittivity is assumed isotropic nonisotropic permittivity will significantly complicate the
derivations but will not principally change the main conclusion of section 2  eqs 70 and
87
the general form of the integral equation governing the electric field inside the
dielectric scatterer is the following1920

bdiscretization

to solve eq 1 numerically a discretization is done in the following way20 let v  uvi 
i 1

vi i v j  0 for i  j  n denotes the number of subvolumes dipoles assuming r  vi and

choosing v0  vi  eq 1 can be rewritten as
er   e inc r     d 3 r g r r   r er   m vi  r   l vi  r   r er  
j i v j

the set of eq 8 for all i is exact further one fixed point ri inside each vi its center is
chosen and r  ri is set
the usual approximation20 is considering e and  constant inside each subvolume
er   eri   e i   r    ri    i for r  vi

eq 8 can then be rewritten as

a further approximation which is used in almost all formulations of dda is
g ij 0  g ri  r j

this assumption is made implicitly by all formulations that start by replacing the scatterer
with a set of point dipoles as was done originally by purcell and pennypacker1 for a cubical
as well as spherical cell vi with ri located at the center of the cell l i can be calculated
analytically yielding22

eq 10 together with eqs 13 and 14 and completely neglecting m i is equivalent to
the original dda by purcell and pennypacker pp1 the diagonal terms in eq 10 are then
equivalent to the wellknown clausiusmossotti cm polarizability for point dipoles
modifications introduced by other dda prescriptions are discussed in section 2f
in matrix notation eq 10 reads

controlled to be much less than other errors comparing eqs 15 and 17 one can

derror analysis
in this section we perform error analysis for the pp formulation of dda improvements of
dda are further discussed in section 2f
we assume cubical subvolumes with size d we also assume that the shape of the
particle is exactly described by these cubical subvolumes we call this cubically shaped
scatterer moreover  is a smooth function inside v exact assumptions on  are formulated
below an extension of the theory to shapes that do not satisfy these conditions is presented
in section 2e if there are several regions with different values of  smooth inside each
region the analysis is still valid but interfaces inside v should be considered the same way as
the outer boundary of v we further fix the geometry of the scattering problem and incident
field therefore we will be interested only in variation of discretization which is
characterized by the single parameter  d for reasons that will become clear in the sequel we
assume that kd  2 this bound is not limiting since otherwise dda is generally
inapplicable2
we switch to dimensionless parameters by assuming k  1  which is equivalent to
measuring all the distances in units of 1 k  the unit of electric field can be chosen arbitrary
but constant in all further derivations we will use two sets of constants i and ci 113 are
basic constants that do not depend on the discretization d but do depend directly upon all
other problem parameters  size parameter x  kreq req  volumeequivalent radius m
shape and incident field  or some of them on the contrary c1c94 are auxiliary values that
either are numerical constants or can be derived in terms of constants i although the
dependencies of ci on i are not explicitly derived in this paper one can easily obtain them
following the derivations of this section that is the main motivation for using such vast
amount of constants instead of an order of magnitude formalism however such explicit
derivation has limited application because as we will see further constants in the final result
depend upon almost all basic constants qualitative analysis of these dependencies will be
performed in the end of this section it should be noted that the main theoretical results
concerning dda convergence boundedness of errors by a quadratic function cf eq 70
can be formulated and applied without consideration of any constants which is simpler
however our full derivation enables us to make additional conclusions related to the behavior
of specific error terms
the total number of dipoles used to discretize the scatterer is
n   1d 3 
29

we assume that the internal field e is at least four times differentiable and all these
derivatives are bounded inside v

30
for r  v and      

this assumption is acceptable since there are no interfaces inside v therefore e should be a
smooth function  denotes the euclidian l2 norm which is used for all 3d objects vectors
and tensors we use the l1norm  1  for ndimensional vectors and matrices as well as for

functions and operators eq 30 immediately implies that e  l1 v   we require that 
satisfies eq 30 with constants 711 further we will state an estimate for the norm of
g  r  and its derivatives one can easily obtain from eq 2 that for r  1 g r  satisfies
eq 30 with constants c1c5 while for r  2

next we state two auxiliary facts that will be used later let vc be a cube with size d and
with its center at the origin and fr a four times differentiable function inside vc then

eqs 32 and 33 are the corollary of expanding f into taylor series odd orders of the taylor
expansion vanish because of cubical symmetry
our first goal is to estimate h d  starting from eq 17 we write h id as

where we have introduced the polarization vector for conciseness

to estimate the sum in eq 34 we consider separately three cases 1 dipole j lies in a
complete shell of dipole i we define the shell below 2 j lies in a distant shell of dipole i 
rij  r j  ri  1  3 all j that fall between the first two cases see fig 1 we define the first

shell s1i of a cubical dipole as a set of dipoles that touch it including touching in one point
only the second shell s2i is a set of dipoles that touch the outer surface of the first shell
and so on the lth shell sli is then a set of all dipoles that lie on the boundary of the cube
with size 2l  1d and center coinciding with the center of the original dipole we call a shell
complete if all its elements lie inside the volume of the scatterer v a shell is called a distant

demand k i   k max to separate cases 1 and 2 described above all j that fall in the third
case satisfy rij  2 the exact value of this constant  slightly larger than 3  depends on
d the number of dipoles in a shell sl which can be incomplete  nsl  can be estimated as

since each shell in eq 42 is complete it can be divided into pairs of dipoles that are
symmetric over the center of the shell j and j for convenience we set ri  0  the inner

to analyze the third part of the sum in eq 34 we again sum over shells however since
they are incomplete we cannot use symmetry considerations we apply eq 33 to the whole

identity

the last term in eq 63 is mostly determined by dipoles that lie on the surface or few
dipoles deep because it comes from the k4 term in eq 61 which rapidly decreases when
moving from surface we define surface errors as those associated with the linear term in
eq 63 our numerical simulation see section 0 show that this term is small compared to
other terms for typical values of d however it is always significant for small enough values
of d

we assume that a bounded solution of eq 7 uniquely exists for any e inc  h 2  moreover we

although eq 65 seems intuitively correct its rigorous prove even if feasible lies outside
the scope of this paper for an intuitive understanding one may consult the paper by rahola25
where he studied the spectrum of the discretized operator for scattering by a sphere and
showed that it does converge to the spectrum of the integral operator with decreasing d it
should however be noted that convergence of the spectrum only implies the convergence of
the spectral l2 norm of the operator and not necessarily the convergence of the l1norm
therefore eq 65 should be considered as an assumption it implies that there exists a d0
such that

where c47 is an arbitrary constant larger then 13 although d0 depends on its choice for

it is important to remember that the derivation was performed for constant x m shape and
incident field there are 13 basic constants 113 1 eq 29 characterizes the total
volume of the scatterer hence it depends only on x 711 eq 30 for r can be easily
obtained given the function r moreover it is completely trivial in the common case of
homogenous scatterers 12 surface to volume ratio eq 62 depends on the shape of the
scatterer and is inversely proportional to x it is not feasible except for certain simple shapes
to obtain the values of constants 26 eq 30 since it requires an exact solution for the
internal fields these constants definitely depend upon all the parameters of the scattering
problem moreover these dependencies can be rapidly varying especially near the resonance
regions the same is true for 13 l1norm of the inverse of the integral operator eq 65
finally there is the important constant d0 that also depends on all the parameters however
one may expect it to be large enough eg d 0  2  for most of the problems  then its
variation can be neglected
before proceeding we introduce the discretization parameter y  m kd  we employ the

commonly used formula as proposed by draine8 however the exact dependence on m is not
important because all the conclusions are still valid for constant m replacing d by y does not
significantly change the dependence of the constants in eq 69 since they all already depend
on m through the basic constants 211 13 this leads to
 y  c59  c60 ln y  y 2  c61 y 
70
it is not feasible to make any rigorous conclusions about the variation of the constants in
eq 70 with varying parameters because all these constants depend on 26 13 that in turn
depend in a complex way upon the parameters of the scattering problem however we can
make one conclusion about the general trend of this dependency
following the derivation of the eq 70 one can observe that c61 is proportional to 12
while c59 and c60 do not directly depend on it at least part of the contributions to them are
independent of 12 therefore the general trend will be a decrease of the ratio c61 c59 with
increasing x when all other parameters are fixed this is a mathematical justification of the
intuitively evident fact that surface errors are less significant for larger particles
in the analysis of the results of the numerical simulations section 0 we will neglect the
variation of the logarithm eq 70 then states that error is bounded by a quadratic function of
y for d  d 0  however keep in mind that our derivation does not lead to an optimal error
estimation ie it overestimates the error and can be improved for example the constants 26 are usually largest inside a small volume fraction of the scatterer near the surface or some

internal resonance regions while in the rest of the scatterer the internal electric field and its
derivatives are bounded by significantly smaller constants however the order of the error is
estimated correctly as we will see in the numerical simulations
11

it is important to note that eq 70 does not imply that  y which is a signed value
actually depends on y as a quadratic function but we will see later that it is the case for small
enough y section 0 see detailed discussion in paper 2 moreover the coefficients of linear
and quadratic terms for  y may have different signs which may lead to zero error for nonzero y however this y if it exists is unfortunately different for each measured quantity

eshape errors
in this section we extend the error analysis as presented in section 2d to shapes that cannot
be described exactly by a set of cubical subvolumes we perform the discretization the same
way as in section 2b but some of the vi are not cubical for i  v  which denotes that
dipole i lies on the boundary of the volume v we set ri to be still in the center of the cube
circumscribing vi not to break the regularity of the lattice the standard pp prescription uses
equal volumes  vi  d 3  in eqs 10 14 25 and 26 ie the discretization changes the
shape of the particle a little bit we will estimate the errors introduced by these boundary
dipoles these errors should then be added to those obtained in section 2d we start by
estimating h d  first we consider h id for i  v

we estimate each of the terms in eq 73 separately since there is actually no significant
cancellation and the error is of the same order of magnitude as the values themselves using

where the remaining integral can be proven to be equal to  l vi  ri   the last prove left
see eqs 74 and 80 is to demonstrate that l vi  ri  is bounded by a constant the only
potential problem may come from the subsurface of vi that is part of the particle surface
because it may be close to ri this subsurface is assumed planar we will calculate the
integral in eq 6 over the infinite plane r   ri    r such that   r  0  then n

l vi  ri   c69

where we have changed the order of the summation in the double sum and split the
summation over cubical shells for l  k max and l  k max  then we have grouped everything
into one sum over boundary dipoles eqs 41 and 62 were used in the last inequality
combining eqs 63 and 83 one can obtain the total estimate of the h d for any scatterer

13

the shape errors reinforce the surface errors the linear term of discretization error and
although they both generally decrease with increasing size parameter x one may expect the
linear term in eq 87 to be significant up to higher values of y than in eq 70
all the derivations in this section can in principle be extended to interfaces inside the
particle ie when a surface which cannot be described exactly as a surface of a set of cubes
separates two regions where r varies smoothly two parts of the cubical dipole on the
interface should be considered separately the same way as it was done above this will
however not change the main conclusion of this section  eq87  but only the constants

fdifferent dda formulations
in this section we discuss how different dda formulations modify the error estimates derived
in sections 2d and 2e
most of the improvements of pp proposed in the literature are concerned with the selfterm  m vi  ri   they are the radiative reaction correction rr8 the digitized greens
function dgf23 the formulation by lakhtakia lak2627 the a1term method2829 the
lattice dispersion relation ldr30 the formulation by peltoniemi pel31 and the
corrected ldr cldr32 all of them provide an expression for m vi  ri  that is of order d2
except for rr that is of order d3 for instance ldr is equivalent to
88
m vi  ri   b1  b2 m 2  b3 m 2 s d 2   2 3id 3 pi 





remember that we assumed k  1  where b1 b2 b3 are numerical constants and s is a
constant that depends only on the propagation and polarization vectors of the incident field
however none of these formulations can exactly evaluate the integral in eq 39 because the
variation of the electric field is not known beforehand pel solves this problem but only for
a spherical dipole therefore they hopefully decrease the constant in eq 40 thus
decreasing the overall error in the measured quantities however these formulations are not
expected to change the order of the error from d2 to some higher order
we do not analyze the improvements by rahmani chaumet and bryant rcb3334 and
surface corrected ldr scldr17 as they are limited to certain particle shapes
there exist two improvements of the interaction term in pp filtered coupled dipoles
fcd12 and integration of greens tensor it35 a rigorous analysis of fcd errors is
beyond the scope of this paper but it seems that fcd is not designed to reduce the linear term
in eq 63 that comes from the incomplete nonsymmetric shells this is because fcd
employs sampling theory to improve the accuracy of the overall discretization for regular
cubical grids fcd does not improve the accuracy of a single g ij calculation approximation
of an integral over one subvolume
it which numerically evaluates the integral in eq 12 has a more pronounced effect
on the error estimate consider dipole j from lth shell incomplete of dipole i then

here we have used eq 36 and taylor expansion of greens tensor up to the first order
eq 89 states that the second term in eq 58 is completely eliminated and so is the linear
term in eqs 69 and 70 surface errors therefore convergence of dda with it for
cubically shaped scatterers is expected to be purely quadratic neglecting the logarithm
however for non cubically shaped scatterers the linear term reappears due to the shape
14

errors both it and fcd also modify the selfterm however the effect is basically the same as
for the other formulations
several papers aimed to reduce shape errors101136 the first one  generalized semianalytical gsa method10  modifies the whole dda scheme while the other two propose
averaging of the susceptibility over the boundary dipoles we will analyze here weighted
discretization wd by piller11 as probably the most advanced method to reduce shape errors
available today
wd modifies the susceptibility and selfterm of the boundary subvolume we slightly
modify the definition of the boundary subvolume used in sections 2b and 2e to
automatically take into account interfaces inside the scatterer we define vi to be always
cubical but with a possible interface inside the particle surface crossing the subvolume vi
is assumed planar and divides the subvolume into two parts the principal volume vi p
containing the center and the secondary volume vi s with susceptibilities  ip   i   is and
electric fields eip  e i  e si respectively the electric fields are considered constant inside
each part and related to each other via the boundary condition tensor ti 
e is  ti e i 
90
in wd the susceptibility of the boundary subvolume is replaced by an effective one defined
as
 ie  vi p  ip i  vi s  is ti d 3 
91
which gives the correct total polarization of the cubical dipole the effective selfterm is
directly evaluated starting from eq 4 considering  and e constant inside each part

where the second term comes from the fact that averaged l p is not the same as l times
averaged p this error depends on the geometry of the interface inside vi and generally is of
order unity for example if the plane interface is described as z  zi    taking limit   0

gives the error 2 pip  pis z using eq 81 therefore wd does not principally improve

the error estimate of h sh
given by eq 76 although it may significantly decrease the

constant on the other hand since l vi p  ri  and l vi s  ri  can be analytically evaluated
for a cube intersected by a plane wd can be further improved to reduce the error in h sh

it can be shown that for the scattering amplitude eq 25 the error estimate given by

in his original paper piller did not specify the expression that should be used for cabs direct
application of the susceptibility provided by wd into eq 26 does not reduce the order of
error when compared with the exact eq 24 except when  is  0  since they are not linear
functions of the electric field however if we consider separately vi p and vi s which is
equivalent to replacing vi im ie e i  ei  by vi p im ip  ei  vi s im  is  ti ei  the same

estimate as in eq 99 can be derived for cabs
using eqs 98 99 and the first part of eq 86 one can derive the final error
estimate for wd
 y  c92  c93 ln y  y 2  c94 y 
100
where the constant before the linear term as compared to eq 87 does not contain a
logarithm and is expected to be significantly smaller because several factors contributing to it
are eliminated in wd although wd has a potential for improving it does not seem feasible
to completely eliminate the linear term in the shape error the accuracy of evaluation of the
interaction term over the boundary dipole cf eq 94 can be improved by integration of
greens tensor over vi p and vi s separately but that would ruin the blocktoeplitz structure of
the interaction matrix and hinder the fftbased algorithm for the solution of linear

inapplicable
minor modifications of the expression for cabs are possible draine8 proposed a
modification of eq 26 that was widely used afterwards and which was further modified by
chaumet et al35 however for many cases these expressions are equivalent and even when
they are not the difference is of order d3 which is neglected in our error analysis

3 numerical simulations
adiscrete dipole approximation
the basics of the dda method were summarized by draine and flatau2 in this paper we use
the ldr prescription for dipole polarizability30 which is most widely used nowadays eg in
the publicly available code ddscat 614 we also employ dipole size correction8 for noncubically shaped scatterers to ensure that the cubical approximation of the scatterer has the
correct volume this is believed to diminish shape errors especially for small scatterers2 we
use a standard discretization scheme as described in section 2e without any improvements
for boundary dipoles it is important to note that all the conclusions are valid for any dda
implementation but with a few changes for specific improvements as discussed in
section 2f
our code  amsterdam dda adda  is capable of running on a cluster of computers
parallelizing a single dda computation which allows us to use practically unlimited
number of dipoles since we are not limited by the memory of a single computer3738 we used
a relative error of residual  10 8 as a stopping criterion for the iterative solution of the dda
linear system tests suggest that the relative error of the measured quantities due to the
iterative solver is then  10 7 data not shown and hence can be neglected total relative
errors in our simulations are  10 6  10 5  see section 0 more details about our code can
be found in paper 2 all dda simulations were carried out on the dutch national compute

fig 5 relative errors of qext versus y for all 5 test cases a loglog scale is used a linear fit through 5
finest discretizations of kd  3 sphere is shown

most commonly used in applications however the theory applies to any measured quantity
for instance we have also confirmed it for other mueller matrix elements data not shown
exact results of s11  for all 5 test cases are shown in fig 2 for spheres this is the
result of mie theory the relative accuracy of the code we used24 is at least  10 6  and for the
cube and discretized sphere an extrapolation over the 5 finest discretizations the
extrapolation technique is presented in paper 2 together with all details of obtaining these
results including their estimated errors we use such exact results because analytical theory
is unavailable for these shapes and because errors of the best discretization are larger than that
of the extrapolation their use as references for computing real errors difference between the
computed and the exact value of single dda calculations is justified because all these real
errors are significantly larger than the errors of the references themselves see paper 2 in
general real errors obtained this way have an uncertainty of reference error exact values of
qext for all test cases are presented in table 1
in the following we show the results of dda convergence fig 3 and fig 4 present
relative errors absolute values of s11 at different angles  and maximum error over all 
versus y in loglog scale in many cases the maximum errors are reached at exact
backscattering direction then these two sets of points overlap deep minima that happen at
intermediate values of y for some values of  and also sometimes for qext  fig 5 are due to
the fact that the differences between simulated and reference values change sign near these
values of y see paper 2 for detailed description of this behavior the solid lines are linear fits
to all or some points of maximum error the slopes of these lines are depicted in the figures
fig 5 shows relative errors of qext for all 5 studied cases in loglog scale a linear fit through
the 5 finest discretizations of the kd  3 sphere is shown more results of these numerical
simulations are presented in paper 2

4 discussion
convergence of dda for cubically shaped particles fig 3 shows the following trends all
curves have linear and quadratic parts the nonmonotonic behavior of errors for some  are
also a manifestation of the fact that signed difference can be approximated by a sum of linear
and quadratic terms that have different signs the transition between these two regimes
20

occurs at different y which indicates the relative importance of linear and quadratic
coefficients while for maximum errors that are close to those of the backscattering direction
the linear term is significant for larger y it is much smaller and not significant in the whole
range of y studied for side scattering    90  results of dda convergence for spheres fig
4 show a different behavior for different sizes errors for the small  kd  3  sphere converge
purely linear except for small deviation of errors of s11 90 for large values of y similar
results are obtained for the kd  10 sphere but with significant oscillations superimposed
upon the general trend convergence for the large  kd  30  sphere is quadratic or even faster
in the range of y studied also with significant oscillations
comparing fig 3 and fig 4 especially fig 3b and fig 4b showing results for
almost the same particles one can deduce the following differences in dda convergence for
cubically and noncubically shaped scatterers the linear term for cubically shaped scatterers
is significantly smaller resulting in smaller total errors especially for small y all these
conclusions together with the size dependence of the significance of the linear term in the
total errors are in perfect agreement with the theoretical predictions made in sections 2d and
2e errors for noncubically shaped particles exhibit quasirandom oscillations that are not
present for cubically shaped particles this can be explained by the sharp variations of shape
errors with changing y discussed in details in paper 2 oscillations for the kd  3 sphere
fig 4a are very small but still clearly present which is due to the small size of the
particle and hence featurelessness of its light scattering pattern  the surface structure is not
that important and one may expect rather small shape errors results for qext fig 5 fully
support the conclusions errors of qext for the large sphere at small values of y are
unexpectedly smaller than for smaller spheres this feature requires further study before
making any firm conclusions however there is definitely no similar tendency for s11  cf
fig 4
we have also studied a kd  8 porous cube that was obtained by dividing a cube into
27 smaller cubes and then removing randomly 9 of them all the conclusions are the same as
those reported for the cube but with slightly higher overall errors data not shown
in this paper we have used a traditional dda formulation2 for numerical simulations
however as we showed in section 2f several modern improvements of dda namely it
and wd should significantly change its convergence behavior it should completely
eliminate the linear term for cubically shaped scatterers which should improve the accuracy
especially for small y wd should significantly decrease shape and hence total errors for noncubically shaped particles moreover it should significantly decrease the amplitude of quasirandom error oscillations because it takes into account the location of the interface inside the
boundary dipoles numerical testing of dda convergence using it and wd is a subject of a
future study

5 conclusion
to the best of our knowledge we conducted for the first time a rigorous theoretical
convergence analysis of dda in the range of dda applicability  kd  2  errors are bounded
by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the discretization parameter y the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for noncubically shaped scatterers therefore for
small y errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for noncubically shaped
the relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size hence convergence
of dda for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of y all these
conclusions were verified by extensive numerical simulations
21

moreover these simulations showed that errors are not only bounded by a quadratic
function as predicted in section 2 but actually can be with good accuracy described by a
quadratic function of y this fact provides a basis for the extrapolation technique presented in
paper 2
our theory predicts that modern dda improvements namely it and wd should
significantly change the convergence of dda however numerical testing of these predictions
is left for future research
