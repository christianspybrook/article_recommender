1 introduction
theoretical study of polarons in the strongly correlated system is like an attempt to view contents of a pandora box embedded into another even more
sinister and obscure container of riddles enigmas and mysteries this desperate situation occurs because solution is not known even for the simplest
polaron problem ie when a perfectly stable quasiparticle qp with momentum as a single quantum number interacts with a well defined bath of
bosonic elementary excitations to the contrary the definition of the strongly
correlated system implies that qps might be highly unstable and the very
notion of qps both in electronic and bosonic subsystems is under question
thus one faces the problem of an interplay between ill defined objects and
it is crucial to solve the problem without approximations further difficulty
pertinent to realistic systems is an interplay of the momentum and other
quantum numbers characterizing internal states of a qp
the problem of polaron originally emerged as that of an electron coupled
to phonons see 1 2 in the initial formulation a structureless qp is characterized by the only quantum number momentum which changes due to
interaction of the qp with phonons 3 4 later depending on what can be
called particle and environment and how they interact with each other
the polaron concept was related to extreme diversity of physical phenomena
there are many other objects which having nothing to do with phonons are
isomorphic to simple polaron 5 as eg an excitonpolaron in the intraband
scattering approximation 6 7 8 9 another example is the problem of a hole
in the antiferromagnet which is closely related to polaron since hole movement
is accompanied by the spin flips which in the spin wave approximation are
equivalent to creation and annihilation of magnons 10 11

the concept of polaron was further generalized to include internal degrees
of freedom which interacting with environment change their quantum numbers example of a complex qp is the jahnteller polaron where electronphonon interaction epi changes quantum numbers of degenerate electronic
states 12 13 14 this generalization is important due to its relevance to
the colossal magnetoresistance phenomena in the manganese oxides 15 16
another example is the pseudo jahnteller polaron where epi is inelastic
and leads to transitions between close in energy electronic levels of a qp
17 18 19 further generalization is a system of several qps which interact
both with each other and environment for example effective interaction of
two electrons through exchange by phonons can overcome the coulomb repulsion and form a bound state bipolaron 20 21 22 23 24 on the other hand
coupling of attracting hole and electron to the lattice vibrations 25 26 27
can create a lot of qualitatively different objects localized exciton weakly
bound pair of localized hole and localized electron etc 28 7 scattering by
impurities introduces additional complexity to the polaron problem because
interference of impurity potential with lattice distortion which accompanies
the polaron movement can contribute either constructively or destructively
to the localization of a qp on impurity 29 30 7
in addition a bare qp and bosonic bath can not be considered as well
defined in the correlated systems angle resolved photoemission spectra
arpes revealing the lehmann function lf of quasiparticle demonstrate
broad peaks in many correlated systems cooper oxide hightemperature superconductors 31 32 33 colossal magnetoresistive manganites 34 35 36
quasionedimensional peierls conductors 37 38 and verwey magnetites 39
besides phonons are also broadened in many correlated systems eg in hightemperature semiconductors 40 and mixedvalent materials 41 42 one of
possible reasons for these broadenings is the interaction of the qps with the
lattice degrees of freedom however in many realistic cases other subsystems
not explicitly included into the polaron hamiltonian are responsible for the
decay of qp and phonons eg another electronic bands phonon anharmonicity interaction with nuclear spins etc then if this auxiliary broadening is
known in some approximation one can formulate an ambitious goal to study
spectral response when bare quasiparticle with known damping interacts
with broadened bosonic excitations
no one of traditional numerical methods to say nothing of analytical ones
can give approximation free results for measurable quantities of polaron such
as optical conductivity or angle resolved photoemission spectra for in macroscopic system of arbitrary dimension besides we are not aware of any numerical method which can incorporate in an approximation free way the information on the damping of qp and bosonic bath below we describe basics of recently developed diagrammatic monte carlo dmc method for numerically
exact computation of green functions and correlation functions in imaginary
time for few polarons in a macroscopic system 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51

formed by a novel approximation free approach of stochastic optimization
so 45 50 51 circumventing difficulties of popular maximal enthropy
method finally we focus on results of application of the dmcso machinery
to various problems 52 53 54 55 56 57
the basic models related to the polaronic objects in correlated systems
which can be solved by dmcso methods are stated in the next sect it
is followed in sect 12 by description of stumbling blocks encountered by
analytic methods sect 2 concerns the basics of dmcso methods however
those who are not interested in the details of the methods can briefly look
through the definitions in the introduction for sect 2 and turn to sect 3
where lf and optical conductivity of frhlich polaron are discussed see also
58 results of studies of the selftrapping phenomenon are presented in sect
4 and application of dmcso methods to the exciton problem can be found
in sect 5 the chapter is completed by sect 6 devoted to studies of arpes
of high temperature superconductors

complicated model 16 is still too far from the cases encountered in
strongly correlated systems due to coupling of qps 1 and 5 and bosonic
fields 4 to additional degrees of freedom these excitations are not well defined from the onset namely the dispersion relation of the qp spectrum k

the simplest polaron problem in turn can be subdivided into continuous and
lattice polaron models
12 limitations of analytic methods in problem of polarons
analytic solution for the problem of exciton in a rigid lattice is available
only for small radius frenkel regime 67 and large radius wannier regime
68 however even limits of validity for these approximations are not known
random phase approximation approaches 62 63 are capable of obtaining
some qualitative conclusions for intermediate radius regime though its quantitative results are not reliable due to uncontrolled errors the situation is
similar with the problem of structureless polaron where analytic solutions
are known only in the weak and strong coupling regimes besides reliable
results for these regimes are available only for ground state properties
although several novel methods capable of obtaining properties of excited
states were developed recently variational coherentstates expansion 69 and
free propagator momentum average summation 70 as a few examples all of
them to provide reliable data in a specific regime need either comparison
with exact sum rules 71 72 or with exact numerical results
application of variational methods to study of excitations is a tricky issue since strictly speaking they are valid only for the ground state as an
example for the importance of sum rules in variational treatment we refer
to the problem of the optical conductivity of the frchlich polaron possibility of existence of relaxed excited state res which is a metastable state
where lattice deformation has adjusted to the electronic excitation rendering
stability and narrow linewidth of the spectroscopic response was briefly mentioned by s i pekar in early 50s then conception of res was rigorously
formulated by j t devreese with coworkers and has been a subject of extensive investigations for years 5 73 74 75 76 77 48 57 calculations of
impedance 75 in the framework of technique 78 supported the existence of
a narrow stable peak in the optical conductivity however even the authors
of 75 were skeptical about the fact that the width of res in the strong
coupling regime appeared to be more narrow than the phonon frequency ie
inverse time which is according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle is
required for the lattice readaptation in consequent paper 77 they realized
the importance of manyphonon processes and studied twophonon contribution to optical conductivity importance of many phonon processes was
confirmed when variational results 75 were compared with exact dmc simulations 48 variational result well reproduced the position of the peak in
exact data though failed in description of the peak width in the strong coupling regime 48 finally when approach 75 was modified and several sum
rules were accurately introduced into variational model 57 both position

and width of the peak were quantitatively reproduced studies 57 see sect
31 do not address rather philosophical question whether res exists or not
though inevitably prove that in contrast to the foregoing beliefs there in no
stable excited state of the frhlich polaron in the strong coupling regime
note that sometimes excited states can not be handled by analytic methods
even for weak couplings perturbation theory expression for lf of the frhlich
polaron model diverges at the phonon energy ph see 34 in sect 31 and
more elaborate treatment is necessary
difficulties of semianalytic methods enhance in the intermediate coupling
regime where results are sometimes wrong even for ground state properties
for example the variatioanl approach 79 which has been considered as an
intermediate coupling theory appeared to be valid only in the weak coupling
limit 45 special interest to the methods giving reliable information on excited states is triggered by the selftrapping phenomenon which occurs just
in the intermediate coupling regime this phenomenon is a dramatic transformation of qp properties when system parameters are slightly changed
3 7 9 80 in the intermediate coupling regime trapped qp state with
strong lattice deformation around it and free state with weakly perturbed
lattice may hybridize and resonate because of close energies at some critical
value of electronlattice interaction c  it is clear that to study selftrapping
one has to apply a method giving reliable information on excited states in the
intermediate coupling regime

2 diagrammatic monte carlo and stochastic
optimization methods
in this section we introduce definitions of excitonpolaron properties which
can be evaluated by dmc and so methods an idea of dmc approach for
numerically exact calculation of green functions gfs in imaginary times
is presented in sect 21 and a short description of so method which is
capable of making unbiased analytic continuation from imaginary times to
real frequencies is given in sect 22 using combination of dmc and so
one can often circumvent difficulties of analytic and traditional numerical
methods therefore a brief comparative analysis of advantages and drawbacks
of dmcso machinery is given in sect 23
to obtain information on qps it is necessary to calculate matsubara gf
in imaginary time representation and make analytic continuation to the real
frequencies 60 for the twoparticle problem 14 the relevant quantity is
the twoparticle gf 46 47

dmc method is an algorithm which calculates gf 1012 without any
systematic errors this algorithm is described below for the simplest case of
structureless polaron 45 and generalizations to more complex cases can be
found in consequent references4  dmc is based on the feynman expansion of
the matsubara gf in imaginary time in the interaction representation

generalization of described below technique to the case of exciton 12 is given
in 46 and its modification for pseudojahnteller polaron 46 is developed in
52 47 method for evaluation of currentcurrent correlation function can be
found in 48 and a case of a polaron interacting with two kinds of bosonic fields
is considered in 49

the dmc process is a numerical procedure which basing on the metropolis principle 81 82 samples different fds in the parameter space  m m  xm 
and collects statistics of external variable  in a way that the result of this
statistics converges to exact gf gk   although sampling of the internal
parameters of one term in 25 and switch between different orders is performed within the the framework of one and the same numerical process

22 stochastic optimization method
the problem of inverting of integral equation 13 is an ill posed problem
due to incomplete noisy information about gf gk   which is known with
statistic errors on a finite number of imaginary times in a finite range 0 max 
there is infinite number of approximate solutions which reproduce gf within
some range of deviations and the problem is to chose the best one another
problem which is a stumbling block for decades is the saw tooth noise instability it occurs when solution is obtained by a naive method eg by using
leastsquares approach for minimizing deviation measure

have much larger amplitude than the value of actual lf lk  standard tools
for saw tooth noise suppression are based on the early 60es idea of fillipstikhonov regularization method 84 85 86 87 a nonlinear functional which
suppresses large derivatives of approximate solution lk  is added to the
linear deviation measure 30 most popular variant of regularization methods
is the maximal entropy method 61
however typical lf of a qp in a boson field consists of functional peaks
and smooth incoherent continuum with a sharp border 45 54 hence suppression of high derivatives as a general strategy of the regularization method
fails moreover any specific implementation of the regularization method uses
predefined mesh in the  space which could be absolutely unacceptable for
the case of sharp peaks if the actual location of a sharp peak is between
predefined discrete points the rest of spectral density can be distorted beyond recognition finally regularization maximal entropy approach requires
assumption of gauss distribution of statistic errors in gk   which might be
invalid in some cases 61
recently a stochastic optimization so method which circumvents
abovementioned difficulties was developed 45 the idea of the so method
is to generate a large enough number m of statistically independent nonregs
ularized solutions lk  s  1  m  which deviation measures ds are
smaller than some upper limit du  depending of the statistic noise of the gf
gk   then using linearity of expressions 13 30 the final solution is

addition to updates which do not change number of terms in the sum 32
there are updates which increase or decrease number k hence since the
number of elements k is not fixed any spectral function can be reproduced
with desired accuracy

although each particular solution lk  suffers from saw tooth noise at
the area of smooth lf statistical independence of each solution leads to self
averaging of this noise in the sum 32 note that suppression of noise happens
without suppression of high derivatives and hence sharp peaks and edges
are not smeared out in contrast to regularization approaches therefore saw
tooth noise instability is defeated without corruption of sharp peaks and edges
moreover continuous parameterization 32 does not need predefined mesh in
space besides since the hilbert space of solution is sampled directly any
assumption about distribution of statistical errors is not necessary

45 rashbapekar excitonpolaron 54 holepolaron in tjmodel 53 49
and manyparticle spin system 88 calculation of the optical conductivity of
polaron by so method can be found in 48 so method appeared to be helpful
in cases when gfs asymptotic limit giving information about ground state
can not be reached for example sign fluctuations of the terms in expansion
25 for a hole in the tjmodel lead to poor statistics at large times 53
though so method is capable of recovering energy and zfactor even from
gf known only at small imaginary times 53
23 advantages and drawbacks of dmcso machinery
among numerical methods capable of obtaining quantitative results in the
problem of exciton 1 and 2 one can list timedependent density functional theory 89 hankesham technique of correcting particlehole excitation energy 90 91 and approaches directly solving bethesalpeter equation
92 93 94 the latter ones provide rather accurate information on the twoparticle gf however usage of finite mesh in directreciprocal space which
is avoided in dmc method leads to its failure in wannier regime 93
in contrast to dmc method none of the traditional numeric methods
can give reliable results for measurable properties of excited states of polaron
at arbitrary range of electronphonon interaction for the macroscopic system
in the thermodynamic limit exact diagonalization method 95 96 97 98
can study excited states though only on rather small finite size systems and
results of this method are not even justified in the variational sense in the
thermodynamic limit 99 there is a batch of rather effective variational exact translation methods 99 100 101 102 103 where basis is chosen in
the momentum space and hence the variational principle is applied in the
thermodynamic limit although these methods can reveal few discrete excited
states its fail for longrange interaction and for dispersive especially acoustic
phonons due to catastrophic growth of variational basis a non perturbative
theory which is able to give information about spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit at least for one electron is dynamical mean field theory
104 105 106 107 however it gives an exact solution only in the case of
infinite dimension which does not correspond to a realistic system and can be
considered only as a guide for extrapolation to finite dimensions 108

quantum monte carlo algorithm 119 120 121 122 is valid for any dimension and properly takes into account quasi longrange interactions 123 path
integral method is capable of obtaining the density of states 119 120 and
isotope exponents 121 124 however calculations of measurable characteristics of excited states such as arpes or optical conductivity by this method
were never reported
in conclusion none of methods except dmcso combination can obtain
at the moment approximationfree results for measurable physical quantities
for a few qps interacting with a macroscopic bosonic bath in the thermodynamic limit indeed there are limitations of the dmc and so methods dmc
method does not work in manyfermion systems due to sign problem and so
method fails at high temperatures comparable to energies of dominant spectral peaks because even very small statistical noise of gfs turns fredholm
equation 13 into essentially ill defined problem 84

3 spectral properties of the frhlich polaron
before development of dmcso methods the information on the excited
states of polaron models especially the frhlich one was very limited knowledge of lf was based on results of infinitedimensions approximation 125
exact diagonalization 126 96 97 97 or strong coupling expansion 127 no
one of the above techniques was capable of obtaining the lf of polaron without approximations especially for longrange interaction where difficulties of
traditional numerical methods dramatically increase in a similar way optical
conductivity oc of frhlich model was known only in strong coupling expansion approximation 128 within the framework of the perturbation theory
129 or was based on the variational feynman path integral technique 75
in this sect we consider exact dmcso results on lf 45 and oc 48 57 of
frhlich polaron model

accuracy for the polaron energy and zfactor is about 104  on the other hand
highenergy part of numeric result fig 2 significantly deviates from that of
the analytic expression 35 this is not surprising since for frhlich polaron
the perturbation theory expression is diverging as   ph and therefore
the perturbation theory breaks down when perturbation theory is obviously
valid eg for the case of finite   1 there is a perfect agreement between
analytic expression and dmcso results fig 2b note that the highenergy
part of lk0  is successfully restored by so method despite the fact that
the total weight of the feature for   005 is less than 102

fig 3 evolution of spectral density with  in the crossover region from intermediate to strong couplings the polaron ground state peak is shown only for   8
note that the spectral analysis still resolves it despite its very small weight  103 

is seen for higher values of the interaction constant and its weight grows with
 
near the threshold   1 lf demonstrates the squareroot dependence
   1 fig 2f
to trace the evolution of the peak at higher values of  the lf was calculated 45 for   4   6 and   8 fig 3 at   4 the peak at
  4 already dominates moreover a distinct highenergy shoulder appears
at   4 which transforms into a broad peak at   85 in the lf for   6
the lf for   8 demonstrates further redistribution of the spectral weight
between different maxima without significant shift of the peak positions
32 optical conductivity of the frhlich polaron validity of the
franckcondon principle in the optical spectroscopy
the fc principle 130 131 and its validity have been widely discussed in studies of optical transitions in atoms molecules 132 133 and solids 134 9
generally the fc principle means that if only one of two coupled subsystems eg an electronic subsystem is affected by an external perturbation
the second subsystem eg the lattice is not fast enough to follow the reconstruction of the electronic configuration it is clear that the justification
for the fc principle is the short characteristic time of the measurement process mp  ic  where mp is related to the energy gap between the initial
and final states e through the uncertainty principle mp  he and
ic is the time necessary to adjust the lattice when the electronic component
is perturbed then the spectroscopic response considerably depends on the
value of the ratio mp ic for example in mixed valence systems where the
ionic valence fluctuates between configurations f 5 and f 6 with characteristic
time ic  1013 s spectra of fast and slow experiments are dramatically different 135 136 photoemission experiments with short characteristic times
mp  1016 s fc regime reveal two lines corresponding to f 5 and f 6

17

states on the other hand slow mssbauer isomer shift measurements with
mp  109 s show a single broad peak with mean frequency lying between
signals from pure f 5 and f 6 shells finally according to paradigm of measurement process time magnetic neutron scattering with mp  ic revealed
both coherent lines with all subsystems dynamically adjusted and broad incoherent remnants of strongly damped excitation of f 5 and f 6 shells 137 138
actually the meaning of the times ic and mp varies with the system and
with the measurement process
to study the interplay between measurement process time mp and adjustment time ic  the oc of the frhlich polaron was studied in 57 from
the weak to the strong coupling regime by three methods dmc method gives
numerically exact answer which is compared with memory function formalism
mff which is able to take dynamical lattice relaxation into account and
strong coupling expansion sce which assumes fc approach it was found
that near critical coupling c  85 a dramatic change of the oc spectrum
occurs dominating peak of oc splits into two satellites in this critical regime
the upper lower one quickly decreases increases its spectral weight as the
value of coupling constant increases besides while oc follows prediction of
mff at   c  its dependence switches to that predicted by sce for larger
couplings it was concluded that for the oc measurement of polaron the
adjustment time ic  hd is set by typical nonadiabatic energy d nonadiabaticity destroys fc classification at   c while fc principle rapidly
regains its validity at large couplings due to fast growth of energy separation
between initial and final states of optical transitions
comparison of exact dmcso data for oc with existing results of approximate methods showed 48 that the feynman path integral technique
75 of devreese de sitter and goovaerts where oc is calculated starting
from the feynman variational model 139 is the only successfully describing
evolution of the energy of the main peak in oc with coupling constant  see
58 however starting from the intermediate coupling regime this approach
fails to reproduce the peak width subsequently the path integral approach
was rewritten in terms of mff 140 then in 57 the extended mff formalism which introduces dissipation processes fixed by exact sum rules was
developed 141
as shown in fig 4a in the weak coupling regime the mff with or without dissipation is in very good agreement with dmc data showing significant
improvement with respect to weak coupling perturbation approach 129 which
provides a good description of oc spectra only for very small values of  for
1    8 where standard mff fails to reproduce peak width fig 4bd
and even the peak position fig 4c the damping introduced to extended
mff scheme becomes crucial results of extended mff are accurate for the
peak energy and quite satisfactory for the peak width fig 4be note that
the broadening of the peak in dmc data is not a consequence of poor quality
of analytic continuation procedure since dmcso methods is capable of revealing such fine features as 2 and 3phonon thresholds of emission fig 4b

however a dramatic change of oc occurs around critical coupling strength
c  85 the dominating peak of oc splits into two ones the energy of lover
one corresponding to the predictions of scr expansion and that of upper
one obeying extended mff value fig 5a the shoulder corresponding to
dynamical extended mff contribution rapidly decreases its intensity with
increase of  and at large  fig 5bc the oc is in good agreement with
strong coupling expansion assuming fc scheme finally comparing energies
of the peaks obtained by dmc extended mff and fc strong coupling expansion fig 5d we conclude that at critical coupling c  85 the spectral
properties rapidly switch from dynamic when lattice relaxes at transition to
fc regime where nuclei are frozen in initial configuration
in order get an idea of the fc breakdown authors of 57 consider the following arguments the approximate adiabatic states are not exact eigenstates
of the system these states are mixed by nondiagonal matrix elements of the

spectroscopic properties of polarons by exact monte carlo

19

nonadiabatic operator d and exact eigenstates are linear combinations of the
adiabatic wavefunctions being interested in the properties of transition from
ground g to an excited ex state whose energy correspond to that of the oc
peak it is necessary to consider mixing of only these states and express exact
wavefunctions as a linear combinations 142 143 of ground and excited adiabatic states the coefficients of superposition are determined from standard
techniques 142 143 where nondiagonal matrix elements of the nonadiabatic

36
the extent to which lattice can follow transition between electronic states
depends on the degree of mixing between initial and final exact eigenstates
through the nonadiabatic interaction if initial and ground states are strongly
mixed the adiabatic classification has no sense and therefore the fc processes have no place and lattice is adjusted to the change of electronic states
during the transition in the opposite limit adiabatic approximation is valid
and fc processes dominate the estimation for the weight of fc component

of maximal mixing the weight of adiabatically connected ac transition

where mp  1e and ic  1d for  of the order of unity one obtains
qualitative description of a rather fast transition from ac to fcdominated
transition when if c and iac exchange half of their weights in the range
of  from 7 to 9 the physical reason for such quick change is the faster
growth of energy separation e  2 compared to that of the matrix element m  12  finally for large couplings initial and final states become
adiabatically disconnected the rapid acfc switch has nothing to do with
the selftrapping phenomenon where crossing and hybridization of the ground
and an excited states occurs this phenomenon is a property of transition
between different states and related to the choice whether lattice can or can
not follow adiabatically the change of electronic state at the transition

4 selftrapping
in this section we consider the selftrapping st phenomenon which due to
essential importance of manyparticle interaction of qp with bosonic bath of

20

a s mishchenko and n nagaosa

macroscopic system was never addressed by exact method before we start
with a basic definition of the st phenomenon and introduce the adopted
criterion for its existence then generic features of st are demonstrated
on a simple model of rashbapekar excitonpolaron in sect 41 it is shown
in sect 42 that the criterion is not a dogma since even in one dimensional
system where st is forbidden by criterion of existence one can observe all
main features of st due to peculiar nature of electronic states
in general terms 7 80 st is a dramatic transformation of a qp properties
when system parameters are slightly changed the physical reason of st is a
quantum resonance which happens at some critical interaction constant c 
between trapped t state of qp with strong lattice deformation around
it and free f state naturally st transition is not abrupt because of
nonadiabatic interaction between t and f states and all properties of the qp
are analytic in  144 at small   c  ground state is an f state which is
weakly coupled to phonons while excited states are t states and have a large
lattice deformation at critical couplings   c a crossover and hybridization
of these states occurs then for   c the roles of the states exchange the
lowest state is a t state while the upper one is an f state
first and up to now the only quantitative criterion for st existence was
given in terms of the ground state properties in the adiabatic approximation
this criterion considers stability of the delocalized state in undistorted lattice
  0 with respect to the energy gain due to lattice distortion  6 0 st
phenomenon occurs when completely delocalized state with   0 is separated
from distorted state with  6 0 by a barrier of adiabatic potential one of
these states is stable while another one is metastable the criterion of barrier
existence is defined in terms of the stability index

discontinuous change of the polaron state ie st occurs in the former case

alone can not conclude the presence or absence of the st and more detailed
discussion for each model is needed

the existence of st is satisfied for three dimensional system with short range

a quantum resonance between polaronic phonon clouds of f and t state is
demonstrated distribution of partial nphonon contributions z k0 n in
17 has one maximum at n  0 in the weak coupling regime which corresponds to weak deformation and one maximum at n  1 in the strong
coupling regime which is the consequence of a strong lattice distortion however due to ft resonance there are two distinct peaks at n  0 and n  1

near the critical coupling c the lf of polaron has several stable states
fig 7 ab below the threshold of incoherent continuum egs  ph  any state
above the threshold is unstable because emission of a phonon with transition
to the ground state at k  0 with energy egs is allowed on the other hand
decay is forbidden by conservation laws for states below the threshold dependence of the energies of ground and excited resonances on the interaction

order of the bare qp mass m to the contrary the effective mass of excited
state m  m is large hence below the critical coupling the energy of the

it is natural to assume that above the critical coupling the situation is
opposite ground state is the t state with large effective mass while excited
f state has small nearly bare effective mass indeed this assumption was
confirmed in the framework of another model which is considered in sect 61
moreover it was shown that in the strong coupling regime excited resonance
inherits not only bare effective mass around k  0 but the whole dispersion
law of the bare qp 49
42 degeneracy driven selftrapping
according to the criterion 38 st phenomenon in onedimensional system does not occur although this statement is probably valid for the
case of single band in relevant energy range it is not the case for the
generic multiband cases this fact has been unnoticed for many years

which prevented the proper explanation of puzzling physics of quasionedimensional compound anthracenepmda although its optical properties
65 145 146 147 66 148 directly suggested resonance of t and f states
the reason is that in anthracenepmda in contrast to conditions at which
criterion 38 is obtained there are two nearly degenerate exciton bands
then one can consider quasidegenerate selftrapping mechanism when st
phenomenon is driven by nondiagonal interaction of phonons with quasidegenerate exciton levels 52 such mechanism was already suggested for explanation of properties of mixed valence systems 143 though its relevance was
never proved by an exact approach

despite numerous efforts over the years there has been no rigorous technique to solve for exciton properties even for the simplest model 12 which
treats electronelectron interactions as a static renormalized coulomb potential with averaged dynamical screening the only solvable cases are the frenkel
smallradius limit 67 and the wannier largeradius limit 68 which describe
molecular crystals and wide gap insulators with large dielectric constant respectively meanwhile even the accurate data for the limits of validity of the

sects 12 and 23 semianalytic approaches has little to add to problem when
quantitative results are needed whereas traditional numerical methods fail to
reproduce them even in the wannier regime to the contrary dmc results
do not contain any approximation

a study of conditions necessary for formation of charge transfer exciton in
three dimensional systems is crucial to finalize protracted discussion of numerous models concerning properties of mixed valence semiconductors 149 a
decade ago unusual properties of sms and smb6 were explained by invoking
the excitonic instability mechanism assuming chargetransfer nature of the
optically forbidden exciton 150 151 although this model explained quantitatively the phonon spectra 152 153 optical properties 154 155 and magnetic neutron scattering data 138 its basic assumption has been criticized
as being groundless 156 157 to study excitonic wavefunction dispersions
of valence and conduction bands were chosen as it is typical for mixed valence
materials almost flat valence band is separated from broad conduction band
having maximum in the centre and minimum at the border of brillouin zone
46 results presented in fig 9b support assumption of 150 151 since wave
function of relative motion has almost zero onsite component and maximal
charge density at near neighbors

6 polarons in undoped high temperature
superconductors
it is now well established that the physics of high temperature superconductors is that of hole doping a mott insulator 158 159 160 even a single
hole in a mott insulator ie a hole in an antiferromagnet in case of infinite
hubbard repulsion u  is substantially influenced by manybody effects 10 because its jump to a neighboring site disturbs antiferromagnetic arrangement
of spins hence a thorough understanding of the dynamics of doped holes in
mott insulators has attracted a great deal of recent interest the two major
interactions relevant to the electrons in solids are electronelectron interactions eei and electronphonon interactions epi the importance of the
former at low doping is no doubt essential since the mott insulator is driven

by strong hubbard repulsion while the latter was considered to be largely
irrelevant to superconductivity based on the observations of a small isotope
effect on the optimal tc 161 and an absence of a phonon contribution to the
resistivity for review see 162
on the other hand there are now accumulating evidences that the epi
plays an important role in the physics of cuprates such as i an isotope effect
on superfluid density s and tc away from optimal doping 163 ii neutron
and raman scattering 164 165 166 experiments showing strong phonon softening with both temperature and hole doping indicating that epi is strong
167 168 furthermore the recent studies of cuprates by the angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy arpes which spectra are proportional to the
lf 7 32 resulted in the discovery of the dispersion kinks at around 4070mev measured from the fermi energy in the correct range of the relevant
oxygen related phonons 169 170 171 these particular phonons  oxygen
buckling and halfbreathing modes are known to soften with doping 172 164
and with temperature 170 171 172 164 165 166 indicating strong coupling the quick change of the velocity can be predicted by any interaction of
a quasiparticle with a bosonic mode either with a phonon 170 171 or with
a collective magnetic resonance mode 173 174 175 however the recently
discovered universality of the kink energy for lsco over the entire doping
range 176 casts doubts on the validity of the latter scenario as the energy
scale of the magnetic excitation changes strongly with doping
besides measured in undoped high tc materials arpes revealed apparent contradiction between momentum dependence of the energy and linewidth
of the qp peak on the one hand the experimental energy dispersion of the
broad peak in many underdoped compounds 31 177 obeys the theoretical
predictions 178 179 whereas the experimental peak width is comparable
with the bandwidth and orders of magnitude larger than that obtained from
theory of mott insulator 53 early attempts to interpret this anomalously
short lifetime of a hole by an interaction with additional nonmagnetic bosonic
excitations eg phonons 180 faced generic question is it possible that interaction with media leaves the energy dispersion absolutely unrenormalized
while induces a decay which inverse lifetime is comparable or even larger
than the qp energy dispersion a possibility of an extrinsic origin of this
width can be ruled out since the doping induces further disorder while a
sharper peak is observed in the overdoped region
in order to understand whether phonons can be responsible for peculiar
shape of the arpes in the undoped cuprates the lf of an interacting with
phonons hole in mott insulator was studied by dmcso 49 the case of the
lf of a single hole corresponds to the arpes in an undoped compound for
a system with large hubbard repulsion u  when u is much larger than the
typical bandwidth w of noninteracting qp the problem reduces to the tj
model 181 182 158 11

we consider the evolution of arpes of a single hole in tjholstein model
4042 from the weak to the strong coupling regime and dispersion of the lf
in the strong coupling regime in sect 61 it occurs that properties of the lf in
the strong coupling regime of the epi explain the puzzle of broad lineshape
in arpes in underdoped high tc superconductors therefore in order to
suggest a crucial test for the mechanism of phononinduced broadening we
present calculations of the effect of the isotope substitution on the arpes in
sect 62
61 spectral function of a hole interacting with phonons in the
tj model selftrapping and momentum dependence
previously the lf of tjholstein model was studied by exact diagonalization
method on small clusters 191 and in the noncrossing approximation nca6
for both phonons and magnons 192 193 however the small system size in
exact diagonalization method implies a discrete spectrum and therefore the
problem of lineshape could not be addressed the latter method omits the
fds with mutual crossing of phonon propagators and hence is an invalid
approximation for phonons in strong and intermediate couplings of epi this
statement was demonstrated by dmc which can sum all fds for holstein
model both exactly and in the nca 49 exact results and those of nca are
in good agreement for small values   04 and drastically different for   1
for example for 0 t  01 exact result shows a sharp crossover to strong
coupling regime for   ch  12 whereas nca result does not undergo such
crossover even at   100 on the other hand nca is valid for interaction of a
hole with magnons since spin s12 can not flip more than once and number
of magnons in the polaronic cloud can not be large note that the tjholstein
model is reduced to problem of polaron which interacts with several bosonic
fields 34
dmc expansion in 49 takes into account mutual crossing of phonon propagators and in the framework of partial nca neglects mutual crossing of
magnon propagators to avoid sign problem nca for magnons is justified for
jt  04 by good agreement of results of nca and exact diagonalization on
small clusters 188 10 194 195 190 recently results of exact diagonalization
were compared in the limit of small epi for tjholstein model bosonholon
model 4042 without nca and bosonholon model with nca 196 although agreement is not so good as for pure tj model it was concluded that
nca for magnons is still good enough to suggest that one can use nca for a
qualitative description of the tjholstein model

nca is equivalent to selfconsistent born approximation scba

model giving the adiabatic ratio 2j  16  1 besides as experience
with the oc of the frhlich polaron sect 32 shows there is one more
important parameter in the strong coupling limit namely the ratio between
measurement process time mp  he where e is the energy separation of
shakeoff hump from the ground state pole and that of characteristic lattice
time   10 is much less than unity hence fast photoemission probe sees
the ions frozen in one of possible configurations 197 the lf in the fc limit
is a sum of transitions between a lower elow q and an upper eup q sheets
of adiabatic potential weighted by the adiabatic wave function of the lower
sheet  low q 2 198 if epi is absent both in initial elow q  q2 2
and final eup q  d  q2 2 states the lf is peaked at the energy d
then if there is epi eup q  q only in the final state ie when hole
is removed from the mott insulator the upper sheet of adiabatic potential
eup q  d  2 2  q  2 2 has the same energy d at q  0 since the
probability function  low q 2 has maximum at q  0 the peak of the lf

behavior of the lf is the same as observed in the arpes of undoped
cuprates the lf consists of a broad peak and a high energy incoherent continuum see fig 11a besides dispersion of the broad peak c in figs 11
reproduces that of sharp peak in pure tj model fig 11bf the lowest dispersionless peak corresponding to small radius polaron has very small weight
and hence can not be seen in experiment on the other hand according to ex
periment momentum dependence of spectral weight z k of broad resonance
exactly reproduces dispersion of z k factor of pure tj model the reason
for such perfect mapping is that in adiabatic case 0 2j  1 all weight of
the sharp resonance in tj model without epi is transformed at strong epi
into the broad peak this picture implies that the chemical potential in the
heavily underdoped cuprates is not connected with the broad resonance but
pinned to the real quasiparticle pole with small zfactor this conclusion was
recently confirmed experimentally 177
comparing the critical epi for a hole in the tjholstein model 4042
ctj  038 and that for holstein model ch  12 with the same value of
hopping t we conclude that spinhole interaction accelerates transition into
the strong coupling regime the reason for enhancement of the role of epi is
found in 196 comparison of the epi driven renormalization of the effective
mass in tjholstein and holstein model shows that large effective mass in the
tj model is responsible for this effect the enhancement of the role of epi
by eei takes place at least for a single hole at the bottom of the tj band
had the comparison been made with halffilled model the result would have
been smaller enhancement or no enhancement at all 199 on the other hand
coupling constant of halfbreathing phonon is increased by correlations 200
finally we conclude that effect of enhancement of the effective epi by eei is
not unambiguous and depends on details of interaction and filling however
this effect is present for small filling in the tjholstein model
62 isotope effect on arpes in underdoped hightemperature
superconductors
the magnetic resonance mode and the phonon modes are the two major
candidates to explain the kink structure of the electron energy dispersion
around 4070 mev below the fermi energy and the isotope effect ie on
arpes should be the smokinggun experiment to distinguish between these
two gweon et al 201 performed the arpes experiment on o18 replaced
bi2212 at optimal doping and found an appreciable ie which however can
not be explained within the conventional weakcoupling migdaleliashberg
theory namely the change of the spectral function due to o18 replacement
has been observed at higher energy region beyond the phonon energy 
60mev this is in sharp contrast to the weak coupling theory prediction ie
the ie should occur only near the phonon energy hence the ie in optimal
bi2212 remains still a puzzle on the other hand the arpes in undoped
materials as described in sect 61 has recently been understood in terms of

the small polaron formation 49 202 198 therefore it is essential to compare
experiment in undoped systems with presented in this sect dmcso data
where theory can offer quantitative results
in addition to hightc problem strong epi mechanism of arpes spectra broadening was considered as one of alternative scenarios for diatomic
molecules 203 colossal magnetoresistive manganites 34 quasionedimensional peierls conductors 37 38 and verwey magnetites 39 therefore exact
analysis of the ie on arpes at strong epi is of general interest for conclusive
experiments in a broad variety of compound classes
dimensionless coupling constant    2 4t in 42 is an invariant quan
tity for the simplest case of ie indeed assuming natural relation   1 m
between phonon frequency and mass
p we find that  does not depend on
the isotope factor iso  0  m0 m  which is defined as the ratio of
phonon frequency in isotope substituted  and normal 0  systems we
chose adopted parameters of the tt t j model which reproduce the experimental dispersion of arpes 178 jt  04 t t  034 and t t  023 
the frequencypof the relevant phonon 32 is set to 0 t  02 and the isotope
factor iso  1618 corresponds to substitution of o18 isotope for o16 
to sweep aside any doubts of possible instabilities of analytic continuation
we calculate
the lf for normal compound nor  1pisotope substituted

monotonic dependence of lf on  ensures stability of analytic continuation
and gives possibility to evaluate the errorbars of a quantity a using quantities
aiso  anor  anor  aant  and aiso  aant 2
since lf is sensitive to strengths of epi only for low frequencies 55 we
concentrate on the low energy part of the spectrum figure 12 shows ie on the
hole lf for different couplings in nodal and antinodal points respectively the
general trend is a shift of all spectral features to larger energies with increase
of the isotope mass   1 one can also note that the shift of broad fcp is
much larger than that of narrow realqp peak moreover for large couplings
 the shift of qp energy approaches zero and only decrease of qp spectral
weight z is observed for larger isotope mass on the other hand the shift
of fcp is not suppressed for larger couplings except for the lf in nodal
point at   062 fig 12a b where lf still has significant weight of qp
functional peak there is one more notable feature of the ie with increase
of the isotope mass ther height of fcp increases taking into account the

conservation law for lf  lk   1 and insensitivity of high energy part
of lf to epi strength 55 the narrowing of the fcp for larger isotope mass
can be concluded to understand the trends of the ie in the strong coupling
regime we analyze the exactly solvable independent oscillators model iom

estimates are in good agreement for strong epi   075 fig 13 however shift of the fcp top p and 12 are considerably enhanced in the
selftrapping st transition region the physical reason for enhancement of
ie in this region is a general property regardless of the qp dispersion range
of epi etc the influence of nonadiabatic matrix element mixing excited
and ground states on the energies of resonances essentially depends on the
phonon frequency while in the adiabatic approximation st transition is sudden and nonanalytic in  80 nonadiabatic matrix elements turn it to smooth
crossover 144 thus as illustrated in fig 13a the smaller the frequency the
sharper the kink in the dependence of excited state energy on the interaction
constant
in the undoped case the present results can be directly compared with
the experiments it is found that the ie on the arpes lineshape of a single hole is anomalously enhanced in the intermediate coupling regime while
can be described by the simple independent oscillators model in the strong
coupling regime the shift of fcp top and change of the fcp height are relevant quantities to pursue experimentally in the intermediate coupling regime

contrast shift of the leading edge of the broad peak is the relevant quantity

in the strong coupling regime since this value increases with coupling as 
these conclusions depending on the fact whether self trapping phenomenon
is encountered in specific case can be applied fully or partially to another
compounds with strong epi 34 37 38 39
63 conclusions and perspectives
in this article we have focused mainly on the polaron problem in strongly
correlated systems this offers an approach from the limit of low carrier concentration doped into the mott insulator which is complementary to the
conventional eliashbergmigdal approach for the epi in metals in the latter
case we have the fermi energy f as a relevant energy scale which is usually
much larger than the phonon frequency 0  in this case the adiabatic migdal
approximation is valid and the vertex corrections which correspond to the
multiphonon cloud and are essential to the selftrapping phenomenon are
suppressed by the ratio 0 f  therefore an important issue is the crossover
from the strong coupling polaronic picture to the weak coupling eliashbergmigdal picture this occurs as one increases the carrier doping into the insulator as is observed by arpes experiments in high temperature superconductors the polaronic states continue to survive even at finite doping 177
this suggests a novel polaronic metallic state in underdoped cuprates which
is common also in cmr manganites 36 and is most probably universal in
transition metal oxides in the optimal and overdoped region the eliashbergmigdal picture becomes appropriate 170 171 but still a nontrivial feature of
the epi is its strong momentum dependence leading to the dichotomy between
the nodal and antinodal regions it is an interesting observation that the highest superconducting transition temperature is attained at the crossover region
between the two pictures above which suggests that both the itinerancy and
strong coupling to the phonons are essential to the quantum coherence it
should be noted that this crossover occurs in a nontrivial way also in the momentum space ie the nodal and antinodal regions behave quite differently
as discussed in sect 62 however the relevance of the epi to the high tc
superconductivity is still left for future investigations
we hope that this article convinces the readers the vital role of arpes
experiments and numerically exact solutions to the epi problem the combination of them offers a powerful tool for the momentumenergy resolved
analysis of these rather complicated strongly correlated electronic systems
this will pave a new path to the deeper understanding of the manybody
electronic systems
