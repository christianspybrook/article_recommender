abstract
this paper is an exposition of the socalled injective morita contexts in which
the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective and morita contexts in which
the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of zimmermannhuisgen motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action or
the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed we introduce the
notions of morita semicontexts and morita data and investigate them injective
morita data will be used with the help of static and adstatic modules to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of categories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a morita datum
we end up with applications of morita contexts to modules and injective right
wide morita contexts

introduction

morita contexts in general and semistrict morita contexts with surjective connecting bilinear morphisms in particular were extensively studied and developed exponentially during the last few decades eg aghz1997 however we sincerely feel that
there is a gap in the literature on injective morita contexts ie those with injective connecting bilinear morphisms apart from the results in nau1994a nau1994b where
the second author initially explored this notion and from an application to grothendieck
groups in the recent paper nau2004 it seems that injective morita contexts were not
studied systematically at all

we noticed that in several results of nau1993 nau1994a and nau1994b that are
related to morita contexts only one trace ideal is used observing this fact we introduce
the notions of morita semicontexts and morita data and investigate them several results
are proved then for injective morita semi contexts andor injective morita data
consider a morita datum m  t s p q  t   s  with not necessarily compatible bimodule morphisms  t  p s q  t and  s  q t p  s we say that m is
injective iff  t and  s are injective and to be a morita datum iff the associated
dual pairings pl  q t p  pr  q ps  ql  p s q and qr  p qt  satisfy
the condition which is closely related to the notion of local projectivity in the sense of
zimmermannhuisgen zh1976 the condition was introduced in agtl2001 and
further investigated by the first author in abu2005
while semistrict unital morita contexts induce equivalences between the whole module categories of the rings under consideration we show in this paper how injective morita
semicontexts and injective morita data play an important role in establishing equivalences between suitable intersecting subcategories of module categories eg intersections
of subcategories that are localizedcolocalized by trace ideals of a morita datum with subcategories of staticadstatic modules etc our main applications in addition to equivalences related to the katoohtakemller localizationcolocalization theory developed in
kat1978 ko1979 and ml1974 will be to modules introduced by menini and orsatti mo1989 and to right wide morita contexts introduced by f castao iglesias and
j gmeztorrecillas cigt1995
most of our results will be stated for left modules while deriving the dual versions for
right modules is left to the interested reader moreover for morita contexts some results
are statedproved for only one of the morita semicontexts as the ones corresponding to
the second semicontext can be obtained analogously for the convenience of the reader we
tried to make the paper selfcontained so that it can serve as a reference on injective morita
semicontexts and their applications in this respect and for the sake of completeness we
have included some previous results of the authors that are in most cases either provided
with new shorter proofs or are obtained under weaker conditions
this paper is organized as follows after this brief introduction we give in section 2
some preliminaries including the basic properties of dual pairings which play a central
role in rest of the work the notions of morita semicontexts and morita data are introduced in section 3 where we clarify their relations with the dual pairings and the socalled
elementary rngs injective morita semicontexts appear in section 4 where we study
their interplay with dual pairings and provide some examples and a counterexample
in section 5 we include some observations regarding static and adstatic modules and use
them to obtain equivalences among suitable intersecting subcategories of modules related
to a morita semicontext in the last section more applications are presented mainly to
subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by a trace ideal of an injective
morita semicontext to modules and to injective right wide morita contexts

preliminaries

throughout r denotes a commutative ring with 1r 6 0r and a a  b b  are unital
ralgebras we have reserved the term ring for an associative ring with a multiplicative
unity and we will use the term rng for a general associative ring not necessarily with
unity all modules over rings are assumed to be unitary and ring morphisms are assumed
to respect multiplicative unities if t and s are categories then we write t  s t  s
to mean that t is a full subcategory of s and t  s to indicate that t and s are
equivalent

rngs and their modules
21 by an arng t t  we mean an a abimodule t with an a abilinear morphism t  t a t  t such that t  t a idt   t  idt a t  we call an arng
t t  an aring iff there exists in addition an a abilinear morphism t  a  t
called the unity map such that t  t a idt   lt and t  idt a  t   rt where
lt

rt

a a t  t and t a a  t are the canonical isomorphisms so an aring is a unital
arng and an arng is roughly speaking an aring not necessarily with unity
22 a morphism of rngs     t  a  t   a  consists of a morphism of ralgebras
aa 
  a  a and an a abilinear morphism   t  t   such that t  t  t    a  
aa 

  t where t  t    t  a t   t  a t  is the canonical map induced by  by rng
we denote the category of associative rngs with morphisms being rng morphisms and
by urng  rng the nonfull subcategory of unital rings with morphisms being the
morphisms in rng which respect multiplicative unities
23 let t t  be an arng by a left t module we mean a left amodule n with a left
n
n
n
alinear morphism n
t  t a n  n such that t  t a idn   t  idt a t  for
left t modules m n we call a left alinear morphism f  m  n a t linear morphism
iff f tm  tf m for all t  t the category of left t modules and left t linear morphisms
is denoted by t m the category mt of right t modules is defined analogously let t  a
and t   a  be rngs we call an a a bimodule n a t t  bimodule iff n n
t  is
n
n

a left t module and n t   is a right t module such that t   t a idt    n

t t bilinear provided f is left t linear and right t linear the category of t t bimodules is denoted by t mt   in particular for any arng t a left right t module
m has a canonical structure of a unitary right left smodule where s  endt mop
s  endmt  and moreover with this structure m becomes a t sbimodule an
s t bimodule
remark 24 similarly one can define rngs over arbitrary notnecessarily unital ground
rngs and rng morphisms between them moreover one can define bimodules over such
rngs and bilinear morphisms between them

notation let t be an arng we write t u ut  to denote that u is a left right t module for a left right t module t u we consider the set  u  homt  u t  u  
homt u t  of all left right t linear morphisms from u to t with the canonical right
left t module structure

generators and cogenerators
definition 25 let t be an arng for a left t module t u consider the following subclasses of t m 
gent u
cogent u
prest u
coprest u






t v   a set  and an exact sequence u   v  0
t w   a set  and an exact sequence 0  w  u  
t v   sets 1  2 and an exact sequence u 2   u 1   v  0
t w   sets 1  2 and an exact sequence 0  w  u 1  u 2 

a left t module in gent u respectively cogent u prest u coprest u is said to be
ugenerated respectively ucogenerated upresented ucopresented moreover
we say that t u is a generator respectively cogenerator presentor copresentor iff
gent u  t m respectively cogent u  t m prest u  t m coprest u  t m

dual pairings
in what follows we recall the definition and properties of dual pairings introduced
in agtl2001 definition 23 and studied further in abu2005
26 let t be an arng a dual left t pairing pl  v t w  consists of a left t module
w and a right t module v with a right t linear morphism pl  v   w equivalently
a left t linear morphism pl  w  v   for dual left pairings pl  v t w  pl  v  



t  w  a morphism of dual left pairings    v  w   v w  consists of a triple
     v

tw

 v  

tw





where   v  v  and   w   w are t linear and   t  t  is a morphism of rngs
such that considering the induced maps  t  v  w  t and  t   v   w   t  we
have
1
 v w  t    v w  t  for all v  v and w   w  
the dual left pairings with the morphisms defined above build a category which we denote
by pl  with pl t   pl we denote the full subcategory of dual t pairings the category
pr of dual right pairings and its full subcategory pr t   pr of dual right t pairings are
defined analogously

remark 27 the reader should be warned that in general for a noncommutative rng t
and a dual left t pairing pl  v t w  the following map induced by the right t linear
morphism pl  v   w 
 t  v  w  t  v w t  pl vw
is not necessarily t balanced and so does not induce in general a map v t w  t in
fact for all v  v w  w and t  t we have
 vt w 
 v tw

28 let t be an arng n w be left t modules and identify n w with the set of all
mappings from w to n considering n with the discrete topology and n w with the product
topology the induced relative topology on homt  w n  n w is a linear topology called
the finite topology for which the basis of neighborhoods of 0 is given by the set of
annihilator submodules
bf 0  f homt  wn   f  w1   wk   w is a finite subset
where
f homt  wn   f  homt  w n  f w   0

t module ut the following canonical map

morita semicontexts

we noticed in the proofs of some results on equivalences between subcategories of
module categories associated to a given morita context that no use is made of the compatibility between the connecting bimodule morphisms or even that only one trace ideal
is used and so only one of the two bilinear morphisms is really in action some results of
this type appeared for example in nau1993 nau1994a and nau1994b moreover
in our considerations some morita contexts will be formed for arbitrary associative rngs
ie not necessarily unital rings these considerations motivate us to make the following
general definitions
31 by a morita semicontext we mean a tuple
mt  t  a s  b p q  t  i

3

where t is an arng s is a brng p is a t sbimodule q is an s t bimodule
 t  p s q  t is a t t bilinear morphism and i  im t   t called the
trace ideal associated to mt  we drop the ground rings a b and the trace ideal i  t
if they are not explicitly in action if mt 3 is a morita semicontext and t s are unital
rings then we call mt a unital morita semicontext
32 let mt  t  a s  b p q  t  mt   t   a  s   b   p   q   t   be
morita semicontexts by a morphism of morita semicontexts from mt to mt  we
mean a four fold set of morphisms
         t  a s  b p q  t   a  s   b   p  q 
where     t  a  t   a  and     s  b  s   b   are rng morphisms
  p  p  is t sbilinear and   q  q is s t bilinear such that
 p q t   p q t  for all p  p q  q 
notice that we consider p  as a t sbimodule and q as an s t bimodule with actions
induced by the morphism of rngs    and    by msc we denote the category
of morita semicontexts with morphisms defined as above and by umsc  msc the
nonfull subcategory of unital morita semicontexts
7

morita semicontexts are closely related to dual pairings in the sense of abu2005
33 let t s p q  t   msc and consider the canonical isomorphisms of abelian
groups




homst  q  p   homtt  p s q t   homts p q 
this means that we have two dual t pairings pl  q t p   pl t  and qr  p qt  
pr t  induced by the canonical t linear morphisms
pl   1  t   q   p and qr   t   p  q 
on the other hand let s t q p  s   msc and consider the canonical isomorphisms
of abelian groups




homst  q p    homss q t p s  homts p  q
then we have two dual spairings pr  q ps   pr s and ql  p s q  pl s
induced by the canonical morphisms
pr   1  s   q  p  and qr     s   p   q
34 by a morita datum we mean a tuple
m  t  a s  b p q  t   s  i j

4

where the following are morita semicontexts
mt  t  a s  b p q  t  i and ms  s  b t  a q p  s  j 5
if moreover the bilinear morphisms  t  p s q  t and   s  q t p  s are
compatible in the sense that
 q p s q   q  p q  t and p  q p s  p q t p  p p  p q q   q 6
then we call m a morita context if t s in a morita datum context m are unital
then we call m a unital morita datum context
35 let m  t  a s  b p q  t   s  and m  t   a  s   b   p  q  
 t    s   be morita contexts extending ami1971 page 275 we mean by a morphism of morita contexts from m to m a four fold set of maps
         t  a s  b p q  t   a  s   b   p  q 
where     t  a  t   a      s  b  s   b   are rng morphisms
  p  p  is t sbilinear and   q  q is s t bilinear such that
 p q t   p q t  and  q p s   q p s   p  p q  q
by mc we denote the category of morita contexts with morphisms defined as above and
by umc  mc the nonfull subcategory of unital morita contexts
8

example 36 if r is commutative then any morita semicontext r r p q  r yields
r
a morita context r r p q  r  r  where  r  q r p  p r q  r
37 we call a morita semicontext mt  t s p q  t  semiderived derived
iff s  endt p op and q   p  we call a morita datum or a morita context m 
t s p q  t   s  semiderived derived iff s  endt p op  or t  endps 
s  endt p op and q   p or t  endps  and q  p  
remark 38 following cae1998 12 however dropping the condition that the bilinear
map  t  p s q  t is surjective morita semicontexts t s p q t  in our sense
were called dual pairs in ver2006 however we think the terminology we are using is more
informative and avoids confusion with other notions of dual pairings in the literature eg
the ones studied by the first author in abu2005 the reason for this specific terminology
ie morita semicontexts is that every morita context contains two morita semicontexts
as clear from the definition and that any morita semicontext can be extended to a not
necessarily unital morita context in a natural way as explained below

elementary rngs
in what follows we demonstrate how to build new morita semicontexts from a given
morita semicontext these constructions are inspired by the notion of elementary rngs in
cae1998 12 and ver2006 remark 38

analogous results to those in lemma 39 can be obtained for the srng s and the
t rng t
2 given a morita semicontext t s p q  t  several equivalent conditions for the
t rng t  p s q to be unital and the modules t p qt to be firm can be found in
ver2006 theorem 33 analogous results can be formulated for the srng q t p
and the smodules ps  s q corresponding to any s t q p  s   msc
proposition 311
1 let mt  t s p q  t   umsc and assume the arng
t  p s q to be unital if  t  t  t respects unities and mt is injective
t

then  t is surjective t  t as arings
2 let ms  s t q p  s   umsc and assume the brng s  q s p to

definition 312 let t be an arng vt a right t module and consider for every left

following af1974 exercises 19 we say vt is lfaithful iff ann
l vt   0 and to be
completely faithful iff vt is lfaithful for every left t module s l similarly we can
define completely faithful left t modules
under suitable conditions the following result characterizes the morita data which
are morita contexts
proposition 313 let m  t s p q  t   s  be a morita datum

hence  q p s q   q  p q  t  annq p   0 since t p is qfaithful ie
 q p s q   q  p q  t for all p  p and q q   q assuming qt is p faithful
one can prove analogously that  p q t p  p  q p s for all p p  p and
q  q consequently m is a morita context

injective morita semicontexts

definition 41 we call a morita semicontext mt  t s p q  t  i 
injective resp semistrict strict iff  t  p s q  t is injective resp surjective bijective
nondegenerate iff q   p and p  q canonically
morita semicontext iff pl  q t p   pl t  and qr  p qt   pr t 
11

notation by msc  msc umsc  umsc we denote the full subcategory of
unital morita semicontexts satisfying the condition moreover we denote by imsc 
msc iumsc  umsc the full subcategory of injective unital morita semicontexts
definition 42 we say a morita datum context m  t s p q  t   s  i j 
is injective resp semistrict strict iff  t  p s q  t and  s  qt p  s
are injective resp surjective bijective
is nondegenerate iff q   p p  q  q  p  and p   q canonically
satisfies the left condition iff pl  q t p   pl t  and ql  p s q  pl s
satisfies the right condition iff qr  p qt   pr t  and pr  q ps  

pr s
satisfies the condition or m is a morita datum morita context iff m
satisfies both the left and the right conditions
notation by mcl  mc umcl  umc we denote the full subcategory of morita
contexts satisfying the left condition and by mcr  mc umcr  umc the full
subcategory of unital morita contexts satisfying the right condition moreover we set
mc  mcl  mcr and umc  umcl  umcr 
lemma 43 let m  t s p q  t   s  i j  mc consider the morita semicontext ms  s t q p  s  the dual pairings pl  q t p   pl t  qr 
p qt   pr t  and the canonical morphisms of rings
p  s  endt p op and q  s  endqt 
1 if qr is injective semistrict then ms is injective p  s  endt p op is a
surjective morphism of brngs
2 assume ps is faithful and let qr be semistrict then s  endt p op an isomorphism of unital brings and ms is strict
3 if pl is injective semistrict then ms is injective q  s  endqt  is a surjective morphism of brngs
4 assume s q is faithful and let pl is semistrict then s  endqt  an isomorphism
of unital brings and ms is strict
proof we prove only 1 and 2 as 3 and 4 can be proved analogously

definition 47 let t be a rng and i  t an ideal for every left t module t v consider
the canonical t linear map
 iv  v  homt i v  v 7 t 7 tv
we say t i is strongly v faithful iff annv i  ker iv   0 moreover we say i is
strongly faithful if t i is v faithful for every left t module t v strong faithfulness of i
wrt right t modules can be defined analogously
remark 48 let t be a rng i  t an ideal and t u a left ideal its clear that ann
u it  
annu i  ker iu  hence if t i is strongly ufaithful then it is ufaithful which
justifies our terminology in particular if t i is strongly faithful then it is completely
faithful
morita contexts are injective by corollary 44 the following result gives a
partial converse

equivalences of categories

in this section we give some applications of injective morita semicontexts and injective morita data to equivalences between suitable subcategories of modules arising in
the katomllerohtake localizationcolocalization theory as developed in eg kat1978
ko1979 ml1974 all rings hence all morita semicontexts and data in this section
are unital

static and adstatic modules
51 cigtw2003 let a and b be two complete cocomplete abelian categories r 
a  b an additive covariant functor with left adjoint l  b  a and let
  lr  1a and   1b  rl
be the induced natural transformations called the counit and the unit of the adjunction
respectively related to the adjoint pair l r are two full subcategories of a and b 
y

x

statr  x  a  lrx  x and adstatr  y  b  y  rly 
whose members are called rstatic objects and radstatic objects respectively it is
evident from definition that we have equivalence of categories statr  adstatr
a typical situation in which static and adstatic objects arise naturally is the
following
52 let t s be rings t us a t sbimodule and consider the covariant functors
hlu  homt u  

tm



sm

and tlu  u s  

sm



t m

it is wellknown that tlu  hlu  is an adjoint pair of covariant functors via the natural
isomorphisms
homt u s m n  homs m homt u n for all m 

sm

and n 

tm

and the natural transformations
 lu  u s homt u   1t m and  lu  1s m  homt u u s 
yield for every t k and s l the canonical morphisms
 luk  u s homt u k  k and  lul  l  homt u u s l

9

we call the hlu static modules ustatic wrt s and set
 luk

statl t us   stathlu   t k  u s homt  u k  k
and the hlu adstatic modules uadstatic wrt s and set
 lul

adstatl t us   adstathlu   s l  l  homt  u u s l
by nau1990a and nau1990b there are equivalences of categories
statl t us   adstatl t us

on the other hand one can define the full subcategories statr t us   adstatr t us

in particular setting

statl t uendt u op

adstatt u
adstatus 




adstatl t uendt u op 
adstatr ends u  us 

there are equivalences of categories

remark 53 the theory of static and adstatic modules was developed in a series of papers
by the second author see the references they were also considered by several other
authors eg alp1990 cf2004 for other terminologies used by different authors the
interested reader may refer to a comprehensive treatment of the subject by r wisbauer
in wis2000

intersecting subcategories
several intersecting subcategories related to morita contexts were introduced in
the literature eg nau1993 nau1994b in what follows we introduce more and we
show that many of these coincide if one starts with an injective morita semicontext
moreover other results on equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related
to an injective morita context will be reframed for arbitrary not necessarily compatible
injective morita data
definition 54
1 for a right t module x a t submodule x   x is called kpure
for some left t module t k iff the following sequence of abelian groups is exact
0  x  t k  x t k  xx  t k  0
2 for a left t module y a t submodule y   y is called lcopure for some left
t module t l iff the following sequence of abelian groups is exact
0  homt y y   l  homt y l  homt y   l  0
definition 55 compare ko1979 theorems 13 23 let t be a ring i  t an
ideal u a left t module and consider the canonical t linear morphisms
 iu  u  homt i u and  iu  i t u  u

2 we say t u is ilocalized iff u  homt i u canonically equivalently iff t i is
strongly ufaithful and t i  t is ucopure

iff t u is idivisible and it  t is upure

given ms  s t q p  s  j  umsc one can define analogously the corresponding
intersecting subcategories of s m and ms 
as an immediate consequence of proposition 56 we get

starting with a morita context the following result was obtained in nau1993
theorem 32 we restate the result for an arbitrary not necessarily compatible morita
datum and sketch its proof
lemma 59 let m  t s p q  t   s  i j be a unital morita datum and consider the associated morita semicontexts mt and ms in 5 then there are equivalences
of categories

proof let t v  xl mt  by the equivalence statl t ps

have homt  p v   adstat t ps  moreover v  dl m hence homt  p v   q t v
20

qt 

canonically and it follows then from the equivalence adstatl s qt   statl s qt  that
homt  p v   statl s qt  moreover we have the following natural isomorphisms
p s homt  p v   v  homs q q t v   homs q homt  p v 

13

ie homt  p v   dl ms  consequently homt  p v   xl ms  moreover 13
yields a natural isomorphism v  homs q homt  p v  analogously one can show for
every w  xl ms  that homs q w   xl mt  and that w  homt  p homs q w 
naturally consequently xl mt   xl ms  the equivalences xr mt   xr ms  can
be proved analogously
proposition 510 let m  t s p q  t   s  i j be a unital injective morita
datum and consider the associated morita semicontexts mt and ms in 5

3 if statr t it   xr ms  and statr s js   xr mt  then there are equivalences of
categories
statr t it   statr s js  and adstatr t it   adstatr s js 
t

proof to prove 1 notice that since m is an injective morita datum p s q  i
s
and q t p  j as bimodules and so the four equivalences of categories result from 52
to prove 2 one can use an argument similar to that in nau1994b theorem 39 to
show that the inclusion statl t it   statl t p s qt   xl ms  implies statl t it  
statl t p s qt   xl mt  and that the inclusion statl s js   statl s q t p s  
xl mt  implies statl s js   statl s q t p s   xl ms  the result follows then by
lemma 59 the proof of 3 is analogous to that of 2
for injective morita semicontexts several subcategories in 12 are shown in the
following result to be equal
theorem 511 let mt  t s p q  t  i  iums then

proof we prove only 1 as 2 can be proved analogously assume the morita semicontext mt  t s p q  t  i is injective by our assumption we have for every
v  dl mt  the commutative diagram
can

p s q t v

then it becomes obvious that  lpv  p s homt p v   v is an isomorphism if and only
if  iv  i t v  v is an isomorphism consequently
vmt   dl mt   statl t ps   dl mt   i c  vmt 
on the other hand we have for every v  dl mt  the following commutative diagram

in addition to establishing several other equivalences of intersecting subcategories

more applications

in this final section we give more applications of morita semicontexts and
injective morita semicontexts all rings in this section are unital whence all morita
semicontexts are unital moreover for any ring t we denote with t e an arbitrary but
fixed injective cogenerator in t m
notation let t be an aring for any left t module t v we set  v  homt v t e if
moreover t vs is a t sbimodule for some bring s then we consider 
s v with the left
smodule structure induced by that of vs 
23

lemma 61 compare col1990 lemma 32 cf2004 lemmas 212 213 let t be
an aring s a bring and t vs a t sbimodule
1 a left t module t k is v generated if and only if the canonical t linear morphism
 lvk  v s homt v k  k

18

is surjective moreover v s w  prest v   gent v  for every left smodule
s w
2 a left smodule s l is 
s v cogenerated if and only if the canonical slinear morphism
lvl  l  homt v v s l

19


is injective moreover homt v m  copres
s v   cogens v  for every left
t module t m

remark 62 let t be an aring s a bring and t vs a t sbimodule notice that for
any left smodule s l we have
l
ann
l vs   l  l  v s l  0  ker vl 

whence by lemma 61 2  vs is lfaithful if and only if s l is 
s v cogenerated it follows

then that vs is completely faithful if and only if s v is a cogenerator

localization and colocalization
in what follows we clarify the relations between static adstatic modules and subcategories colocalized localized by a trace ideal of a morita context satisfying the condition
recall that for any t sbimodule t ps we have by lemma 61
statl t ps   gent p  and adstatl t ps   cogen
s p 

20

theorem 63 let m  t s p q  t   s  i j  umc then we have

3 if qr  p qt   pr t  then t i  t t is pure and i c  i d
24

21

proof for every left t module t k consider the following diagram with canonical morphisms and let 2   ik   lpk  it is easy to see that both rectangles and the two right

triangle in diagram 22 implies that 2 is injective whence  lpk is injective by the
commutativity of the lower right triangle

1 if k  statl t ps  then the commutativity of the lower right triangle 22 and the
injectivity of 2 show that  ik is injective hence statl t ps   i f on the other
hand if t k is p generated then  lpk is surjective by lemma 61 1 thence bijective
ie k  statl t ps  consequently gent p   statl t ps 
2 this follows directly from the inclusions in 21 and 1
3 assume qr  p qt   pr t  since pr  pr s it follows by analogy to propor
sition 212 3 that ps is flat hence idp s q

by definition j l  j f and adstatl t ps   cogen
s p  if s l  j f then  jl is injective
and it follows by commutativity of the right rectangle in diagram 23 that  lpl is injective

hence s l is 
s p cogenerated by lemma 61 2 consequently j f  cogens p 
assume now that qr  pr t  then it follows from lemma 43 that  s is injective

hence q t p  j and so 4  can   s  l1  p p
l  is injective

1 since 3 is injective  jl is also injective for every s l ie js  ss is pure if s l 
j c then it follows from the commutativity of the left rectangle in diagram 23 that
 lpl is injective hence l  cogen
s p  by lemma 61 2
2 assume that pr  pr s so that 4 is injective if s l  j l then  jl is an
isomorphism thence  lpl is surjective notice that 4 is injective consequently

modules
to the end of this section we fix a unital ring t a left t module t p and set s 
endt p op 
definition 65 mo1989 we call t p a module iff gent p   cogen
s p 
remark 66 it was shown by j trlifaj trl1994 that all modules are finitely generated
by definition statl t ps   t m and adstatl t ps   s m are the largest subcategories between which the adjunction p s  homt p  induces an equivalence on
the other hand lemma 61 shows that gent p   t m and cogen
s p   s m are the
largest such subcategories see col1990 section 3 for more details this suggests the
following observation

proposition 67 xin1999 lemma 23 we have

proof
1 if pr  pr s then it follows by theorem 63 that gent p   statl t ps 
which is equivalent to each of b and c by wis2000 44 and to d by wis2000
43
2 it follows by the assumptions theorems 63 64 and 52 that gent p   statl t ps  

adstatl t ps   cogen
s p  whence gent p   cogens p  which is the definition
of modules hence a b c the equivalence a  d is evident by
wis2000 corollary 47 and we are done

wide morita contexts
wide morita contexts were introduced by f castao iglesias and j gmeztorrecillas
cigt1995 and cigt1996 as an extension of classical morita contexts to abelian
categories
definition 610 let a and b be abelian categories a right left wide morita
context between a and b is a datum wr  g a b f   where g  a  b  f are
right left exact covariant functors and   f  g  1a    g  f  1b   1a 
f  g   1b  g  f  are natural transformations such that for every pair of objects
a b  a  b the compatibility conditions ga   ga and f b   f b hold
definition 611 let a and b be abelian categories and w  g a b f   be a right
left wide morita context we call w injective respectively semistrict strict iff 
and  are monomorphisms respectively epimorphisms isomorphisms
remarks 612 let w  g a b f   be a right left wide morita context
1 it follows by cdn2005 propositions 11 14 that if either  or  is an epimorphism
monomorphism then w is strict whence a  b
2 the resemblance of injective left wide morita contexts is with the moritatakeuchi
contexts for comodules of coalgebras ie the so called preequivalence data for categories of comodules introduced in tak1977 see cigt1998 for more details
injective right wide morita contexts
in a recent work cdn2005 51 chifan et al clarified for module categories the
relation between classical morita contexts and right wide morita contexts for the convenience of the reader and for later reference we include in what follows a brief description
of this relation
613 let t s be rings a  t m and b  s m associated to each morita context
m  t s p q  t   s  is a wide morita context as follows define g  a  b  f
28

by g  q t  and f   p s  then there are natural transformations  
f  g  1t m and   g  f  1s m such that for each t v and ws

then the datum wr m  g t m s m f   is a right wide morita context
conversely let t   s  be two rings and wr  g  t  m s  m f       be a right wide
morita context between t  m and s  m such that the right exact functors g  t  m 

s  m  f commute with direct sums by watts theorems eg gol1979 there exists a
t sbimodule p  eg f  s   such that f   p  s   an s t bimodule q such that
g  q t   and there should exist two bilinear forms
 t   p  s  q  t  and  s   q t  p   s  
such that the natural transformations   f   g  1t  m    g  f   1s  m are given by
 v  p s  q  t  v    p  q  t  v  and w  q  t p s w    q   p s  w 
for all v   t  m w   s  m p  p  q   q  v   v  and w   w   it can be shown that
in this way one obtains a morita context m  m wr   t   s  p   q   t    s  
moreover it turns out that given a wide morita context wr  we have wr  wr mwr 
the following result clarifies the relation between injective morita contexts and
injective right wide morita contexts
theorem 614 let m  t s p q  t   s  be a morita context a  t m b 
s m and consider the induced right wide morita context wr m  g a b f  
1 if wr m is an injective right wide morita context then m is an injective morita
context
2 if m  umcr  then wr m is an injective right wide morita context
proof
1 let wr m be an injective right wide morita context then in particular
 t   t and  s  s are injective ie m is an injective morita context
2 x
assume that m satisfies the right condition suppose there exists some t v and
pi s qi t vi   ker v  then for any q  q we have
