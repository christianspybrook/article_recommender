abstract
the multisite phosphorylationdephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling
this motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without
direct positive feedbacks in this paper we study the number of positive steady states of a general
multisite phosphorylationdephosphorylation cycle and how the number of positive steady states varies
by changing the biological parameters we show analytically that 1 for some parameter ranges there
are at least n  1 if n is even or n if n is odd steady states 2 there never are more than 2n  1
steady states in particular this implies that for n  2 including single levels of mapk cascades there
are at most three steady states 3 for parameters near the standard michaelismenten quasisteady
state conditions there are at most n  1 steady states and 4 for parameters far from the standard
michaelismenten quasisteady state conditions there is at most one steady state

introduction

a promising approach to handling the complexity of cell signaling pathways is to decompose pathways into
small motifs and analyze the individual motifs one particular motif that has attracted much attention in
recent years is the cycle formed by two or more interconvertible forms of one protein the protein denoted
here by s0  is ultimately converted into a product denoted here by sn  through a cascade of activation
reactions triggered or facilitated by an enzyme e conversely sn is transformed back or deactivated
into the original s0  helped on by the action of a second enzyme f  see figure 1

such structures often called futile cycles also called substrate cycles enzymatic cycles or enzymatic
interconversions see 1 serve as basic blocks in cellular signaling pathways and have pivotal impact on
the signaling dynamics futile cycles underlie signaling processes such as gtpase cycles 2 bacterial
twocomponent systems and phosphorelays 3 4 actin treadmilling 5 and glucose mobilization 6 as
well as metabolic control 7 and cell division and apoptosis 8 and cellcycle checkpoint control 9 one
very important instance is that of mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk cascades which regulate

primary cellular activities such as proliferation differentiation and apoptosis 1013 in eukaryotes from
yeast to humans
mapk cascades usually consist of three tiers of similar structures with multiple feedbacks 1416
each individual level of the mapk cascades is a futile cycle as depicted in figure 1 with n  2 markevich
et als paper 17 was the first to demonstrate the possibility of multistationarity at a single cascade
level and motivated the need for analytical studies of the number of steady states conradi et al studied
the existence of multistationarity in their paper 19 employing algorithms based on feinbergs chemical
reaction network theory crnt for more details on crnt see 3132 the crnt algorithm confirms
multistationarity in a single level of mapk cascades and provides a set of kinetic constants which can
give rise to multistationarity however the crnt algorithm only tests for the existence of multiple steady
states and does not provide information regarding the precise number of steady states
in 18 gunawardena proposed a novel approach to the study of steady states of futile cycles his
approach which was focused in the question of determining the proportion of maximally phosphorylated
substrate was developed under the simplifying quasisteady state assumption that substrate is in excess
nonetheless our study of multistationarity uses in a key manner the basic formalism in 18 even for the
case when substrate is not in excess
in section 2 we state our basic assumptions regarding the model the basic formalism and background
for the approach is provided in section 3 the main focus of this paper is on section 4 where we derive
various bounds on the number of steady states of futile cycles of size n the first result is a the lower
bound for the number of steady states currently available results on lower bounds as in 29 can only
handle the case when quasisteady state assumptions are valid we substantially extend these results to the
fully general case by means of a perturbation argument which allows one to get around these restricted
assumptions another novel feature of our results in this paper is the derivation of an upper bound
of 2n  1 valid for all kinetic constants models in molecular cell biology are characterized by a high
degree of uncertainly in parameters hence such results valid over the entire parameter space are of special
significance however when more information of the parameters are available sharper upper bounds can
obtained see theorems 4 and 5 we finally conclude our paper in section 5 with a conjecture of an n  1
upper bound
we remark that the results given here complement our work dealing with the dynamical behavior
of futile cycles for the case n  2 25 showed that the model exhibits generic convergence to steady
states but no more complicated behavior at least within restricted parameter ranges while 27 showed a
persistence property no species tends to be eliminated for any possible parameter values these papers
did not address the question of estimating the number of steady states an exception is the case n  1
for which uniqueness of steady states can be proved in several ways and for which global convergence to
these unique equilibria holds 27

model assumptions

before presenting mathematical details let us first discuss the basic biochemical assumptions that go into
the model in general phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can follow either distributive or processive
mechanism in the processive mechanism the kinase phosphatase facilitates two or more phosphorylations
dephosphorylations before the final product is released whereas in the distributive mechanism the kinase
phosphatase facilitates at most one phosphorylation dephosphorylation in each molecular encounter
in the case of n  2 a futile cycle that follows the processive mechanism can be represented by reactions
2

as follows
s0  e  es0  es1  s2  e
s2  f  f s2  f s1  s0  f 
and the distributive mechanism can be represented by reactions
s0  e  es0  s1  e  es1  s2  e
s2  f  f s2  s1  f  f s1  s0  f
biological experiments have demonstrated that both dual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in mapk
are distributive see 1416 in their paper 19 conradi et al showed mathematically that if either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation follows a processive mechanism the steady state will be unique which
it is argued in 19 contradicts experimental observations so to get more interesting results we assume
that both phosphorylations and dephosphorylations in the futile cycles follow the distributive mechanism
our structure of futile cycles in figure 1 also implicitly assumes a sequential instead of a random
mechanism by a sequential mechanism we mean that the kinase phosphorylates the substrates in a
specific order and the phosphatase works in the reversed order this assumption dramatically reduces the
number of different phosphoforms and simplifies our analysis in a special case when the kinetic constants
of each phosphorylation are the same and the kinetic constants of each dephosphorylation are the same
the random mechanism can be easily included in the sequential case biologically there are systems for
instance the autophosphorylation of fgfreceptor1 that have been experimentally shown to follow a
sequential mechanism 33
to model the reactions we assume mass action kinetics which is standard in mathematical modeling
of molecular events in biology

although the equation   0 represents 3n  3 equations with 3n  3 unknowns next we will show that
it can be reduced to two equations with two unknowns which have the same number of positive solutions
as   0 let us first define a set
c
s c  u v  r  r  gc
1 u v  0 g2 u v  0
c
2
where gc
1  g2  r  r are given by


gc

gc
2 u v  0 u2 uv  0 u  stot 2 u  ftot u1 u  ftot 2 u v  stot 

the precise statement is as follows
lemma 1 there exists a mapping   r3n3  r2 such that for each  c the map  restricted to
z c is a bijection between the sets z c and s c
proof let us define the mapping   r3n3  r2 as x  ef s0  where
x  s0      sn  c0      cn1  d1      dn  e f 
if we can show that  induces a bijection between z c and s c we are done
first we claim that z c  s c pick any x  z c we have that x satisfies 35
moreover 3n2 x  c  0 yields
e
etot  e  es0 1  
f
and thus
etot

e
1  s0 1 ef 
using 3n1 x  c  0 and 3n2 x  c  0 we get
etot
e1  s0 1 ef 


ftot
f 1  s0 2 ef 

which is gc
1 ef s0   0 after multiplying by 1  s0 2 ef  and rearranging terms

to check that gc

for i  0     n  1 it is easy to see that the vector x  s0      sn  c0      cn1  d1      dn  e f  satisfies
1 x  c  0     3n1 x  c  0 if 3n2 x  c and 3n3 x  c are also zero then x is an
element of z c with x  y given the condition that gc

we have g1 ef s0   0 and therefore 9 holds since

it remains for us to show that the map  is one to one on z c suppose that x1   x2   u v
where
xi  si0      sin  ci0      cin1  di1      din  ei  f i  i  1 2
by the definition of  we know that s10  s20 and e1 f 1  e2 f 2  therefore s1i  s2i for i  0     n
equation 8 gives

thus f 1  f 2  and c1i  c2i  d1i1  d2i1 for i  0     n  1 because of 35 therefore x1  x2  and 
is one to one
the above lemma ensures that the two sets z c and s c have the same number of elements from
c
now on we will focus on s c the set of positive solutions of equations gc

one approach to solving 1011 is to view gc
2 u v as a quadratic polynomial in v since g2 u 0  0
equation 11 has a unique positive root namely
p
h c u  h c u2  4stot 0 u2 u

12
v

where
h c u  0 u  stot 2 u  ftot u1 u  ftot 2 u

we get
substituting this expression for v into 10 and multiplying by

14
so any u v  s c should satisfy 12 and 14 on the other hand any positive solution u of 14
notice that 0 u  0 and v given by 12 always positive provide a positive a solution of 1011
that is u v is an element in s c therefore the number of positive solutions of 1011 is the same
as the number of positive solutions of 12 and 14 but v is uniquely determined by u in 12 which
further simplifies the problem to one equation 14 with one unknown u based on this observation we
have
6n6
such that the following
theorem 1 for each positive numbers stot   there exist 0  0 and   r
property holds pick any etot  ftot such that

ftot  etot   0 stot 

15

then the system  c with c  etot  ftot  stot  has at least n  1 n positive steady states when n is
even odd
8

proof for each   stot  let us define two functions r  r  r as follows
h stot  u  h stot stot stot  u

by lemma 1 and the argument before this theorem it is enough to show that there exist 0  0 and  
6n6
such that for all   0 0  the equation f stot  u  0 has at least n  1 n positive solutions
r
when n is even odd then given stot   etot  and ftot satisfying 15 we let   etot stot  0 
and apply the result

where the i s and kmi s are defined as in 6 and i  kcati lcati  the polynomial f stot 0 u
is of degree n  1 so there are at most n  1 positive roots notice that u  0 is not a root because
f stot 0 u    0 which also implies that when n is odd there can not be n  1 positive roots
now fix any stot and  we will construct a vector  such that f stot 0 u has n  1 distinct positive
roots when n is even
let us pick any n  1 positive real numbers u1      un1  such that their product is  and assume

in order to satisfy 20 from the given

such that i  kcati lcati  i  0     n  1 and 6 holds this vector  will guarantee that f stot 0 u
has n  1 positive distinct roots when n is odd a similar construction will give a vector  such that
f stot 0 u has n positive roots and one negative root
one construction of  given i  kmi  i  i  0     n  1 is as follows for each i  0     n  1 we
start by defining
i kmi

consistently with the definitions in 6 then we take

this  satisfies i  kcati lcati  i  0     n  1 and 6
in order to apply the implicit function theorem we now view the functions defined by formulas in
16 and 17 as defined also for   0 ie as functions r  r  r it is easy to see that f stot  u
is c 1 on r  r because the polynomial under the square root sign in f stot  u is never zero on
s
tot 0 u  6 0 by the
the other hand since f stot 0 u is a polynomial in u with distinct roots  f
u

i

implicit function theorem for each i  1     n  1 there exist open intervals ei containing 0 and open
intervals ui containing ui  and a differentiable function
i  ei  ui
such that i 0  ui  f stot  i   0 for all   ei  and the images i ei s are nonoverlapping if
we take

ei
0 0

then for any   0 0  we have i  as n  1 distinct positive roots of f stot  u the case when
n is odd can be proved similarly
the above theorem shows that when etot ftot is sufficiently small it is always possible for the futile
cycle to have n  1 n steady states when n is even odd by choosing appropriate kinetic constants 
10

we should notice that for arbitrary  the derivative of f at each positive root may become zero which
breaks down the perturbation argument here is an example to show that more conditions are needed
with
n  2 0  1 1  3   6 0  1  112 k0  18 k1  12 stot  5
we have that

f stot 0 u  3u3  12u2  15u  6  3u  12 u  2

has a double root at u  1 in this case even for   001 there is only one positive root of f stot  u

states of system  c is greater or equal to the number of positive roots of f stot 0 u

proof suppose that f stot 0 u has m roots 1      m  applying lemma 2 we have

11

by the perturbation arguments as in theorem 1 we have that there exists 1  0 such that f stot  u

the above result depends heavily on a perturbation argument which only works when etot ftot is
sufficiently small in the next section we will give an upper bound of the number of steady states with no
restrictions on etot ftot  and independent of  and c

theorem 3 for each  c the system  c has at most 2n  1 positive steady states

in the special case when u1 u  etot ftot 2 u  0 by 10 we must have u  etot ftot  and
thus 1 etot ftot   2 etot ftot  substituting into 11 we get a unique v defined as in 12 with
u  etot ftot  but notice that in this case u  etot ftot is also a root of p c u so also in this case
the number of positive solutions to 1011 is no greater than the number of positive roots of p c u
it is easy to see that p c u is divisible by u consider the polynomial qc u  p c uu of
degree 2n  1 we will first show that qc u has no more than 2n positive roots then we will prove by
contradiction that 2n distinct positive roots can not be achieved
it is easy to see that the coefficient of u2n1 is
0    n1 2
 0
lmn1
and the constant term is

etot
 0
ftot km0

so the polynomial qc u has at least one negative root and thus has no more than 2n positive roots
suppose that s c has cardinality 2n then qc u must have 2n distinct positive roots and each of
them has multiplicity one let us denote the roots as u1      u2n in ascending order we claim that none
of them equals etot ftot  if so we would have 1 etot ftot   2 etot ftot  and etot ftot would
be a double root of qc u contradiction
12

since qc 0  0 qc u is positive on intervals
i0  0 u1  i1  u2  u3      in1  u2n2  u2n1  in  u2n  
and negative on intervals
j1  u1  u2      jn  u2n1  u2n 
as remarked earlier 1 etot ftot  6 2 etot ftot  the polynomial qc u evaluated at etot ftot
is negative and therefore etot ftot belongs to one of the j intervals say js  u2s1  u2s  for some
s  1     n 
on the other hand the denominator of v in 22 denoted as bu is a polynomial of degree n and
divisible by u if bu has no positive root then it does not change sign on the positive axis of u but v
changes sign when u passes etot ftot  thus v2s1 and v2s have opposite signs and one of u2s1  v2s1 
and u2s  v2s  is not a solution to 1011 which contradicts the fact that both are in s c
otherwise there exists a positive root  of bu such that there is no other positive root of bu
between  and etot ftot  plugging  into qc u we see that qc  is always positive therefore 
belongs to one of the i intervals say it  u2t  u2t1  for some t  0     n there are two cases
1 etot ftot   we have

u2s1  etot ftot  u2t  

notice that v changes sign when u passes etot ftot  so the corresponding v2s1 and v2t have different
signs and either u2s1  v2s1  
 s c or u2t  v2t  
 s c contradiction
2 etot ftot   we have

  u2t1  etot ftot  u2s 

since v changes sign when u passes etot ftot  so the corresponding v2t1 and v2s have different
signs and either u2t1  v2t1  
 s c or u2s  v2s  
 s c contradiction
therefore  c has at most 2n  1 steady states

finetuned upper bounds

in the previous section we have seen that any u v  s c u 6 etot ftot must satisfy 2223 but
not all solutions of 2223 are elements in s c suppose that u v is a solution of 2223 it is
in s c if and only if u v  0 in some special cases for example when the enzyme is in excess or the
substrate is in excess we could count the number of solutions of 2223 which are not in s c to get
a better upper bound
the following is a standard result on continuity of roots see for instance lemma a41 in 30
lemma 3 let gz  z n  a1 z n1      an be a polynomial of degree n and complex coefficients having
distinct roots
1      q 
with multiplicities
n1      nq  n

13

respectively given any small enough   0 there exists a   0 so that if
hz  z n  b1 z n1      bn  ai  bi    for i  1     n
then h has precisely ni roots in b i  for each i  1     q
6n6
such that 1  6 2  and each stot  0 there exists
theorem 4 for each   0 and   r
2  0 such that for all positive numbers etot  ftot satisfying ftot  etot   2 stot  the system
 c has at most n  1 positive steady states

proof let us define a function r  c  c as follows
qstot  u  qstot stot stot  u
and a set b stot  consisting of the roots of qstot  u which are not positive or the corresponding
vs determined by us as in 22 are not positive since qstot  u is a polynomial of degree 2n  1
if we can show that there exists 2  0 such that for any   0 2  qstot  u has at least n roots
counting multiplicities that are in b stot  then we are done
in order to apply lemma 3 we regard the function qstot as defined on r  c at   0
qstot 0 u  0 2   u2  0  stot 2 u1  2   u  stot u1  2 2 u
 0 2   u2  0 u1  2   u  stot 2 u1  2   u  stot u1  2 2 u
 0   uu1  2   stot uu1  2 2  1 u
 2  1 u0  stot u1  2   0 
 2  1 f stot 0 u
let us denote the distinct roots of qstot 0 uu as
u1      uq 
with multiplicities
n1      nq  2n  1
and the roots of 1  2 as
u1      up  p  q
with multiplicities
m1      mp  n ni  mi  for i  1     p
for each i  1     p if ui is real and positive then there are two cases ui 6  as 1  6 2 
1 ui   we have
2 ui   we have

ui 1 ui   2 ui   1 ui   2 ui   0
ui 1 ui   2 ui   1 ui   2 ui   0

14

in both cases ui 1 ui   2 ui  and   ui have opposite signs ie
ui 1 ui   2 ui   ui   0
let us pick   0 small enough such that the following conditions hold
1 for all i  1     p if ui is not real then b ui  has no intersection with the real axis
2 for all i  1     p if ui is real and positive the following inequality holds for any real u  b ui 
u1 u  2 u  u  0

24

3 for all i  1     p if ui is real and negative then b ui  has no intersection with the imaginary
axis
t
4 b uj  b uk    for all j 6 k  1     q

by lemma 3 there exists 3  0 such that for all   0 3  the polynomial qstot  uu has exactly
nj roots in each b uj  j  1     q denoted by ukj  k  1     nj 

 i  1  p
  p with the v defined as
we pick one such  and we claim that none of the roots in b uip
in 22 will be an element in s if so we are done since there are p1 ni  p1 mi  n such roots of
qstot  u which are in b stot 
for each i  1     p there are two cases
1 ui is not real then condition 1 guarantees that uki  is not real for each k  1     ni  and thus is
in b stot 
2 ui is real and positive pick any root uki   b ui  k  1     ni  the corresponding vik  equals
  uki 
 0
uki 1 uki   2 uki 

 s c and uki   b stot 
followed from 24 so uki  vik  
3 ui is real and negative by condition 1 and 3 uki  is not positive for all k  1     ni 

the next theorem considers the case when enzyme is in excess
6n6
such that 1  6 2  and each etot  0 there exists 3  0
theorem 5 for each   0   r
such that for all positive numbers ftot  stot satisfying ftot  etot   stot 3  the system  c has
at most one positive steady state
6n6
such that 1  6 2  and each etot  0 we define a function
proof for each   0   r
r  c  c as follows
qetot  u  qetot etot etot  u

15

let us define the set c etot  as the set of roots of qetot  u which are not positive or the
corresponding vs determined by us as in 22 are not positive if we can show that there exists 3  0
such that for any   0 3  there is at most one positive root of qetot  u that is not in c etot 
we are done
in order to apply lemma 3 we now view the function qetot as defined on r  c at   0

let us denote the distinct roots of qetot 0 uu as
u1   u2      uq 
with multiplicities
n1      nq  2n  1
and u2      uq are the roots of retot u other than 
since 1  6 2  retot u is not divisible by u   and thus n1  1
for each i  2     q we have

 ui 1 ui    2 ui  are both positive since ui 1 ui  



2 ui  and   ui are non zero ui 1 ui   2 ui  and   ui must have opposite signs that is

ui 1 ui   2 ui   ui   0
let us pick   0 small enough such that the following conditions hold for all i  2     q
1 if ui is not real then b ui  has no intersection with the real axis
2 if ui is real and positive then for any real u  b ui  the following inequality holds
u1 u  2 u  u  0

25

3 if ui is real and negative then b ui  has no intersection with the imaginary axis
t
4 b uj  b uk    for all i 6 k  2     q

by lemma 3 there exists 3  0 such that for all   0 3  the polynomial qetot  u has exactly
nj roots in each b uj  j  1     q denoted by ukj  k  1     nj 
we pick one such  and if we can show that all of the roots in b ui  i  2     q are in c etot 
then we are done since the only roots that may not be in c etot  are the roots in b u1  and there
is one root in b u1 
for each i  2     p there are three cases
16

1 ui is not real then condition 1 guarantees that uki  is not real for all k  1     ni 
2 ui is real and positive pick any root uki  k  1     ni  the corresponding vik  equals
  uki 
 0
uki 1 uki   2 uki 
so uki  is in c etot 
3 ui is real and negative by conditions 1 and 3 uki  is not positive for all k  1     ni

conclusions and discussions

here we have set up a mathematical model for multisite phosphorylationdephosphorylation cycles of size
n and studied the number of positive steady states based on this model we reformulated the question
of number of positive steady states to question of the number of positive roots of certain polynomials
through which we also applied perturbation techniques our theoretical results depend on the assumption
of mass action kinetics and distributive sequential mechanism which are customary in the study of multisite
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
an upper bound of 2n  1 steady states is obtained for arbitrary parameter combinations biologically
when the substrate concentration greatly exceeds that of the enzyme there are at most n  1 n steady
states if n is even odd and this upper bound can be achieved under proper kinetic conditions see
theorem 1 for the construction on the other extreme when the enzyme is in excess there is a unique
steady state
as a special case of n  2 which can be applied to a single level of mapk cascades our results
guarantees that there are no more than three steady states consistent with numerical simulations in 17
we notice that there is an apparent gap between the upper bound 2n  1 and the upper bound of n  1
n if n is even odd when the substrate is in excess if we think the ratio etot ftot as a parameter 
then when   1 there are at most n  1 n steady states when n is even odd which coincides with the
largest possible lower bound when   1 there is a unique steady state if the number of steady states
changes continuously with respect to  then we do not expect the number of steady states to exceed
n  1 n if n is even odd so a natural conjecture would be that the number of steady states never
exceed n  1 under any conditions
