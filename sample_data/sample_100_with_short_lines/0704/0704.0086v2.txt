clustering in a stochastic model of
onedimensional gas
by vladislav v vysotsky1
st petersburg state university
we give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model
of onedimensional gas at time zero the gas consists of n identical
particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero
initial speeds particles begin to move under the forces of mutual
attraction when particles collide they stick together forming a new
particle called cluster whose mass and speed are defined by the laws
of conservation
we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of kn t as n  
where kn t denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system
with n initial particles our main result is a functional limit theorem
for kn t its proof is based on the discovered localization property
of the aggregation process which states that the behavior of each
particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles

1 introduction
11 description of the model we give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of onedimensional gas at time zero the gas
consists of n point particles each one of mass n1  these particles are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds particles
begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction when two or more
particles collide they stick together forming a new particle called cluster
whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of mass and momentum
conservation between collisions particles move according to the laws of
newtonian mechanics
we suppose that the force of mutual attraction does not depend on distance and equals the product of masses this assumption is natural for

onedimensional models because by the gauss law applied to flux of the
gravitational field gravitation is proportional to the distance to the power
one minus dimension of the space at any moment the acceleration of a
particle is thus equal to difference of masses located to the right and to the
left of the particle
random initial positions of particles are usually described see 8 16
25 by the following natural models in the uniform model n particles are
independently and uniformly spread on 0 1 in the poisson model particles
are located at points n1 s1  n1 s2      n1 sn  where si is a standard exponential
random walk in other words particles are located at points of first n jumps
of a poisson process with intensity n
these two models are the most natural and interesting let us call them
the main models of initial positions however we will see that behavior
of the poisson model is essentially defined by independence of initial distances between particles rather than by the particular type of the distances
distribution therefore it is of a great mathematical interest to generalize the poisson model by introducing the id model where id stands
for independent distances as follows particles are initially located at

n s1  n s2      n sn  where si is a positive random walk whose nonnegative
iid increments xi satisfy the normalization condition exi  1 note that
if we proceed to the limit as n   we consider a system of total mass one
which consists of roughly speaking infinitesimal particles homogeneously
spread on 0 1 this is true for all the mentioned models of initial positions
the mathematical interest in sticky particles systems arises mainly from
relations between these systems and some nonlinear partial differential equations originating from fluid mechanics for example the burgers equation
these equations admit interpretation in terms of sticky particles see gurbatov et al 10 brenier and grenier 4 or e rykov and sinai 6 sticky
particles models are also used for numerical solving of other partial differential equations see chertock et al 5 for explanations and further references
as time goes particles aggregate in clusters clusters become larger and
larger while the number of clusters decreases until they merge into a single
cluster containing all initial particles this process of mass aggregation is
strongly connected with additive coalescence see bertoin 2 and giraud 9
for the most recent results and references
the aggregation process resembles formation of a star from dispersed
space dust and sticky particles models indeed have relations to astrophysics
it is appropriate to clarify these relations since they are not so direct and
cause a lot of misunderstanding
it is known that the distribution of galaxies in the universe is very inhomogeneous and the regions of high density form a peculiar cellular structure
the first attempt to understand the formation of such structures was made

clustering in a stochastic model of onedimensional gas

in 1970 by zeldovich most of the mass in the universe is believed to exist in the form of particles that practically do not collide with each other
and interact only gravitationally for example neutrinos in his model zeldovich considered an initially homogeneous collisionless medium of particles
moving by pure inertia the gravitational interaction was taken away by an
appropriate time change he showed that singularities that is the thin regions of very high density of particles so called pancakes appear even if
initial speeds of particles form a smooth velocity field
zeldovichs approximate model however does not explain formation of
the cellular structure of matter his approximation does not take into account that particles hitting a pancake are hampered by its strong gravitational field and start oscillating inside the pancake instead of flying away
although this gravitational adhesion of collisionless particles is not precisely
the same as the real sticking the model of sticky particles serves as a reasonable approximation the effect of gravitational adhesion was then analyzed
by the use of the burgers equation gurbatov saichev and shandarin proposed it in 1984 to extend zeldovichs approximation which is invalid after
formation of pancakes
the model of sticky particles is directly mentioned in gurbatov et al 11
a comprehensive survey of the formation of the universes largescale structure could be found in shandarin and zeldovich 23
12 statement of the problem and the results in general the problem
is to describe the process of mass aggregation how fast is it how large
the clusters are where do clusters appear most intensively and so forth
numerous papers on the model eg 8 14 16 20 25 are dedicated to
probabilistic description of various properties of the aggregation process as
the number of initial particles n tends to infinity thus the behavior of a
typical system consisting of a large number of particles is studied
in this paper we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of kn t which
denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system with n initial particles
this variable is a decreasing random step function satisfying kn 0  n
and kn t  1 for t  tnlast  where tnlast denotes the moment of the last
collision while calculating kn t we also count initial particles that have
not experienced any collisions in other words kn t is the total number of
particles existing at time t
it is very important to know the behavior of kn t this gives us a deep
understanding of the aggregation process since the average size of a cluster
at time t is knnt 
at first we give a short deterministic example suppose that particles are
located at points n1  n2      nn  that is si  i by simple calculations we find
that there would not be any collisions before t  1 at the moment t  1 all

particles simultaneously stick together hence kn t  n for 0  t  1 and
kn t  1 for t  1
however when the initial positions are random the aggregation process
behaves entirely differently in 25 the author proved the following statement
fact 1 there exists a deterministic function at such that both in the
poisson and the uniform models of initial positions for any t  0 we have
1

kn t p
 at
n

n  

the function at is continuous a0  1 and at  0 for t  1 we conjecture on the basis of numerical simulations that at  1  t2 for 0  t  1
the relation at  0 for t  1 is not of a surprise because we know from
p
giraud 8 that both in the poisson and the uniform models tnlast  1 the
limit constant is so fine due to the proper scaling of the model therefore
we say that the moment t  1 is critical note that this moment coincides
with the moment of the total collision in the deterministic model
the aim of this paper is to strengthen the result of 25 we first generalize fact 1 and prove it for the id model we will see relations 19
and 27 below that at is equal to the probability of a certain event that
is expressed in terms of xi  also we will prove that at depends on the

common distribution of xi as follows at  1 on 0  where
  supy  pxi  y  0

at  0 1 on   1 and at  0 on 1 
furthermore the recent results of the author 26 allow us to prove the
conjecture from fact 1 that apoiss t  aunif t  1  t2 for 0  t  1 there
is an amazing contrast between the simplicity of this formula and the hard
calculations one needs to obtain it it is remarkable that now we know the
limit function at for the main models of initial positions
our main goal is to improve 1 by finding the next term in the asymptotics of kn t the result is the following statement where the standard
d
symbol  denotes weak convergence and d denotes the skorohod space
theorem 1 in the id model with continuous xi satisfying exi  
for some   4 there exists a centered gaussian process k on 0 1 such
that

as n   the process k depends on the distribution of xi  this process satisfies k0  0 and has as continuous trajectories the covariance

function rs t of k is continuous on 0 12  rs t  0 on   12  and

rs t  0 on 0 12    12 
in the uniform model 2 holds for some centered gaussian process k unif 
on 0 1 this process satisfies k unif 0  0 and has as continuous trajectories the covariance function runif s t of k unif  is continuous on 0 12 
and runif s t  rpoiss s t  s2 t2 
thus the poisson and the uniform models lead to different limit processes
k poiss  and k unif  although apoiss   aunif 
as an immediate corollary of theorem 1 see billingsley 3 section 15

for any t  1 where  2 t  rt t it is possible to show that in the id
model 3 holds for all t 6 1 under the less restrictive condition exi2  
with  2 t  0 for t  1 continuity of xi is not required
we also study convergence of the lefthand side of 3 at the critical
moment t  1 apparently the limit is not gaussian but this complicated
problem is related to a curious but hardly provable conjecture on integrated
random walks in view of this nongaussianity it seems impossible to prove
any extended version of theorem 1 that describes the weak convergence of
trajectories on the whole interval 0 1 we refer to section 7 for further
discussion
we finish this subsection with a note on scaling in our model the masses
of particles are equal to n1 and the distances between them are of the order
1
n  let us rescale the id model by multiplying all masses and distances
by n the system of particles of mass one each initially located at points
s1  sn2  s2  sn2      sn  sn2  is called the expanding model the
particles are shifted by sn2 because we want the system to expand filling
the whole line as n   rather than only the positive halfline
all results of our paper hold true for the expanding model this is not
unexpected because the shift does not produce any changes and the rescaling
of masses is equivalent to the time contraction by n times while the rescaling
of distances is equivalent to the time expansion by n times we refer the
reader to section 2 below or to lifshits and shi 16 for rigorous arguments
13 organization of the paper in section 2 we describe a general method
which is used to study systems of sticky particles this method is applied for
studying the id model in section 3 where we investigate some properties of

v v vysotsky

the aggregation process we will show that the aggregation process is highly
local that is the behavior of a particle is essentially defined by the motion
of neighbor particles this localization property suggests that we could use
limit theorems for weakly dependent variables to prove both fact 1 and
theorem 1 for the id model this will be done in section 4 then we will
prove theorem 1 for the uniform model in section 5 in section 6 we study
the number of clusters at the critical moment t  1 some open questions
are discussed in section 7
2 method of barycenters in this section we briefly describe the method
of barycenters which is the main tool used to study systems of sticky particles it is also applicable to more general models where particles could
have nonzero initial speeds and different masses the method of barycenters
was independently introduced by e rykov and sinai 6 and martin and
piasecki 20
let us start with several definitions we always numerate particles from
left to right and identify particles with their numbers a block of particles is
a nonempty set j  1 n consisting of consecutive numbers for example
the block i i  k consists of particles i  1     i  k note that there are not
any relations between blocks and clusters for example a blocks particles
could be contained in different clusters and these clusters could even contain
particles that do not belong to the block
it is convenient to assume that initial particles do not vanish at collisions
but continue to exist in created clusters then the coordinate xin t of a
particle i could be defined as the coordinate of a cluster that contains the
particle at time t the second subscript n always indicates the number of
initial particles we will
omit this subscript as often as possible
p
by xj t  j1 ij xi t denote the position of the barycenter of a
block j at time t further define
r

xj t  xj 0  21 mj
r

l

l

 mj t2 

where mj  n1 n  maxjj  and mj  n1 minjj 1 are the total masses of particles located to the right and to the left of the block j 
respectively
a block is free from the right up to time t if up to this time the blocks
particles did not collide with particles initially located to the right of the
block we similarly define blocks that are free from the left and say that a
block is free up to time t if it is both free from the right and from the left
the next statement plays the key role in the analysis of sticky particles
systems the barycenter of a free block moves as an imaginary particle consisting of all particles of the block put together at the initial barycenter in a
more precise and general way we state the following

clustering in a stochastic model of onedimensional gas

7

proposition 1 if a block j is free from the right resp left up to time
t then xj s  xj s for s  0 t resp xj s  xj s if a block j is free
up to time t then xj s  xj s for s  0 t
this statement could be found for example in lifshits and shi 16
proposition 41 the easy proof is based on the property of conservation of
momentum
the moment when a particle j sticks with its righthand side neighbor
j  1 is called the merging time tjn of the particle j in other words tjn
is the first moment when particles j and j  1 are contained in a common
cluster here j  1 n  1 proposition 43 from lifshits and shi 16 which
is stated below gives us a way to calculate tjn 
proposition 2
4

for every j  1 n  1 we have

tjn  min s  0  xjk s  xlj s
jkn
0lj

thus tjn is expressed by means of barycenters note that since
kl 2
s 
2n
each of the equations xjk s  xlj s has a unique nonnegative solution
we also mention that at the moment tjn appears a cluster that consists of
the particles l  1     k where k and l are minimizers of the righthand side
of 4
we will prove proposition 2 since the proof is simple and perfectly illustrates the sense of the method of barycenters
5

xjks  xlj s  xjk0  xlj 0 

proof of proposition 2 for any u  tjn  the particles j and j  1
are contained in different clusters therefore for every l  j the block l j
is free from the right up to time u and for every k  j the block j  1 k
is free from the left by proposition 1
xlj u  xlj u  xj u  xj1 u
 xjk u  xjk u

and since by 5 the function xjk s  xlj s is decreasing for s  0 we
conclude that
u s  0  xjks  xlj s
taking minimum over k l and taking supremum over u we get tjn 
min

v v vysotsky

let us prove the last inequality in the other direction by the definition of
tjn  there exist an l  j and a k  j such that the blocks l j and j k are
free up to time tjn clusters containing particles from these blocks collide
exactly at time tjn  in view of proposition 1
xlj tjn   xlj tjn   xjktjn   xjk tjn 
hence tjn  s  0  xjk s  xlj s and tjn  min

because the total number of clusters decreases by one at each moment tin 
this representation plays the key role in the investigation of kn t clearly
we need to study properties of the rvs tin to prove limit theorems for
kn t such study will be done in this section
31 the initial study let us simplify the representation for tjn from
proposition 2 in this section we consider the id model of initial positions

32 localization property of the aggregation process we see that tjn
is a function of x2      xn  in other words it is necessary to know the
distances between all n particles to find tjn  the aggregation process is
actually highly local that is the value of tjn is essentially defined by the
initial distances between neighbor particles i of j for which j  i is small
enough
to make this statement rigorous we need to introduce the following notation let us put

several important properties of the rvs ti 
1 the sequence ti is stationary
proof this statement immediately follows from the definition of ti and
stationarity of xi  which are iid
2 the common distribution function of ti is defined by
x
1 k1
k  ixi  t2 
k1 k
i1



pti  t  p inf

 inf
l  ixi  t2   x0  t2   0 
l1 l

proof this formula follows from 9


3 we have p   ti  1  1 while supy  pti  y  0   and
infy  pti  y  1  1 recall that   supy  pxi  y  0 in addition if 0  dxi   then pti  1  0

proof first p   ti   1 is trivial because both infima in 19 are
nonpositive
second fix a t  1 and consider pti  t taking into account that infima
in 19 are nonpositive we obtain
x
1 k1
pti  t  p inf
k  ixi  t2   x0  t2   0

then by the same arguments as in 18

by the strong law of large numbers this probability is zero for all t  1

it follows from the asymptotics of unilateral small deviation probabilities of
an integrated wiener process see 43 and 44 below that the last expression equals zero

third supy  pti  y  0   and infy  pti  y  1  1 follow
if we prove that for any t  exi  1 the common distribution of the iid
infima in 19 has an atom at zero but we have

and it could be shown via the strong law of large numbers that the last
probability is strictly positive for all t  1
k
4 suppose xi is continuous then tj and tjn are continuous for any
j k n and the common distribution of tj could have an atom only at 1 in
addition if exi2   then tj are continuous

for every s  1  exi  the last expression tends to zero by the strong law
of large numbers then ptj  t is continuous on 0 s as a uniform limit
k
of continuous functions ptj  t since s  1 is arbitrary ptj  t is
continuous on 0 1
5 the cov1st0   1ttk   tends to zero as k   for all s t  0 1 if
in addition exi   for some   1 then for any s t  0 1 and k  n
we have
21

cov1st0   1ttk    2 s  tk1 

proof the idea is to approximate 1st0  and 1ttk  by 1st k2  and

k
z  m  x note that 1st k2  and 1tt k2  are independent because the

proof let us first recall the definition and some basic properties of associated variables rvs 1      m are associated if for any coordinatewise
nondecreasing functions f g  rm  r it is true that
covf 1      m  g1      m   0
assuming that the lefthand side is well defined an infinite set of rvs is
associated if any finite subset of its variables is associated
the following sufficient conditions of association are well known see 7
a independent variables are associated
b coordinatewise nondecreasing functions of finite number of arguments of associated rvs are associated
c if the variables 1k      mk are associated for every k and 1k     
d

mk   1      m  as k   then 1      m are associated
d if two sets of associated variables are independent then the union of
these sets is also associated
n1
then tin i1
are associated for every n by a b and 20 analok
k
gously ti iz are associated for every k finally since ti  ti as as
k   for every i c ensures the association of ti iz

8 if exi   for some   2 then the stationary sequence minti  t
is strongly mixing for any t  1 and its coefficients of strong mixing k
satisfy k  ok2

instead of i1 1ttin   we thus deal with a single sequence ti and avoid

it remains to check that 1 holds for t  1 if exi2   to conclude
the proof if dxi  0 then the situation is deterministic this case was
described in introduction here we always have kn 1  1 and 1 is true

in d0 1   for all   0 1

we will use the following result from lin and lu 17 section 12 on
convergence of empirical processes they attribute this statement to qm
shao who published it in 1986 in chinese
fact 4 let i be a sequence of stationary strongly mixing rvs distributed on 0 1 and let f be the common distribution function of i 
suppose f x  x on 0 1 ie i are uniformly distributed and the coefficients of strong mixing of the sequence f i  decrease as ok2 
as k   for some   0 then the empirical processes of i weakly converge
in d0 1 to a centered gaussian process with the covariance function

cov

remark the limit gaussian process is as continuous on 0 1 fact 4
also holds true if f is an arbitrary continuous distribution function

the as continuity of the limit process could be concluded by a comparison of the proof from lin and lu 17 with the proof of theorem 221 from
billingsley 3 the statements and the proofs of these theorems are identical

clustering in a stochastic model of onedimensional gas

23

but lin and lu do not state the continuity while billingsley does further
since f i  is uniformly distributed on 0 1 if f is continuous fact 4 holds
true for every continuous f  see the proof of theorem 221 by billingsley 3
for explanations
recall that we need to prove the convergence of the empirical process of
ti  it seems that the rvs ti are not strongly mixing but minti  1   are
strongly mixing because of property 8 section 34 these variables are not
continuous and so we need to fix them let us fix an   0 1 and let i
be iid rvs independent of all ti and say uniformly distributed on 0 
we define ti  minti  1    1ti 1 i 
the stationary variables ti are distributed on 0 1 their common distribution function g is continuous and the coefficients of strong mixing
of gti  decrease as ok2  the proof of the last statement is the same
as the proof of property 8 from section 34 indeed approximate the varik2

    where
m

ti  minti  1    1t m 1 i  use the analogous approximation
i
for the variables from the future and then repeat word for word the arguments of the previous proof
now recalling that   4 we see that ti satisfy the assumptions of fact 4
with the only difference that their distribution is not uniform by n 
denote the empirical process of ti  clearly n  coincides with the empirical
process un  of ti on 0 1   by the remark to fact 4 we conclude that
first

where k is a centered gaussian process with the covariance function

cov1t0 s  1ti t 

and second trajectories of k are as continuous on 0 1
there exists a simpler and more elegant proof of 33 note that ti iz
are associated as coordinatewise nondecreasing functions of associated rvs
ti  i iz  see a b and d from property 6 section 34 then we can
obtain 33 applying the result of louhichi 18 on convergence of empirical
processes of stationary associated rvs i instead of using fact 4 this theorem requires only covf 0  f k   ok4  which could be proved
analogously to property 5 section 34 thus we avoid the complicated estimations of the strong mixing coefficients and the proof of 33 is becomes
much simpler the only problem is that this proof requires   5
we also note that the as continuity of k could be proved directly
without referring to the proof of fact 4 the arguments should be the same
as in the proof of the continuity of k unif  in section 5

24

v v vysotsky

define

rs t

cov1t0 s  1ti t 

which is evidently equal to rs t on 0 1  2  since rs t is positive
definite and   0 is arbitrary the function rs t is positive definite on
0 12  therefore by lifshits 15 section 4 there exists a centered gaussian
process k on 0 1 with the covariance function rs t the trajectories
d
of k are as continuous on 0 1 by k  k on 0 1   arbitrariness
of   0 and the as continuity of k on 0 1
d
finally by 33 n   un  on 0 1   k 
k on 0 1   and
the as continuity of k we get 32 since 32 implies 30 we conclude
the proof of 2
only the stated properties of rs t remain to be proven the continuity
of the joint distribution function of continuous variables t0 and ti implies
that cov1t0 s  1ti t  is continuous on 0 12 for every i  0 then in
view of 21 rs t is continuous on 0 12 as a sum of uniformly converging
series of continuous functions

the strict positivity of rs t on   12 trivially follows from 34 23
and cov1t0 s  1t0 t   as  t1  as  t  0 the last inequality holds

by property 3 section 34 the rs t  0 on 0 12    12 follows from

pti    0 which holds by properties 3 and 4 from section 34 
we note that 3 holds for t 6 1 under the less restrictive condition exi2 
 for t  1 the proof is almost the same by 29 which is true for   32
we conclude that 3 holds if the stationary associated sequence 1tti 
satisfies the central limit theorem then we refer to the central limit theorem
for stationary associated sequences from newman 21 his theorem requires
only rt t   that is the convergence of the righthand side of 34 this
condition holds by 13 and fact 2 for t  1 relation 3 holds true with
 2 t  0 because of proposition 3
finally note that the process k is associated that is the rvs
ktt01 are associated in fact by 6 property 6 from section 34

are
and condition b from the same property 6 the processes kn na
n
associated for every n then k is associated by 2 and c property 6

5 proof of theorem 1 for the uniform model there exists a simple
method that allows to extend results from the poisson model to the uniform
model and vise versa the method is based on the next statement see
karlin 13 section 91

where  is a standard gaussian rv
we claim that 38 the independence of yn  and zn  and 39 yield
the weak convergence of yn  in d0 1   let us check the tightness of

the tightness of yn  in d0 1   follows from yn   yn   zn  
zn  38 and 39 indeed by the prokhorov theorem 38 and 39 yield
that both sequences yn   zn  and zn  are tight but trajectories

tightness follows from the continuity of addition   d  c  d and the fact
that under any continuous mapping the image of a compact set is also a
compact set
now we study convergence of finite dimensional distributions of yn

then 38 the independence of yn  and zn  and 39 yield that for the
characteristic functions of all finitedimensional distributions of yn  we
have
40

j k
j k jk1 uu

eeiyn tu  e12r



where u  rm  t  t1      tm   0 1m  and yn t  yn t1      yn tm 
we stress that 40 is true for every t  0 1  m since the limit processes
in 38 and 39 have continuous trajectories
we see that the matrix rpoiss tj  tk   t2j t2k m
jk1 is positive definite for
m
any t  t1      tm   0 1   and m  1 since the absolute value of the
lefthand side of 40 does not exceed one putting
runif s t  rpoiss s t  s2 t2 
unif t  t m
we have rpoiss tj  tk   t2j t2k m
j k jk1  then the function

r
s t is positive definite on 0 1 since   0 is arbitrary thus by
lifshits 15 section 4 runif s t is the covariance function of some centered
gaussian process k unif  on 0 1
relation 2 is thus proved now check that k unif   c0 1   as to
conclude the proof of theorem 1 for the uniform model
for this purpose let us prove that as trajectories of yn  have jumps
of size 1n only in fact the jumps of yn  coincide with the jumps of
1 k unif

whose jumps are of size

also have n   k unif  but 1  lim inf pn   c  pk unif   c
since c  d is closed in the skorohod topology therefore as k unif  is
continuous on 0 1  
since   0 1 is arbitrary as k unif  is continuous on the whole interval 0 1 the runif s t  rpoiss s t  s2 t2 is continuous on 0 12 because

attention to the number of clusters at the critical moment t  1 we are

which is the lefthand side of 3 at t  1 here we have a1  0 under
exi2   see property 3 section 34
we do not know if this sequence is weakly convergent but we hope that
it is we also have a naive guess that its limit is gaussian because the limit
in theorem 1 is gaussian in view of kn 1  1 this conjectured weak limit
is nonnegative hence it is gaussian if and only if it is identically equal to
zero however the results of this section show that the limit is nonzero thus
our guess on gaussianity fails
the study of convergence of kn 1
is quite complicated therefore in this

section we consider only the poisson model first let us prove the following
statement
in the poisson model we have limn pkn 1

and sp
i is a standard exponential random walk we say that the sequence of

i1 si  esi  is an integrated random walk in the proof of property
3 section 34 we showed that pk  0 as k   therefore it is reasonable
to say that pk are the unilateral small deviation probabilities of an integrated
centered random walk
we need to obtain the asymptotics of pk  0 to continue the study of
convergence of kn 1
 unfortunately the results of the rest of this section
n
are completely dependent on the correctness of the following conjecture
conjecture 1

we have pk  c1 k14 as k   for some c1  0 

simulations show that the conjecture is true and c1  036 the weaker
form pk  k14 of conjecture 1 was proved by sinai 22 but only for integrated symmetric bernoulli random walks it also interesting to note that
by mckean 19 the unilateral small deviation probabilities of an integrated
wiener process have the same order as t

to be precise mckean was interested in a more general problem and
some calculations are required to obtain 43 from his results therefore
we additionally refer to isozaki and watanabe 12 who state 43 explicitly
by the results mentioned above we also suppose that conjecture 1 is
true for other integrated centered random walks that satisfy some moment
conditions
now we are able to prove the following result on convergence of kn 1

7 open questions 1 the number of clusters at the critical moment
t  1
here the main question is if conjecture 1 holds true even by itself this
problem is worth studying
but even if conjecture 1 is true we still do not have a proof of weak
 it is only known that this sequence is tight the author
convergence of kn 1

32

v v vysotsky

strongly believes relying on numerical simulations that the limit exists it
would be interesting to find this conjectured limit which should be nontrivial
by proposition 5 in an explicit form

2 the weak convergence of kn na
on the whole interval 0 1
n
it is very natural to ask if it is possible to strengthen theorem 1 by

in d0 1 this complicated
proving the weak convergence of kn na
n
problem returns us again to question 1 because the weak convergence of
kn na


in d0 1 implies the weak convergence of kn 1na1
 kn 1
 see
n
n
n
converges its weak limit k1
billingsley 3 section 15 but even if kn 1
n
is not gaussian hence the limit process k which is gaussian on 0 1
is no more gaussian on 0 1 therefore it is doubtful that theorem 1 is
true in d0 1 at least one should provide a proof completely different from
the presented one also it is unclear how to define the finitedimensional
distributions of the nongaussian k on 0 1 because simulations show
that k1 would not be independent with kt for t  1
3 the number of clusters in the warm gas
in the presented case initial speeds of particles are zero this model is often called the cold gas according to its zero initial temperature we introduce
a new model stating that initial speeds of particles are an v1  an v2      an vn 
where vi are some iid rvs and an is a sequence of normalization constants this model called the warm gas was studied in many papers for
example 14 16 20 25
it is of a great interest to study the behavior of kn t in the warm gas
in 25 the author proved that in the basic case where an  1 for all n and
p
evi2   we have knnt  0 for all t  0 the question is to find a normalization of kn t leading to some nontrivial limit clearly this normalization
depends on an  but it is very possible that there is an effect of phase transition similar to the one discovered by lifshits and shi 16 if an are small
enough then the gas has a low temperature and the normalization is the
same as in the cold gas if an are big enough as in the basic case an  1
then the normalization and the behavior of the gas differ entirely from the
case of the cold gas
the author believes that the localization property which is described in
section 3 could be helpful in a study of these questions
it is also interesting to compare the behavior of kn 1 in the warm and in
the cold gases in the warm gas the moment t  1 plays the same critical
role as in the cold gas see lifshits and shi 16 the variable kn 1 was
studied by suidan 24 who considered the warm gas with an  1 and deterministic initial positions of particles his initial positions were n1  n2      nn 
for this case suidan found the distribution of kn 1 and showed
that

4 the number of clusters in ballistic systems of sticky particles
a sticky particles model is called ballistic if it evolves according to the
laws introduced in section 1 but in the absence of gravitation such models
are in some sense more natural than gravitational ones because the basic assumption that gravitation does not depend on distance is sometimes
confusing however an unpublished paper of lifshits and kuoza shows that
certain gravitational and ballistic models are tightly connected
it seems interesting to study the number of clusters in the ballistic model
the author does not know any results in this field
