abstract
we formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
riemannian isometries for a compact riemannian manifold by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact
quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described
by spectral triples and then proving the existence of a universal object
called the quantum isometry group in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given possibly
noncommutative manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions
in fact we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category namely the category of quantum families of
smooth isometries defined along the line of woronowicz and soltan
we also construct a spectral triple on the hilbert space of forms on a
noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group we give
explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and
noncommutative tori and in this context obtain the quantum double
torus defined in 11 as the universal quantum group of holomorphic
isometries of the noncommutative torus

introduction

such quantum groups particularly the quantum permutation groups of finite
sets and finite graphs have been extensively studied by a number of mathematicians see eg 1 2 17 and references therein who have also found
applications to and interaction with areas like free probability and subfactor
theory the underlying basic principle of defining a quantum automorphism
group corresponding to some given mathematical structure for example a

finite set a graph a c  or von neumann algebra consists of two steps 
first to identify if possible the group of automorphisms of the structure as
a universal object in a suitable category and then try to look for the universal object in a similar but bigger category by replacing groups by quantum
groups of appropriate type however most of the work done so far concern
some kind of quantum automorphism groups of a finite structure for example of finite sets or finite dimensional matrix algebras it is thus quite
natural to try to extend these ideas to the infinite or continuous mathematical structures for example classical and noncommutative manifolds in
the present article we have made an attempt to formulate and study the
quantum analogues of the groups of riemannian isometries which play a
very important role in the classical differential geometry the group of riemannian isometries of a compact riemannian manifold m can be viewed as
the universal object in the category of all compact metrizable groups acting
on m  with smooth and isometric action therefore to define the quantum
isometry group it is reasonable to consider a category of compact quantum
groups which act on the manifold or more generally on a noncommutative
manifold given by spectral triple in a nice way preserving the riemannian
structure in some suitable sense to be precisely formulated in this article
we have given a definition of such smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a possibly noncommutative manifold extending
the notion of smooth and isometric action by a group on a classical manifold indeed the meaning of isometric action is nothing but that the action
should commute with the laplacian coming from the spectral triple and
we should mention that this idea was already present in 2 though only in
the context of a finite metric space or a finite graph the universal object
in the category of such quantum groups if it exists should be thought of
as the quantum analogue of the group of isometries and we have been able
to prove its existence under some regularity assumptions all of which can
be verified for a general compact connected riemannian manifold as well
as the standard examples of noncommutative manifolds motivated by the
ideas of woronowicz and soltan we actually consider a bigger category the
isometry group of a classical manifold viewed as a compact metrizable space
forgetiing the group structure can be seen to be the universal object of a
category whose objectclass consists of subsets not necessarily subgroups
of the set of smooth isometries of the manifold then it can be proved
that this universal compact set has a canonical group structure a natural
quantum analogue of this has been formulated by us called the category of
quantum families of smooth isometries the underlying c  algebra of the
quantum isometry group has been identified with its universal object and
2

moreover it is shown to be equipped with a canonical coproduct making it
into a compact quantum group
we believe that a detailed study of quantum isometry groups will not
only give many new and interesting examples of compact quantum groups
it will also contribute to the understanding of quantum group covariant
spectral triples in fact we have made some progress in this direction already
by constructing a spectral triple which is often closely related to the original
spectral triple on the hilbert space of forms which is equivriant with respect
to a canonical unitary representation of the quantum isometry group
in a companion article 3 with j bhowmick we provide explicit computations of quantum isometry groups of a few classical and noncommutative
manifolds however we briefly quote some of main results of 3 in the
present article one interesting observation is that the quantum isometry
group of the noncommutative twotorus a with the canonical spectral
triple is as a c  algebra a direct sum of two commutative and two noncommutative tori and contains as a quantum subgroup which is universal for certain class of isometric actions called holomorphic isometries the
quantum doubletorus discovered and studied by hajac and masuda 11

definition of the quantum isometry group
isometry groups of classical manifolds

we begin with a wellknown characterization of the isometry group of a classical compact riemannian manifold let m g be a compact riemannian
manifold and let 1  1 m  be the space of smooth oneforms which has
a right hilbertc  m module structure given by the c  m valued inner
product     defined by
    m  m m  m 
 m at
where     m is the riemannian metric on the cotangent space tm
1
the point m  m  the riemannian volume form allows us to make  a prehilbert space and we denote its completion by h1  let h0  l2 m dvol
and consider the derham differential d as an unbounded linear map from
h0 to h1  with the natural domain c  m   h0  and also denote its closure
by d let l  d d the following identity can be verified by direct and
easy computation using the local coordinates 

l   lll  2  d d  for    c  m

proposition 21 a smooth map   m  m is a riemannian isometry if
and only if  commutes with l in the sense that lf    lf    for
all f  c  m 
proof 
if  commutes with l then from the identity  we get for m  m and
   c  m  
 dm  dm  m
  d d  m

l   m

l     m

  d   d    m
  d  m  d  m  m
  dm  dm  dm  dm   m 

 m is an isometry thus  is a
which proves that dm   tm
m  tm
riemannian isometry
conversely if  is an isometry both the maps induced by  on h0 and
h1  ie u0  h0  h0 given by u0 f   f   and u1  h1  h1 given
by u1 f d  f  d   are unitaries moreover d  u0  u1  d on
c  m   h0  from this it follows that l  d d commutes with u0  
now let us consider a compact metrizable ie second countable space
y with a continuous map   m  y  m  we abbreviate m y as ym
and denote by y the map m  m 7 ym let   cm   cm   cy  

cm  y  be the map given by f m y  f ym for y  y  m  m
and f  cm  for a state  on cy  denote by  the map id     
cm   cm  we shall also denote by c the subspace of cm   cy 
generated by elements of the form f 1   f  cm    cy  since
cm  and cy  are commutative algebras it is easy to see that c is a
subalgebra of cm   cy  then we have the following

theorem 22 i c is normdense in cm   cy  if and only if for every
y  y  y is onetoone
ii the map y is c  for every y  y if and only if  c  m   c  m 
for all 
iii under the hypothesis of ii each y is also an isometry if and only if
4

 commutes with l  1 for all state  and all  in the resolvent of l
equivalently  commutes with the laplacian l on c  m 
proof 
i first assume that y is onetoone for all y by stoneweirstrass theorem it is enough to show that c separates points take m1  y1  6 m2  y2 
in m  y  if y1 6 y2  we can choose   cy  which separates y1 and y2 
hence 1    c separates m1  y1  and m2  y2  so we can consider the
case when y1  y2  y say but m1 6 m2  by injectivity of y  we have
ym1 6 ym2  so there exists f  cm  such that f ym1  6 f ym2  ie
f m1  y 6 f m2  y this proves the density of c
for the converse we argue as in the proof of proposition 33 of 14
assume that c is dense in cm   cy  and let y  y  m1  m2  m such
that ym1  ym2  that is f 1  m1  y  f 1  m2  y for all
f  cm    cy  by the density of c we get m1  y  m2  y for
all   cm  y  so m1  y  m2  y ie m1  m2 
ii the if part of ii follows by considering the states corresponding to
point evaluation ie cy    7 y y  y  for the converse we note
that an arbitrary
borel measure  on y
r state  corresponds to a regular
r
so that h  hd and thus  f m  f ymdy for f  cm 
from this by interchanging differentiation and integation which is allowed
by the dominated convergence theorem since  is a finite measure we can
prove that  f  is c  whenever f is so
the assertion iii follows from proposition 21 in a straghtforward way

let us recall a few wellknown facts about the laplacian l viewed as a
negative selfadjoint operator on the hilbert space l2 m dvol it is known
see 12 and references therein that l has compact resolvents and all its
eigenvectors belong to c  m  moreover it follows from the sobolev embedding theorem that

domln   c  m 
n1

let eij  j  1  di  i  1 2  be the set of normalised eigenvectors of
l where eij  c  m  is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue i 
1   2    we have the following
lemma 23 the complex linear span of eij  is normdense in cm 
proof 
this is a consequence of the asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues i  as
5

well as the uniform bound of the eigenfunctions eij  for example it is
known 9theorem 12 that there exist constants c c  such that keij k 
n1
n1
ci  4  di  c  t
i  2  where n is the dimension of the manifold m  now
for f  c  m   k1 domlk  we write f as an apriori l2 convergent
p
p
series ij fij eij fij  c and observe that
fij 2 i 2k   for every
p
k  1 choose and fix sufficiently large k such that i0 i n12k  
which is possible due to the wellknown weyl asymptotics of eigenvalues of
l now by the cauchyschwarz inequality and the estimate for di  we have

thus the series ij fij eij converges to f in supnorm so speij  j  1 2  di  i 
1 2  is dense in supnorm in c  m  hence in cm  as well 
let us denote speij  j  1  di  i  1 by a
0 from now on we shall
now show that c  m  can be replaced by the smaller subspace a
0 in
theorem 22 we need a lemma for this which will be useful later on too
lemma 24 let h1  h2 be hilbert spaces and for i  1 2 let li be possibly
unbounded selfadjoint operator on hi with compact resolvents and let vi
be the linear span of eigenvectors of li  moreover assume that there is an
eigenvalue of li for which the eigenspace is onedimensional say spanned by
a unit vector i  let  be a linear map from v1 to v2 such that l2   l1
and 1   2  then we have
h2  xi  h1  xi x  v1 

1

proof
by hypothesis on  it is clear that there is a common eigenvalue say 0  of
l1 and l2  with the eigenvectors 1 and 2 respectively
let us write the set
s
of eigenvalues of li as a disjoint union 0  i i  1 2 and let
l the corresponding orthogonal decomposition of vi be given by vi  ci i vi 
ci  vi  say where vi denotes the eigenspace of li corresponding to the
eigenvalue  by assumption  maps v1 to v2 whenever  is an eigenvalue
of l2  ie v2 6 0 and otherwise it maps v1 into 0 thus v1   v2 
now 1 is obviously satisfied for x  1  so it is enough to prove 1
t for all
x  v1  but we have h xi  0 for x  v1  and since x  v2  v2 2  
it follows that h2  xi  0  h1  xi

lemma 25 let y and  be as in theorem 22 then the following are
equivalent
a for every y  y  y is smooth isometric

b for every state  on cy  we have  a
0   a0  and  l  l on

a0 
proof
we prove only the nontrivial implication b  a assume b that 
leaves a
0 invariant and commutes with l on it for every state  to
prove that  is a smooth isometric action it is enough see the proof of
theorem 22 to prove that y a   a for all y  y  where y f  
idevy f   f y  evy being the evaluation at the point y let m1   mk
be the connected components of the compact manifold m  thus the hilbert
space l2 m dvol admits an orthogonal decomposition ki1 l2 mi  dvol
and the laplacian l is of the form i li where li denotes the laplacian on
mi  since each mi is connected we have kerli   ci  where i is the
constant function on mi equal to 1 now we note that for fixed y and i
the image of mi under the continuous function y must be mapped into a
component say mj  thus by applying lemma 24 with h1  l2 mi h2 
l2 mj    y and the l2 continuity of the map f 7 y f   f  y  we
have
z
z
f xdvolx
y f xdvolx 
mi

mj

for all f in the linear span of
r eigenvectors ofrli  hence by density for all f
in l2 mi  it follows that m y f dvol  m f dvol for all f  l2 m  in
particular for all f  cm  since y is a homomorphism on cm  we
have
z
z
y f gdvol 
hy f  y gi 
f gdvol  hf gi
m

m

for all f g  cm  thus y extends to an isometry on l2 m  to be
denoted by the same notation which by our assumption commutes with the
n
selfadjoint operator l on the core a
0  and hence y commutes with l for
n
all n in particular it leaves invariant the domains of each l  which implies
y a   a  
in view of the fact that the set of isometries of m  denoted by isom 
is a compact second countable ie compact metrizable group we see that
isom  is the maximal compact second countable group acting on m such
that the action is smooth and isometric in other words if we consider a
catogory whose objects are compact metrizable groups acting smoothly and
7

isometrically on m  and morphisms are the group homomorphisms commuting with the actions on m  then isom  with its canonical action on
m  is the initial object of this cateogory however one can take a more
general viewpoint and consider the category of compact metrizable spaces
y equipped with a continuous map   m  y  m satisfying iiii of
theorem 22 or equivalently the pair of commutative unital c  algebras
b  cy  and a unital c  homomorphism   cm   cm   b satisfying the conditions iiii the set of isometries isom  as a topological
space can be identified with the universal object of this category and then
one can prove that it has a group structure
it is quite natural to formulate a quantum analogue of the above by considering in the spirit of woronowicz and soltan see 19 and 13 quantum
families of isometries which can be defined to be a pair b  where b is
a not necessarily commutative c  algebra and   cm   cm   b is
unital c  homomorhism satisfying iiii of theorem 22 ie the linear
span of cm 1  b which is not necessarily a subalgebra any more
b being possibly noncommutative is normdense in cm   b and for every state  on b the map  keeps c  m  invariant and commutes with
the laplacian l the morphisms of this category are obvious we shall
prove that this category has a universal object and this universal object
can be equipped with a canonical quantum group structure this will define
the quantum isometry group of a manifold however we shall go beyond
classical manifolds and define quantum isometry group qisoa  h d
for a spectral triple a  h d with a being unital and satisfying certain assumptions to this end we need to carefully formulate the notion
of laplacian in noncommutative geometry which is the goal of the next
subsection

laplacian in noncommutative geometry

given a spectral triple a  h d we recall from 10 and 6 the construction of the space of oneforms we have a derivation from a to the
a a bimodule bh given by a 7 d a this induces a bimodule
morphism  from 1 a  the bimodule of universal oneforms on a  to
bh such that a  d a where   a  1 a  denotes the
universal derivation map we set 1d  1d a   1 a ker 

1

 a   bh assume that the spectral triple is of compact type
and has a finite dimension in the sense of connes 6 ie there is some
p  0 such that the operator dp interpreted as the inverse of the restriction of dp on the closure of its range which has a finite codimension
8

since d has compact resolvents has finite nonzero dixmier trace denoted
by t r where  is some suitable banach limit see eg 6 10 consider the canonical volume form  coming from the dixmier trace ie
1
p  let us at this
  bh  c defined by  a  t r d
p  t r ad
point assume that the spectral triple is qc   ie a and d a a  a 
are contained in the domains of all powers of the derivation d  under
this assumption  is a positive faithful trace on the c  subalgebra generated by a and d a a  a  and the gns hilbert space l2 a    is
0  similarly we equip 1 with a semiinner product given by
denoted by hd

           and denote the hilbert space obtained from it by hd

the map dd  hd  hd given by dd   d  is an unbounded densely
defined linear map let us assume the following
assumptioni a dd is closable the closure is denoted again by dd 
b a  doml where l  dd dd and a is viewed as a dense sub0 
space of hd
at this point let us show that this assumption is valid under a very
natural condition on the spectral triple
lemma 26 suppose that for every element a  a  the map r  t 7
t x  expitdxexpitd is differentiable at t  0 in the normtopology of bh where x  a or d a then the assumption i is satisfied moreover in this case l maps a into the weak closure of a in
0 
bhd
proof 
we first observe that  t a   a for all t and for all a  bh since
expitd commutes with dp  if moreover a belongs to the domain of
 id a in operatornormdifferentiability at t  0 of t  ie t aa
t
norm then it follows from the property of the dixmier trace that  d a 
 t a a

t
differentiability at t  0 of t a for a belonging to the subalgebra say
b generated by a and d a  it follows that  d a  0 a  b let
us now fix a b c  a and observe that
 a dd b dd c

using the fact that  d d b a c  0 this implies

  a dd b dd c    kd d b a k c c 2  kd d b a kkck2

0  this proves that
where kck2   c c 2 denotes the l2 norm of c  hd

a dd b belongs to the domain of dd for all a b  a  so in particular
dd is dense ie dd is closable moreover taking a  1 we see that
dd a   domdd  or in other words a  domdd dd  this proves
ia and ib the last sentence in the statement of the lemma can be
proven along the line of theorem 29 page 129 10 
we need few more assumptions on the operator l to define the quantum
isometry group

spanned by the identity 1 of a  viewed as a unit vector in hd
we call l the noncommutative laplacian and tt the noncommutative heat
semigroup we summarize some simple observations in form of the following
lemma 27 a if the assumptions iv are valid then for x  a  we
have lx   lx 
0 into a for all t  0 the the assumption

iv is satisfied

it follows by simple calculation using the facts that  is a trace and dd x

for all y  a  by density of a in hd

that if x  hd is an eigenvector of l say lx  x   c then we have
tt x  et x hence x  et tt x  a  

10

since by assumption l has a countable set of eigenvalues each with finite
multiplicity let us denote them by 0  0 1  2   with v0  c 1 v1  v2  
be corresponding eigenspaces finite dimensional and for each i let eij  j 
1  di  be an orthonormal basis of vi  by assumption iv vi  a for
each i vi is closed under  and moreover eij  j  1  di  is also an orthonormal basis for vi  since  x y   yx  for x y  a  we also make
the following
assumption vi the complex linear span of eij  i  0 1  j  1  di 

say a
0  is normdense in a 
definition 28 we say that a spectral triple satisfying the assumptions ivi admissible
remark 29 we have just seen that classical spectral triple a  c  m  h d
where m is compact connected spin manifold h is the l2 space of square
integrable spinors and d is the dirac operator is indeed admissible in our
sense later on we shall discuss how we can weaken the connectedness
assumption as well thus accommodating a general classical commutative
spectral triple in our setup moreover the standard examples of noncommutative spectral triples eg those on a  quantum heisenberg manifold
etc do belong to the admissible class
lemma 210 let us assume that the spectral triple a  h d is admis
sible let   a

definition and existence of the quantum isometry group

we begin by recalling the definition of compact quantum groups and their
actions from 18 a compact quantum group is given by a pair s  where
s is a unital separable c  algebra equipped with a unital c  homomorphism
  s  s  s where  denotes the injective tensor product satisfying
11

ai   id    id     coassociativity and
aii the linear span of ss  1 and s1  s are normdense in
s  s
it is wellknown see 18 that there is a canonical dense subalgebra s0
of s consisting of the matrix coefficients of the finite dimensional unitary
corepresentations of s and maps   s0  c counit and   s0  s0
antipode defined on s0 which make s0 a hopf algebra
we say that the compact quantum group s  acts on a unital c 
algebra b if there is a unital c  homomorphism   b  b  s satisfying
the following 
bi   id    id     and
bii the linear span of b1  s is normdense in b  s

let us now recall the concept of universal quantum groups as in 17
15 and references therein we shall use most of the terminologies of 15
eg woronowicz c  subalgebra woronowicz c  ideal etc however with
the exception that we shall call the woronowicz c  algebras just compact
quantum groups and not use the term compact quantum groups for the
dual objects as done in 15 for q  gln c let au q denote the universal compact quantum group generated by uij  i j  1  n satisfying the
relations
uu  in  u u u quq1  in  quq1 u 
  is
where u  uij  u  uji  and u  uij  the coproduct say 
given by
x
  ij  
u
uik  ukj 
k

we refer the reader to 17 for a detailed discussion on the structure and classification of such quantum groups let us denote by ui the quantum group
adi i where di is dimension of the subspace vi  we fix a representation
p
i
i  vi  vi ui of ui on the hilbert space vi  given by i eij   k eik ukj 
i

for j  1  di  where ui  ukj are the generators of ui as discussed before
thus both ui and u i are unitaries it follows from 15 that the representations i canonically induce a representation   i i of the free product
u  i ui which is a compact quantum group see 15 for the details on
0  such that the restriction of  on v coincides with 
the hilbert space hd

for all i

12

in view of the characterization of smooth isometric action on a classical
manifold we make the following definitions
definition 211 a quantum family of smooth isometries of a noncommutative manifold a or more precisely on the corresponding spectral triple
is a pair s  where s is a separable unital c  algebra   a  a  s
where a denotes the c  algebra obtained by completing a in the norm of
0  is a unital c  homomorphism satisfying the following
bhd

a sp a1  s  a  s

b   id     maps a
0 into itself and commutes with l on a0 
for every state  on s
in case the c  algebra s has a coproduct  such that s  is a compact
quantum group and  is an action of s  on a we say that s  acts
smoothly and isometrically on the noncommutative manifold
fix a spectral triple a  h d consider the category q with the
objectclass consisting of all quantum families of isometries s  of the
given noncommutative manifold and the set of morphisms mors  s    
being the set of unital c  homomorphisms   s  s  satisfying id 
  we also consider another category q whose objects are triplets s  
where s  is a compact quantum group acting smoothly and isometrically
on the given noncommutative manifold with  being the corresponding action the morphisms are the homomorphisms of compact quantum groups
which are also morphisms of the underlying quantum families the forgetful functor f  q  q is clearly faithful and we can view f q  as a
subcategory of q
let us assume from now on that the spectral triple a  h d is admissible our aim is to prove the existence of a universal object in q we shall
also prove that the unique upto isomorphism universal object belongs to
f q  and its preimage in q is a universal object in the category q  to
this end we need some preparatory results
lemma 212 consider an admissible spectral triple a  h d and let
s  be a quantum family of smooth isometries of the spectral triple moreover assume that the action  is faithful in the sense that there is no proper
c  subalgebra s1 of s such that a   a  s1  then   a  s 
a  s defined by a  b  a1  b extends to an slinear unitary on
0  s denoted again by  moreover we can find a
the hilbert smodule hd

c isomorphism   ui  s between s and a quotient of u by a c  ideal

13

0  where 
i of u such that   id    id  i    on a  hd
i
denotes the quotient map from u to ui
if furthermore there is a compact quantum group structure on s given
by a coproduct  such that s   is an object in q  the map   a 
a s extends to a unitary representation denoted again by  of the com0  in this case the ideal i is a woronowicz
pact quantum group s  on hd


c ideal and the c isomorphism   ui  s is a morphism of compact
quantum groups

proof 
let  be any state on s since the action   a  a  s is smooth
and isometric we conclude by lemma 210 that   x   x1 for all
x  a since  is arbitrary we have   idx   x1s for all x  a
so  x y s  x y  1s  where    s denotes the svalued

inner product of the hilbert module hd

x  b  x1  b x  a  b  s extends to an slinear isometry on
0  s moreover since a 1  s is normdense
the hilbert smodule hd
in   s it is clear that the slinear span of the range of a  is dense in
0  s or in other words the isometry  has a dense
the hilbert module hd
range so it is a unitary
since  leaves each vi invariant it is clear that  maps vi into vi  s
i
for each i let vkj j k  1  di  be the elements of s such that eij  
p
i
i
k eik  vkj  note that vi  vkj  is a unitary in mdi c  s moreover
i

the subalgebra generated by all vkj  i j k  1 must be dense in s by
the assumption of faithfulness
we have already remarked that eij  is also an orthonormal basis of
vi  and since  being a c  action on a is preserving we have eij  
p

i
eij   k eik  vkj  and therefore vkj  is also unitary by univeri

i

sality of ui  there is a c  homomorphism from ui to s sending ukj to vkj 
and by definition of the free product this induces a c  homomorphism say
 from u onto s so that ui 
 s where i  ker
in case s has a coproduct  making it into a compact quantum group
and  is a quantum group action it is easy to see that the subalgebra of
p i
i
i
i
s generated by vkj is a hopf algebra with vkj   l vkl  vlj  from
this it follows that  is hopfalgebra morphism hence i is a woronowicz
c  ideal 
before we state and prove the main theorem let us note the following
14

elementary fact about c  algebras
lemma 213 let c be a c  algebra and f be a nonempty collection of
c  ideals closed twosided ideals of c then for any x  c we have
sup kx  ik  kx  i0 k
if

where i0 denotes the intersection of all i in f and kx  ik  inf kx 
yk  y  i denotes the norm in ci
proof 
it is clear that supif kx  ik defines a norm on ci0  which is in fact a
c  norm since each of the quotient norms k  ik is so thus the lemma
follows from the uniqueness of c  norm on the c  algebra ci0  
theorem 214 for any admissible spectral triple a  h d the category
q of quantum families of smooth isometries has a universal initial object
say g 0  moreover g has a coproduct 0 such that g 0  is a compact quantum group and g 0  0  is a universal object in the category q
of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on the given
spectral triple the action 0 is faithful
proof 
0 to
recall the c  algebra u considered before and the map  from hd
0


hd u by our definition of  it is clear that a0   a0 alg u however
 is only a linear map unitary but not necessarily a homomorphism we
shall construct the universal object as a suitable quotient of u let f
be the collection of all those c  ideals i of u such that the composition


i  id  i     a
0  a0 alg ui extends to a c homomorphsim
from  to   ui where i denotes the quotient map from u onto
ui this collection is nonempty since the trivial onedimensional c  algebra c gives an object in q and by lemma 212 we do get a member of
f now let i0 be the intersection of all ideals in f we claim that i0 is
again a member of f since any c  homomorphism is contractive we have
ki ak  ka    ik  kak for all a  a
0 and i  f by lemma
213 we see that ki0 ak  kak for a  a

so i0 extends to a norm0

contractive map on  by the density of a0 in  moreover for a b  
and for i  f we have i ab  i ai b since i  i  i0  we can
rewrite the homomorphic property of i as
i0 ab  i0 ai0 b    ii0 
15

since this holds for every i  f we conclude that i0 ab  i0 ai0 b 
t
if ii0   0 ie i0 is a homomorphism in a similar way we can
show that it is a homomorphism since each i is a unitary representation
of the compact quantum group ui on the finite dimensional space vi  it
follows that i vi 1  ui  is total in vi  ui  in particular for any vi  vi
i arbitrary the element vi  1ui  vi  1u belongs to the linear span of
i vi 1ui   vi 1u thus a
0 1u is contained in the linear span of
 1
is
linearly
spanned by i0 a
a
1u
and
hence
a
u
0 1ui0 
0
0
i0

by the normdenisty of a
0 in a and the contractivity of the quotient map
it follows that a  u i0 is the closed linear span of i0 a
0 1  ui0 
this completes the proof that ui0  i0  is indeed an object of q
we now show that g  ui0 is a universal object in q to see this consider any object s  of q without loss of generality we can assume the
action to be faithful since otherwise we can replace s by the c  subalgebra
i
generated by the elements vkj  appearing in the proof of lemma 212 but
by lemma 212 we can further assume that s is isomorphic with ui for
some i  f since i0  i we have a c  homomorphism from ui0 onto
ui sending x  i0 to x  i which is clearly a morphism in the category q
this is indeed the unique such morphism since it is uniquely determined on
i
the dense subalgebra generated by ukj  i0  i j k  1 of g
to construct the coproduct on g  ui0  we first consider 2  i0 
id  i0  a  a  g  g it is easy to verify that g  g 2  is an object
in the category q so by the universality of g i0  we have a unique unital
c  homomorphism 0  g  g  g satisfying
id  0   i0 x  2 x x  a
taking x  eij  we get

on the linear span of ujk  i j k  1 and hence on the whole of u this
implies that 0 maps i0  keri0  into keri0 i0   i0 11i0 
16

u  u in other words i0 is a hopf c  ideal and hence g  ui0 has the
canonical compact quantum group structure as a quantum subgroup of u it
is clear from the relation 2 that 0 coincides with the canonical coproduct
of the quantum subgroup ui0 inherited from that of u it is also easy to
see that the object g 0  i0  is universal in the category q  using the fact
that by lemma 212 any compact quantum group g  acting smoothly
and isometrically on the given spectral triple is isomorphic with a quantum
subgroup ui for some hopf c  ideal i of u
finally the faithfulness of 0 follows from the universality by standard
arguments which we briefly sketch if g1  g is a subalgebra of g such
that 0 a  a  g1  it is easy to see that g1  0  0  is also a universal
object and by definition of universality of g it follows that there is a unique
morphism say j from g to g1  but the map j  i is a morphism from g to
itself where i  g1  g is the inclusion again by universality we have that
j  i  idg  so in particular i is onto ie g1  g 
definition 215 we shall call the universal object g 0  obtained in the
theorem above the quantum isometry group of a  h d and denote it
by qisoa  h d or just qisoa  or sometimes qiso if the
spectral triple is understood from the context
remark 216 assume that an admissible spectral
triple a  h d also
t
satisfies the condition i of lemma 25 ie
domln   a  let  
a  as be a smooth isometric action on a by a compact quantum group
s we recall from the proof of lemma 212 that the map  from a  s to
0  s ie
itself extends to an slinear unitary on the hilbert smodule hd
0
 can be viewed as a unitary in bhd   s clearly for any state  on
0  now by the definition of a smooth
s we have   id    bhd
isometric action the bounded operator  commutes with the selfadjoint
l so  must commute with ln
operator l on a
0  which is a core for t
for all n and in particular keeps a  n domln  invariant

remark 217 let us now briefly indicate how one can weaken the hypothesis of connectedness such an extension of our results is desirable
to accommodate the classical spaces including the finite sets and graphs
in our framework one possibile approach could be to consider the category of compact quantum group actions  which are not only smmoth and
isometric in our sense but also satisfy the  invariance condition ie
  ida   a1 it is easy to see that the connectedness assumption
has been used by us only to prove that the  invariance is automatic for
17

smooth isometric actions thus if we work in the smaller cateogory of such
 invraiant actions only the proof of theorem 214 does go through and thus
we can prove the existence of a universal object to be defined as the quantum
isometry group it is easy to see that for the algebra of functions on a finite
set with the spectral triple given by d  0 this quantum isometry group
coincides with thw quantum permutation group defined by wang
remark 218 it is easy to see how to extend our formulation and results
to spectral triples which are not necessarily of type ii ie when the trace
 is replaced by some nontracial positive functional indeed our construction will go through in such a situation more or less verbatim by replacing
the universal quantum groups adi i by adi qi  for some suitable choice of
matrices qi coming from the modularity property of

construction of quantum groupequivariant spectral triples

in this subsection we shall briefly discuss the relevance of quantum isometry
group to the problem of constructing quantum group equivariant spectral
triples which is important to understand the role of quantum groups in the
framework of noncommutative geometry there has been a lot of activity
in this direction recently see for example the articles by chakraborty and
pal 5 connes 7 landi et al 8 and the references therein in the
classical situation there exists a natural unitary representation of the isometry group g  isom  of a manifold m on the hilbert space of forms so
that the operator d  d where d is the derham differential operator commutes with the representation indeed dd is also a dirac operator for the
spectral triple given by the natural representation of c  m  on the hilbert
space of forms so we have a canonical construction of gequivariant spectral
triple our aim in this subsection is to generalize this to the noncommutative framework by proving that dd  dd is equivariant with respect to a
canonical unitary representation on the hilbert space of noncommutative
forms see for example 10 for a detailed discussion of such forms
consider an admissible spectral triple a  h d and moreover make
the assumption of lemma 26 ie assume that t 7 eitd xeitd is normdifferentiable at t  0 for all x in the algebra b generated by a and
d a 
lemma 219 in the notation of lemma 26 we have the following where
b c  a 
1
3
dd dd bc   blc  lbc  lbc 
2
18

proof
denote by b c the right hand side of euqation 3 and fix any a  a 
using the facts the the functional  is a faithful trace on the algebra b
l  dd dd and that d x  0 for any x in b we have
 a b c
1
   a blc   ca lb   a lbc
2
1

 d a bd c   d ca d b   d a d bc
2
1

 a d bd c   d ca d b   cd a d b   d a d bc
2
  d a d bc
  d a d bc
 hdd a dd bci
  a dd dd bc

from this we get the following by a simple computation
1
hadd b a dd b i    b a a b 
2

for a b a  b  a  and where x y  lxylxy xly now let us
denote the quantum isometry group of the given spectral triple a  h d
by g   let a0 denote the algebra generated by a
0  g0 denote algebra of g generated by matrix elements of irreducible representations
clearly   a0  a0 alg g0 is a hopfalgebraic action of g0 on a0  define
  a0 alg g0   a0 alg g0   a0 alg g0 by
x  q x  q    x x   qq  
it follows from the relation l  id      l on a0 that
x y  x y

5

we now define a linear map 1 from the linear span of add b  a b  a0 
1  g by setting
to hd
x 1
1
2 2
1 add b 
ai dd bj   ai bj

19

p 1 2
where for any x  a0 we write x  i xi xi  a0 alg g0 summation
over finitely many terms we shall sometimes use the sweedler convention
of writing the above simply as x  x1  x2  it then follows from the
identities 4 and 5 and also the fact that   ida   a1 for all
a  a0 that
hadd b a dd b ig
1
    idb a a  b 
2
1
    idb a a  b 
2
1
    idb a a  b 
2
1
   b a a  b 1g
2
 hadd b a dd b i1g 
this proves that 1 is indeed welldefined and extends to a glinear isom1  g to be denoted by u 1  which sends ad b  q to
etry on hd
d
1
 add b1  q a b  a0  q  g moreover since the linear span
0
of a
0 1  g is dense in hd  g it is easily seen that the range of the
1
1  g ie u 1 is a unitary in fact from its
isometry u is the whole of hd
definition it can also be shwon that u 1 is a unitary representation of the
1 
compact quantum group g on hd
in a similar way we can construct unitary representation u n of g on
the hilbert space of nforms for any n  1 by defining
1

2 2


u n a0 dd a1 dd a2 dd an q  a0 dd a1 dd ann a0 a1 a2
n q ai  a0 

using sweedler convention and verifying that it extends to a unitary
0 discussed bewe also denote by u 0 the unitary representation  onlhd
n of g on
fore finally we have a unitary representation u 
n0 u
l
n  and also extend d as a closed densely defined operator on h
h  n hd
d
in the obvious way by defining dd a0 dd a1 dd an   dd a0 dd an 
it is now straightforward to see the following
theorem 220 the operator d   dd dd is equivariant in the sense that
u d   1  d   1u 
we point out that there is a natural representation  of a on h given
by aa0 dd a1 dd an   aa0 dd a1 dd an  and a  h d  is
indeed a spectral triple which is gequivariant
20

although the relation between spectral properties of d and d  is not
clear in general in many cases of interest eg when there is an underlying
type 1 1 spectral data in the sense of 10 these two dirac operators are
closely related as an illustration consider the canonical spectral on the
noncommutative 2torus a  which is discussed in some details in the next
section in this case the dirac operator d acts on l2 a     c2  and it
can easily be shown see 10 that the hilbert space of forms is isomorphic
with l2 a     c4 
 l2 a   c2  thus d is essentially same as d in this
case

examples and computations

we give some simple yet interesting explicit examples of quantum isometry
groups here however we give only some computational details for the first
example and for the rest the reader is referred to a companion article 3
example 1  commutative tori
consider m  t the onetorus with the usual riemannian structure the
algebra a  c  m  is generated by one unitary u  which is the multiplication operator by z in l2 t the laplacian is given by lu n   n2 u n 
 smoothly let a  n  z be
if a compact quantum group s p
s  acts on a
n
elements of s such that 0 u   n u n  an here 0  a  a alg s
is the saction on a  note that this infinite sum converges at least
in the topology of the hilbert space l2 t  l2 s where l2 s denotes
the gns space for the haar state of s it is clear that the condition
l  id  0  0  l forces to have an  0 for all but n  1 the
conditions 0 u 0 u   0 u  0 u   1  1 further imply the following
a1 a1  a1 a1  1  a1 a1  a1 a1 
a1 a1  a1 a1  a1 a1  a1 a1  0
it follows that a1 are partial isometries with orthogonal domains and
ranges say a1 has domain p and range q hence the domain and
range of a1 are respectively 1  p and 1  q consider the unitary
v  a  b so that v p  a v 1  p   b now from the fact that
l  id0 u 2   0 lu 2  it is easy to see that the coefficient of 1  1 in
the expression of 0 u 2 must be 0 ie ab  ba  0 from this it follows
that v and p commute and therefore p  q by straightforward calculation
using the facts that v is unitary p is a projection and v and p commute we
21

can verify that 0 given by 0 u   u  v p  u 1  v 1  p  extends to a
homomorphsim from a to a c  v p  satisfying lid0  0 l
it follows that the c  algebra qisot is commutative and generated by a
unitary v and a projection p  or equivalently by two partial isometries a
b such that a a  aa  b  b  bb   ab  ba  0 so as a c  algebra
it is isomorphic with ct  ct 
 ct  z2  the coproduct say 0 
can easily be calculated from the requirement of coassociativity and the
hopf algebra structure of qisot can be seen to coincide with that of
the semidirect product of t by z2  where the generator of z2 acts on t by
sending z 7 z
we summarize this in form of the following
theorem 31 the universal quantum group of isometries qisot of the
onetorus t is isomorphic as a quantum group with ct z2   cisot
we can easily extend this result to higher dimensional commutative tori
and can prove that the quantum isometry group coincides with the classical
isometry group this is some kind of rigidity result and it will be interesting to investigate the nature of quantum isometry groups of more general
classical manifolds
example 2  noncommutative torus holomorphic isomrtries
next we consider the simplest and wellknown example of noncommutative
manifold namely the noncommutative twotorus a  where  is a fixed
irrational number see 6 it is the universal c  algebra generated by
two unitaries u and v satisfying the commutation relation u v  v u 
where   e2i  there is a canonical faithful trace  on a given by
 u m v n   mn  we consider the canonical spectral triple a  h d
where a is the unital algebra spanned by u v  h  l2    l2   and
d is given by


0
d1  id2
d

d1  id2
0
where d1 and d2 are closed unbounded linear maps on l2   given by
d1 u m v n   mu m v n  d2 u m v n   nu m v n  it is easy to compute the
space of oneforms 1d see 4 10 6 and the laplacian l  d d is
given by lu m v n   m2  n2 u m v n  for simplicity of computation
instead of the full quantum isometry group we at first concentrate on an
interesting quantum subgroup g  qisohol a  h d which is the universal quantum group which leaves invariant the subalgebra of a consisting
of polynomials in u  v and 1 ie span of u m v n with m n  0 the proof
of existence and uniqueness of such a universal quantum group is more or
22

less identical to the proof of existence and uniqueness of qiso we call g
the quantum group of holomorphic isometries and observe in the theorem
stated below without proof see 3 that this quantum group is nothing but
the quantum double torus studied in 11
theorem 32 consider the following coproduct b on the c  algebra b 
ct2 a2  given on the generators a0  b0  c0  d0 as follows  where a0  d0
correspond to ct2  and b0  c0 correspond to a2 
b a0   a0  a0  c0  b0  b b0   b0  a0  d0  b0 
b c0   a0  c0  c0  d0  b d0   b0  c0  d0  d0 
then b 0  is a compact quantum group and it has an action 0 on a
given by
0 u   u  a0  v  b0  0 v   u  c0  v  d0 
moreover b b  is isomorphic as quantum group with g  qisohol a  h d
we refer to 3 for a proof of the above result and to 11 for the computation
of the haar stat and representation theory of the compact quantum group
g
example 3  noncommutative torus full quantum isometry group
by similar but somewhat tedious calculations see 3 one can also describe
explicitly the full quantum isometry group qisoa  h d it is as a
c  algebra has eight direct summands four of which are isomorphic with
the commutative algebra ct2  and the other four are irrational rotation
algebras
theorem 33 qisoa   8k1 c  uk1  uk2  as a c  algebra where for
odd k uk1  uk2 are the two commuting unitary generators of ct2  and for
even k uk1 uk2  exp4iuk2 uk1  ie they generate a2  the coaction
on the generators u v say of a are given by the following 
0 u   u u11 u31 v u52 u62 u 1 u21 u41 v 1 u72 u82 
0 v   u u51 u71 v u12 u22 u 1 u61 u81 v 1 u32 u42 
from the coassociativity condition the coproduct of qisoa  can easily
be calculated for the detailed description of the coproduct counit antipode and study of the representation theory of qisoa  the reader is
referred to 3 it is interesting to mention here that the quantum isometry
23

group of a is a rieffel type deformation of the isometry group which is
same as the quantum isometry group of the commutative twotorus the
commutative twotorus is a subgroup of its isometry group but when the
isometry group is deformed into qisoa  the subgroup relation is not
respected and the deformation of the commutative torus which is a2  sits
in qisoa  just as a c  subalgebra in fact a direct summand but not
as a quantum subgroup any more this perhaps provides some explanation
of the nonexistence of any hopf algebra structure on the noncommutative
torus
acknowledgement  the author would like to thank p hajac for drawing his attention to the article 11 and sl woronowicz for many valuable
comments and suggestions which led to substantial improvement of the paper
