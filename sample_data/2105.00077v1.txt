ABSTRACT

A significant fraction of isolated white dwarfs host magnetic fields in excess of a MegaGauss. Observations suggest that these fields originate in interacting binary systems
where the companion is destroyed thus leaving a singular, highly-magnetized white
dwarf. In post-main-sequence evolution, radial expansion of the parent star may cause
orbiting companions to become engulfed. During the common envelope phase, as the
orbital separation rapidly decreases, low-mass companions will tidally disrupt as they
approach the giant's core. We hydrodynamically simulate the tidal disruption of planets and brown dwarfs, and the subsequent accretion disc formation, in the interior of
an asymptotic giant branch star. These dynamically formed discs are commensurate
with previous estimates, suggesting strong magnetic fields may originate from these
tidal disruption events.

INTRODUCTION

White dwarfs (WDs) with magnetic field strengths in excess
of a MegaGauss (MG) are observed in both isolated and binary systems (Ferrario et al. 2015). WDs in binaries can either be "attached" (the companion's radius extends past the
equipotential surface and mass transfer is occurring through
L1) or "detached" (the companion's radius is well within the
equipotential surface). Between 25% and 36% of WDs in attached binary systems are highly magnetic (polar or intermediate polar cataclysmic variables) while the remaining systems have sub-MG or non-measurable fields (Ferrario et al.
2015; Pala et al. 2020). In contrast, WDs in detached binary
systems seldom host strong magnetic fields with only ∼10 of
the over 3000 found to date (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2016;
Parsons et al. 2021). Lastly, about 10% of isolated WDs have
measured field strengths in excess of a MG, these objects are
commonly referred to as High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs
(HFMWDs) (Kawka et al. 2007; Liebert et al. 2003). In each
of these cases the origin of the WD's magnetic field strength
is an area of active research.
HFMWDs tend to be more massive than their isolated
non-magnetic counterparts (Liebert 1988). This suggests
?

that HFMWD formation may require some type of mass
transfer during binary interactions. Additionally, a primordial field origin in which magnetized white dwarfs are descendants of Ap/Bp stars is unable to explain the quantity and field strength distribution of HFMWDs in the solar
neighborhood (Kawka & Vennes 2004; Kawka 2020). If the
origin were truly independent of binary interactions, then
the presence of a detached binary should not affect the incidence of magnetic fields. However, in contrast to the ∼10%
of isolated white dwarfs that host strong magnetic fields, not
a single young magnetic white dwarf has been observed in
a detached binary1 (Kawka et al. 2007; Liebert et al. 2003).
Therefore, the formation channel for strong magnetic fields
in WDs likely requires binary evolution (Tout et al. 2008;
Nordhaus et al. 2011).
Recently, research on binary formation for magnetic
white dwarfs has focused on pathways that involve common
envelope evolution (CEE) (Tout et al. 2008; Nordhaus et al.
2011; Ferrario et al. 2020). In CEE, one of the stellar components experiences radial expansion, creating an envelope

The systems in Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2016) and Parsons
et al. (2021) all contain older WDs and companions with high
Roche-lobe filling factors. The latter may indicate a history of
mass transfer, i.e., not necessarily detached.

of loosely bound material. This envelope may directly engulf
an orbiting companion or cause orbital decay that results in
a common envelope (CE) phase (Paczynski 1976; Harpaz &
Soker 1994; Siess & Livio 1999; Nordhaus & Blackman 2006;
Staff et al. 2016; Belczynski et al. 2016; Wilson & Nordhaus 2019, 2020). For a more complete discussion of CEs
see Ivanova et al. (2013) and references therein. Magnetic
field generation could occur in the envelope during CEE, or
during subsequent mass transfer event in the post-CE system, or in a merger if the companion disrupts during the
CE phase (Tout et al. 2008; Nordhaus et al. 2007, 2011;
Ohlmann et al. 2016a).
Double degenerate (WD-WD) mergers are one proposed
pathway to create isolated HFMWDs (Wickramasinghe &
Ferrario 2000; Garcı́a-Berro et al. 2012). In this scenario,
the resultant object is a massive white dwarf with a hot differentially rotating corona that may amplify magnetic fields
via a dynamo. This seems unlikely to explain the complete
distribution of isolated HFMWDs, as the average mass of
HFMWDs is only about 0.1 M more than the average
mass of non-magnetic WDs. Furthermore, a small number of
HFMWDs have been discovered in young stellar clusters. In
these settings, only the most massive WDs would exist (The
remnants of the most massive intermediate mass stars), and
therefore mergers of two of these objects would have resulted
in Type Ia supernovae (Caiazzo et al. 2020).
Here, we focus on CE phases that result in the merger
of a white dwarf with a less massive companion (M-dwarf,
brown dwarf, or planetary companion) (Nordhaus et al.
2011; Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013; Guidarelli et al. 2019). During CEE, the companion does not possess sufficient energy
to eject the envelope and emerge in a short-period orbit. Instead, the orbital separation decreases until the companion
is tidally disrupted as it nears the proto-white dwarf core.
The disrupted material forms an accretion disc that may
amplify the magnetic field and advect it to the white dwarf
surface where it could anchor.
Previously, we showed that such discs survive thermal
evaporation in the hot stellar ambient medium and remain
stable for at least ∼100 orbits (Guidarelli et al. 2019). However, these results assumed a disc formed from disrupted
material was already present and thus are contingent on
assumptions about the initial mass and disc geometry we
chose. To verify that these assumptions are reasonable and
to obtain further insight, we numerically simulate the dynamics of the tidal disruption events and subsequent disc
formation. Some work has been done on massive star binary
mergers with low-mass companions, investigating the long
term evolution of angular momentum as well as the surface abundances (Chatzopoulos et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020).
Tidal disruption events around white dwarfs have also been
investigated (Malamud & Perets 2020; Veras et al. 2014).
However, there have been no simulations investigating disc
formation and structure from tidal disruption around the
core of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star.
In this paper we present high-resolution, threedimensional, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations
of tidal disruption events involving 10, 20, and 30 MJ 2 companions inside the core of an AGB star that was evolved

2

MJ is the mass of Jupiter

from a 2 M zero-age-main-sequence star. We find that an
accretion disc typically forms within six orbital periods at
∼1R . Approximately, ∼60% of the disrupted material orbits in a disk while the rest remains gravitationally bound
in the tidal tail. Even though the disc dynamically forms,
its resultant structure is similar to the initial conditions assumed in our previous work (Guidarelli et al. 2019).
The structure of the paper is as follows: in Section 2,
we describe our numerical techniques and initial conditions.
In Section 3, we analyze the evolution of the global angular
momentum, present the resultant radially averaged angular
velocity profile of the disc, quantify the fraction of tidallydisrupted mass that forms the disc, analyze the flow properties and discuss how our results depend on resolution. We
discuss future work and conclude in Section 4.

NUMERICAL SETUP

We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with 10 , 20, and 30 MJ companions around the 0.56 M core of an AGB star. In contrast
to CE simulations that utilize the entire star (Sand et al.
2020; Chamandy et al. 2019a; Chamandy et al. 2019b, 2020;
Ohlmann et al. 2016b, 2017; De Marco et al. 2011; Ricker
& Taam 2008; Ricker & Taam 2012), we focus on the inner
1012 cm to study the dynamics of the tidal disruption event
. This results in a higher-effective resolution than what is
typically achieved in global CE simulations that simulate
the entire primary star.
The companions were initialized just outside the tidal
disruption radius. We define this as the distance of the secondary from the center of mass of the primary (AGB core)
where the companion's gravitational binding energy is equal
to the average differential external potential multiplied by
the diameter of the planet. This separation is given as:

Rtidal ∼

2(5 − n) Mcore
3
Mp

1/2
Rp ,

(1)

where Rp and Mp are the companion radius and mass,
and Mcore is the mass of the proto-WD AGB core. This assumes that the planet is a polytrope with index n, and the
companion's radius is small compared to the separation.
The companions were given an initial orbital velocity
that was 65% of the Keplerian velocity at that radius, this
conserves computational resources as it ensures tidal disruption within one orbit. The simulations were run for over 100
orbits of the inner-most regions of the disc after it formed,
and at least six orbits of the disc at ∼1R (i.e. the approximate outer edge of the disc). We investigate the dynamics of
the tidally disrupted matter, the fraction of initial mass that
forms the disc, the disc geometry, and the timescale of disc
formation. Details of the numerical grid, initial conditions,
modifications to the stellar profile, and other aspects of the
numerical implementation are described below.
2.1

Numerical Grid Parameters

To carry out these simulations we utilize AstroBEAR, an
Eulerian, three-dimensional (3D) multi-physics code (Cunningham et al. 2009; Carroll-Nellenback et al. 2013). AsMNRAS 000, 1–8 (2021)

troBEAR employs adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to dynamically resolve regions of the grid that require higher
resolution while leaving other regions at lower resolution,
thereby saving substantial computational costs.
AstroBEAR solves the following hydrodynamic equations:

the acceleration due to self gravity, E is the total internal

Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. For these
simulations we use an ideal gas equation of state with adiabatic index, γ = 5/3. Lastly, gc is the softened gravitational

of the point particle which is smaller than Mcore . The difference in mass Mcore − Mpp is taken into account with ag as it
is resolved on the grid (see Section 2.2.1).
We employ a base grid of 323 with up to five levels of
factor two refinement for an effective resolution of 10243 .
This yields a smallest grid cell of ∼109 cm, approximately
the radius of the central white dwarf. The total simulated
box size is (2 × 1012 cm)3 . The spline softening radius of the
central particle is 1010 cm. We simulate approximately one
day of physical time, consistent with six orbits at the outer
radii of the resultant disc and over 100 orbits at the softening
radius.
2.2

Initial Condition Generation and Modification

To generate interior profiles for both the AGB star and the
companions, we utilize MESA (Modules for Experiments
in Stellar Astrophysics version 12115) (Paxton et al. 2011,
2018, 2019). MESA is a spherically symmetric, stellar evolution code that is capable of simulating the interior density,
pressure, temperature and composition profiles of a star over

Figure 2. Density as a function of radius for the planetary companions, having an effective polytropic index, n ∼ 1.5. Because the
profiles are already flat within 109 cm (the smallest grid cell), they
do not require a point particle or modification. The density corresponding to the flat outer section is the average AGB density in
the companion vicinity. This section is appended to the profile to
create an initial co-moving envelope of relatively low density material which reduces the effects of the shock between the orbiting
companion and stationary ambient material.

various epochs of its evolution. We calculate the full evolution of a primary star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass
of 2 M with solar metallicity. Mass-loss on the Red Giant
Branch (RGB) is governed via a Reimers mass-loss prescription with a Reimers mass-loss coefficient, ηR = 0.7 (Reimers
1975). On the AGB, we use a Bloecker mass-loss prescription
with a mass-loss coefficient, ηB , of 0.7 (Bloecker 1995). For
the simulations reported in this paper, we select the density
and pressure profiles when the radius attains its maximum
extent on the AGB. These spherically-symmetric profiles are
mapped onto the grid and form the initial conditions for the
AGB ambient.

The black curve is the Keplerian velocity profile about a point

elliptical discs, we expect circularization in a few more orbital
time scales. When this occurs, the disc will still be sub-Keplerian
as pressure gradients will offset some gravitational force.

The ∼5% dip in angular momentum at ∼6 hr is caused by a small
amount of material accelerated by the companion that exits the
cylinder only to slow down and fall back in the the following few
hours. As indicated by the gray shaded region, At 13 hr, the tidal
arm passes through the cylinder boundary and causes the total
angular momentum within the cylinder to decrease accordingly.

Similarly, we use MESA to generate hydrostatic density and pressure profiles for each planet and brown dwarf
companion. With the built in 'make planets' module, one
can create an initial 1D hydrostatic profile, allow this profile
to relax and form a core, and expose the profile to expected
radiation. We initialize our companion with solar metallicity values of Y = 0.25 and Z = 0.02 and select these profiles
before cooling and core formation which results in a slightly
larger estimate for the tidal disruption radius. Note that a
typical core contributes < 10% of the planet mass.

AGB Profile Modification

Because of the large range of scales inherent to AGB stars,
we utilize a point particle to represent some of the mass
in the central region. Were a point particle not employed,
the steep density gradients in this region would be underresolved, resulting in numerical instability on small scales
and an inaccurate gravitational potential at larger scales.
Once implemented, point particles allow for the original
steep density profile to be replaced with a flatter profile.
However, point particles also require a modification to the
gravitational potential as under-resolved small separations
lead to extraneous acceleration. Therefore, to maintain a
proper representation of the potential when implementing a
point particle, we modify the density profile in accordance
with a smoothed gravitational potential acting on the surrounding material. This modified profile is shown in Figure
1.
We modify the density and pressure distributions using
a method previously described in Guidarelli et al. (2019).
Specifically, we construct a numerical integrator to iterate
over solutions to the Modified-Lane-Emden equation. This
yields a modified density and corresponding pressure profile that maintains hydrostatic equilibrium for any choice of
initial profile and smoothing function. This code is publicly
available3 and is useful for generating hydrostatic initial conditions for 3D simulations involving evolved stars (Guidarelli
et al. 2019; Ohlmann et al. 2017; Chamandy et al. 2018).

Planet and brown dwarf co-moving envelopes

In contrast to the AGB initial conditions, the planetary
profiles could be imported to the 3D grid without modification, as the smallest grid-cell accurately resolves all
density gradients. However, because the pressure gradients

at the planetary boundary cause large initial shocks, we
give the surrounding ambient (a spherical shell of thickness
0.5 R p ) the same initial velocity as shown in Figure 2. While
shocks are expected, the initial steep pressure gradient significantly lengths the computational time. By adding this
low-density shell of co-moving material, the initial shock dissipates quickly allowing subsequent shocks to develop naturally.

RESULTS

Figures 3 - 5 present the density distributions in the orbital
plane from each simulation at 6.6, 13.2 and 19.8 hrs. These
times correspond to ∼2, 4 and 6 Keplerian orbits at the
outer disc radii. In each panel we also show the velocity in
units of the local Keplerian circular speed. From these images, it is clear a disc begins to form within 20 hrs regardless

of the initial companion mass. Within the first few hours the
planets disrupt, dispersing the angular momentum. The material that gains angular momentum forms a tidal tail and
moves outward while material that loses significant angular
momentum falls inward. The main differences between these
simulations stem from the increase in total linear momentum. During disruption, the more massive companions transfer more linear momentum to the primary core. Because the
core then moves in the direction of this momentum, material
in the opposite direction becomes more dispersed.
Thermal evaporation seems to play a minor role as the
disrupted companion mass remains relatively distinct from
the hot stellar interior. At the end of the simulations, ∼60%
of the initial companion mass resides in the disc. The material in the tidal tail remains bound and may fall back on
longer timescales.
To quantify the effect of resolution on our results, we
present a snapshot from an identical 10 MJ simulation at
lower resolution in Figure 6. Although more dispersive, the
lower resolution simulation is dynamically and morphologically consistent with the higher resolution run.

3.1

Angular Momentum Evolution

The total angular momentum within a cylinder of radius
0.8 × 1012 cm is shown in Figure 7 as a function of time for
each of the simulations. In all cases angular momentum is
conserved to within ∼5% until material from the disrupted
companion leaves the computational grid at ∼13hrs.
The distribution of angular velocity for the 10 MJ planet
is shown in Figure 8. Each color represents a different time in
the simulation in reference to the Keplerian velocity (black
line). As the planet moves inwards, density and angular momentum diffuse radially. By the end of the simulation, the
angular velocity profile matches the concavity of the Keplerian solution. The difference in magnitude is the result of
a non-circular (elliptical) disc as well as pressure support
within the disc.

Resultant Disc Geometry and Efficiency

Figure 9 presents density contours of the disc taken from
slices through the point particle perpendicular to the orbital
plane at various angles (indicated by color). In this figure,
we included an image of a 10MJ disc from our previous work
for comparison (Guidarelli et al. 2019). In aggregate, the
contours provide an estimate of the height to radius ratio of
the disc. We find that for these discs H/R varies from 0.05
in the inner regions to 0.25 in the tidal tail consistent with
our previous work (Guidarelli et al. 2019). The temperature
in a vertical slice through the disc is shown in Figure 10 and
demonstrates that post-tidal disruption, the disk remains
distinct and cold compared to the hot ambient.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we present the results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of tidal disruption events of planet and brown dwarf
companions in the interior of an AGB star. These events are
expected to form accretion discs which may result in conditions that amplify and anchor strong magnetic fields to the
proto-WD (Nordhaus et al. 2010). As mass-loss from the
AGB star continues during its evolution, a HFMWD would
eventually emerge. We show that for planetary and brown
dwarf companions, tidal disruption results in the formation
of an accretion disc around the proto-WD which typically
occurs within a few orbital timescales. About 60% of the
original companion mass forms the disc with the remaining 40% in the tidal tail and subject to fallback on longer
timescales. Lastly, the innermost region of our tidal discs are
morphologically similar to that of the disc initial conditions
assumed in our previous work (Guidarelli et al. 2019).
Once the disc is formed, advection of magnetic flux
through the disc or its surface might transport the field to
the white dwarf. Note that this would occur on radial accretion timescales4 (≤ 1 month) for a standard disk, which is
much shorter then a typical AGB lifetime (∼105−6 years).
Within the environment of a stellar envelope however,
a buildup of pressure may halt accretion in the absence of
a pressure release valve. A pressure release valve could be
provided by jets (Chamandy et al. 2018). The magnetic field
itself may incite vertical outflows which act to relieve pressure, in essence forming a self-sustaining conveyor belt of
magnetic flux until the field gets large enough to inhibit
further advection. Future work should therefore include a
study of the dynamics of tidal disruption when the companion, and/or stellar ambient, are initially magnetized.
