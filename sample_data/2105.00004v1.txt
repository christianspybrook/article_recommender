We describe an efficient numerical method for simulating the dynamics of interacting spin ensembles in the presence of dephasing and decay. The method builds on the discrete truncated Wigner
approximation for isolated systems, which combines the mean-field dynamics of a spin ensemble
with a Monte Carlo sampling of discrete initial spin values to account for quantum correlations.
Here we show how this approach can be generalized for dissipative spin systems by replacing the
deterministic mean-field evolution by a stochastic process, which describes the decay of coherences
and populations while preserving the length of each spin. We demonstrate the application of this
technique for simulating nonclassical spin-squeezing effects or the dynamics and steady states of
cavity QED models with hundred thousand interacting two-level systems and without relying on
any symmetries. This opens up the possibility to perform accurate real-scale simulations of a diverse
range of experiments in quantum optics or with solid-state spin ensembles under realistic laboratory
conditions.

INTRODUCTION

Modeling and understanding the behavior of large ensembles of interacting spins is of importance for many areas of physics. Apart from more traditional fields, such
as magnetism in solids, this includes as well many recent experiments with cold atoms [1–9], trapped ions [10–
16], Rydberg atoms [17–23], polar molecules [24], magnetic atoms [25–28] or hybrid quantum systems [29–35].
In such settings, an accurate control over a large number of effective spin systems and their coupling to other
bosonic degrees of freedom can now be achieved and used
for quantum sensing and other quantum technology applications. However, due to the exponential growth of
the Hilbert space with increasing number of spins, exact
numerical simulations of such systems are typically restricted to only a few tens of spins, which makes a direct
theoretical modeling and benchmarking of such experiments impossible. Numerical simulations become even
more challenging when realistic decoherence processes are
taken into account and the dynamics of the full system
density operator must be evaluated.
In certain specific situations the exponential scaling in
numerical simulations can be avoided and the simulation
of moderately large spin systems is still possible. For example, in one dimensional lattices, time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) techniques
can be used to substantially reduce the computational
complexity. This permits the simulation of the coherent [36–38] and dissipative dynamics [39–42] of rather
large spin chains and with additional effort extensions
to two-dimensional lattices are possible [43–46]. Another
important case are systems with a permutational symmetry, for example, a cloud of atoms that couple collectively to a single cavity mode, but also decay individually
with the same rate. In this situation the permutation
symmetry can be exploited to perform numerical simu-

lations that scale only polynomially with the number of
two-level systems [47–52]. When combined with Monte
Carlo wavefunction techniques, the simulation of cavity
QED systems with hundreds of atoms [49] or bare ensembles of about ∼ 105 two-level systems [51] become
possible. However, this approach is very restricted and
cannot be applied to systems with short-range interactions or, in general, to describe realistic experiments with
inhomogeneous frequencies or spatially varying fields. To
model such generic experimental situations it is necessary
to identify approximate numerical techniques that take
all relevant coherent and incoherent processes accurately
into account, but are still efficient to implement.
In this paper we describe such a general scheme for
simulating the dynamics of interacting spin ensembles
and cavity QED setups in the presence of dephasing
and decay. The method builds on the discrete truncated
Wigner approximation (DTWA) introduced in Ref. [53],
where the coherent evolution of interacting spins is approximated by an average over a set of classical trajectories. By taking the exact amount of quantum noise in
the initial distribution of those trajectories into account,
this technique goes considerably beyond mean-field and
provides very accurate predictions for spin-squeezing effects [54, 55] or for the numerical simulation of quench
dynamics [56, 57] of systems with hundreds or thousands
of spins. However, the DTWA as well as closely related
continuous TWA techniques [58] are only applicable for
coherent systems. A truncated Wigner method for open
quantum spin systems (TWOQS) has recently been introduced in Ref. [59] and used to study non-equilibrium
phase transitions [60], but this techniques is in general
only applicable for large collective spins. Thus, with
these existing methods an accurate simulation of real experiments with dissipation and decoherence is still not
possible.
To overcome this problem we present the dissipative

2
discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DDTWA), an
extension of the DTWA for open quantum systems, which
takes decay and different types of dephasing processes
fully into account. This can be achieved by replacing the
mean-field dynamics of the classical spin variables by a
set of stochastic trajectories. These stochastic equations
describe the decay of coherences and populations, but
also include the correct amount of added noise in order
to preserves the quantum fluctuations of each individual
spin, which is the essential ingredient for the accuracy of
the DTWA. Further, the stochastic dynamics of the spins
can be readily combined with other phase space techniques for continuous variable degrees of freedom [58].
Therefore, the method can be immediately adapted for
the simulation of ensemble cavity QED settings that include the coupling to lossy photonic modes. At the same
time the actual numerical simulations are both straightforward to implement and efficient, such that they can be
readily applied for modelling realistic experiments with
thousands or even millions of two-level systems.
The remainder of paper is structured as follows. In
Sec. II we first briefly summarize the DTWA technique
for simulating the coherent dynamics of interacting spin
ensembles, which we then generalize in Sec. III to take
dephasing and decay processes into account. In Sec. IV
we illustrate and benchmark the method in terms of a
few basic examples, for which exact solutions for comparison still exist. Finally, in Sec. V we demonstrate the
application of this technique for simulating superradiant
decay processes in interacting and inhomogeneous cavity
QED systems, for which exact simulation methods are
no longer available. A summary of our findings is given
in Sec. VI.

THE DISCRETE TRUNCATED WIGNER
APPROXIMATION

We are interested in the time evolution of interacting
spin ensembles and cavity QED setups with N  1 effective S = 1/2 systems. For concreteness we will first
focus on pure spin systems described by a Hamiltonian
of the form (~ = 1)
N

H=

ics of interacting spin systems. The basic idea behind
this method is to approximate the exact dynamics of the
spin ensemble by a set of N classical spin trajectories,
~si (t), which evolve according to the mean-field equations
of motion. However, the initial values for these trajectories are randomly drawn from a probability distribution
that accounts for the correct quantum mechanical uncertainties of the initial spin state. This leads to a significant
improvement compared to mean-field theory.
The actual numerical simulation is performed by implementing the following steps [see Fig. 1(a)]:
1. Draw a set of N classical spin variables ~si =
(sxi , syi , szi ) according to the discrete Wigner distribution WD ({~si }) [61]. For example, for a single
spin pointing down, | ↓ i, we have [62]
1
WD (~si ) = δ(sz + 1) [δ(sxi + 1) + δ(sxi − 1)]
4
× [δ(syi + 1) + δ(syi − 1)] .

(2)

This means that the initial spin vectors are randomly drawn from one of the four spin configurations
(sxi , syi , szi ) = (±1, ±1, −1),

(3)

which occur with the same probability of 1/4. All
other states on the Bloch sphere can be sampled
using the same configurations, followed by an appropriate rotation [62].
2. Evolve the classical spins according to the meanfield equations of motion, which for the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) read

Here ~σ = (σ x , σ y , σ z )T , where the σ k are the usual Pauli
~ and Jij are the local field and the spinoperators, and Ω
spin interaction matrix, respectively. Later below we will
also consider additional couplings of the spin ensemble to
a common bosonic mode, as encountered in cavity QED.
Even without the bosonic mode, the spins evolving under
the action of H will in general get entangled over time
and exact numerical simulations of the full quantum state
of the system are only possible for a few tens of spins.
In Ref. [53] the DTWA was introduced as an approximate numerical method to simulate the coherent dynam-

where the ~si,n (t) denote the classical spin vectors

verifies that by averaging over the four configurations of Eq. (3) all expectation values of the state

in this work for open quantum spin systems. See text for
more details.

By evaluating only the classical equations of motion, the
DTWA scales approximately linearly with N and therefore the dynamics of thousands of spins can be simulated.
At the same time, the quantum mechanical uncertainties of the initial state are fully included by averaging
over a distribution of initial spin vectors and in general
hσik σj` i =
6 hσik ihσj` i. Importantly, since the mean-field
equations of motion in Eq. (4) preserve the length of
each individual spin, ~si2 (t) = 3, its magnitude is equal
to the exact quantum mechanical value along each individual trajectory. This means that compared to meanfield theory, the effects of spin-spin interactions, which
scale as ∼ |~si (t)||~sj (t)|, are much more accurately taken
into account. In many situations of interest, for example,
in spin-squeezing experiments with trapped ions or cold
atoms, this feature leads to very precise predictions. A
more detailed discussion of the DTWA and many explicit
examples can found in Refs. [53–57].
Finally, let us remark that instead of sampling from a
discrete distribution, analogous simulations can be performed by sampling the initial spin components from a
Gaussian distribution [58], which leads to different levels of accuracies for different quantities and configurations [63]. While we focus here exclusively on the DTWA,
all results below can be also applied to such continuous
TWA simulations.

III.

STOCHASTIC SIMULATION OF OPEN
SPIN ENSEMBLES

In real experiments the spins or atoms are never completely isolated and will spontaneously decay or undergo
dephasing due to residual interactions with the environment. Such an open system scenario can be modeled by
a master equation for the system density operator ρ,
ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] + Ldeph (ρ) + Ldecay (ρ).

Ldecay (ρ) =

2 i=1

and describes the uncorrelated decay of each two-level
system with rate Γ.
Naively, one could simply account for these decoherence processes by evaluating the mean-field dynamics for
hσ k i using the master equation in Eq. (7) and by including the additional terms in the mean-field equations
of motion in Eq. (4). This approach is still exact for
noninteracting spins and would also in general correctly
capture the decay of coherences of the transverse spin
components, hσix i and hσiy i. However, in this case the
spin length |~si (t)| is no longer conserved along a trajectory. As a consequence, also the effect of spin-spin
interactions is reduced and the accuracy of the DTWA
simulation degrades considerably. Therefore, in order to
avoid this degradation, not only damping terms, but also
an appropriate amount of fluctuations must be included
in the dynamics.
A.

Dephasing

Let us first focus on pure dephasing. In this situation
we can make use of the fact that the incoherent dynamics
generated by Ldeph in Eq. (7) is nothing else but the
limiting case of a coherent evolution of the spins under
the rapidly fluctuating Hamiltonian
N

Hfluc (t) =

1X
ξi (t)σiz .
2 i=1

(11)

Here the ξi (t) are classical noise processes with zero mean
and we can set hξi (t)ξj (t0 )i ∼ δij to model individual dephasing or ξi (t) = ξ(t) for collective noise. The evolution
under this Hamiltonian introduces an additional term in
the mean-field dynamics,

White noise limit

If the noise is uncorrelated over the typical timescales
of the spin dynamics, which is also assumed in the derivation of the master equation in Eq. (7), we can take the
white-noise limit hξi (t)ξi (t0 )i ' 2Γφ δ(t−t0 ) and interpret
Eq. (12) as a Stratonovich stochastic differential equation. For numerical simulations it is more convenient to
convert Eq. (12) into an Ito differential equation, where
the added noise in each time step is independent of ~si (t).
Using the usual rules of stochastic calculus [64] we then
obtain the following stochastic increments for the spin
variables
p
(13)
dsxi |deph = −Γφ sxi dt − 2Γφ syi dWi ,
p
y
y
x
dsi |deph = −Γφ si dt + 2Γφ si dWi ,
(14)
dszi |deph = 0,

(15)

where the dWi ≡ dWi (t) are real-valued and independent
Wiener increments for the time step [t, t + dt]. These
increments satisfy hdWi i = 0 and hdWi dWj i = δij dt for
individual dephasing and again we can simply set dWi =
dW to describe spatially correlated noise.
In summary, we end up with a DDTWA algorithm as
illustrated in Fig. 1(b). In this algorithm the sampling
of the initial spin values, ~si (t = 0), is implemented as
before, but the deterministic mean-field equations of motion for the dynamics are replaced by the following set of
stochastic differential equations
~ i × ~si dt + d~si |
d~si = Ω
eff
deph ,

(16)

where the dephasing-induced contribution is defined in
Eqs. (13)-(15). This set of equations can be efficiently simulated numerically with the Euler-Maruyama
method [64]. We see that Eq. (16) still describes the
same coherent dynamics for h~si i(t), but also accounts for
the loss of coherences. Importantly, this loss is accompanied by an appropriate amount of noise, which ensures
that [65]
hd~si2 i = 0.

(17)

Therefore, although coherences decay over time, the
length of each spin and, as a consequence, also the magnitude of the spin-spin interactions are preserved on average. In the examples discussed in Sec. IV below we find
that this property results in an excellent agreement between these approximate stochastic simulations and the
exact results obtained for a large variety of models and
parameter regimes.

2.

Colored noise

Compared to the original master equation, an important benefit of the derivation presented above is that it
can be readily generalized to colored noise with a finite

correlation time. For example, let us consider the evolution of the spins in the presence of noisy fields with a
correlation function of the form
0

hξi (t)ξj (t0 )i ' δij σ 2 e−|t−t |/τc .

(18)

We see that in the limit τc → 0 we recover the δcorrelated noise from above with Γφ = σ 2 τc , while
for τc → ∞ we obtain the case of static noise with
hξi (t)ξj (t0 )i ' δij σ 2 . In general, the random noises ξi
can be obtained by simulating an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process [64, 66]

dξi = − ξi dt +
τc

r

2
σdηi ,
τc

(19)

where dηi are Wiener increments with hdηi i = 0 and
hdηi dηj i = δij dt. In our numerical simulations we can
then account for the effect of colored noise by simulating
the coherent dynamics in Eq. (12), but assuming noisy
fields ξi (t) that are calculated according to Eq. (19). Note
that compared to the Markovian case, this only increases
the number of simulated equations by N or even just by
one in the case of collective noise. However, for very short
correlation times τc , also the integration time steps must
be reduced and it becomes much more efficient to use the
Markovian dephasing dynamics described by Eqs. (13)(15).

B.

Decay

In the previous derivation we made use of the fact that
dephasing can be described by classical noise. This is not
the case for decay processes, where the system couples
to a quantum environment represented by noise operators with non-vanishing commutation relations. This
difference between dephasing and decay processes also
appears in the Schwinger-boson representation of collective spin systems, where in the latter case the mapping
to a Fokker-Planck equation requires additional approximations [59]. In stochastic simulations of the full quantum mechanical wavefunction, decay is usually modelled
by introducing random quantum jumps [67], after which
the system is projected into the state of the spin pointing down | ↓ i. Within the truncated Wigner function
formalism, this would corresponds to a random projection into one of the four configurations listed in Eq. (3).
However, in this approach the system evolution between
the jumps is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian,
which again reduces the spin length |~si | and degrades the
accuracy of the DTWA.
To circumvent these problems, we propose here to simulate the decay dynamics of dissipative spin systems by
a continuous stochastic process with the following increments for the classical spin trajectories
~ ieff × ~si dt + d~si |
d~si = Ω
decay ,

(20)

dsyi |decay = − syi dt + Γsxi dWi ,
(22)
2
√
dszi |decay = −Γ(szi + 1)dt + Γ(szi + 1)dWi . (23)
Let us emphasize that these equations are not derived
from an underlying system-bath Hamiltonian, but rather
constructed in order to satisfy two crucial properties.
First, the deterministic terms in these equations reproduce the correct decay dynamics for the average spin
components
Γ x,y
hσ̇iz i = −Γ(hσiz i + 1). (24)
hσ i,
2 i
Second, the additional noise terms in Eqs. (21)-(23) reintroduce spin fluctuations to preserve the length of each
spin, |~si |, on average. However, in contrast to the classical noise process, we now obtain [65]

hd~si2 i = Γ 1 − h(szi )2 i dt,
(25)
hσ̇ix,y i = −

and this requirement can only be fulfilled up to a certain
level of approximation. The reason is that for the decay process the deterministic change of the z-component,
d(szi )2 = −2Γszi (sz + 1)dt, is positive for sz < 0. This
cannot be compensated by a positive diffusion term. In
this sense, Eqs. (21)-(23) represent a diffusion process,
which reproduces the exact single-spin dynamics while
conserving the length of each spin as good as possible.
In the actual numerical simulations we find that under most conditions of interest, in particular for small
decay rates Γ, the condition hd~si2 i ≈ 0 is satisfied and
that the average spin length remains very close to its initial value. Specifically, in all the investigated examples
reported below there was only little change of h~s 2 i and
therefore no noticeable degradation of the accuracy of
the predicted results has been observed, neither in the
transient dynamics nor in the steady state. While, this
cannot be guaranteed in general, the conservation of the
spin lengths can easily be verified for a particular application. In this case, Eqs. (21)-(23) represent a faithful
stochastic approximation of a spin decay process, which
is fully compatible with the DTWA.

can also simulate the steady states of the ensemble and
investigate, for example, non-equilibrium phase transitions in driven-dissipative spin systems. As a second
setup we consider an ensemble of two-level atoms coupled to a common optical mode. This setting illustrates
how the DDTWA can be combined with other phase
space methods for continuous variable systems and shows
that the relevant interplay between collective interactions
and individual dephasing is accurately captured by these
stochastic simulations.

A.

Interacting spin ensembles

We first study the dynamics of an interacting spin ensemble under the influence of local dephasing and spontenous emission, as described by Eqs. (7). More specifically, we assume that the coherent evolution of the spins

EXAMPLES AND BENCHMARKING

In this section we demonstrate the application of the
DDTWA for two paradigmatic settings in quantum optics, which can also be used to benchmark the results
against exact numerical simulations in certain limiting
cases. The first example is an ensemble of spin S = 1/2
systems with spatially varying interactions. For this
system it is already known that the DTWA provides
accurate results in the isolated case [53] and we show
that adding dephasing or decay does not affect the accuracy of the method. In the case of decaying spins we

decay algebraically with the (normalized) distance between the spins, |~ri − ~rj |. Such a scenario appears, for
example, in trapped ion systems, where 0 < α < 3 [10–
12], while for an ensemble of Rydberg atoms with vander-Waals interactions we obtain α = 6 [17, 18, 21].
By adding the stochastic terms for local dephasing and
spontaneous emission to the mean-field equations, we arrive at the following set of stochastic differential equa-

spins are arranged on a cubic lattice in three dimensions
with unit spacing and different values of the power-law
exponent α are considered. The central quantity of interest in these plots is the spin-squeezing parameter [69]

As usual, (∆O) = hO i − hOi denotes the variance of
an operator O. Achieving a spin squeezing parameter
of ξ 2 < 1 is relevant for metrological applications, but
it also implies that the spins are entangled [70]. Therefore, such spin-squeezing effects cannot be described by
mean-field theory.

In the absence of the driving field the z-components
of all the spins are conserved and the system dynamics can still be evaluated exactly [68]. This allows us to
directly compare the approximate stochastic simulations
with the corresponding exact results. In Fig. 2(a) we find
that for a very small dephasing rate of Γφ /J = 0.0025 the
squeezing parameter ξ 2 calculated with the DDTWA is
accurate up to the level of a few percent, which is consistent with DTWA results for isolated systems. As shown
in Fig. 2(b), for a slightly stronger rate of Γφ /J = 0.025
the accuracy of the DDTWA improves even further. This
can be attributed to the overall reduction of quantum correlations, which are only approximately take into account
in the coherent dynamics.
In a next step we extend our analysis to finite driving strengths, Ω 6= 0. In this case there are no analytic
solutions available and exact numerical simulations are
restricted to small spin systems, N . 20. However, in
the limit of all-to-all interactions, i.e., α = 0, simulations
with a large number of spins, N ∼ 100, can still be done
by exploiting the permutational symmetry of the master equation [49, 50]. In Fig. 3 we use this symmetry
to compare the DDTWA simulations of the driven Ising
model with α = 0 to the corresponding exact numerical
results. Again we find that for all the considered driving strengths the DDTWA provides very accurate predictions for the mean spin components as well as for the
achievable level of quantum correlations signified by the
squeezing parameter.

Let us now continue with a similar study of the transverse Ising model for Γφ = 0, but including a finite rate
of decay, Γ > 0.

ent power-law interactions in the absence of the driving
field, Ω = 0, and two different values of Γ. Similar to the
case of dephasing, we find excellent agreement between
the DDTWA simulations and the exact solutions [68],
which shows that for such short-time dynamical simulations both types of decoherence processes can be accurately taken into account.
Let us now include a finite driving strength, Ω 6= 0.
While under the influence of pure dephasing the spin ensemble would then simply evolve into an infinite temperature state, this is not the case for driven spin systems in
the presence of decay. As we illustrate in the following,
the DDTWA can also be used to simulate such nontrivial
steady states of driven spin ensembles. In order to benchmark these simulations, we focus again on the case α = 0,
where exact numerical calculations are still possible. In
Fig. 5 we evaluate the steady states of the dissipative
transverse Ising model for varying driving strengths Ω.
For all parameters we find excellent agreement between
the DDTWA simulations and the exact results, both for
the mean values of the collective observables hSk i as well
as for the variances (∆Sk )2 . The sharp peak in the spin
fluctuations at a critical driving strength of Ωc ≈ J indicates a non-equilibrium phase transition in the steady
state of the spin ensemble [71], which shows that the
DDTWA is well suited to study such phenomena.
In summary, these examples clearly demonstrate the
high level of accuracy that can be achieved with the
DDTWA when simulating interacting spin systems with
local dephasing and decay and equivalently accurate results are obtained for spatially correlated dephasing.
Small deviations from the exact predictions are mainly
due to inaccuracies in the coherent dynamics, which takes
spin-spin correlations only approximately into account.
Therefore, we find that in most situations the accuracy
of the DDTWA improves in the presence of decay and
dephasing, where such correlations are reduced.

Apart from being able to simulate large ensembles of
spins, the DDTWA can be readily combined with conventional phase space methods for continuous degrees of
freedom. This is relevant for a large range of cavity QED
models, where many two-level systems are coupled to a
common photonic mode. As an illustrative example, we
consider here the driven Dicke model with Hamiltonian

g
H= √
S+ a + S− a† + ΩSx ,
(32)
N
where S± = Sx ± iSy and a (a† ) is a bosonic annihilation
(creation) operator. To model a realistic scenario, we
include the dephasing of the two-level systems as well
as the decay of the photonic mode with a rate 2κ. The
whole system is then described by the master equation

ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] + Ldeph (ρ) + κ 2aρa† − a† aρ − ρa† a .
(33)
To apply the DDTWA in such a mixed setting, it is natural to represent also the bosonic mode in terms of its
Wigner function,

W (α, t) = 2

(34)
In this case the moments of W (α, t) correspond to the
symmetrically-ordered expectation values of mode operators [67, 72],
Z
h(a† )k a` i|sym (t) = dn α (α∗ )k α` W (α, t).
(35)
In the common situation where the photonic mode is initially prepared in the vacuum state or in a coherent state
with amplitude α0 , the corresponding Wigner function,
W (α, t = 0) =

2 −|α−α0 |2

(36)

is positive and can be interpreted as a probability distribution for the classical amplitudes α. In this case we
can also sample the time evolution of W (α, t) by a set of
stochastic trajectories {αn (t)} and evaluate expectation
values as

and describe the loss of energy as well as the associated

Given a stochastic description for each of the individual

which are integrated for a set of nt  1 initial values ~si (0)
and α(0), randomly drawn from the Wigner distributions
of the individual subsystems.
In Fig. 6 we use this combined TWA approach to simulate the dynamics of the driven Dicke model, first of all
for N = 10 spins, where the results can still be compared
with an exact simulation of the master equation. From
this comparison we find an excellent agreement between
the stochastic simulations and the exact results, both for
the cavity and the spin observables. Although here we

In particular, this correlation function shows a qualitative change from a coherent state, where g (2) (0) ' 1, to
a thermal-like state with g (2) (0) & 2. This crossover as
a function of the driving strength depends explicitly on
the spin dephasing rate Γφ .
As another illustrative example, we compare in
Fig. 6(d) the time evolution of the driven Dicke model
for the two limiting cases of individual dephasing and collective dephasing with the same rate Γφ = ΓC
φ . For this
plot we have assumed a moderate driving and coupling
strength, such that the dissipative cavity acts mainly as
a collective decay channel for the spins. For collective dephasing, where the system dynamics remains constrained
to the maximal angular momentum subspace, the system then quickly relaxes to a stationary state with only
a small spin population. In contrast, for individual dephasing the spin population increases with a rate ∼ Γφ
for longer times. This can be understood from the fact
that the local dephasing processes drive the spins into
orthogonal subspaces with a smaller total angular momentum quantum number. Within these subspaces there
exist many subradiant states, |ψsub i, which are decoupled
from the cavity mode, i.e. S− |ψsub i = 0, but still have a
finite spin population that remains trapped.
In Fig. 6(d) we also show the prediction for hSz i(t) obtained from mean-field theory. While mean-field theory
still predicts very accurately the initial oscillations and
the overall increase of the populations, the solution exhibits large, weakly-damped oscillations that are a clear
artefact of this approximation. Note that the mean-field
contribution to d~si |deph is the same for local and collective dephasing. Thus, a mean-field simulation cannot
distinguish between spatially correlated and uncorrelated
noise, a difference that is manifested only in the stochastic noise terms.
In summary, the simulation of this driven Dicke model
demonstrates the applicability of the DDTWA for simulating cavity QED systems with large ensembles of twolevel systems. In particular, the example presented in
Fig. 6(d) shows that this method captures very accurately both the collective coupling to the maximal angular momentum states as well as the physics associated
with subradiant states.

LARGE-SCALE SIMULATIONS

In the previous section we have focused on examples
and parameter regimes where a comparison with other
exact methods was still possible. However, the main advantage of the DDTWA is that it can be easily scaled
up and applied in many experimentally relevant situations, where exact methods are no longer available. To
illustrate this point, we consider in this section the superradiant decay of a large ensemble of interacting twolevel atoms inside a lossy cavity. An old question in connection to superradiance is, how dipole-dipole interactions in dense atomic ensembles affect the decay process
by inducing transitions out of the fully symmetric subspace [73]. In real experiments, similar effects can also
arise from local dephasing and a relevant follow-up question is, if interaction effects can actually be distinguished
from fluctuating or static frequency inhomogeneities. As
we show in the following, the DDTWA can be used to answer these and related questions through direct numerical
simulations.
To do so we consider the same master equation as in
Sec. IV B,

Here the first and the second term represent the collective atom-cavity coupling and the short-range spin-spin

interactions with Jij
= Jx |~ri − ~rj |−3 , respectively. The
last term accounts for an inhomogeneous broadening of
the atomic transition frequency, where the ωi are randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with variance
σ 2 and zero mean.
The model defined in Eq. (44) and Eq. (45) can now be
used to investigate, for example, how superradiant decay
is influenced by (i) short-range interactions, (ii) Markovian dephasing and (iii) static inhomogeneous broadening. To do so we consider in Fig. 7 a system of N ≈ 105
atoms arranged on a cubic lattice and initially prepared
in the excited state. We then use the DDTWA method
to simulate the consecutive decay dynamics under the
influence of those three processes. For these simulations we have assumed α = 3, but all interactions with
xx
|Jij
|/Jx < 0.01 have been set to zero. For the frequency
distribution we have chosen a variance of σ 2 = 2Γ2φ ,
such that the inhomogeneous broadening and the Markovian dephasing lead to a loss of coherence over a similar
timescale. The plots in Fig. 7 show that while all three
mechanisms lead to a strong inhibition of the decay, the
actual decay dynamics of the atomic population and the
emitted photons is both qualitatively and quantitatively
very different.

In (a) we show the decay of the total spin population and
in (b) the photon number ha† ai ∼ Iph (t), which is proportional to the emitted field intensity. In both plots we compare the evolution of the bare non-interacting ensemble (blue
line), with dynamics in the presence of additional Ising interactions ∼ σix σjx , with Jx /g = 0.025 and α = 3 (purple line).
The other two cases show the dynamics of an noninteracting
ensemble, but in the presence of local Markovian dephasing
with a rate Γφ /g = 0.5 (red line) and for an inhomogeneously
broadened ensemble (yellow line). In the latter case the spin
frequencies ωi have been randomly draw from a normal distribution with zero mean and a variance of σ 2 = 2Γ2φ . To
obtain this data nt = 64 trajectories were simulated.

While a more detailed investigation of this system is
beyond the scope of this work, these basic results already show how the DDTWA can be used to simulate
interesting dynamical effects in large-scale spin systems
under experimentally realistic conditions. Note that for
the plots in Fig. 7 we have simulated about N = 105
atoms coupled to a cavity mode, which itself becomes
populated with many thousands of photons. These simulations can be performed on a regular PC in about a
day of computation time and with some additional programming efforts and the use of a supercomputer the
simulation of millions of spins becomes possible.
Such system sizes are far beyond the typical atom numbers of about N ≈ 150 [49] that can be treated in exact
simulations of similar models by exploiting permutation
symmetry and using quantum trajectories. Moreover,
both the short-range interactions as well as the inhomogeneous frequency distribution break the permutational
invariance of the system such that the current type of
simulations are simply not accessible with such exact numerical techniques. At the same time, since during the
whole evolution hσix i = hσiy i = 0, neither the initial decay
nor the effect of transverse spin-spin interactions would
be captured by a simulation of the mean-field equations of
motion only. Higher-order approximation schemes based
on a cumulant expansion of correlation functions, which
can account for such effects, already scale as N 2 and are

10
thus no longer applicable for the considered system sizes.
Note that cumulant expansion techniques also often exhibit numerical instabilities, which do not occur in the
DDTWA approach.

VI.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have presented a simple and efficient
numerical algorithm for simulating large spin ensembles
and cavity-QED systems in the presence of realistic decoherence processes. Using the DTWA for coherent systems
as a starting point, we have shown that both dephasing
and decay can be included in these simulations in terms
of a stochastic evolution of the classical spin variables.
Thereby it is possible to account for damping and loss of
coherence while still preserving the total length of each
classical spin on average. This last feature ensures that
the magnitude of spin-spin interactions is not reduced
and that the accuracy of the DTWA is not degraded.
We have demonstrated the application of this method
for various show cases, where a direct benchmarking with
exact simulations is still possible. However, due to the

linear scaling of the simulation time with the number
of spins, the same results can be readily obtained for
systems with many thousands or even millions of spins,
which we have illustrated for the example of superradiant decay. In such situations there are no exact numerical methods, but the DDTWA still allows us to make
accurate predictions about fluctuations, correlations and
spin-squeezing effects, as relevant for many cavity QED
and spin ensemble experiments.
Note added. During completion of the manuscript, we
became aware of a related work investigating the DTWA
in open systems [74].
