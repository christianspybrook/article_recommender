Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual
enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can
develop. The analysis based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered system.

Molecular machines, such as molecular motors, ion
pumps and some enzymes, play a fundamental role in
biological cells and can be also used in the emerging softmatter nanotechnology [1]. A protein machine is a cyclic
device, where each cycle consists of conformational motions initiated by binding of an energy-bringing ligand
[2, 3]. In motors, such internal motions generate mechanical work [4], while in enzymes they enable or facilitate chemical reaction events (see, e.g., [5, 6]). Much
attention has been attracted to studies of biomembranes
with ion pumps and molecular motors, where membrane
instabilities and synchronization effects have been analyzed [7, 8, 9]. Here, a different class of distributed active molecular systems - formed by enzymes - is considered. The catalytic activity of an allosteric enzyme
protein is activated or inhibited by binding of small regulatory molecules; the role of such regulatory molecules
can be played by products of the same reaction [10]. Previous investigations of simple product-regulated enzymic
systems [11, 12] and enzymic networks [13] in small spatial volume with full diffusional mixing have shown that
spontaneous synchronization of molecular turnover cycles
can take place there. External molecular synchronization of enzymes of the photosensitive P-450 dependent
monooxygenase system by periodic optical forcing has
been experimentally demonstrated [14].
In this Letter, spatiotemporal pattern formation in enzymic arrays is investigated. In such systems, immobile
enzymes are attached to a solid planar support immersed
into a solution through which fresh substrate is supplied
and product molecules are continuously removed. Product molecules released by an enzyme diffuse through the
solution and activate catalytic turnover cycles of neighbouring enzymes in the array. We show that, at sufficiently high enzyme concentrations, diffusion-mediated
interactions can lead to spontaneous development of complex spatiotemporal patterns of enzymic activity. Both
stochastic simulations and the analysis of the mean-field
approximation of the model are undertaken. Possibilities
of experimental observation of such molecular synchronization patterns are discussed.

machine (a stochastic phase oscillator), shown in Fig. 1,
is used. Binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme i
initiates an ordered internal conformational motion, described by the conformational phase coordinate φi . The
initial state corresponds to the phase φi = 0. The catalytic conversion event takes place and the product is
released at the state φp inside the cycle. After that,
the conformational motion continues until the equilibrium state of the enzyme (φi = 1) is finally reached.
Initiation of a turnover cycle is a random event, occurring at a certain probability rate. We assume that substrate is present in abundance, and its concentration is
not affected by the reactions. The conformational motion inside the cycle is modelled as a stochastic diffusional. drift process, described by the Langevin equation φi = v + ηi (t), where v is the mean drift velocity
and ηi (t) is an internal white noise with the correlators
hηi (t)ηj (t′ )i = 2σδij δ(t − t′ ). The parameter σ specifies
the intensity of intramolecular fluctuations.
Allosterically activated enzymes possess a separate
binding site on their surface, where regulatory molecules
can become bound. Binding of a regulatory molecule
leads to a conformational change that enhances catalytic
activity of an enzyme molecule. A regulatory molecule
can bind to an enzyme with the rate constant β and
dissociate from it with the rate constant κ. Binding of
a regulatory molecule on an enzyme rises its probability to start a cycle from α0 to α1 . We assume that a

regulatory molecule can bind to an enzyme only in its
rest state and this molecule is released when the cycle is
started. The role of regulatory molecules in the considered model is played by the product molecules of the same
reaction. Immobile enzymes are randomly distributed in
space with the concentration c. Product molecules, released by enzymes, diffuse through the medium at diffusion constant D and undergo decay at the rate constant γ. The characteristic
diffusion length of product
p
molecules is ldif f = D/γ.
In our stochastic 2D simulations, the medium was discretized into spatial cells (up to 256 × 256), each containing a number of enzyme molecules. The cells were
so small that diffusional mixing of product molecules in
a cell within the shortest characteristic time of the reaction could always take place. Each enzyme was described
by the stochastic model given above; diffusion of product
molecules was modeled as a random walk over a discrete
cell lattice. The mean cycle time τ = 1/v was chosen
as the time unit in all our simulations (τ = 1). Systems including up to 655 360 enzymes were used in the
simulations.
Figure 2a,b (for respective dynamical evolutions, see
Videos 1 and 2 in ref. [15]) shows two typical examples
of stochastic 2D simulations. Here, spatial distributions
of product molecules are displayed. Waves of product
concentration are propagating through the medium. In
a peak of a wave, many locally present enzymes are simultaneously releasing product molecules. Since the product
release can take place only at a certain stage inside the
cycle, this means that the cycles of enzymes are locally
synchronized. Not only regular wave structures, such as
rotating spiral waves or target patterns (Fig. 2a), but
also complex regimes of wave turbulence (Fig. 2b) have
been observed in the simulations.
To understand and interpret stochastic simulation results, an analytical study of the system in the mean-field
approximation, which holds in the limit of high enzyme
concentrations (see the discussion below), has been performed. In this approximation, the system is characterised by three continuous variables n0 (r, t), n1 (r, t) and

m(r, t) which represent local concentrations of enzymes
in the rest state without or with regulatory molecules attached (n0 and n1 ) and local concentration of the product (m). For simplicity, internal fluctuations in enzymes
are neglected (σ = 0). Thus, all enzymes which have
started their cycles at some time t would release their
products at a definite time t + τp (with τp = φp /v) and
finish their cycles, returning to the rest state, at time
t + τ . Therefore, the system is described by a set of three
reaction-diffusion equations with time delays,
∂n1
= βmn0 − κn1 − α1 n1
(1a)
∂t
∂n0
= −βmn0 + κn1 − α0 n0 + α0 n0 (t − τ )
∂t
+α1 n1 (t − τ )
(1b)
∂m
= −βmn0 + κn1 + α1 n1 − γm + α0 n0 (t − τp )
∂t
+α1 n1 (t − τp ) + D∇2 m.
(1c)
The concentration n0 of free enzymes in the rest state
decreases because they can start their cycles or bind regulatory product molecules; it increases due to those enzymes which return to the rest state after completing
their turnover cycles and due to the enzymes in the rest
state, for which dissociation of the regulatory molecule
has occurred. The concentration n1 of enzymes in the
rest state with attached regulatory molecules decreases
because they can start their cycles or because dissociation of a regulatory molecule happens; it increases due
to free enzymes in the rest state that bind regulatory
molecules. The product concentration m decreases because products can die or bind to the enzymes; it rises
due to the release of new product molecules and dissociation of the bound products.
The system always has an uniform stationary state
with certain concentrations n0 , n1 and m, which can be
found as solutions of the respective algebraic equations.
This state corresponds to the absence of synchronization.
However, it may become unstable if allosteric activation
is strong enough. To analyze the stability, small perturbations δn0 , δn1 and δm are added to the stationary
state, the equations (1) are linearized and their solutions
are sought in the form δn0 ∼ δn1 ∼ δm ∼ exp (λq t − iqx)
with λq = μq + iωq . Thus, each spatial mode with the
wavevector q is characterized by its frequency ωq and its
rate of growth μq . The properties μq and ωq are given by
the roots of a characteristic equation which is determined
by the linearization matrix of equations (1). The steady
state becomes unstable when at least one spatial mode
with some wavenumber q0 starts to grow (μq0 > 0).
As the bifurcation parameter, coefficient β can be chosen. If regulatory molecules cannot bind to enzymes
(β = 0), feedback is absent and instabilities are not possible. On the other hand, allosteric activation becomes
strong if regulatory molecules can easily bind and, in this

case, the emergence of oscillations and wave patterns can
be expected. Our bifurcation analysis reveals that, depending on other parameters of the system, it can exhibit
either a Hopf or a wave bifurcation [16]. As a result of
the Hopf bifurcation, uniform oscillations with q = 0 develop. Because of the presence of delays in equations (1),
the characteristic equation is nonpolynomial in terms of
λ and, generally, a number of oscillatory solutions with
different frequencies ω are possible. Physically, such solutions correspond to the formation of several synchronous
enzymic groups. This effect has been previously extensively investigated for similar systems in small spatial
volumes with full diffusional mixing [11] and we shall
not further discuss it here. The most robust uniform
oscillations, which we consider, are characterized by the
frequency ω ≈ 2π/τ and correspond to the single-group
synchronization. As the result of a wave bifurcation (also
known as the Hopf bifurcation with a finite wave number
[17]), the first unstable modes are traveling waves with
a certain wavenumber q0 . Figure 3 shows the computed
bifurcation diagram of the system (1) in the parameter
plane (τp , β). The bold solid line shows the boundary
of the Hopf bifurcation and the dash-dotted line displays
the boundary of the wave bifurcation; the steady state is
unstable above these curves. It is important to note that
the curves merge at a certain point, where a codimension2 Hopf-wave bifurcation takes place.
To investigate nonlinear dynamics of the system, numerical simulations of equations (1) have been performed
[16]. Explicit Euler integration method has been used;
no-flux boundary conditions were applied. Results of 1D

simulations are summarized in Fig. 3 and examples of
typical observed patterns are shown in Fig. 4. Standing waves (Fig. 4a) develop when the boundary of the
wave bifurcation (dash-dotted curve) is crossed and uniform oscillations are observed above the boundary of the
Hopf bifurcation. Near the codimension-2 point, more
complex behavior was found. This included rippled oscillations (Fig. 4b), self-organized pacemakers (Fig. 4c)
and modulated traveling waves (Fig. 4d). The observed
patterns are similar to those previously found in reactiondiffusion systems with the wave bifurcation [18]. In the
right upper corner of the diagram in Fig. 3, higher frequency oscillations with several synchronous groups take
place.
Two-dimensional simulations of reaction-diffusion
equations (1) with time delay have been performed for
selected parameter values. In 2D simulations, spontaneously developing concentric waves (target patterns)
and spiral waves have been observed; target patterns
were however unstable and evolved into pairs of rotating spiral waves (Fig. 2c and Video 3 [15]). Complex
wave regimes, which can be qualitatively characterized
as turbulence of standing waves, have also been observed
(Fig. 2d and Video 4 [15]).
The mean-field approximation is based on neglecting statistical fluctuations in concentrations of reacting
species [11] and, therefore, it should hold in the high concentration limit. In Fig. 4, two upper panel rows display
spatiotemporal patterns, which are observed in stochastic simulations with the parameter values corresponding

4
to the respective mean-field simulations. To compare
mean-field simulations with different enzyme densities,
the following property of equations (1) can be used: introducing relative concentrations n
e0 = n0 /c, n
e1 = n1 /c
and m
e = m/c, it can be noticed that they obey the same
equations, but with a rescaled coefficient βe = βc. Thus,
essentially the same patterns are observed as long as as
the parameter combination βc remains constant. In the
stochastic simulations in Fig. 4, the coefficient β has
been increased to compensate for a decrease in the enzyme concentration. For larger enzyme concentrations,
good agreement between the mean-field predictions and
stochastic simulations has indeed been found. In the
mean-field equations (1), intramolecular fluctuations are
not taken into account (σ = 0 and therefore each turnover
cycle has the same fixed duration τ ). Stochastic simulations have been, however, also performed when such
fluctuations were present. Synchronization waves could
still be found even at internal noise levels which corresponded to the mean relative dispersion ξ of turnover
1/2
times of about 10% (with ξ = δτ 2
/τ ≃ (2στ )1/2 ).
A product molecule, released by an enzyme, diffuses
in the solution until it either binds, as a regulatory
molecule, to another enzyme or undergoes a decay. Here,
it should be taken into account that a regulatory molecule
can bind to an allosteric enzyme only at a certain binding site of characteristic radius R. Using the theory of
diffusion-controlled reactions, the average time ttransit
after which a regulatory product would find a binding
site of one of the enzymes can be roughly estimated
[11] as ttransit = 1/cDR, if enzymes are uniformly distributed inside the reaction volume with concentration
c. Therefore, binding typically occurs within the dis1/2
−1/2
tance Lcorr = (Dttransit )
= (cR)
from the point
where a molecule is released. Obviously, it can only
take place if the product molecule has not undergone
decay until that moment, i.e. if γttransit < 1. This
condition puts a restriction on the enzyme concentration
c, which must be higher than the critical concentration
c∗ = γ/DR. Choosing γ = 103 s−1 , D = 10−5 cm2 s−1
and R = 10−7 cm, the critical enzyme concentration is
c∗ = 1015 cm−3 = 10−6 M. A similar estimate can be
obtained when enzymes are immobilized on a plane immersed into a reactive solution; in this case the mean distance between the enzymes on the plane should be less
than lc = (Rldif f )1/2 . Although the required enzyme
concentrations are relatively large, they are within the
range characteristic for biological cells (e.g., glycolytic
enzymes are present [19] in a cell at even higher concentration of more than 10−5 M). The characteristic temporal period of the developing patterns is determined by
the enzyme turnover time τ , which typically varies from
milliseconds to seconds. The characteristic length scale
of the developing wave patterns is determined by the diffusion length ldif f , which can vary under these conditions

from a fraction of a micrometer to tens of micrometers.
Our analysis shows that spontaneous molecular synchronization of allosteric product-activated enzymes can
be observed in enzymic arrays. Similar phenomena are
possible in dense enzyme solutions and can take place in
biological cells. In the study by Petty et al. [20], traveling
waves of NAD(P)H and proton concentrations with the
wavelength of about a micrometer were observed inside
neutrophil cells. These metabolic waves had the temporal
period of about 300 ms, which is by two orders of magnitude shorter than the characteristic period of glycolytic
oscillations in the cells and lies closer to the time scales
of turnover cycles of individual enzymes. An intriguing
question, requiring further detailed analysis, is whether
molecular synchronization waves may have already been
seen in these experiments.
