Abstract
Let H be a digraph possibly with loops and D a digraph without loops whose arcs are colored with
the vertices of H (D is said to be an H−colored digraph). If W = (x0 , . . . , xn ) is an open walk in D and
i ∈ {1, . . . , n−1}, we say that there is an obstruction on xi whenever (color(xi−1 , xi ), color(xi , xi+1 )) ∈
/ A(H).
A (k, l, H)-kernel by walks in an H-colored digraph D (k ≥ 2, l ≥ 1), is a subset S of vertices of D, such
that, for every pair of different vertices in S, every walk between them has at least k − 1 obstructions, and
for every x ∈ V (D) \ S there exists an xS-walk with at most l − 1 obstructions. This concept generalize
the concepts of kernel, (k, l)-kernel, kernel by monochromatic paths, and kernel by H-walks. If D is an Hcolored digraph, an H-class partition is a partition F of A(D) such that, for every {(u, v), (v, w)} ⊆ A(D),
(color(u, v), color(v, w)) ∈ A(H) iff there exists F in F such that {(u, v), (v, w)} ⊆ F . The H-class digraph
relative to F , denoted by CF (D), is the digraph such that V (CF (D)) = F , and (F, G) ∈ A(CF (D)) iff
there exist (u, v) ∈ F and (v, w) ∈ G with {u, v, w} ⊆ V (D).
We will show sufficient conditions on F and CF (D) to guarantee the existence of (k, l, H)-kernels by
walks in H-colored digraphs, and we will show that some conditions are tight. For instance, we will show
that if an H-colored digraph D has an H-class partition in which every class induces a strongly connected
digraph, and has a obstruction-free vertex, then for every k ≥ 2, D has a (k, k − 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Despite finding (k, l)-kernels is a N P -complete problem, some hypothesis presented in this paper can be
verified in polynomial time.

Introduction.

For terminology and notation not defined here, we refer the reader to [3]. If D is a digraph and x ∈ V (D),
we denote by A+ (x) the set {(x, v) ∈ A(D) : v ∈ V (D)}, A− (x) the set {(u, x) ∈ A(D) : u ∈ V (D)}, and
A(x) = A− (x) ∪ A+ (x). If D is a digraph without loops, a sink is a vertex x such that A+ (x) = ∅. If H is a
digraph possibly with loops, a sink is a vertex x such that A+ (x) ⊆ {(x, x)}. If S1 and S2 is a subsets of V (D),
we denote by N + (S1 ) the proper out-neighbor of S1 . In this paper we write walk, path and cycle, instead of
directed walk, directed path, and directed cycle, respectively. If W = (x0 , . . . , xn ) is a walk (path), we say that
W is an x0 xn -walk (x0 xn -path). The length of W is the number n and it is denoted by l(W ). If T1 = (z0 , . . . , zn )
and T2 = (w0 , . . . , wm ) are walks and zn = w0 , we denote by T1 ∪ T2 the walk (z0 , . . . , zn = w0 , . . . , wm ). If x
belongs to a walk W , we denote by x+ (respectively x− ) the successor (respectively predecessor) of x in W .
If S1 and S2 are two disjoint subsets of V (D), a uv-walk in D is called an S1 S2 -walk whenever u ∈ S1 and
v ∈ S2 . If S1 = {x} or S2 = {x}, then we write xS2 -walk or S1 x-walk, respectively. For a nonempty subset
F ⊆ A(D) the subdigraph arc-induced by F is denoted by DhF i.
The concept of kernel was introduced by von Neumann and Morgenstern in [23] as a subset S of vertices
of a digraph D, such that for every pair of different vertices in S, there is no arc between them, and every
vertex not in S has at least one out-neighbor in S. This concept has been deeply and widely studied by several
authors due to a large amount of theoretical and practical applications, by example [7], [9], [10] and [11]. In
[6] Chvátal showed that deciding if a digraph has a kernel is an NP-complete problem, and a classical result
proved by König [19] shows that every transitive digraph has a kernel.
The concept of kernel has been generalized over the years. A subset S of vertices of D is said to be a
kernel by paths, if for every x ∈ V (D) \ S, there exists an xS-path (that is, S is absorbent by paths) and, for
every pair of different vertices {u, v} ⊆ S, there is no uv-path in D (that is, S is independent by paths). This
concept was introduced by Berge in [5], and it is a well known result that every digraph has a kernel by paths
[5] (see Corollary 2 on p. 311). The concept of (k, l)-kernel was introduced by Borowiecki and Kwaśnik in [21]
as follows: If k ≥ 2, a subset S of vertices of a digraph D is a k-independent set, if for every pair of different
vertices in S, every walk between them has length at least k. If l ≥ 1, we say that S is an l-absorbent set if
for every x ∈ V (D) \ S there exists an xS-walk with length at most l. If k ≥ 2 and l ≥ 1, a (k, l)-kernel is a
subset of V (D) which is k-independent and l-absorbent. If l = k − 1, the (k, l)-kernel is called a k-kernel. Notice
that every 2-kernel is a kernel. Several sufficient conditions for the existence of k-kernels have been proved, as
example see [14], [15] and [20]. In [14] the authors proved the following theorem:
Theorem 1.1. [14] If D is a symmetric digraph, then D has a k-kernel for every k ≥ 2. Moreover, every
maximal k-independent set in D is a k-kernel.

A digraph is m-colored if its arcs are colored with m colors. If D is an m-colored digraph, a path in D is
called monochromatic (respectively, alternating) if all of its arcs are colored alike (respectively, consecutive arcs
have different color). A subset S of vertices of D is a kernel by monochromatic paths (respectively, kernel by
alternating walks) if for every x ∈ V (D) \ S there exists a monochromatic xS-path (respectively an alternating
xS-walk), and no two different vertices in S are connected by a monochromatic path (respectively, by an
alternating walk). Notice that a digraph D has a kernel if an only if the m-colored digraph D, in which every
two different arcs have different colors, has a kernel by monochromatic paths. The existence of kernels by
monochromatic paths in m-colored digraphs was studied primarily by Sands, Sauer and Woodrow in [25]. It
is worth mentioning that Galeana-Sánchez introduced the concept of kernel by monochromatic paths in [13].
Due to the difficulty of finding kernels by monochromatic paths in m-colored digraphs, in [12] Galeana-Sánchez
studied the color changes in an m-colored digraph, in order to obtain conditions for the existence of kernels by
monochromatic paths. As a consequence, she defined the color-class digraph of an m-colored digraph, denoted
by C (D), as the digraph whose set of vertices are the colors represented in the arcs of D, and (c1 , c2 ) is an
arc in C (D) if and only if there exist two arcs of D, namely (u, v) and (v, w), such that (u, v) has color c1 and
(v, w) has color c2 .
Let H be a digraph possibly with loops, and D a digraph without loops whose arcs are colored with the
vertices of H (D is said to be an H−colored digraph). For an arc (x, z) of D, we denote by ρ(x, z) its color.
A vertex x ∈ V (D) is obstruction-free in D if (ρ(a), ρ(b)) ∈ A(H) whenever a ∈ A− (x) and b ∈ A+ (x). We
say that a subdigraph D0 of D is an H-digraph, if for every two arcs (u, v) and (v, w) in D0 we have that
(ρ(u, v), ρ(v, w)) ∈ A(H). A directed walk (path) in D, say W = (x0 , . . . , xn ), is an H-walk (H-path), whenever
the consecutive colors encountered on W form a directed walk in H. In [22] Linek and Sands introduced the
concept of H-walk and their work was later considered by several authors, as example, [2], [8], [16] and [24]. A
subset S of vertices of D is absorbent by H-paths (absorbent by H-walks), if for every x ∈ V (D) \ S there exists
an xS-H-path (xS-H-walk); and S is said to be independent by H-paths (independent by H-walks), if for every
pair of different vertices {u, v} ⊆ S, there is no uv-H-path (uv-H-walk) between them. A kernel by H−paths,
or simply H-kernel (respectively kernel by H-walks), is a subset of vertices of D that is both absorbent by
H-paths and independent by H-paths (respectively, absorbent by H-walks and independent by H-walks).
If D is an H-colored digraph, an H-class partition of A(D) is a partition of A(D), say F , such that for every
{(u, v), (v, w)} ⊆ A(D), (ρ(u, v), ρ(v, w)) ∈ A(H) if and only if there exists F in F such that {(u, v), (v, w)} ⊆ F .

+
If x ∈ V (D), we define NF
(x) = {F ∈ F : (u, x) ∈ F for some u ∈ V (D)}, NF
(x) = {F ∈ F : (x, v) ∈ F for
+
−
some v ∈ V (D)}, and NF (x) = NF (x) ∪ NF (x). If F is an H-class partition of A(D), the H-class digraph
relative to F , denoted by CF (D), is the digraph such that V (CF (D)) = F , and (Fi , Fj ) is an arc in CF (D),
if and only if there exist (u, v) ∈ Fi and (v, w) ∈ Fj for some {u, v, w} ⊆ V (D). Notice that CF (D) can allow
loops. Moreover, C (D) is a particular case of CF (D) when H has only loops, every vertex in H has a loop and
every class in F consist in those arcs colored alike. An H-class partition F is walk-preservative if for every
(F, G) ∈ A(CF (D)) and z ∈ V (DhF i), there exists a zw-path in DhF i for some w ∈ V (DhGi). Notice that
w ∈ V (DhF i) ∩ V (DhGi).
If W = (x0 , . . . , xn ) is a walk in an H-colored digraph D and i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, we say that there is an
obstruction on xi iff (ρ(xi−1 , xi ), ρ(xi , xi+1 )) ∈
/ A(H) (indices are taken modulo n if x0 = xn ). We denote by
OH (W ) the set {i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} : there is an obstruction on xi }. The H-length of W , denoted by lH (W ), is
defined as lH (W ) = |OH (W )| + 1 if W is open, or lH (W ) = |OH (W )| otherwise. The H-length was primarily
studied by Galeana-Sánchez and Sánchez-López in [16] for closed walks, and by Andenmatten, Galeana-Sáchez
and Pach in [1] for open paths. Clearly, the usual length l(W ) coincides with the H-length lH (W ), in the very
particular case when A(H) = ∅. An open walk in an H-colored digraph is an H-walk if and only if it has
H-length 1.
It is worth mentioning that in [1], the authors defined the H-length for H-colored graphs and H-colored
digraphs. A particular kind of H-coloring in graphs was studied by Szeider in [26] and, as a consequence, in [1]
was proved that under the assumption P 6= N P , finding uv-paths of minimum H-length in H-colored graphs
(H-colored digraphs) has no polynomial solution (although there is a polynomial algorithm to find uv-paths of
minimum H-length for some H [1]).
Let D be an H-colored digraph and S a subset of vertices of D. If l ≥ 1, we say that S is an (l, H)-absorbent
set by paths (respectively, (l, H)-absorbent set by walks), if for every vertex v ∈ V (D) \ S there exists a vS-path
(respectively, vS-walk) whose H-length is at most l. If k ≥ 2, we say that S is a (k, H)-independent set by
paths (respectively, (k, H)-independent set by walks), if for every pair of different vertices in S, every path
(respectively, walk) between them has H-length at least k. If k ≥ 2 and l ≥ l, we say that S is a (k, l, H)-kernel
by paths (respectively, (k, l, H)-kernel by walks) if it is both (k, H)-independent by paths and (l, H)-absorbent
by paths (respectively, (k, H)-independent by walks and (l, H)-absorbent by walks). If l = k − 1, a (k, l, H)kernel by paths is called a (k, H)-kernel by paths (respectively, (k, H)−kernel by walks). It is straightforward
to see that every kernel by H-paths (respectively, kernel by H-walks) is a (2, H)-kernel by paths (respectively,
(2, H)−kernel by walks), and every (k, l)-kernel is a (k, l, H)-kernel by paths and a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks
in D, if H has no arcs nor loops. Since finding (k, l)-kernels in digraphs is a N P -complete problem, finding
2

(k, l, H)-kernels in H-colored digraphs is a N P -complete problem.
On the other hand, the concepts of (k, l, H)-kernel by paths and (k, l, H)-kernel by walks are not equivalent.
In [4], the authors showed an infinite family of digraphs with (2, H)-kernel by walks and no (2, H)-kernel by
paths, and an infinite family of digraphs with (2, H)-kernel by paths and no (2, H)-kernel by walks.
In [18] the authors showed that, by applying conditions on CF (D), it is possible to guarantee the existence
of (k, H)-kernels by walks and (k, H)-kernels by paths in D. In the same spirit, in this paper we will show
sufficient conditions on F and CF (D) in order to guarantee the existence of (k, l, H)-kernels by walks in Hcolored digraphs, and we will show that some conditions are tight. Moreover, some hypothesis presented in this
paper can be verified in polynomial time.

Preliminary results.

Lemma 2.1. Let D be a symmetric digraph and {k, l} ⊆ N. If 2 ≤ k and k − 1 ≤ l, then D has a (k, l)-kernel.
Proof. It follows from Theorem 2.1 and the definition of (k, l)-kernel.
Lemma 2.2. Let D be an H-colored digraph, F an H-class partition of A(D) and x ∈ V (D). The following
assertions holds:
−
+
a) If d− (x) 6= 0 and d+ (x) 6= 0, then for every F1 ∈ NF
(x) and F2 ∈ NF
(x), we have that (F1 , F2 ) ∈ A(CF (D)).

b) If x is obstruction-free in D and d(x) 6= 0, then there is a unique F ∈ F such that x ∈ V (DhF i).
c) If T is a walk in D such that OH (T ) = ∅, then there is a unique F ∈ F such that A(T ) ⊆ F .
d) If u, v and w are three different vertices in D, T is a uv−walk, and T 0 is a vw-H-walk, then either lH (T ∪
T 0 ) = lH (T ) or lH (T ∪ T 0 ) = lH (T ) + 1.
−
+
Proof. a) If F1 ∈ NF
(x) and F2 ∈ NF
(x), then there exists {u, v} ⊆ V (D) such that (u, x) ∈ F1 and (x, v) ∈ F2 .
It follows from definition of CF (D) that (F1 , F2 ) ∈ A(CF (D)).

b) Since d(x) 6= 0, then there exists F ∈ F such that x ∈ V (DhF i). On the other hand, since x is obstructionfree, we have that A(x) ⊆ F , concluding that F is unique.
c) If T = (x0 , . . . , xn ), then (ρ(xi−1 , xi ), ρ(xi , xi+1 )) ∈ A(H) for every i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} (indices modulo n if
x0 = xn ). Hence, it follows from definition of H-class partition that there is a unique F ∈ F such that
A(T ) ⊆ F .
d) Suppose that T = (z0 = u, z1 , . . . , zn = v) and T 0 = (zn = v, zn+1 , . . . , zm = w). It is straightforward to see
that OH (T ∪ T 0 ) ⊆ OH (T ) ∪ {n} and OH (T ) ⊆ OH (T ∪ T 0 ), which implies that either lH (T ∪ T 0 ) = lH (T )
or lH (T ∪ T 0 ) = lH (T ) + 1.
Lemma 2.3. If D is a digraph with no isolated vertices and K is a kernel by paths in D, then for every x ∈ K,
d−
D (x) 6= 0.
Proof. Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that there exists x ∈ K such that d−
D (x) = 0. Since D has no
isolated vertices, then there exists y ∈ V (D) such that (x, y) ∈ A(D), which implies that y ∈
/ K. Hence, there
exits a yz-path in D, say P , such that z ∈ K. Since d−
(x)
=
0,
we
have
that
z
=
6
x,
which
implies
that (x, y)∪P
D
is an xz-path in D with {x, z} ⊆ K, contradicting the independence by paths of K. Therefore, d−
D (x) 6= 0.
Lemma 2.4. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D). If S is a nonempty subset
−
of F and K is a kernel by paths in Dh∪F ∈S F i, then for every x ∈ K, NF
(x) ∩ S =
6 ∅.
Proof. Let K be a kernel by paths in D0 = Dh∪F ∈S F i and x ∈ K. By Lemma 2.3 we have that d−
D 0 (x) 6= 0.
Hence, there exists z ∈ V (D0 ) such that (z, x) ∈ A(D0 ). It follows from definition of D0 that (z, x) ∈ F for some
−
−
F ∈ S, which implies that F ∈ NF
(x) ∩ S. Hence, NF
(x) ∩ S =
6 ∅.
Lemma 2.5. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D). If S is an independent set
in CF (D), then Dh∪F ∈S F i is an H-subdigraph of D.
Proof. Let D0 = Dh∪F ∈S F i and {(u, v), (v, x)} ⊆ A(D0 ). We will prove that (ρ(u, v), ρ(v, x)) ∈ A(H). By
definition of D0 , there exists {F, G} ⊆ S such that (u, v) ∈ F and (v, x) ∈ G. Hence, we have that (F, G) ∈
A(CF (D)). Since S is an independent set in CF (D), then F = G, which implies that {(u, v), (v, x)} ⊆ F . It
follows from the fact that F is an H-class partition of A(D) that (ρ(u, v), ρ(v, x)) ∈ A(H). Therefore, D0 is an
H-subdigraph of D.

Lemma 2.6. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D). If D is strongly connected,
then CF (D) is strongly connected.
Proof. Let F and F 0 be different vertices in CF (D), and {(x0 , x1 ), (z0 , z1 )} ⊆ A(D) such that (x0 , x1 ) ∈ F and
(z0 , z1 ) ∈ F 0 . It follows from the fact that D is strongly connected, that there exists an x0 z1 -walk in D, say
C = (w0 , . . . , wn ), whose initial arc is (x0 , x1 ) and ending arc is (z0 , z1 )..
Since (w0 , w1 ) ∈ F , (wn−1 , wn ) ∈ F 0 , and F 6= F 0 , we can conclude that OH (C) 6= ∅ (Lemma 2.2) (c)). Let
OH (C) = {α1 , . . . , αr } for some r ≥ 1, and we can assume that αi ≤ αi+1 whenever i ∈ {1, . . . , r − 1}. For
every i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, let Gi ∈ F such that (wαi , wα+i ) ∈ Gi . Notice that P = (G1 , . . . , Gr ) is a walk in CF (D),
and Gr = F 0 .
If α1 = 0, then F = G1 , which implies that P is an F F 0 -walk in CF (D). If α1 6= 0, then (F, G1 ) ∈
A(CF (D)), which implies that (F, G1 ) ∪ P is an F F 0 -walk in CF (D). Hence, we conclude that CF (D) is
strongly connected.
Corollary 2.7. Let D be a strongly connected H-colored digraph and F a non-trivial H-class partition of
A(D). If S is an independent set in CF (D), then NC+F (D) (S) 6= ∅.
Proof. Since CF (D) is non-trivial and strongly connected (Lemma 2.6), then S =
6 V (CF (D)). As CF (D) is
strongly connected, there exists an arc from S to V (CF (D)) \ S, which implies that NC+F (D) (S) 6= ∅.
Lemma 2.8. Let D be an H-colored digraph, F an H-class partition of A(D), S a non-empty subset of
V (CF (D)) such that DhF i is unilateral for every F ∈ S, K a kernel by walks in Dh∪F ∈S F i, and {x, z} ⊆ K.
If x ∈ V (DhF1 i) and z ∈ V (DhF2 i) for some {F1 , F2 } ⊆ S, then F1 6= F2 .
Proof. Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that F1 = F2 . Since DhF1 i is unilateral, then either there exists
an xz-path in DhF1 i or there exists a zx-path in DhF1 i, say P . It follows that P is a path in Dh∪F ∈S F i such
that {x, z} ⊆ K, which contradicts the independence by paths of K. Therefore, F1 6= F2 .
Lemma 2.9. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D) such that for every F ∈ F ,
DhF i is strongly connected. The following assertions holds:
a) F is walk-preservative.
b) CF (D) is a symmetric digraph.
c) If S ⊆ V (CF (D)) is an independent set in CF (D) and {F1 , F2 } ⊆ S, then V (DhF1 i) ∩ V (DhF2 i) = ∅.
Proof. a) Let (F, G) ∈ A(CF (D)) and x ∈ V (DhF i). It follows from definition of CF (D) that there exists
{u, v, z} ⊆ V (D) such that (u, v) ∈ F and (v, z) ∈ G. Notice that v ∈ V (DhF i) ∩ V (DhGi). Since DhF i is
strongly connected, then there exists an xv-walk in DhF i, which implies that F is walk-preservative.
b) Let (F1 , F2 ) ∈ A(CF (D)). It follows from definition of CF (D) that there exists {u, v, z} ⊆ V (D) such
that (u, v) ∈ F1 and (v, z) ∈ F2 . Since (u, v) ∈ A(DhF1 i), then DhF1 i is a nontrivial strongly connected
digraph, which implies that there exists u0 ∈ V (DhF1 i) such that (v, u0 ) ∈ F1 . In the same way, there exists
z 0 ∈ V (DhF2 i) such that (z 0 , v) ∈ F2 . It follows from definition of CF (D) that (F2 , F1 ) ∈ A(CF (D)), concluding
that CF (D) is a symmetric digraph.
c) Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that V (DhF1 i) ∩ V (DhF2 i) 6= ∅, and consider x ∈ V (DhF1 i) ∩
V (DhF2 i). Since DhF1 i and DhF2 i are non-trivial strongly connected digraphs, then there exist u ∈ V (DhF1 i)
and z ∈ V (DhF2 i) such that (u, x) ∈ A(DhF1 i) and (x, z) ∈ A(DhF2 i). It follows from definition of CF (D) that
(F1 , F2 ) ∈ A(CF (D)), which is no possible since S is an independent set in CF (D). Therefore, V (DhF1 i) ∩
V (DhF2 i) = ∅.
Proposition 2.10. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F a non-trivial walk-preservative H-class partition of
A(D) such that CF (D) has no sinks. If S is an independent set in CF (D), then there exists a kernel by paths
in Dh∪F ∈S F i, say N , such that N ⊆ V (Dh∪G∈N + (S) Gi).
Proof. We will denote by D1 the digraph Dh∪F ∈S F i. Since CF (D) has no sinks, then N + (S) 6= ∅. Hence,
denote by D2 the digraph Dh∪G∈N + (S) Gi. Let N be a kernel by paths in D1 intersecting V (D2 ) the most
possible, that is, for every kernel by paths in D1 , say N 0 , we have that
|N \ V (D2 )| ≤ |N 0 \ V (D2 )|

(1)

Notice that possibly N ∩ V (D2 ) = ∅. We claim that N \ V (D2 ) = ∅. Proceeding by contradiction, suppose
that there exists x0 ∈ N \ V (D2 ). Since x0 ∈ V (D1 ), it follows from definition of D1 that there exists F ∈ S
such that x0 ∈ V (DhF i). By hypothesis, CF (D) has no sinks, which implies that there exists G ∈ V (CF (D))
such that F 6= G and (F, G) ∈ A(CF (D)). It follows from the fact that F is a walk-preservative H-class
4

partition that there exists an x0 z-path in DhF i, say C, for some z ∈ V (DhGi). Notice that C is a path in D1 ,
z ∈ V (D1 ) ∩ V (D2 ), and z 6= x0 . Moreover, since N is independent by paths in D1 , then z ∈
/ N . We will prove
the following claims in order to get a contradiction.
Claim 1. There exists a zx0 -path in D1 .
Since z ∈
/ N , there exists a zy-path in D1 for some y ∈ N , say P 0 . It follows that C ∪ P 0 is an x0 y-walk
in D1 such that x0 ∈ N and y ∈ N , which implies that x0 = y, concluding that P 0 is a zx0 -path in D1 .
Claim 2. (N \ {x0 }) ∪ {z} is a kernel by paths in D1 .
In order to show that N 0 = (N \ {x0 }) ∪ {z} is an absorbent set by paths in D1 , consider u ∈ V (D1 ) \ N 0 .
If u = x0 , then C is an x0 N 0 -path in D1 . If u 6= x0 , then u ∈ V (D1 ) \ N . It follows from the fact that N is
an absorbent set by paths in D1 that there exists a uv-path in D1 , say P , for some v ∈ N . If v 6= x0 , then
P is a uN 0 -path in D1 . If v = x0 , then P ∪ C is a uN 0 -walk in D1 , concluding that N 0 is an absorbent
set by paths in D1 .
Now we will show that N 0 is an independent set by paths in D1 . Proceeding by contradiction, suppose
that there exists a uv-path in D1 , say T , where {u, v} ⊆ N 0 . Since N is an independent set by paths in D1 ,
then z ∈ {u, v}. If z = u, it follows that C ∪ T is an x0 v-walk in D1 , which contradicts the independence
by paths of N . If v = z, by Claim 1 there exists a zx0 -path in D1 , say P , which implies that T ∪ P is a
ux0 -walk in D1 , contradicting the independence by paths of N . Therefore, N 0 is an independent set by
paths in D1 , and the claim holds.
Notice that |N 0 \V (D2 )| = |N \V (D2 )|−1, which is no possible by (1). Therefore, N \V (D2 ) = ∅, concluding
that N ⊆ V (D2 ).
Proposition 2.11. Let D be an H-colored digraph with no isolated vertices, F a walk-preservative H-class
partition of A(D), and S an independent and l-absorbent set in CF (D) for some l ≥ 1. If K is a kernel by
paths in Dh∪F ∈S F i, then K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by walks in D.
Proof. Let D0 = Dh∪F ∈S F i and x0 ∈ V (D) \ K. If x0 ∈ V (D0 ), since K is a kernel by paths in D0 , there exists
an x0 K-path in D0 , say T . It follows from Lemma 2.5 that T is an H-path. Hence, lH (T ) = 1, which implies
that lH (T ) ≤ l + 1.
Now we will assume that x0 ∈
/ V (D0 ). By hypothesis, x0 is no isolated, which implies that x0 ∈ V (DhF0 i)
for some F0 ∈ F . Notice that F0 ∈
/ S because x0 ∈
/ V (D0 ). Since S is an l-absorbent set in CF (D), we can
consider an F0 Ft -path with minimum length in CF (D), say T = (F0 , . . . , Fr ), where Fr ∈ S. Notice that r ≤ l.
Since F is walk-preservative, there exists xα1 ∈ V (DhF0 i) ∩ V (DhF1 i) such that there exists an x0 xα1 path in DhF0 i, say T0 , and, for every i ∈ {2, . . . , r − 1}, there exist xαi ∈ V (DhFi−1 i) ∩ V (DhFi i) and
xαi+1 ∈ V (DhFi i) ∩ V (DhFi+1 i), such that there exists an xαi xαi+1 -path in DhFi i, say Ti . Notice that Ti
is an H-path for every i ∈ {0, . . . , r − 1}, and xαr ∈ V (D0 ). Moreover, since C is a path in CF (D), then
A(Ti ) ∩ A(Tj ) = ∅ whenever i 6= j.
0
Now we consider C = ∪r−1
i=0 Ti , and suppose that C = (z1 , . . . , zn ). Notice that zn ∈ V (D ) (because
zn = xαr ).
Claim 1. lH (C) ≤ l + 1.
For every i ∈ {0, . . . , r − 2}, let Ui = {l ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} : (zl−1 , zl ) ∈ Fi } be, and L = {i ∈ {0, . . . , r − 2} :
Ui 6= ∅}. For every i ∈ L, define βi = maxUi .
We will show that OH (C) ⊆ {βi : i ∈ L}. If m ∈ OH (C), then it follows that (ρ(zm−1 , zm ), ρ(zm , zm+1 )) ∈
/
A(H). On the other hand, we have that (zm−1 , zm ) ∈ A(Tj ) for some j ∈ {0, . . . , r − 1}. Since Tj is an
H-path, then (zm , zm+1 ) ∈
/ A(Tj ), which implies that m = maxUj and j ≤ r − 2. Hence, m ∈ {βi : i ∈ L}.
It follows that OH (C) ⊆ L. Hence, |OH (C)| ≤ |L|, that is |OH (C)| ≤ r − 1, and we can conclude that
lH (C) ≤ l.
If zn ∈ K, then by Claim 1 we have that C is a x0 K-path with lH (C) ≤ l + 1. If zt ∈
/ K, since zn ∈ V (D0 ),
0
0
and K is an absorbent set by paths in D , then there exists a zn K-path in D , say Tr . Hence, C 0 = C ∪ Tr is
an x0 K−walk in D, and by Lemma 2.2, lH (C 0 ) ≤ lH (C) + 1, which implies that lH (C 0 ) ≤ l + 1.
Therefore, K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by walks in D.
Notice that the conclusions in Proposition 2.11 are tight. We will show an example where K is not necessarily
an (r, H)-absorbent set by walks in D for some r ≤ l + 1. Consider the H-colored digraph showed in Figure
1, and for every i ∈ {1, . . . , 6} let Fi = {e ∈ A(D) : ρ(e) = ci }. Clearly, F = {Fi : i ∈ {1, . . . , 6}} is a walkpreservative H-class partition of A(D). Notice that S = {F6 } is a 3-absorbent set in CF (D). On the other
hand, it is straightforward to see that K = {x4 } is a kernel by paths in DhF6 i which is not an (r, H)-absorbent
by walks in D for every r ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

Figure 1:
On the other hand, if D is an H-colored digraph and F is an H-class partition which is no walk-preservative,
then Proposition 2.11 is not necessarily true. Consider the H-colored digraph showed in Figure 2. For every
i ∈ {1, . . . , 5} let Fi = {e ∈ A(D) : ρ(e) = ci }. It is straightforward to see that F = {Fi : i ∈ {1, . . . , 5}} is an
H-class partition of A(D). Notice that (F2 , F3 ) is an arc of CF (D) such that x3 ∈ V (DhF2 i), and there is no
x3 w-walk in DhF2 i with w ∈ V (DhF3 i), that is, F is not a walk-preservative H-class partition of A(D). On
the other hand, S = {F5 } is a 4-absorbent set in CF (D) but no kernel by paths in DhF5 i is a (5, H)-absorbent
set by walks in D.

Main results.

The following lemmas will be useful.
Lemma 3.1. Let D be a digraph with at least one arc, W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0}, and {k, l} ⊆ N such that
2 ≤ k and 1 ≤ l. If K is a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks in D − W , then K ∪ W is a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks in D.
Lemma 3.2. If D is an H−digraph, then every kernel by paths in D is a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks in D for
every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ 1.
Proposition 3.3. Let D be an H-colored digraph with no isolated vertices, F a walk-preservative H-class
partition of A(D), and S ⊆ V (CF (D)) an independent and l-absorbent set in CF (D) for some l ≥ 1. If
N + (S) = ∅ and k ≥ 2, then every kernel by paths in Dh∪F ∈S F i is a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.
Proof. Let K be a kernel by paths in D0 = Dh∪F ∈S F i. Since F is walk preservative, it follows from Proposition
2.11 that K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by walks in D. Now, in order to prove that K is a (k, H)-independent
set by walks in D for every k ≥ 2, we will show that K is a path-independent set in D. Proceeding by
contradiction, suppose that there exists an x1 xn -path in D, say T 0 = (x1 , . . . , xn ), such that {x1 , xn } ⊆ K.
−
Consider F0 ∈ NF
(x1 ) ∩ S (Lemma 2.4). Hence, there exists x0 ∈ V (D) such that (x0 , x1 ) ∈ F0 ∩ A− (x1 ), and
let T = (x0 , x1 ) ∪ T 0 be.
If A(T ) ⊆ F0 , then A(T 0 ) ⊆ F0 , which implies that T 0 is an x1 xn -path in D0 , contradicting the fact that K
is an independent set by paths in D0 . Hence, A(T ) 6⊆ F0 . Let t = min{i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} : (xi , xi+1 ) ∈
/ F0 }. It
6

follows that (xt−1 , xt ) ∈ F0 , and (xt , xt+1 ) ∈ G for some G ∈ F with F 6= G. Notice that (F, G) ∈ A(CF (D))
and, since S is and independent set in CF (D), then G ∈
/ S. Therefore, G ∈ N + (S) which contradicts the
+
assumption that N (S) = ∅. Hence, K is path-independent in D, which implies that K is a (k, H)-independent
set by walks in D for every k ≥ 2.
Therefore K is a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D for every k ≥ 2.
Corollary 3.4. Let D be an H-colored digraph, F a walk-preservative H-class partition of A(D), and {k, l} ⊆ N
such that k ≥ 2 and l ≥ 1. If S is a (k, l)-kernel in CF (D) such that N + (S) = ∅, then D has a (k, l+1, H)-kernel
by walks.
Proof. Let W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0} and K 0 a (k, l)-kernel in CF (D) such that N + (S) = ∅. Since K 0 is an
independent and l-absorbent set in CF (D), it follows from Proposition 3.3 that D − W has a (k, l, H)-kernel
by walks, say K. By Lemma 3.1, we can conclude that K ∪ W is a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks in D.
Proposition 3.5. Let D be an H-colored digraph, and F a walk-preservative H-class partition of A(D) such
that CF (D) has a (k, l)-kernel, say S. If the following conditions holds:
a) CF (D) has no sinks, and every cycle in CF (D) is either a loop or has length at least k.
−
b) For every x ∈ V (D) such that NF (x) ∩ S 6= ∅ and NF (x) ∩ N + (S) 6= ∅, we have that NF
(x) ⊆ S.

Then D has a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Proof. First, suppose that D has no isolated vertices. Let D1 = Dh∪F ∈S F i. Since CF (D) has no sinks and S
is an independent set in CF (D), then N + (S) 6= ∅. Now, let D2 = Dh∪G∈N + (S) Gi. By Proposition 2.10, we can
consider a kernel by paths in D1 , say K, such that K ⊆ V (D2 ). We will show that K is a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel
by walks in D.
Since F is walk-preservative, it follows from Proposition 2.11 that K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by walks
in D. It only remains to show that K is a (k, H)-independent set by walks in D. First, we will prove the
following useful claim.
−
Claim 1. For every x ∈ K, NF
(x) ⊆ A(D1 ).

If x ∈ K, then x ∈ V (D1 ) ∩ V (D2 ). Since x ∈ V (D1 ), it follows from definition of D1 that there exists
F ∈ S such that A(x) ∩ F 6= ∅. Hence, NF (x) ∩ S 6= ∅. On the other hand, since x ∈ V (D2 ), an analogous
−
proof will show that NF (x) ∩ N + (S) 6= ∅. By hypothesis (b), we can conclude that NF
(x) ⊆ S.
In order to show that K is a (k, H)−independent set by walks in D, consider an x0 xn -walk in D, say
T = (x0 , . . . , xn ), such that {x0 , xn } ⊆ K.
Claim 2. OH (T ) 6= ∅.
Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that OH (T ) = ∅. Hence, there exists F 0 ∈ F such that A(T ) ⊆ F 0 ,
which implies that (xn−1 , xn ) ∈ F 0 . It follows from Claim 1 that F 0 ∈ S. Hence, T is an x0 xn -walk in
D1 , which contradicts the fact that K is an independent set by paths in D1 . Therefore, OH (T ) 6= ∅ and
the claim holds.
By Claim 2, suppose that OH (T ) = {αi : i ∈ {1, . . . , t}} where t ≥ 1, and αi ≤ αi+1 for every i ∈
{1, . . . , t − 1}. On the other hand, for every i ∈ {1, . . . , t} consider Fi ∈ F such that (xαi , x+
αi ) ∈ Fi , and
F0 ∈ F such that (x0 , x1 ) ∈ F0 . It follows from definition of CF (D) that T 0 = (F0 , F1 , . . . , Ft ) is a walk in
CF (D). Notice that lH (T ) = l(T 0 ) + 1 and, by Claim 1, Ft ∈ S. Consider the following cases:
Case 1. F0 ∈ S.
If F0 6= Ft , as S is a k-independent set in CF (D), then l(T 0 ) ≥ k, which implies that lH (T ) ≥ k. If
F0 = Ft , then T 0 is a closed walk in CF (D) which is not a loop and, by hypothesis, l(T 0 ) ≥ k. Hence,
lH (T ) ≥ k.
Case 2. F0 ∈ V (CF (D)) \ S.
−
By Lemma 2.4, consider F ∈ NF
(x0 ) ∩ S. Since F0 ∈
/ S, then F 6= F0 . It follows from definition of CF (D)
00
0
that T = (F, F0 ) ∪ T is a walk in CF (D). Notice that lH (T ) = l(T 00 ). If F 6= Ft , as S is a k-independent
set in CF (D), we have that l(T 00 ) ≥ k, which implies that lH (T ) ≥ k. If F = Ft , then T 00 is a closed walk
in CF (D) which is not a loop and, by hypothesis, l(T 00 ) ≥ k. Hence, lH (T ) ≥ k.

It follows from Case 1 and Case 2 that K is a (k, H)-independent set by walks in D. Therefore, K is a
(k, l + 1)-kernel by walks in D.
Now, suppose that W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0} is nonempty. By the the previous proof, we have that D −W
has a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks, say K. By Lemma 3.1, we can conclude that K ∪ W is a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel
by walks in D.

As a consequence of Proposition 3.5, we have the following result for strongly connected digraphs.
Corollary 3.6. Let D be a strongly connected H-colored digraph and F a walk-preservative H-class partition
of A(D) such that CF (D) has a (k, l)-kernel, say S. If the following conditions holds:
a) Every cycle in CF (D) is either a loop or has length at least k.
−
b) For every x ∈ V (D) such that NF (x) ∩ S 6= ∅ and NF (x) ∩ N + (S) 6= ∅, we have that NF
(x) ⊆ S.

Then D has a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Proof. If D is an H-digraph, it follows from Lemma 3.2 that for every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ 1, D has a (k, l, H)−kernel
by walks. Hence, we may assume that D is not an H-digraph. It follows that CF (D) is a non-trivial strongly
connected digraph (Lemma 2.6), which implies that CF (D) has no sinks. By Proposition 3.5 we have that D
has a (k, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Proposition 3.7. Let D be an H-colored digraph with no isolated vertices, F a walk-preservative H-class
partition of A(D), and S a (k, l)-kernel in CF (D) such that k ≥ 3 and l ≥ 1. If for every F ∈ S, DhF i is
unilateral and has no sinks, then every kernel by paths in Dh∪F ∈S F i is a (k − 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.
Proof. Let K be a kernel by paths in D1 = Dh∪F ∈S F i. Since F is a walk-preservative H-class partition, it
follows from Proposition 2.11 that K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by walks in D. It only remains to show
that K is a (k − 1, H)-independent set by walks in D. Consider a walk in D, say C = (x0 , . . . , xn ), such that
{x0 , xn } ⊆ K.
−
+
Claim 1. NF
(x0 ) ∩ S =
6 ∅ and NF
(xn ) ∩ S =
6 ∅.
−
Since x0 ∈ K, it follows from Lemma 2.4 that NF
(x0 )∩S 6= ∅. On the other hand, since xn ∈ V (D1 ), then
xn ∈ V (DhF i) for some F ∈ S. By hypothesis, DhF i has no sinks, which implies that A+ (xn ) ∩ F 6= ∅.
+
+
Hence F ∈ NF
(xn ), concluding that F ∈ NF
(xn ) ∩ S, and the claim holds.
−
+
By Claim 1, consider F 0 ∈ NF
(x0 ) ∩ S and F 00 ∈ NF
(xn ) ∩ S. It follows from Lemma 2.8 that F 0 6= F 00 (*).

Claim 2. OH (C) 6= ∅.
Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that OH (C) = ∅. Hence, there exists F ∈ F such that A(C) ⊆ F .
By definition of CF (D), we have that {(F 0 , F ), (F, F 00 )} ⊆ A(CF (D)). Since {F 0 , F 00 } ⊆ S and S is an
independent set in CF (D), then F 6= F 0 and F 6= F 00 . Hence, (F 0 , F, F 00 ) is an F 0 F 00 -path in CF (D),
which is no possible since S is a k-independent set with k ≥ 3. Therefore, OH (C) 6= ∅, and the claim
holds.
By Claim 2, suppose that OH (C) = {αi : i ∈ {1, . . . , t}} where t ≥ 1, and αi ≤ αi+1 for every i ∈
{1, . . . , t−1}. For every i ∈ {1, . . . , t}, let Fi ∈ F such that (xαi , x+
αi ) ∈ Fi , and F0 ∈ F such that (x0 , x1 ) ∈ F0 .
Notice that x0 ∈ V (DhF0 i) and xn ∈ V (DhFt i). On the other hand, it follows from definition of CF (D) that
C0 = (F0 , F1 , . . . , Ft ) is a walk in CF (D). Consider the following cases:
Case 1. F0 ∈ S.
First, suppose that Ft ∈ S. Notice that C0 is a walk in CF (D) such that lH (C) − 1 = l(C0 ). On the
other hand, we have that {F0 , Ft } ⊆ S, x0 ∈ V (DhF0 i) and xn ∈ V (DhFt i), which implies that F0 6= Ft
(Lemma 2.8). Since S is a k-independent set in CF (D), we have that l(C0 ) ≥ k. We can conclude that
lH (C) ≥ k − 1.
Now suppose that Ft ∈
/ S, and consider C1 = C0 ∪ (Ft , F 00 ). Notice that C1 is a walk in CF (D) such that
lH (C) = l(C1 ). On the other hand, we have that {F0 , F 00 } ⊆ S, x0 ∈ V (DhF0 i) and xn ∈ V (DhF 00 i),
which implies that F0 6= F 00 (Lemma 2.8). Since S is a k-independent set in CF (D), then l(C1 ) ≥ k. We
can conclude that lH (C) ≥ k − 1.
Case 2. F0 ∈ V (CF (D)) \ S.
First, suppose that Ft ∈ S, and consider C2 = (F 0 , F0 ) ∪ C0 . Notice that C2 is a walk in CF (D) such
that lH (C) = l(C2 ). On the other hand, we have that {F 0 , Ft } ⊆ S, x0 ∈ V (DhF 0 i) and xn ∈ V (DhFt i),
which implies that F 0 6= Ft (Lemma 2.8). Since S is a k-independent set in CF (D), then l(C2 ) ≥ k. We
can conclude that lH (C) ≥ k − 1.
Now suppose that Ft ∈
/ S, and consider C3 = (F 0 , F0 ) ∪ C0 ∪ (Ft , F 00 ). Notice that C3 is a walk in
CF (D) such that lH (C) + 1 = l(C3 ). On the other hand, by (*) we have that F 0 6= F 00 and, since S is a
k-independent set in CF (D), then l(C3 ) ≥ k. We can conclude that lH (C) ≥ k − 1.

8

It follows from the previous cases that K is a (k − 1, H)-independent set by walks in D. Therefore, K is a
(k − 1, l + 1)-kernel by walks in D.
Corollary 3.8. Let D be an H-colored digraph, F a walk-preservative H-class partition of A(D) such that for
every F ∈ F , DhF i is unilateral and has no sinks. If CF (D) has a (k, l)-kernel for some k ≥ 3 and l ≥ 1, then
D has a (k − 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Proof. First, suppose that D has no isolated vertices. If S is a (k, l)-kernel in CF (D) with k ≥ 3 and l ≥ 1,
then by Proposition 3.7, every kernel by paths in Dh∪F ∈S F i is a (k − 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.
On the other hand, if W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0} is nonempty, then by the previous proof, we have
that D − W has a (k − 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks, say K. By Lemma 3.1, we can conclude that K ∪ W is a
(k − 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.
Corollary 3.9. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D). If for every F ∈ F we
have that DhF i is strongly connected, then for every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ k + 1, D has a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks.
Proof. First, suppose that D has no isolated vertices. Since DhF i is strongly connected for every F ∈ F , we
have that F is walk-preservative (Lemma 2.9 (a)), and DhF i is unilateral and has no sinks for every F ∈ F .
On the other hand, by Lemma 2.9 (b), we have that CF (D) is a symmetric digraph, which implies that CF (D)
has a (k + 1, l − 1)-kernel for every k + 1 ≥ 3 and l − 1 ≥ k (Lemma 2.1). Hence, by Corollary 3.8, we have that
D has a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks for every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ k + 1.
On the other hand, if W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0} is nonempty, then by the previous proof, we have that
D − W has a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks for every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ k + 1. By Lemma 3.1, we can conclude that D
has a (k, l, H)-kernel by walks for every k ≥ 2 and l ≥ k + 1.
Proposition 3.10. Let D be an H-colored digraph, F an H-class partition of A(D) and S a (k, l)-kernel of
CF (D) for some k ≥ 3 and l ≥ 1. If for every F ∈ S, DhF i is strongly connected and has a obstruction-free
vertex in D, then D has a (k + 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks.
Proof. First, suppose that D has no isolated vertices. Let S = {F1 , . . . , Fr } for some r ≥ 1, and for every
i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, let zi ∈ V (DhFi i) such that zi is obstruction-free in D. By Lemma 2.9 (c) we have that zi 6= zj
whenever {i, j} ⊆ {1, . . . , r} and i 6= j .
Claim 1. K = {zi : i ∈ {1, . . . , r}} is a kernel by paths in D1 = Dh∪F ∈S F i.
In order to show that K is an absorbent set by paths in D1 , consider w ∈ V (D1 ) \ K. Since w ∈ V (D1 ),
then there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , r} such that w ∈ V (DhFj i). It follows from the fact that DhFj i is strongly
connected that there exists a wzj -path in DhFj i, say P . Hence, P is a wK-path in D1 , concluding that
K is an absorbent set by paths in D1 .
It only remains to show that K is a path-independent set in D1 . It follows from Lemma 2.9 (c) that
V (DhFi i) ∩ V (DhFj i) = ∅ for every {i, j} ⊆ {1, . . . r} with i 6= j, which implies that there is no zi zj -path
in D1 for every {i, j} ⊆ {1, . . . r} with i 6= j. Hence, K is a path-independent set in D1 , and the claim
holds.
Now, we will show that K is a (k + 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D. In order to show that K is an (l + 1, H)absorbent set by walks in D, notice that F is a walk-preservative partition of A(D) (Lemma 2.9 (a)), and, since
K is a kernel by walks in D1 , we can conclude from Proposition 2.11 that K is an (l + 1, H)-absorbent set by
walks in D.
It only remains to show that K is a (k + 1, H)-independent set by walks in D. Consider {zi , zj } ⊆ K with
i 6= j, and a zi zj -walk in D, say C = (zi = x0 , x1 . . . , xn = zj ).
Claim 2. OH (C) 6= ∅.
Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that OH (C) = ∅, which implies that there exists F ∈ F such
that A(C) ⊆ F . Since zi and zj are obstruction-free in D, then F = Fi and F = Fj (Lemma 2.2 (b)),
concluding that Fi = Fj , which is no possible since Fi 6= Fj . Hence, OH (C) 6= ∅ and the claim holds.
By Claim 2, suppose that OH (C) = {αi : i ∈ {1, . . . , t}} where t ≥ 1, and αi ≤ αi+1 for every i ∈
{1, . . . , t − 1}. For every i ∈ {1, . . . , t}, let Gi ∈ F such that (xαi , x+
αi ) ∈ Gi , and G0 ∈ F such that
(x0 , x1 ) ∈ G0 . It follows from definition of CF (D) that C 0 = (G0 , G1 , . . . , Gt ) is a walk in CF (D). Notice that
zi ∈ V (DhG0 i), zj ∈ V (DhGt i), and lH (C) = l(C 0 ) + 1. Since zi and zj are obstruction-free in D, then Fi = G0
and Fj = Gt (Lemma 2.2 (b)), which implies that {G0 , Gt } ⊆ S and G0 6= Gt . Since S is a k-independent set in
CF (D), then l(C 0 ) ≥ k, which implies that lH (C) ≥ k + 1. Hence, K is a (k + 1, H)-independent set by walks
in D. Therefore, K is a (k + 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.
On the other hand, if W = {x ∈ V (D) : d(x) = 0} is nonempty, then by the previous proof, we have
that D − W has a (k + 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks, say K. By Lemma 3.1, we can conclude that K ∪ W is a
(k + 1, l + 1, H)-kernel by walks in D.

Theorem 3.11. If D is an H-colored digraph such that for every vertex x ∈ V (D), there exists an xw-H-walk
for some vertex obstruction-free w in D, then D has an kernel by H-walks.
Proof. First, we define the digraph D0 whose vertex set consists in the obstruction-free vertices of D, and
(x, z) ∈ A(D0 ) if and only if there exists an xz-H-walk in D. Now, we will show that D0 has a kernel, say K,
by proving that D0 is a transitive digraph. Then, a simple proof will show that K is a kernel by H-walks in D.
In order to show that D0 is a transitive digraph, consider {(u, v), (v, w)} ⊆ A(D0 ). It follows from definition
of D0 that there exists a uv-H-walk in D, say W1 , and a vw-H-walk in D, say W2 . Since v is a obstruction-free
vertex in D, then we have that W1 ∪ W2 is a uw-H-walk in D, which implies that (u, w) ∈ A(D0 ), concluding
that D0 is a transitive digraph.
Since D0 is a transitive digraph, consider a kernel in D0 , say K. We will show that K is a kernel by H-walks
in D. It follows from definition of D0 and the fact that K is an independent set in D0 , that K is an independent
set by H-walks in D. It only remains to show that K is an absorbent set by H-walks in D.
Consider x ∈ V (D) \ K. If x is a obstruction-free vertex in D, then x ∈ V (D0 ) and, since K is a kernel
in D0 , there exists w ∈ K such that (x, w) ∈ A(D0 ), which implies that there exists an xw-H-walk in D. If
x∈
/ V (D0 ), then by hypothesis, there exists z ∈ V (D0 ) and an xz-H-walk in D, say W1 . If z ∈ K, then W1 is a
xK-H-walk in D. If z ∈
/ K, then there exists w ∈ K such that (z, w) ∈ A(D0 ), which implies that there exists
an zw-H-walk in D, say W2 . Since z is a obstruction-free vertex in D, then W1 ∪ W2 is an xK-H-walk in D,
concluding that K is a kernel by H-walks in D.
Corollary 3.12. If D is an m-colored digraph such that for every vertex x ∈ V (D), there exists a monochromatic
xw-walk with color c, for some vertex w such that every arc in A(w) has color c, then D has a kernel by
monochromatic paths.
Proof. Consider the digraph H whose vertices are the colors represented in A(D), and A(H) = {(c, c) : c ∈
V (H)}. Since D is an H-colored digraph satisfying the hypothesis on Lemma 3.11, it follows that D has a
kernel by H-walks, which is a kernel by monochromatic paths in D.
Corollary 3.13. If D is an m-colored digraph such that for every vertex x ∈ V (D), there exists a alternating
xw-walk, for some vertex w such that A− (w) and A+ (w) have no colors in common, then D has a kernel by
properly colored walks.
Proof. Consider the digraph H whose vertices are the colors represented in A(D), and A(H) = {(c, d) : {c, d} ⊆
V (H), c 6= d}. Since D is an H-colored digraph satisfying the hypothesis on Theorem 3.11, it follows that D
has a kernel by H-walks, which is a kernel by alternating walks in D.
Theorem 3.14. Let D be an H-colored digraph and F an H-class partition of A(D) such that for every F ∈ F ,
DhF i is strongly connected and has a obstruction-free vertex in D. For every k ≥ 2, D has a (k, H)-kernel by
walks.
Proof. Since CF (D) is a symmetric digraph (Lemma 2.9 (b)), for every k ≥ 2 we have that CF (D) has a
k-kernel (Theorem 1.1). By Theorem 3.10, D has a (k, H)-kernel by walks for every k ≥ 3. On the other hand,
it follows from Theorem 3.11 that D has a (2, H)-kernel by walks, concluding that D has a (k, H)-kernel by
walks for every k ≥ 2.
