ABSTRACT
We report sub-arcsecond ALMA observations between 272 - 375 GHz towards Sgr A*'s Circumnuclear
disk (CND). Our data comprises 8 individual pointings, with significant SiO (8 7 – 7 6) and SO (7 – 6)
emission detected towards 98 positions within these pointings. Additionally, we identify H2 CS (9 1,9 –
8 1,8), OCS (25 – 24) and CH3 OH (2 1,1 – 2 0,2) towards a smaller subset of positions. By using the
observed peak line flux density together with a Bayesian Inference technique informed by radiative
transfer models, we systematically recover the physical gas conditions towards each of these positions.
We estimate that the bulk of the surveyed gas has temperature Tkin < 500 K and density nH /
106 cm−3 , consistent with previous studies of similar positions as traced by HCN clumps. However,
we identify an uncharacteristically hot (Tkin ≈ 600 K) and dense (nH ≈ 106 cm−3 ) source in the
Northeastern Arm. This position is found to be approximately consistent with a gravitationally bound
region dominated by turbulence. We also identify a nearby cold (Tkin ≈ 60 K) and extremely dense
(nH ≈ 107 cm−3 ) position that is again potentially bound and dominated by turbulence. We also
determine that the total gas mass contained within the CND is MCND ≈ 4 × 104 M . Furthermore,
we qualitatively note that the observed chemical enrichment across large scales within the CND is
consistent with bulk grain processing, though multiple desorption mechanisms are plausibly responsible.
Further chemical modelling is required to identify the physical origin of the grain-processing, as well
as the localised H2 CS and OCS emission.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Galactic Center, and within it the Central Molecular Zone, has long been identified as a uniquely extreme environment within the Milky Way owing to the
(4.154±0.014)×106 M supermassive black hole known
as Sgr A* that resides there (Gillessen et al. 2009;
Abuter et al. 2019). Such an environment has important consequences for theories of galactic evolution and
dynamics, as the Galactic Center can be used as a highresolution laboratory for studying the nuclei of external
galaxies. However, it also has a profound impact on theCorresponding author: Tomas A. James

ories of both ISM physics and chemistry under extreme
conditions, especially when considering dense molecular
gas as precursors to star formation.
Morphologically, the inner few pc of the Galactic Center is chaotic and multifaceted. Centrally, Sgr A* is situated within a trifecta of ionised gas streams known as the
Galactic Center Mini Spiral, or GCMS (Lacy et al. 1980;
Ekers et al. 1983). Surrounding the GCMS is an extensive torus or ring like structure of turbulent molecular
gas known as the Circumnuclear ring or Circumnuclear
disk, herein referred to as the CND (e.g. Christopher
et al. 2005). The diffuse region between Sgr A* and
the CND - known as the Central Cavity - is home to a
collection of young and evolved stellar objects, including
≈ 100 OB stars (Eckart et al. 2004; Paumard et al. 2006;

2

James et al.

Lu et al. 2008; Mauerhan et al. 2010) that are thought
to considerably increase the photoionisation rate within
and around Sgr A* (Genzel et al. 1996; Paumard et al.
2006).
Studies of the CND are complicated by a degree of
uncertainty surrounding its exact morphology and kinematics. The extent of the CND is easily identified in
low J-transitions of molecules such as CS, H2 CO and
SiO (Martin et al. 2012; Tsuboi et al. 2018) as well as
dust continuum emission (Lau et al. 2013) and high Jtransitions of molecules like 12CO (Goto et al. 2013).
Such observations identify the CND as extending radially from ∼1.6 pc outwards to ∼5–7 pc from Sgr A*
(Smith & Mac Low 2014), rotating at ∼110 km s−1 between 2–5 pc (Ghez et al. 2005; Genzel et al. 2010).
However, the CND is not continuous or indeed uniform as occasional regions devoid of emission known
as 'gaps' are observed, in turn indicating that different molecules are mapping different regions of the CND.
Notable amongst these gaps is that seen in HCN (1-0)
towards the North of Sgr A*. Wright et al. (2001) propose that this gap is caused by an infalling arm of the
Galactic Center Mini Spiral pushing through the CND
as it falls towards Sgr A* proper, producing OH maser
emission (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1999) in the process. It is
therefore clear that the gas conditions within the CND
are highly non-uniform and position dependent.
In addition, the interior of the CND is highly irregular
and inhomogeneous, exhibiting clump like structures of
size 0.14 − 0.43 pc distributed throughout when viewed
in the near-IR HCN (1-0) transition (Guesten et al. 1987;
Jackson et al. 1993; Christopher et al. 2005). A number
of theories regarding the physical conditions within these
clumps exist, and Genzel et al. (2010) extensively summarises the two prevailing theories as the 'transient' and
'virial' scenarios. In summary, the transient scenario
suggests that the clumps are typically warm (> 100 K),
less dense (< 106 cm−3 ) and tidally unstable with transient lifetimes ≈ 105 yrs. Conversely, the virial scenario
states that these clumps are cooler (< 100 K), dense
(107 − 108 cm−3 ) and tidally stable with lifetimes > 107
yrs. Crucially, this stability affords these clumps the
opportunity to begin in-situ star formation. The tidal
instability, and therefore shorter lifetime estimate in the
transient scenario, would not permit any gravitationally
bound object formation.
Within the detected clumps, Tsuboi et al. (2018) estimate that some of the relatively low density regions have
gas densities in the range 0.9 − 6 × 104 cm−3 . Smith &
Wardle (2014) estimate denser HCN bright cores to have
densities in the range 0.1−2×106 cm−3 . Smith & Wardle
(2014), and independently Mills et al. (2013), find that

the HCN clumps have conditions consistent with that
outlined in the transient scenario. Crucially, such studies have not explored kinetic gas temperatures > 250 K
and thus could fail to highlight hot and dense embedded
sources. However, Smith & Wardle (2014) theorise that
the CND is subject to such large tidal shear that local
star formation is unlikely to occur within the CND in
the absence of some triggering event. This tidal shear
condition could be overcome should self-gravity dominate according to ∼ 107 (r/pc)−3 cm−3 (Yusef-Zadeh
et al. 2017). Assuming that the bulk of the CND is
found between 1.5 – 2 pc from Sgr A* as traced by HCN
(Christopher et al. 2005), then exceeding the tidal shear
condition would require gas density between ≈ 2 × 106
cm−3 at r ≈ 1.5 pc, dropping to ≈ 2×105 cm−3 at r ≈ 2
pc. Satisfying this criterion is essential for in-situ star
formation to occur within these clumps.
C-type shocks originating from clump-clump collisions
have been proposed as an efficient heating mechanism
within the CND owing to the high observed temperatures of Tkin > 200 K (Bradford et al. 2005; Harada
et al. 2015). However, star formation as a process also
presents multiple opportunities to drive C-type shocks
in to the surrounding gas, in turn chemically enriching the surrounding ISM in a similar manner to clumpclump collisions. SiO and SO - as well as other Sbearing species such as H2 S - are all known shock tracers (Martin-Pintado et al. 1992; des Forêts et al. 1993)
as a result of shock-driven evaporation of grain surface
and/or mantle. Subsequent reaction of the evaporated
species in the gas-phase, for example Si and S with O,
can produce molecules such as SiO and SO. Previous
simulations (Martin-Pintado et al. 1992; Flower et al.
2003; Holdship et al. 2017; James et al. 2020) have used
these molecules to great effect when tracing star formation related shocks under standard interstellar conditions. However, as already demonstrated the CND
and its surroundings represent extreme departures from
standard interstellar conditions. For example, the OB
star population in the Central Cavity could increase the
photoionisation rate substantially. In addition to this,
the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within the Central Molecular Zone is much larger than in other regions of the
galaxy. Both Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2007) and Goto et al.
(2013) estimate this could extend to an upper limit of
between 10 − 104 ζ s−1 assuming a standard galactic ionisation rate of ζ ≈ 3 × 10−17 s−1 .
Additionally, the Central Molecular Zone and its immediate surroundings are known to exhibit large scale
distributions of molecules such as CH3 OH (Gottlieb
et al. 1979) as well as HCN, HNC and HCO+ emission (Jones et al. 2011). Detection of these molecules,

3

I. Observations and Radiative Transfer
specifically CH3 OH, in abundance is again typical of regions that have undergone grain processing. As noted
by Turner (1998), the gas-phase formation routes and efficiencies of CH3 OH in particular cannot account for its
measured abundance within the ISM. Instead, Turner
(1998) found that CH3 OH forms readily via successive Hydrogenation of CO on the grain surface. Subsequent desorption - UV photodesorption being the dominant mechanism in translucent clouds - then releases
CH3 OH in to the gas-phase (Turner 1998). Crucially,
these formation and desorption pathways are consistent
with measured gas-phase abundances of CH3 OH. YusefZadeh et al. (2013) also investigated this phenomenon
by comparing chemical models to CH3 OH observations
to constrain the mechanism responsible for its gas-phase
existence. As Molinari et al. (2011) highlight, the dust
temperature Tdust ≤ 40 K within the Central Molecular
Zone is too low for thermal desorption to be significant.
They therefore conclude that cosmic-ray desorption represents the dominant desorption mechanism of CH3 OH
within the Central Molecular Zone. However, on smaller
scales applied to the CND both Latvakoski et al. (1999)
and Lau et al. (2013) find that the dust temperature
can vary positionally from 40 K – 200 K, in turn showing that thermal desorption could become significant in
sub-regions of the CND where the dust temperature exceeds ≈ 100 K. Consequently, detections of molecules
such as SiO, SO and CH3 OH are direct tracers of underlying physical events such as shocks, and/or regions
that have undergone grain processing.
Broadly, the detected emission intensity of these
molecules is a function of the region's physical gas conditions which are, in turn, a function of the physical
processes occurring within the gas. One may derive
estimates of the kinetic gas temperature Tkin , Hydrogen number density nH and molecular column densities
Nspec using radiative transfer codes such as RADEX
(Van Der Tak et al. 2007) in order to understand these
processes in more detail. Crucially, repeating this procedure for each position within and throughout a sample
of beam pointings allows mapping of the gas conditions
across those pointings, permitting a larger scale understanding of the physics and chemistry driving an object's
evolution.
Within this paper we present 0.38" × 0.31" spectral
observations of Sgr A*'s Circumnuclear Disk, and apply the aforementioned radiative transfer methodology
to this data. We present these observations in Section
2 before discussing their implications in Section 3. In
Section 4 we outline our statistical process coupled to
radiative transfer that infers the physical gas conditions
towards each position. Sections 5 and 6 presents the

2. OBSERVATIONS

ALMA Cycle 2 Band 7 (272 - 375 GHz) observations
(Project Code 2013.1.01242.S) that target various SiO
transitions towards the CND are utilized for this investigation. The data presented in Figure 1 and Table 1 was
obtained on 2015 June 8 and consists of 8 pointings with
the 12m array. Each pointing has a total field of view of
19.60800 and a synthesized beam of 0.3800 × 0.3100 with
PA= −72◦ corresponding to an on sky spatial scale of
approximately 0.014×0.012 pc. We thus assume a beam
filling factor of unity. The total integration time for each
source is 151 s with the relevant baseline tuned at the
rest frequency of SiO (7 – 6) (303.926809 GHz) along
with a total bandwidth of 937.5 MHz corresponding to
∼ 900 km s−1 . The raw data product has a velocity
resolution of ∼ 0.5 km s−1 (3840 channels).
The data was calibrated with the assistance of standard observatory scripts using CASA 4.7.0 (McMullin
et al. 2007). CASA was also used to image the data
with a 0.0500 pixel size and 2 km s−1 (2.03 Hz) channel
width. A Brigg's robustness parameter of 0.5 was utilized. The result achieved a sensitivity of ∼5 mJy, as
shown in Table 1. Integrated and peak intensity maps
were used to visually identify molecular line emission in

A* and its surrounding Circumnuclear disk (CND). Details of the individual pointings can be found in Table 1. We follow the
naming convention in Christopher et al. (2005), as well as Figure 2 of Montero-Castaño et al. (2009), for referring to regions
within and around the CND, e.g. pointing G targets the Northeastern Arm whilst pointings M and L target the Southern
Extension. Note: the G pointing is distinct and separate from the dust enshrouded sources of G1 and G2 in Ciurlo et al. (2020).

the data cubes, and these identified lines are listed in
Table 3 within Appendix B.
2.1. CND spectra
Spatial representations of the 8 pointings that comprise our observations are shown in Figure 1. The spectra for each of the 99 positions is shown in Appendix
A, whilst the spectra derived quantities are shown in
Table 3 of Appendix B. The circular regions shown in
Figure 1 represent the approximate field of view of each
pointing corresponding to 2100 at 300 GHz. Within this,
we follow the naming convention adopted in Christopher
et al. (2005) as well as Montero-Castaño et al. (2009) for
surveying regions of the CND. As such, the G pointing
surveys the Northeastern Arm of Sgr A*, whilst all other
pointings survey the interior of the CND. We note that
the G-pointing and its sources within are distinct and
separate from the dust enshrouded sources G1 and G2
highlighted by Ciurlo et al. (2020). Within these pointings, each position contains at least either an SiO (7 –
6) or SO (8 7 – 7 6) line. Only 2 observations - N3, IRS7
- contain only SiO (7 – 6) and SO (8 7 – 7 6) respectively.
96 observations within the data contain both SiO (7 –
6) and SO (8 7 – 7 6) transitions; the exception is the
M4 source in which we do not detect SiO (7 – 6) but
do detect both SO (8 7 – 7 6) and CH3 OH (2 1,1 – 1 0,2)
transitions.
Whilst SiO and SO are the most commonly detected
molecules, CH3 OH forms the third most commonly detected species, being present towards 16 different positions. CH3 OH (2 1,1 – 1 0,2) is not detected in any
L pointing. In fact, it is most commonly observed
within the N pointing. Additionally, our detections of
H2 CS (9 1,9 – 8 1,8) are only found within a small grouping of observations within the G pointing. Furthermore,
we find OCS (25 – 24) to have even further localisation,
being present in only two sources: G2 and K13a. Curiously, G2 and K13a are located in two opposite, distinct
regions within the CND and do not appear to be causally
or spatially related to one another.
3. QUALITATIVE GAS CHARACTERISTICS

Given the commonality of SiO and SO emission, the
ratio ISiO /ISO is a useful diagnostic of the most intense
emission regions. Figure 2 shows this ratio as a function of each position's location and extent. Each aperture within this plot represents the on-sky location of
a detection described in Section 2, with the size of the
aperture being approximately equivalent to the total extent in beams as given in Appendix B. The colour scale
employed to fill these apertures is representative of the
ISiO /ISO ratio as indicated by the vertical colour bar.

5

The underlying image represents HCN emission of the
CND. It's flux density is defined according to the horizontal colour bar.
Within Panel 1, the observations G1, G2, G3a and
G3b sit along a filament of HCN emission, whilst G4
and G5 are situated outside of this structure. As noted
previously, we highlight that these positions and separate and distinct from the G1 and G2 sources identified
in Ciurlo et al. (2020). However, the presence of the filament appears to have negligible effect on the ISiO /ISO
ratio as all sources < 1. G1 is found to have a low
ISiO /ISO ratio of ≈ 0.8, whilst G2 is observed to be
slightly lower at ≈ 0.75. The ratio at G3a is consistent
with G1, whilst G3b is found to be slightly lower again
at ≈ 0.7. However, G4 has a ratio approximately consistent with G2, whilst G5 has ratio consistent with that
of G1. Nevertheless, the ISiO /ISO ratio implies that the
gas in this region has marginally greater SO emission
than SiO, in turn indicating a higher density of SO than
SiO within this region.
When considering Panel 2, it is immediately evident
that there is again very little variation in the ISiO /ISO
ratio across the area covered. With the exception of
K15a and K17, every other observation in this inset plot
shows ISiO /ISO / 1. Interestingly, K12, K13a and K13b
sit along a ridge that demarcates a bright HCN emission
cloud from its surrounding background. It is this region
that is subject to close interaction between the Galactic
Center Mini Spiral and the molecular gas within the
CND. From the ISiO /ISO ratio, it would appear that this
ridge shows stronger SO emission than SiO emission.
Panel 3, much like Panel 2, shows very little variation
in ratio. The only exception to this uniformity is the
multi-component gas at L19 and L30. L19's surrounding
gas shows only single component behaviour, making the
multi-component nature of L19 puzzling. Unfortunately,
L30 does not have any nearby observation to compare
with, though it is worth noting than the ISiO /ISO ratio
for the second component here is the largest ratio seen
in the data at ≈ 12. This stands in stark contrast to
the rest of the observations in Panel 3 whose ratios are
significantly lower and much more uniform at / 1.
Moreover, in addition to L19 and L30 we find 2 further
sources in our observations - D3, and K8b - that exhibit
multi-component behaviour. Curiously, each of these
sources contains only SiO and SO lines.
Broadly, Figure 2 seemingly indicates that the energetics of the CND do not vary significantly throughout
its extent, or from region to region. However, ISiO /ISO
is inherently degenerate as the ratio when ISO << 1 can
also be the same as when ISiO >> 1. We therefore utilise

I. Observations and Radiative Transfer
a quantitative approach to deriving the gas conditions
within each observation.
4. GAS CONDITION INFERENCE PROCEDURE

Both the physics and chemistry of interstellar gas are
entangled and thus form a system that is extremely
non-linear and non-trivial to model. We simplify this
modelling challenge by approaching the problem with
non-LTE radiative transfer in RADEX (Van Der Tak
et al. 2007) coupled to a Bayesian inference procedure.
Within this scheme we may inform the radiative transfer
with a set of independent random variables that define
the physical gas conditions. Monte Carlo methods can
then be used to explore the physical condition parameter space, in turn converging on the most likely gas
conditions for each region. Additionally, this approach
minimises the number of variables required to model the
CND gas, in turn allowing us to determine the physical
gas conditions with a minimal number of assumptions.
A key assumption for applying RADEX is, however, that
the transitions under consideration are optically thin, as
is likely the case.
4.1. Radiative transfer
Using this approach, we utilise the radiative transfer
code RADEX (Van Der Tak et al. 2007) to compute
the emitted line flux density of the relevant transition
for a parcel of gas with physical conditions described
by the set of parameters S = {Tkin , nH , Nspec }. Tkin
is the gas temperature, nH is the molecular Hydrogen
gas number density and Nspec is the column density
of the relevant species under consideration. Owing to
the strong UV heating supplied by the OB star population, as well as the high temperatures inf erred in
the CND from previous observations, we explore temperatures up to 1000 K. We used RADEX owing to
its non-LTE molecular excitation capabilities, as well
as its widespread use in studies that model interstellar spectra (e.g. Beuther et al. 2008; Lique et al. 2009;
Van Dishoeck et al. 2021), including towards the Galactic Center (e.g. Wirström et al. 2010; Amo-Baladrón
et al. 2011; Armijos-Abendaño et al. 2020). We intend
to apply more detailed chemical modelling to these regions in future in order to further understand their phenomenology. All species within this study utilise temperature dependent collisional data from the LAMDA
database (Schöier et al. 2010). For temperatures outside of the calculated temperature range that LAMDA
reports, RADEX fixes the collisional rate constant to the
rate constant at the nearest temperature. For SiO, the
collisional data has been calculated up to and including collisional temperatures of 1000 K. Inspecting the

7

rate constants for SiO (8 7 – 7 6) reveals relatively uniform (within a factor of 2) behaviour across the a-priori
temperature range. Considering a similar process for
SO (7 – 6) we note that the collisional rates have been
determined up to 300 K. Much like SiO, the collisional
data for SO is similarly constant within the calculated
temperature range. We therefore assume that, given
the similar chemical compositions and masses of SiO
and SO, the same uniformity in collisional rates is evident beyond 300 K. We note similar behaviour within
the collisional data for the other molecular transitions
detected in our data, and we therefore apply the same
assumption to all molecules and transitions detected in
our observations.
Additionally, each observation presented in Section 2
has been normalised to units of mJy/beam and thus assumes that each observation fills the beam. This renders
RADEX computed flux densities, as RADEX assumes a
beam filling factor of 1, directly comparable to the observational flux densities presented. The assumption of
a beam filling factor of unity is further justified as the
linear scale of our observations is sufficient to guarantee that the only emission within the beam is from the
targeted gas. Each source is also fully resolved, in turn
ensuring they fill each beam.
Repeating this procedure for each species and each
transition in a given observation allows us to construct a
model θ that represents the synthetic flux density emitted from a region of gas at temperature Tkin and gas
density nH comprising species column densities Nspec .
Constructing the model in this manner assumes that
all emission lines contained within it originate from the
same thermal component. As Section 2 showed, our
observations are consistent with a single component.
Where not, it is clear and distinct that 2 components are
present, either through distinctly different linewidths or
bi-modal line profiles, and they are thus treated as essentially two separate sources, in turn being analysed
with 2 distinct models.
However, given the complexity of the underlying
physics and chemistry, and indeed their associated degeneracy, it is useful to statistically survey the entire parameter space across each dimension in order to better
understand and identify the probable conditions within
each observation. An ideal process with which to do this
utilises Bayesian Inference.

4.2. Bayesian Inference
Bayesian Inference is a method of using conditional
probability to build statistical parameter distributions

P (θ|d) is defined as the probability of the model θ
fitting the data d given that the data is correct (known
as "the posterior probability"). P (d|θ) is the probability
of having obtained the data d given a particular model
θ (known as "the likelihood"). P (θ) is defined as the
probability of the model θ being correct ("the prior")
and P (d) is the probability that the data is correct ("the
evidence"). We define the data as being the observed
flux densities, whilst the model is the equivalent line flux
density determined from RADEX as defined in Section
4.1.
We assume flat priors in log space such that within
each dimension, any value is equally as likely as any
other providing that such a value falls within the nonzero prior range. The non-zero ranges used for these
priors, and in turn the extent of parameter spaces explored, are shown in Table 2.

We constrain the upper and lower limits of column
density for each molecule to explore by estimating the
LTE derived column density for the upper and lower
limits of temperature shown in Table 2. This makes
use of molecular data provided by Splatalogue (Remijan
et al. 2007).

We compute the likelihood using the likelihood function defined in Equation 2.
!
1 X (di − θi )2
(2)
P (d|θ) = exp −
2 i
σi2
Where the summation term represents the Chisquared statistic. Within Equation 2, di is the ith value
of the data, θi is the ith value of the model corresponding
to di and σi is the error associated with di .
By implementing this Bayesian procedure we sample
from the underlying posterior distribution using randomly sampled variables that define the gas condition.
These variables thus form the set S. To perform this
sampling we use the affine-invariant MCMC sampler
emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). emcee uses a numbers of "walkers" to systematically sample the parameter space across a number of steps, in turn constructing a series of Markov Chains. All walkers therefore
define a representation of the underlying posterior distribution, allowing us to identify statistically informed
estimates of the most likely gas condition towards each
observation. We use an ensemble of 500 walkers and
we run each walker for a maximum of 1 × 104 steps.
Every 100 steps we assess convergence in each dimension using the Gelman-Rubin statistic (Gelman & Rubin 1991). We halt our sampling if convergence is judged
to have been achieved across all dimensions. We follow
Brooks & Gelman (1998) in judging successful convergence when the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic for each dimension < 1.2. For additional confidence, we select a
cut-off of 1.15 for achieving sample convergence. In addition and where relevant we also visualise our chains
using ChainConsumer (Hinton 2016).
This approach has a number of distinct advantages
when deriving physical gas conditions. Firstly, the number of variables required to define the gas is limited
to those required by RADEX, resulting in a relatively
low number of dimensions overall. Additionally, within
this scheme each dimension is entirely free and is not
causally related to any other. As such, we derive the
gas conditions with almost no a-priori knowledge of the
local chemistry. The affine-invariant nature of the emcee
sampler thus allows convergence to be achieved independently of the underlying physics and/or chemistry beyond radiative transfer, thus reducing uncertainty and
bias.
5. INFERENCE RESULTS: CORNER PLOTS FOR

INDIVIDUAL SOURCES
Figure 3 shows an example of the corner plot for the
G2 source. G2 contains the largest number of lines in
our sample that our detected towards one region.

Figure 3. An example corner plot for the G2 source that shows the sampled distributions for each parameter, known as
dimensions, in the model. Each dimension is shown on the x axis; the distributions on the diagonal represents the posterior
distributions for the relevant dimension e.g. the posterior on the top left is the T posterior. All other plots in the matrix show
the joint distributions of parameters as per their x and y axes that contribute to the associated posterior. Tight constraints
are observed in the joint distributions within all dimensions except T which exhibits broad behaviour along its domain and
highlights the broad errors associated with this dimension.

10

James et al.

Within this matrix, the marginalised posterior distributions for each parameter are found on the diagonal.
The peak of each of these distributions represents the
point of highest posterior density (HPD) and it this
value that is taken to be the most likely model given the
data. The plots found within the remaining cells represent the joint distributions for the parameters defined by
their relevant x and y axes. Any pair of parameters that
are bounded by a dark blue region is within 2σ of the
HPD, whilst everything bounded within the light blue
region is within 3σ of the HPD.
Considering the marginalised posterior distributions
we see that each dimension peaks to a maximum, though
not without a degree of skewness in the case of T. Inspecting the joint distributions of all dimensions except
T shows roughly symmetrical, tight groupings that in
general extend to ±0.5 orders of magnitude. This produces posteriors that peak strongly, though both SiO
and OCS peak towards the lower boundary of the distributions in this case.
Whilst estimates of T are broad, its HPD is reliably
constrained in the case of G2. However, the skewness in
this distribution does serve to highlight the assymetrical
errors that we find are often associated with this dimension. In this instance, the possible values T < 350 K
become exponentially less likely. At T > 350 K we observe a small plateau of equal likelihood until T ≈ 600 K,
whereby an approximately linear decrease in likelihood
until T ≈ 1000 K is encountered.
Unfortunately, the large errors and associated systematic uncertainties in temperature are a consequence of
the limited number of spectral lines detected and used in
this analysis. In the majority of cases within this study
we require fitting for at least 4 different dimensions using just 2 spectral lines. An example corner plot for this
scheme is shown in Figure 4, which exhibits only SiO
and SO lines. As a result, Figure 4 shows broader constraints in all dimensions and less symmetry in the posterior distributions therein, though T does peak despite
3σ errors spanning the entire parameter space. Subsequent inspection of the temperature column of Table 4 shows wide, asymmetrical errors on almost every constrained temperature, serving to highlight the
challenge in drawing a discrete conclusion from a continuous, asymmetrical and weakly peaked distribution.
The errors on each parameter become both smaller and
more symmetrical in nature, when afforded more line
detections, though the effect on constraining T is slight.
Additionally, the broad temperature distributions may
be reflective of the weak temperature dependence that is
observed in the LAMDA collisional data for the detected
molecular transitions. Further constraints could be ap-

plied if additional observations of molecular transitions
that exhibit strong temperature dependent behaviour
are incorporated.
6. INFERENCE RESULTS: GAS CONDITIONS IN

THE CND
The derived HPD of the physical parameters for each
position are shown in Figures 5 - 8. These plots are
similar to that in Figure 2, however the colour scale
employed to fill the apertures here is indicative of the
HPD of the relevant dimension under consideration as
computed from our inference routine. For instance, Figure 5 shows the HPD of gas temperature Tkin towards
each observation. Similarly, Figures 6, 7 and 8 show
the HPDs of nH , NSiO and NSO respectively. Semitransparent, hatched apertures represent sources that
have not achieved reliable convergence within the maximum number of steps available. We define non-reliable
convergence as any source that has converged to an HPD
but without an associated 1σ error range. Table 4 within
Appendix C shows the HPD for each source and each
dimension therein together with their associated error
ranges. Thus considering each image allows the dataset
wide distribution of physical conditions to be investigated and quantified.
6.1. Temperature
The distribution of HPD temperatures THPD across
the entirety of Figure 5 shows minor correlation on a local level; as expected, sources in close proximity to one
another have broadly similar temperatures. In general,
this behaviour manifests as ±50 K between neighbouring
sources. An example of this is found in Panel 1 which
shows that G3a and G3b are almost identical in temperature of ≈ 100 K. Both G3a and G3b, as well as G1
and G2, are found within a long filamentary structure of
HCN emission that extends along the left vertical edge
of Panel 1. This structure can be regarded as sitting
outside of the main CND structure, and represents the
50 km s−1 molecular cloud identified in previous studies. However, both G1 and G2 are warmer than G3a
and G3b with TG1 ≈ 350 K and TG2 ≈ 600 K. Additionally, Panel 1 also shows G5, which is external to the
HCN filament. G5 is similar in temperature to G3a and
G3b with TG5 ≈ 100 K. There is also an unconstrained
source on the boundary of the filament that is of similar
temperature to G3a, G3b and G5, though this source's
temperature estimate is likely unreliable. Nevertheless,
it would appear that the G3a and G3b observations capture the same gas component, whilst G1 and G2 capture
colder and warmer extremes of the filament respectively.
When considering Panel 2, we see that the main
grouping of observations in the centre of the panel are

I. Observations and Radiative Transfer

11

Figure 4. Corner plot for the K1 source as per Figure 3. This shows much broader spread in all dimensions owing to the
limited number of data points available.

consistent with temperatures 400 < THPD < 700 K,
though there is a significant number of positions that
have not achieved reliable temperature convergence.
Additionally, 5 of the converged positions are identified
as having THPD ≈ 500 K. Interestingly, this is consistent with the bulk of the gas being close to the upper
limit of the CND clump temperature as identified by
Requena-Torres et al. (2012). There are, however, 2
constrained "hot" sources within Panel 2 that exceed
this limit: K15b and K24. Of these, K24 is the hottest
at TK24 ≈ 800 K, whilst K15b is moderately cooler at
TK15b ≈ 700 K. K24 is isolated and much further North
than K15b, and does not appear to correlate with the
underlying HCN emission. Conversely, K15b sits embedded within the CND and is much closer to cooler
sources. This therefore indicates that in general the gas
temperature is increasing towards the South of Panel
2 and, in turn, to the South of the CND. This is also
consistent with the underlying HCN emission becoming
brighter towards the South of Panel 2.
Panel 3 shows a similar trend to that observed in
the main grouping of Panel 2 in that almost every

source in Panel 3 has temperature within the range
350 < THPD < 550 K. In this instance there are only 2
sources - L15 and L25 - that deviate significantly from
≈ 550 K. L25 sits at the furthest extremity of the observation grouping, whilst L15 sits centrally within that
grouping. However, we observe that THPD increases
from L15 along and down the line of observations towards L6, with L3 and L6 being of comparable temperature. The 2 sources either side of L6 - L10a and L1
- are again of comparable temperatures to L3 and L6.
Continuing along and up from L15 towards L20 shows
that the tight grouping of observations in L20, L21 and
L24 are all of similar temperature, again THPD ≈ 550 K.
However, L25's temperature of THPD ≈ 350 K stands in
contrast to its warmer surroundings.
Additionally, L19 is the observation that showed the
largest ISiO /ISO ratio in Panel 3 as well as globally across
all observations. Panel 3 shows that its temperature
is unconstrained, though if we consider the estimate in
relation to its surroundings then we see no significant
deviation from the average THPD of its surrounding observations.

Figure 5. The points of highest posterior density (HPD) of the kinetic gas temperature THPD towards each position outlined in
Section 2. Semi-transparent, hatched circular regions indicate a position whose chain has not reliably converged. G2 (in Panel
1) is noticeably warmer than its surroundings, which are much lower in their recovered temperatures. Panels 2 and 3 show more
agreement between neighbouring positions.

I. Observations and Radiative Transfer
6.2. Gas density
When considering the distribution of HPD densities
nHPD in Figure 6, we see a similar local trend to that
observed in temperature in Figure 5 such that neighbouring sources are within 0.2 orders of magnitude of
one another. Additionally, we also observe far fewer unconstrained sources than were noted in Figure 5. However, more uniformity is seen in the determined values
of nHPD throughout the CND as a whole, with less than
2 orders of magnitude variation throughout.
Panel 1 shows that, in general, colder sources are
found to be at higher density. For example, G5 was
identified as being ≈ 100 K and is, in turn, here noted
to have density nG5 ≈ 107 cm−3 - the most dense of any
position in our sample. Whilst G1 and G2 were noted for
their different temperatures (G1 becoming cooler than
G2), Panel 1 shows that they are broadly similar in density within their associated error ranges. Furthermore
the same density behaviour is seen in G3a, G3b and G4
which were all identified as having similar temperatures.
When considering Panel 2, almost every source sits
within the range 105.6 < nHPD < 106.2 cm−3 , even
those outside of the main grouping identified in Panel
2 of Figure 5. The main grouping is found within an
HCN bright region that defines the Southern extent of
the CND. We note that the density range derived here
is consistent with the density of HCN bright cores estimated by Smith & Wardle (2014). Additionally, the hot
sources identified in K15b and K24 sit within this range
and have densities nK15b ≈ 106.2 cm−3 and nK24 ≈ 105.8
cm−3 respectively. K13a is identified as having a density
towards the upper limit, i.e. nHPD ≈ 106.2 cm−3 , though
its surroundings are of lesser density. When considered
in conjunction with K9 and K10, it would appear that
this region is tracing the dense inner-most ridge of the
CND.
Outside of this grouping we identify that K18 exhibits
a large density of nHPD ≈ 106.4 cm−3 . This is not consistent with the underlying HCN emission and is not reflected in the density of its nearest neighbour K19 whose
density is nHPD ≈ 105.8 cm−3 . K18 is therefore regarding as an anomalous position.
Within Panel 3 we observe that the L16 source acts as
a dividing boundary such that everything North of L16
- and thus the Northern-most cluster of observations all exist at almost exactly the same density of nHPD ≈
106.0 cm−3 . South of L16 we note that the sources show
slightly more variety, with L3 being more dense than
the average of nHPD > 105.8 cm−3 and L16 being less
dense at nHPD > 105.5 cm−3 . L12 is a unique outlier
in that its density is significantly larger than any other
source in Panel 3 at nHPD > 106.4 cm−3 . Within Figure

13

5, L12 does not have a reliable temperature estimate.
However, if we consider the temperature identified we
observe that it is > 800 K, thus potentially forming
another non-quiescent region.
Additionally, observations that sit within HCN regions or filaments are found to broadly exhibit higher
densities than those observations outside of these locations. Given that HCN emission traces dense gas this
is unsurprising, though it does lend additional weight
to the hot, dense sources being embedded non-quiescent
regions such as a YSO.
6.3. Column density
Much like Figure 6, the SiO column density in Figure 7
shows little variance across the dataset. Figure 7 shows
just over an order of magnitude's variation. The effects
of temperature and density also appear to be negligible
in this case as the regional and local variation seen in
Figures 5 and 6 are not observed, or indeed reflected,
here. For example, Panel 1 in Figure 7 shows almost
uniform NSiO in the range 1013.4 > NSiO < 1013.8 cm−2
despite the temperature and density varying widely. A
noticeable feature of Panel 1 is the additional uniformity
in NSiO for sources within the HCN filament. Sources
outside of this filament, e.g. G5, are found to exhibit a
different, larger column density.
Notable features within Panel 2 show that a tentative trend indicating the brighter the underlying HCN
emission then the larger the SiO column density. For example, the upper half of the panel, where HCN emission
is less intense, showing marginally lower column densities than the lower half where HCN emission is more
intense. Curiously, K5a, K5b and K5c are observed to
have lower column density of NSiO ≈ 1013.3 cm−2 than
their surrounding observations. This could indicate that
the surrounding gas acts to shield the K5 sources and
thereby inhibit the emission of SiO. This is further confirmed when noting that the gas density of K5a, K5b and
K5c are consistent with their surroundings. The lower
half of Panel 2 is much more uniform of NSiO ≈ 1013.6
cm−2 with the exception of K8a which has column density NSiO ≈ 1014.0 cm−2 . The inner CND ridge (K9 to
K13b) all show uniform and consistent column density
of NSiO ≈ 1013.6 cm−2 with this agreement extending
behind the ridge until K8a. Uniquely, the previously
identified ridge indicated by K12, K13a and K13b shows
no distinct SiO behaviour relative to its surroundings,
thus indicating that any interaction between the Galactic Centre Mini Spiral and the CND towards this region
is not having an effect on the SiO chemistry.
Panel 3 is not dissimilar in broad trend to Panel 2 in
that it shows the same agreement trends. The larger

observation outlined in Section 2.

James et al.

NSiO is located towards the observation's Northernmost
tip, with the column density decreasing towards the
South of this complex. Interestingly, this region of relatively large NSiO sits within an HCN dark region. By
application, HCN traces dense molecular gas and thus
shows that, at least in this region, that regions of large
SiO column density are found in dense regions of gas.
Directly North of Panel 2 is another grouping of observations that houses the largest derived value of NSiO
at ≈ 1014.2 cm−2 . The surrounding observations are
also observed to have NSiO towards the upper-half of
the derived scale, though these observations are consistent with the values of NSiO derived towards the series of
observations in Panels 2 and 3. This is again consistent
with the underlying HCN emission tracing dense regions
within the CND, ergo grain-processing as described in
Section 1.
Figure 8 shows that almost all sources can be considered to have NSO > 1014 cm−2 . A grouping of 3 observations immediately south of Sgr A* houses the lowest
value of NSO within our data at ≈ 1014 cm−2 .
Panel 1 echoes a similar trend to its SiO column densities, with the largest column density in this Panel - G5
- residing outside of the main HCN filament. Interestingly, G3b is here shown to be NSO ≈ 1015 cm−2 , larger
than it's surroundings in G1 and G2 that show consistent column densities of NSO > 1014.5 cm−2 . G3a and
G4 are also consistent, with NSO > 1014.7 cm−2 .
Panel 2 again shows a number of interesting trends,
specifically a degree of non-uniformity throughout the
derived values in the main grouping. We observe that
whilst the local agreement between neighbouring observations is again evident here, it is more evident in the
upper half of the panel than in the lower half. For
instance, the collection of sources from K1 to K6b all
show NSO ≈ 1014.8 cm−2 . To the South of this complex
we find that the observations along the inner boundary ridge (K9 to K13b) of the CND show large column
densities towards K9 and K13b, with the column density in general decreasing towards the centre of this line
towards K11. K8a also stands out as a high column
density source, especially in relation to its lesser column
density neighbours. However, the derived column densities for these sources span around 1 order of magnitude,
making the individual variation from observation to observation slight. This is also true when applied to the
interaction ridge, which is here observed to be less uniform than in SiO. However, this behaviour is consistent
with the ISiO /ISO ratio being consistent across the ridge.
Panel 3 again exhibits a similar trend to that seen
in Figure 7, though there is even less variation in NSO
throughout this region. The HCN dark region towards

the Northernmost tip of this grouping may again be considered to house the largest values of NSO ≈ 1015 cm−2 .
The dense NSiO observation to the North of Panel 2
in Figure 7 now shows almost unanimous agreement in
NSO with its neighbours indicating that whatever mechanism is driving its excess SiO chemistry - relative to its
surroundings - is not reflected in its SO chemistry.
When considering the trends in both Figures 7 and 8,
we see variation in both NSiO and NSO throughout the
data, though this variation is slight in both dimensions
and likely not large enough to indicate any localised energetic events acting as vectors for excess emission in the
vast majority of cases. Importantly, the derived SiO and
SO column densities are larger than the expected quiescent column densities. The CND wide nature of this
enhancement suggests that the mechanism driving this
excess is universal, and likely grain-processing and/or
desorption.
7. FORMATION MECHANISMS

It is clear that all sources in our data show enhancement of SO and SiO. As already discussed, each of these
molecules is a known tracer of grain-processing activity,
owing to both Si and S being far more abundant on
the grain surfaces than they are in the gas-phase. Indeed, SiO and SO do not form readily in the gas-phase
without Si or S trapped in/on the grains being released
in to the gas phase for subsequent reaction with O e.g.
Si + O −−→ SiO. Conversely, CH3 OH is thought to
form readily on grain surfaces via successive hydrogenation of CO, where it is subsequently desorbed in to the
gas-phase by an energetic mechanism such as shock activity (e.g. James et al. (2020)) or photodesorption (e.g.
Bertin et al. (2016)).
Previous studies of the Galactic Center on large scales
such as those by Molinari et al. (2011) and Yusef-Zadeh
et al. (2013) have shown that the gas and dust are uncoupled and that the dust temperature Tdust ≤ 40 K, well
below the temperature at which thermal desorption becomes significant. When considering smaller scales such
as the CND, Latvakoski et al. (1999) theorise that the
dust temperature varies positionally from 40 K to 200
K, with the variation likely a result of heating by the
OB star population. Furthermore, our analysis has also
shown that the density of the most dense clumps to be
nH ≈ 107 cm−3 , a density at which the gas and dust are
likely coupled, either fully or partially (Goldsmith 2001).
As a result, thermal desorption could also be dominant
within sub-regions of the CND. This naturally poses the
question: what physical event(s) are dominant in driving this grain-processing, and are these events associated
with specific events such as star formation, or is it in-

stead energetic activity associated with Sgr A* and its
surroundings?
In the context of star formation, driven shock action is
an efficient and ubiquitous processor of grains, so much
so that molecules like SiO and SO are often used exclusively as tracers of shocks in star forming regions
(Martin-Pintado et al. 1992; des Forêts et al. 1993). As
already noted, the OB star population in the Central
Cavity could raise the photoionisation rate towards the
inner edge of the disc, making photodesorption of grain
mantle species an efficient desorption mechanism here.
Dense regions further in to the disc may also be subject
to photodesorption via secondary photons. Crucially,
such widespread desorption activity could act to preprocess the grain mantles, rendering molecules such as
SiO and SO unreliable shock tracers in the CND.
Furthermore, the uniform enhancement of SiO and SO
observed throughout our observations is indicative of a
large scale process driving this desorption. Star formation would be expected to occur in a structured manner,
to the extent that its signatures would be concentrated
to relatively small regions of the CND. These signatures
are dependent on the evolutionary state of the object;
they could manifest as cold and dense self-gravitating
regions, or hot and dense gas swept up in outflows.
K13a is, however, one of only 2 observations in our
sample that shows significant OCS emission. K13a's surroundings do not exhibit similar OCS lines, indicating
highly localised phenomena to the K13a locale. The only
other OCS positive source is G2 which, unlike K13a, exhibits CH3 OH and H2 CS emission. Within K13a we
note that the measured linewidth of the OCS line is a
factor of 2 less than the measured linewidths of the SiO
and SO lines. This is in spite of all lines towards K13a
having consistent measured velocities. Such behaviour
could indicate that the SiO and SO lines are tracing a
different thermal component to the OCS line, hence we
disregard the OCS line towards the position when fitting
for K13a. As a result, the assumption of LTE should be
cautioned towards this region.
Interestingly, when considering the G-pointing we find
that G2 does not exhibit similar behaviour, though there
is minor variation in measured linewidth across the detected lines. CH3 OH and H2 CS emission are widespread
throughout the G pointing, creating a unique subset of
observations within our sample. Unfortunately, the temperature towards K13a remains unconstrained. However, if we consider the point of highest posterior density towards K13a as absolute then TK13a ≈ 500 K. G2
has temperature TG2 ≈ 600 K. As such, the presence of
OCS could indicate high-temperature chemistry occurring within these regions. The non-detections of CH3 OH

and H2 CS in K13a is puzzling, though K13a is known to
sit along the Galactic Center Mini Spiral - CND ridge
and thus could be indicative of locally different chemistry. Conversely, OCS tracing a separate thermal component towards K13a, and the absence of this towards
G2, potentially alludes to this interaction. Nevertheless,
both of these regions require further chemical follow up
study to confirm.
One may broadly estimate whether the derived conditions towards the positions in this study are indicative of star formation by considering density, mass and
pressure estimates. Considering G2 we note that the
Roche Density (Chandrasekhar 1987), assuming an approximate distance from Sgr A* of 3.0 pc, is ≈ 6 × 106
cm−3 , which is marginally smaller than the derived gas
density towards G2 thus implying tidal stability. Considering an estimate of the mass, assuming that G2 is
spherical and uniform with average density nH ≈ 106
cm−3 and radius equivalent to ∼ 3 beams we find its
mass Muniform ≈ 22 × 103 M . For G2 to be gravitationally bound with linewidth ∆v ≈ 20 km s−1 then its
mass would need to exceed the virial mass Mvir . Using the same process as Christopher et al. (2005), we
find that Mvir towards G2 is Mvir ≈ 40 × 103 M , only
marginally larger than Muniform . As a result, G2 could
very well be gravitationally bound within the limits of
the assumptions applied. Additionally, another potentially bound source is L28 within the L pointing. L28 has
uniform mass Muniform ≈ 40 × 103 M and virial mass
Mvir ≈ 48 × 103 M , and shows the closest agreement
between uniform and virial masses within our sample.
For G5, we note Muniform ≈ 1 × 103 M and virial mass
Mvir ≈ 4 × 103 M . However, the recovered gas density
for G5 of nH ≈ 107 cm−3 is therefore larger than the
equivalent Roche Density at 3.0 pc, implying that G5
could be able to overcome the tidal barrier to bind itself
gravitationally. This assumes that G5 is one discrete,
monolithic clump. Given that G5's physical conditions
render it such an outlier amongst our observed regions,
it is possible that this region is actually multiple clumps
along the line of sight whose spectra sum to produce a
single spectra, in turn creating the illusion of a spectra
consistent with one unified clump.
We apply a similar process in order to estimate the total molecular gas mass contained within the CND. This
2
2
can be expressed as MCND ≈ π(Rout
− Rin
)hρ where h
represents the height of the CND. Based on the underlying HCN maps in Figure 2 we assume that this is, on
average, ≈ 0.5 pc. For comparison, we utilise the same
CND radii reported in Tsuboi et al. (2018): Rin ≈ 1.5
pc and Rout ≈ 2.0 pc. Additionally, we assume that the
average CND density is equivalent to the modal density

I. Observations and Radiative Transfer
determined previously: ≈ 5 × 105 cm−3 . This yields a
total mass of MCND ≈ 4 × 104 M . Tsuboi et al. (2018)
estimate the molecular gas mass of the CND based on
LTE assumptions to be 3 × 104 M , marginally smaller
than our estimate. However, we caution that our observations do not sample the full extent of the CND, especially towards HCN faint regions such as those to the
North of Sgr A*. In this instance, the use of the modal
density derived from our observations - which deliberately target dense gas - could result in us overestimating
the mean density of the CND, in turn biasing our mass
estimate.
When considering both thermal and turbulent pressure, one may express the thermal pressure as
ptherm /kB ≈ nT and the turbulent pressure as
pturb /kB ≈ ρ∆v 2 /kB . For T ≈ 600 K, nH ≈ 106 cm−3
and ∆v ≈ 20 km s−1 then ptherm /kB ≈ 109 cm−3 K and
pturb /kB ≈ 1011 cm−3 K. Therefore, for G2 the turbulent pressure dominates over the thermal pressure in
spite of the high estimated temperature towards this region. In fact, all positions within the G, K and L pointings are dominated by turbulence, despite their wide
range of estimated temperatures. Additionally, this is
seemingly independent of their potentially bound states,
though a more rigorous determination of mass based on
LTE assumptions and chemical abundances is required
to identify more accurate clump masses to compare to
their virial counterparts.
8. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have presented sub-arcsecond observations from 8 ALMA Band 7 (272 – 375 GHz)
pointings towards the Circumnuclear disk (CND) of
Sgr A*. We detect clear and distinct SiO (8 7 – 7 6)
and SO (7 – 6) emission towards 98 positions within
these pointings. Additionally, we observe widespread
CH3 OH (2 1,1 – 2 0,2) emission as well as more localised
emission of H2 CS (9 1,9 – 8 1,8) and OCS (25 – 24) towards a subset of these 98 positions.
We have used a Bayesian Inference routine coupled
to radiative transfer to infer the physical conditions towards each observation based on the detected line fluxes.
Based on these results, we find the following:
• The temperature of the regions probed by the observations is in general T < 500 K, approximately
consistent with that derived previously towards
similar clumps. Most of the estimated densities
within this work are in good agreement with the
previously reported values towards clumps within
the CND at nH / 106 cm−3 .

19

• The ubiquity of SiO and SO detections, including their large derived column densities, is consistent with large scale grain-processing occurring
within the CND. However, we find that multiple
desorption mechanisms, both thermal and nonthermal (e.g. UV or cosmic-ray photodesorption),
are plausible engines with which to drive grainprocessing in the CND. Further chemical modelling is required to identify which processes are
efficient towards the CND.
• The G2 source within the Northeastern Arm is
identified as being hot (Tkin ≈ 600 K) and
dense (nH ≈ 106 cm−3 ). SiO (8 7 – 7 6) and
SO (7 – 6) emission is identified towards it, as
well as CH3 OH (2 1,1 – 2 0,2), H2 CS (9 1,9 – 8 1,8)
and OCS (25 – 24) lines. Basic calculations indicate that this region is potentially gravitationally
bound and is turbulent pressure dominated. It is
therefore a source of immense interest for follow
up observations and study.
• L28 is identified as having mass almost exactly
consistent with that required for binding to occur,
though turbulence dominates here as well. L28
does not show any outstanding feature in terms of
its line detections or its recovered physical quantities, rendering it somewhat of an outlier amongst
the potentially bound sources identified. Nevertheless, more accurate mass estimates in follow up
studies based on complex chemistry can help constrain whether this region is indeed bound or not.
• Similarly, G5 is found to have the largest recovered density within our data of nH ≈ 107 cm−3
whilst also exhibiting one of the lowest recovered
temperatures at Tkin ≈ 60 K. G5's high density
is sufficient to overcome tidal effects prohibiting
the object from being gravitational bound. Basic
mass estimates also support this finding.
• Another position of chemical interest is K13a.
K13a shows detections of SiO (8 7 – 7 6) and
SO (7 – 6) as well as OCS (25 – 24) - the only other
position other than G2 to exhibit the OCS line.
K13a is located along a ridge of the CND that is
interacting with the Galactic Centre Mini Spiral.
Further follow up study is required to understand
the role that the ionised gas within the Galactic
Centre Mini Spiral plays in the chemistry of this
ridge.
• Using a similar mass derivation approach, we find
that the total molecular gas mass contained within
