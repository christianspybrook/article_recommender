ABSTRACT

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to discover tens of millions of
quasars. A significant fraction of these could be powered by coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries, since many quasars
are believed to be triggered by mergers. We show that under plausible assumptions about the luminosity functions, lifetimes,
and binary fractions of quasars, we expect the full LSST quasar catalogue to contain between 20-100 million compact MBH
binaries with masses M = 105−9 M , redshifts z = 0 − 6, and orbital periods P = 1 − 70 days. Their light-curves are expected
to be distinctly periodic, which can be confidently distinguished from stochastic red-noise variability, because LSST will cover
dozens, or even hundreds of cycles. A very small subset of 10-150 ultra-compact (P <
∼ 1 day) binary quasars among these will,
over ∼5-15 years, evolve into the mHz gravitational-wave (GW) frequency band and can be detected by LISA. They can therefore
be regarded as "LISA verification binaries", analogous to short-period Galactic compact-object binaries. The practical question
is how to find these handful of "needles in the haystack" among the large number of quasars: this will likely require a tailored
co-adding analysis optimised for this purpose.
Key words: quasars: general – galaxies: active – gravitational waves

1 INTRODUCTION
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA; Amaro-Seoane et al.
2017) is currently planned for launch in the mid 2030s and is expected
to discover gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing massive black
hole (MBH) binaries with component masses ≈ 104 − 107 M out
to high redshifts. It has been widely recognised that detecting the
electromagnetic (EM) emission from these binaries, in addition to
their GWs, will enable a significant range of novel science investigations, ranging from a better understanding accretion onto BHs, to
the connection between MBHs and their host galaxies, and to new
tests of general relativity (Baker et al. 2019).
The EM emission from a LISA source could be searched for in
follow-up observations to LISA events, or possibly by EM observations during the late inspiral stage, triggered by a LISA alert (Kocsis
et al. 2008). This is different from the situation for Galactic whitedwarf binaries, for which several are now known that will be detectable by LISA - the so-called "Verification Binaries" (see Burdge
et al. 2020, and references therein).
Here we suggest that MBH binaries detectable by LISA may also
be identified prior to LISA's launch, among the large number of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) expected to be catalogued by the Vera
C Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
Since most major galaxies contain nuclear MBHs (Kormendy & Ho
2013), and in hierarchical structure formation, galaxies are built up
via mergers, pairs of MBHs should be commonly found in galactic
nuclei. MBHs are expected to rapidly sink to the nucleus of the new
galaxy and form a gravitationally bound binary (Begelman et al.
1980). Furthermore, torques during galaxy mergers are understood

to drive gas to the nucleus of the new galaxy (Barnes & Hernquist
1991), and bright and relatively short-lived quasar phases can be
triggered by mergers (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Alexander &
Hickox 2012). The association between galaxy mergers and AGN
activity is also supported by observation (Goulding et al. 2018).
Over the past decade, hydrodynamical simulations of binary BHs
with circumbinary discs have reached the consensus that a binary
can continue accreting efficiently from the disc, via narrow, collimated gas streams, essentially at the same rate as a single MBH
would (D'Orazio et al. 2013; Farris et al. 2014; Shi & Krolik 2015;
Miranda et al. 2017). Moreover, efficient accretion has been shown
to persist all the way to merger (Farris et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2018;
Bowen et al. 2018, 2019). The light-curves of MBHBs can therefore
be expected to be as bright as quasars, but should contain significant
periodicities, due either to hydrodynamical modulations of the accretion rate (as shown in the above simulations), and/or due to relativistic
Doppler and lensing modulations of the apparent flux (Bogdanović
et al. 2011; D'Orazio et al. 2015; Haiman 2017; D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018). As a result, MBH binaries may be identifiable in timedomain AGN surveys as a population of periodic quasars (Haiman
et al. 2009).
In recent years, significant effort has indeed been invested to find
periodic quasars in large time-domain quasar catalogues, e.g. in the
Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS; Graham et al. 2015),
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; Charisi et al. 2016, and in a
joint analysis of the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (DES+SDSS; Chen et al. 2020. (See the recent review by De
Rosa et al. 2019 for a more complete summary.)
These efforts have identified ≈ 200 periodic candidates among

O (105 ) quasars, with BH masses of 108−9 M and putative periods
ranging from several months to a few years. This roughly matches
expectations: massive binary BHs are expected to spend O (105 ) years
at periodicities of order a year, if their orbital decay is driven either
by GW emission or by negative torques exerted by the surrounding
gas disc on the viscous timescale; Haiman et al. 2009). If quasars
typically live for a few ×107 years (Martini & Schneider 2004), then
we might expect a fraction of few ×10−3 to be in this stage.
The LSST is expected to deliver a revolutionary large sample of at
least tens of millions of quasars, each with well-sampled light-curves
at high cadence (i.e every few days). These two novel characteristics
will allow a search for MBH binaries with much shorter-periods,
which are correspondingly much rarer.
In this paper, we suggest that it may be possible to identify ultrashort-period MBH binaries in the LSST quasar catalogue, which are
so compact that they will "chirp" – i.e. evolve in frequency – into the
mHz GW band, where LISA can subsequently detect them several
years later. If so, these sources would be the massive BH analogues of
the Galactic "Verification Binaries". We will argue that this is possible under plausible assumptions about the luminosity functions,
lifetimes, and binary fractions of quasars. In particular, if (i) the faint
of end of the quasar luminosity function is steep and can be extrapolated down luminosities corresponding to BH masses of ∼ 105 M ,
(ii) most quasars are associated with merging MBH binaries, and (iii)
8
quasar lifetimes are relatively short (<
∼ 10 years), then we expect the
LSST's quasar catalogue to contain several such ultra-compact MBH
binaries with periods <
∼ day. Most of these "Verification Binaries"
will lie below LSST's single-snapshot flux detection threshold, and
identifying them will likely require co-adding individual snapshots
in an optimised way.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In § 2, we discuss our
basic methodology, which consists of adopting a quasar luminosity
function (§ 2.1), computing the corresponding LSST quasar number
counts (§ 2.2), and considering detectability by LISA (§ 2.3. In § 3, we
present our main results, i.e. the expected number of LISA-detectable
MBH binaries among the LSST quasars, as well as how these results
depend on the assumed quasar lifetime and typical binary mass ratio.
In § 4, we further discuss several caveats and implications of our
results, including the requirements for co-adding LSST data and
folding quasar light-curves. Finally, our conclusions are summarised
in § 5.

day) periods, will evolve into the mHz GW band, where they can
be discovered by LISA after accumulating sufficient signal-to-noise
ratio. To find potential LISA detections of ultra-short–period quasars
in LSST, we first estimate the number of binary quasars in LSST,
and then employ the most up-to-date LISA sensitivity curve from
Robson et al. 2019. We record a complete set of acceptable orbital
periods within the LISA frequency band. Finally, we compute the
number of binaries detectable by LISA that is obtained from a simple
relationship between the binary merger time and the total quasar
lifetime.

2.1 Quasar Luminosity Functions
The number of luminous quasars is given directly by the quasar
luminosity function (QLF). Quasars are considered to be produced by
accretion onto massive black holes at the centres of galaxies (LyndenBell 1969), and their activity is thought to be often triggered by
the merger of two galaxies, delivering fuel to the nucleus, activating
accretion (e.g. Barnes & Hernquist 1991) Quasar LFs can therefore be
used to determine the abundance of MBHs at different cosmological
redshifts. Since both merging galaxies triggering the quasar activity
are believed to typically contain nuclear MBHs, a large fraction of
quasars could contain binary MBHs (e.g. Haiman et al. 2009; Dotti
et al. 2015).
Over the last few decades, a large amount of work has gone into
understanding the shape and evolution of the QLFs throughout cosmic history. In this paper, we have chosen to use the QLFs reported
in Kulkarni et al. (2019, hereafter K19), for several reasons. K19 is
based on a recent comprehensive compilation, implementing QLFs
from a large homogenised AGN sample across a wide range of redshifts, up to z∼7. Their LFs are also conveniently given in the form
of simple broken power-laws as a function of absolute magnitude,
with the band-pass conversions from apparent optical magnitudes to
absolute magnitude explicitly provided (i.e. their Fig.2). This latter
feature is especially convenient, since it allows us to directly use them
to compute the number of quasars expected to be observed by LSST
above a given apparent magnitude threshold.1
As mentioned above, K19 use a double power–law (PL) to fit the
space density of quasars versus apparent magnitude. There are four
parameters that define the double PL, which vary as functions of
redshift,
φ(M) =

2 METHOD
The efforts in large surveys of active galactic nuclei (AGN), including bright quasars, have been growing remarkably in the last few
decades. This is reflected not only in the significant expansion of
quasar samples, up to a size of a ∼ million sources (Flesch 2019), but
also in the depth of individual surveys (see compilation in Kulkarni
et al. 2019). The upcoming LSST will offer a major improvement in
the observations of quasars in survey area and depth, as well as in
variability information, with the light-curves of most sources sampled at high cadence (of order days) over several years (LSST Science
Collaboration et al. 2009; Ivezić et al. 2019). In this section, we introduce the quasar luminosity functions we use to approximate the
number of quasars that LSST is expected discover.
A fraction of variable quasars in LSST might be compact massive
black hole binaries (MBHBs), produced in mergers which triggered
the quasar activity (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Haiman et al. 2009)
and emitting gravitational waves (GWs) prior to their coalescence.

This is unlike the case for the large majority of other QLF determinations
in the literature (e.g. Shen et al. 2020, and references therein), which quote
QLFs only as a function of absolute magnitude or luminosity, which would
make it necessary for us to "undo" the band flux → luminosity computations
in those works.

redshift bins with central values as indicated in each panel. The fiducial
results from K19 are reproduced by the dashed curves. Our LFs with the four
parameters interpolated smoothly across different redshifts are shown by the
solid curves. The red circles and their error bars represent the binned AGN
data used in K19. The regions in shade blue indicate the upper and lower
uncertainties in LFs obtained from interpolating the error bars in Figure 1.

2.2 The Number of Short–Period Quasars in LSST
steepening of β at z ∼ 2.5 and dramatic flattening near this redshift
are likely unphysical and instead indicate a mismatch between the
BOSS and SDSS+2SLAQ surveys due to systematic errors induced
by their selection functions. Likewise, the outliers at low redshift
(z < 0.6; also shown as empty circles) result from uncertainties in
the correction for host galaxy light and potentially missed AGN in
extended sources. As a result, we follow K19, who excluded these
points from fitting parametric redshift-dependent QLFs, and also
neglect these points (i.e. all open circles) in our fiducial analysis.
Instead, we interpolate the remaining reliable points (solid circles
Fig. 1), and obtain values of each parameter as smooth functions
of redshift. Specifically, we fit 2nd and 3rd order polynomials to the
solid circles in the top panels from left to right and straight lines in
the bottom panels. We find that using higher-order polynomials is
not warranted.
We demonstrate the QLFs obtained from these fits in 9 randomly
selected redshift bins between 0.1 < z < 6 with bins centred at
z = {0.31, 0.50, 1.10, 1.50, 1.98, 2.45, 2.95, 3.88, 4.92} and widths
Δz ≈0.2-0.4. These redshift bins are adopted from Table 2 in K19
and can be used to compare our QLFs to theirs, as shown in Figure 2.
We compare the double PLs with parameters found in K19 (dashed)
and those with our newly interpolated parameters (solid) as functions
of absolute UV magnitude (at rest-frame λ1450Å). We also colour the
uncertainty regions in each panel in blue, using the interpolated upper
and lower errors shown in Figure 1. While K19 base their analysis
on a large compilation of AGN samples from different surveys, each
sample is categorised into smaller magnitude bin(s). We superimpose
the binned AGN data in red, where the shape of the LF is directly
measured (and thus more reliable) than at either fainter or brighter
magnitudes, where they are extrapolated. The interpolated curves
show a larger degree of continuity in both the bright– and the faint–
end slopes across different redshift.

As mentioned above, the Rubin Observatory's LSST is expected
to discover a large number of quasars. An early estimate for these
numbers which fold in the expected completeness as a function of
redshift and apparent magnitude indicate that ∼ 20 million quasars
in total can be identified in single-exposure images (LSST Science
Collaboration et al. 2009). This number is estimated by integrating
the quasar LF (e.g. Eq. 1), over the desired magnitude and redshift
intervals. The predictions in LSST Science Collaboration et al. (2009)
were based on the earlier QLF determinations by Hopkins et al.
(2007).
Here we re-compute the number of quasars in a magnitude and
redshift range, N = N (m min , m max ; z min , zmax ). We convert the
absolute UV magnitude (M1450 ) to apparent i–band magnitude, allowing us to relate the mass of the black holes to their observed
abundance. We adopt the bandpass K-corrections from K19 (who,
in turn, adopt it from Lusso et al. 2015, shown in their Fig. 2),
which conveniently directly converts M1450 to apparent i-mag.
N (m min , m max ; z min , zmax ) is then given by

where f (m, z) is the selection function characterising the completeness, i.e. the fraction of selected AGNs to the true number of AGNs in
a certain volume and magnitude range. The selection function needs
to account for all of the ways that AGNs are identified in LSST, i.e. via
colours, the lack of proper motion, variability and combinations with
other multi-wavelength surveys (LSST Science Collaboration et al.
2009). In general, this makes selection complex, with f a function of
the magnitude and redshift ranging from 0 to 1. In this analysis, we
approximate f (M, z) as a step function, with f = 0 at magnitudes
above (fainter) than a threshold m i and f = 1 for brighter quasars.

Integrating the LF between redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 6 and i–magnitudes
16 ≤ m ≤ 24 (i.e. adopting a threshold m i = 24), we find N = 20
million quasars in total. Extending the magnitude limit it m i ≤ 26,
the number increases to 100 million.
In Figure 3, we show our prediction of N in 11 different imagnitude bins (obtained numerically be evaluating N at 50 evenly
separated values of z for each m i ). For reference, we again show a
comparison with predictions based on K19's original QLF determinations (dashed curves) and also the number counts from LSST's
Science Book (blue dot-dashed curves). The predictions generally
agree with those by LSST, especially at the redshifts most relevant
to possible LISA detections (z <
∼2-3; see below). The vertical shaded
orange bands in this figure shows the redshift ranges covered by the
AGN samples used to fit the QLFs; redshifts outside these bands
represent extrapolations.
For the rest of the analysis, we assume that the majority of the
quasars are associated with massive black hole binary mergers. More
generally, the number of binaries throughout this paper simply scales
linearly with the fraction of quasars fQ,b associated with coalescing
black holes. We further assume that the last stages of the MBH
binary merger falls within the bright quasar phase. This is justified
by the the expected availability of gas in the nuclei of merger-remnant
MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2020)

galaxies, and by recent hydrodynamical simulations of inspiralling
MBHs with circumbinary discs (Farris et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2018;
Bowen et al. 2018). These studies found that while the coalescing
binary creates a low-density central cavity in the accretion disc, the
MBHs can nevertheless be fuelled efficiently, all the way to their
merger, via mini-discs fed by narrow accretion streams. Finally, we
assume that quasars typically have a total lifetime of tQ ∼ few × 107
years (independent of redshift and luminosity), and that they spend
a duration of t (P) at orbital period P. Under these assumptions, the
number of quasars with orbital periods P is given approximately by
N (P) ≈ t (P)/t Q fQ,b N .
The time t (P) that a MBH binary spends at period P, for the compact binaries of interest for LISA, is determined by its GW emission,
and depends on the BH masses. To translate the apparent i-magnitude
into the total mass of binary BHs, we need to assume a quasar luminosity - BH mass relation. Note that the masses relevant for LISA are
between ∼ 105 and ∼ 109 M , with lower-mass binaries dominating
the majority of the population (e.g. Klein et al. 2016, and references
therein). We adopt the relationship between i–magnitude and total
BH mass Mbh based on a typical quasar spectral energy distribution,
and a bolometric quasar luminosity L = fEdd L Edd , where L Edd is
the Eddington luminosity for mass Mbh (Haiman et al. 2009),

binary counts are tabulated on a 50×50 grid in the Mbh –z plane.

To decide which MBH binaries can be detectable by LISA, we use the
recent LISA sensitivity curve reported in Robson et al. (2019), which
gives the total instrumental noise, as well as the stochastic noise
due to the presence of unresolved Galactic binaries. Detectability by
LISA essentially requires that the MBH binary, identified in LSST as
an ultra-short-periodic quasar, evolves into LISA's frequency band
during the time when LISA is operational. At the short periods of
O(days) relevant for our discussion, the binary inspiral is expected
to be dominated by GW emission (see below). In general, it will
take at least several weeks for LSST to identify periodicity with
P = O(days) (since N >
∼ 20 periods are required; see, e.g. Vaughan
et al. 2016), and possibly longer if co-adding data from multiple
LSST visits and phase-folding of the light-curve is needed. LSST is
currently expected to start survey operations in the mid 2020's and
LISA is currently expected to be launched in the mid 2030's, with a
total mission lifetime of 5 years, i.e. ending operations in the early
2040's. Our requirement is therefore approximately that the time
elapsed between the discovery of a periodic source by LSST, and the
time it enters the LISA band, should be between 5-15 years.
For illustration, we reproduce LISA's sensitivity curve in Figure 4.
The vertical red and orange dashed lines mark the possible range of
the "frequency wall", below which LISA's sensitivity is expected to
degrade rapidly. We also show illustrative examples of the evolution
of MBH binaries assuming a 5–year LISA mission lifetime. The
tracks of binaries with primary masses of M1 = 105 M , 106 M and
107 M and redshift z = 1, 3 and 5 are plotted, all with a mass ratio
√
of q ≡ M2 /M1 = 0.1. The characteristic strain h c is given by nh,
where n is the number of cycles spent at each frequency, and h is
the GW strain averaged over sky location and polarisations (see, e.g.
Sesana et al. 2005),

the binary is observed to be tm = 1 year, 1 week and 1 day away from merger.
The black curve shows LISA's nominal sensitivity from Robson et al. 2019,
assuming a mission duration of 5 years. The red and orange vertical dashed
lines at 10−5 and 10−4 Hz mark the possible range of a "frequency wall"
below which LISA's sensitivity is expected to degrade significantly.

the LISA sensitivity curve constrains the range of masses Mbh , mass
ratios q, redshifts z and orbital periods P of the LSST candidates that
satisfy this criterion. Given the uncertainties in the time at which the
binaries may be identified in LSST and in the timing of the launch
and duration of the LISA mission, for simplicity we instead require
that the time to merger is t m = 5 − 15 years. As Figure 4 shows, most
binaries with masses detectable by LSST are also well above LISA's
sensitivity curve just prior to their merger. The exceptions are the

most massive BHs (>
∼ 10 M ) at high redshifts (z ∼ 5) which may
merge at frequencies below LISA's frequency wall. These binaries
are excluded from our counts below, but they constitute a very small
fraction of the LSST quasar sample to begin with.

where G is Newton's constant and c is the speed of light. The time to
merger in the binary's rest-frame is tm,r = (3/8) fr / f¤r and the observed
time to merger is t m = (1 + z)t m,r .
Binaries with t m >
∼ 5 yr accumulate signal-to-noise ratio at each
frequency for the full assumed LISA mission duration of 5 years,
while binaries closer to merger spend less than this time at each
frequency. This results in the "knees" in Figure 4 at the observed
frequencies that correspond to t m ≈ 5 yr. The diamonds from left to
right mark the frequencies at which the MBHB is observed to be 1
year, 1 week and 1 day to merger, and the evolution of each track
is terminated at the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO). These examples assume binary BH mass ratios of q = 0.1
for illustration.
As mentioned above, we will require LSST-identified MBH binaries to enter the LISA band 5-15 years after their discovery. In general,

In this section, we present our results for the total number of quasars
that LSST can discover in its multi-year survey (§ 3.1), and the ultrashort period subset of these quasars that may correspond to compact
MBH binaries and will subsequently be detectable by LISA (§ 3.2).

3.1 Quasars number counts in LSST
Our predictions of the total number of quasars in LSST, described in
§ 2.1 and § 2.2 are shown in Figure 3. In total, we find approximately
19−100 million quasars down to the magnitude limits of m i = 24−26.
The number counts we find are generally somewhat higher than those
predicted by the original QLF in K19. The difference from K19
at most redshifts and magnitudes are nevertheless small, and arise
only from our smoothly interpolating the best-fit double-power-law
parameters, which we consider more physical. The large majority of
quasars are at faint magnitudes m i >
∼ 24, where our counts agree

3.2 The number of "verification binaries" detectable by LISA
As explained in the previous section, we hypothesise that a fraction f (t m ) of the quasars N in the LSST catalogue are powered by
ultra-compact, inspiralling MBH binaries which will enter the LISA
frequency band and merge within the time tm after their discovery,
with t m between 5 and 15 years. This fraction is extremely small,
since we have to "catch" a quasar during the last ∼ 5 − 15 years of its
life. The fraction can simply be approximated by the ratio f (t m ) = t m
/ t Q , so that if quasars have average lifetimes of tQ = 107 years, and
we require a MBH binary system to be within 10 years of its merger,
i.e. tm = 10 years, this fraction is 10−6 .
More generally, the number of LISA-detectable quasars, NLISA =
[t m / t Q ] fQ,b N simply scales linearly both with this ratio (t m / t Q ),
and with the assumed fraction fQ,b of quasars associated with binary
MBH mergers to begin with, and can be trivially adjusted for any
other assumed quasar lifetime, different time-to-merger of the MBH
binary, or overall binary fraction.
We compute the characteristic strains (h c ) of the hypothetical
binaries in the (Mbh , z) plane, where we assume that the binaries
have a t m =5 yr (observer frame) time to merger. We then compare
their characteristic strains to the LISA sensitivity curve, shown in
Figure 4. We find that the evolutionary track h c of 99% of the objects
eventually crosses the sensitivity curve and the 10−5 Hz "frequency
wall" and reaches the ISCO frequency above it. The only exceptions
7−9
are the most massive binaries with Mbh >
∼ few × 10 M (with the
threshold mass depending on the adopted location of the frequency
wall), which merge at frequencies below LISA's sensitivity band.
However, these massive BHs comprise <
∼ 1% of all LSST quasars.
We show NLISA = NLISA (MBH , z), under the assumption of tm =
5 yr and tQ = 107 yr, in Figure 5 in the (MBH , z) plane. Most objects

with K19 nearly exactly. As another point of reference, in Figure 3
we also show the number counts forecast by the LSST, and quoted
in Table 10.2 in Version 2.0 of their Science Book LSST Science
Collaboration et al. (2009). As the figure shows, the number counts
we predict at the faint end are significantly above those in the LSST
Science Book at these faint magnitudes.
More specifically, down to m i = 24, which corresponds to the
magnitude limit in a single-night LSST exposure (consisting of
two separate visits), we predict that LSST will discover 19 million
quasars, compared with ∼ 8.4 million in LSST Science Collaboration et al. (2009). LSST will predominantly observe MBHs of low
masses (∼ 105−6 M ) due to the steepness of the faint–end slope of
the quasar LFs. For this reason, we extrapolate the LFs to fainter
magnitudes, beyond m i = 24 in Figure 3, where no data is gathered
in K19. By co-adding data from many visits during its full multiyear survey, LSST might discover objects as faint as m i = 26. By
integrating the QLFs between redshift 0.5 to 6.5 and 16 ≤ m i ≤ 26,
we find 100 million quasars compared to 16.7 million in the LSST
Science Collaboration et al. 2009. Our numbers are ∼ 6 times higher
because we adopted a QLF with a steeper faint-end slope, and because we included BH's with masses down to ∼ 105 M (see Fig. 5
and detailed discussion of this discrepancy in § 4.1 below). Beyond
z ∼ 6, the bandpass K-correction is not available to convert absolute magnitude to apparent magnitude. So in order to evaluate the
number of quasars at high redshift, using eq. 2, we extrapolate the
K-correction with a straight line to cover 6 < z < 7.5. A very small
fraction of the total number is found at high redshift – we predict
approximately 38,000, 10,000 and 3,300 quasars down to m i = 26,
25 and 24, respectively, in this redshift range 6 < z < 7.5.

Figure 5. Number of MBH binary candidates identified as periodic quasars
in LSST, which can subsequently be detected by LISA. The contours are in
units of per logMbh per z. The top panel shows NLISA integrated over all
BH masses, while the right panel shows NLISA summed over all redshifts.
Imposing "frequency walls" for LISA at fobs > 10−4 Hz (orange) or > 10−5
Hz (red) translates to upper limits on the MBH binary masses shown by the
lines with downward arrows. The light grey, medium grey and black curves
correspond to LSST detection thresholds of mi = 24, 25, and 26, respectively.
This model assumes an observed time to merger of tm = 5 years and a typical
quasar lifetime of tQ = 107 years. The predicted numbers scale linearly with
tm /tQ .

concentrate at z ≈ 2 at the low-mass end with Mbh = few × 105 M ,
which corresponds to the faint end of the QLF (m = 26). This is
unsurprising, given the steep faint-end slope of the QLF. In this
figure, we also show the histograms of NLISA integrated over all
masses in the top panel, and that integrated over all redshifts in
the right panel. We observe a peak of NLISA around z=2, which is
consistent with the peak of the luminosity function (φ★) in Figure 2.
We find that LISA will detect a total of 50 quasars from the full LSST
catalogue, down to m = 26.
Unfortunately, not all 50 of these objects can be detected, due to
further constraints. First, the possible "frequency wall" of LISA could
impose upper limits on the mass of the binary, above which binaries
merge at too low frequencies to be detected. We mark the mass limits
induced by the range of a possible frequency wall in Figure 5. As
the wall moves from 10−5 Hz (red) to 10−4 Hz (orange), lower-mass
binaries become detectable. However, this has only a minor influence
on the total number, because the majority of LISA-detectable sources
concentrate at the low-mass region.
Additionally, one should take into account the uncertainty on how
faint LSST would be able to observe quasars and identify their periodicity. The duration of observation required to identify periodic
quasars will generally vary from one object to the other, depending
on magnitude and period, as well as the nature of the stochastic red
noise for each individual quasar. The nominal single-night detection
threshold for quasars is m i ≈ 24 (LSST Science Collaboration et al.
2009). This corresponds to the mass limit shown by the light grey
curve in Figure 5. Only objects with masses above this line can be
detected by LSST in a single night. This cut would eliminate the large
6
majority of fainter, lower-mass systems (Mbh <
∼ 10 M at z ≈ 2),
leaving 19.4 million sources in total, of which ∼10 are detectable by
LISA. However, this cut is overly conservative, because as data is accumulated over its full multi-year survey, LSST will be able to reach

fainter magnitude limits. As a rough estimate, we consider m i = 26 as
this deeper magnitude limit, shown by the black line in Figure 5, and
for reference, the medium grey line marks an intermediate threshold
m i = 25. We report the total number of quasars left after imposing
combinations of these constraints in Table 1, and further discuss the
issue of co-adding LSST data from multiple visits of the same field
in § 4.2 below.
We should also emphasise that low-mass MBH binaries with short
orbital periods of <
∼ 3 days dominate the LISA-detectable sample.
The distributions of orbital periods of binaries t m = 5 (black) and 15
(maroon) years prior to merger are shown in Figure 6. We zoom in
around the peaks of the two distributions in the inset figure, where
the periods are shorter than 2 days.
The period-distributions are also of more general interest, going beyond the short-period binaries detectable by LISA. Under
our assumptions, quasars associated with binaries have lifetimes up
to t Q , and therefore their merger time t m can be range between
0 ≤ t m ≤ t Q . Assuming further that the binaries inspiral purely
due to GW emission, this yields a maximum orbital period (Pmax )
defined by t m = (3/8) (1 + z) fr / f¤r as t m → t Q , and f¤r is given by
eq. 7. Note that the observed period is P = 2(1 + z)/ fr , where fr is
the rest-frame GW frequency. We show the number of quasars expected as a function of apparent magnitude m i and observed orbital
periods 0 < P < 200 days in Figure 7, at four redshifts, z = 1, 2, 3
and 4, and assuming t Q = 107 years. Note that at low redshifts, the
bottom right region (marked in hatched red) corresponds to periods
P > Pmax , where binary quasars do not exist in our simplistic model.
More generally, the period-distributions can be altered at large binary separations/periods, where the circumbinary gas can dominate
the orbital evolution over GW emission (at periods as low as a ∼
week for the faintest quasars whose BH masses are ∼ 105 M ; see,
e.g., Fig.1 in Haiman et al. 2009).

Figure 7. Expected number of quasars, N (log-scale), as a function of apparent magnitude mi and observed orbital period P at four different redshifts z = 1, 2, 3
and 4. The contours are in units of per magnitude per redshift per day, and the period-distribution assumes the binaries are inspiralling due to GWs. Binary
quasars in the lower right at z = 1 and z = 2 (shown in hatched red) have GW inspiral times longer than the fiducial quasar lifetime of tQ = 107 years and do
not exist in our simple population model.

4 DISCUSSION
The results presented in the previous section demonstrate that there
may be 10-150 "LISA Verification Binaries" in the LSST quasar catalogues. Here the lowest (10) number is for a conservative magnitude
limit of m i = 24, and adopts (t m /t Q ) fQ,b = 5 × 10−8 - this may
correspond, for example, t m = 5 years, t Q = 3 × 107 years, and
fQ,b =0.3. The high-end (150) is for a more aggressive magnitude
limit of m i = 26, and adopts (t m /t Q ) fQ,b = 1.5 × 10−7 , which may
correspond to t m = 15 years, t Q = 3 × 107 years, and fQ,b =0.3.
These numbers rely on several assumptions, beyond the choices of
t m , t Q , and fQ,b on which the counts just depend linearly. Here we
discuss the main assumptions and related issues.

4.1 Uncertainties in the quasar luminosity function
As mentioned in the previous section, the LSST Science Book forecasts a total of 16.7 million quasars, which is ∼ 6 times lower than
the number we find down to the limiting magnitude of m i = 26.
The first item we note is that the LSST Science Book value includes
an absolute magnitude limit of Mi < −20 (corresponding to a BH
5
mass of >
∼ 5 × 10 M ). We have chosen not to include this cut,
MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2020)

as recent years have revealed increasing evidence for the existence
of low-mass BHs in galactic nuclei (see next subsection). To assess
the importance of this cut, the grey dashed curve in Figure 3 shows
our predicted counts but with the same Mi < −20 cut imposed. This
reduces our predictions from 19.4-100.3 million to 18.6-78.7 million
quasars, still leaving a factor of 78.7/16.7=4.7 difference.
Next, the LSST Science Book predictions used an earlier QLF
determination by Hopkins et al. (2007), so we assess how much our
predictions would change if we used the same QLF. Unfortunately,
a precise comparison is difficult, since Hopkins et al. (2007) gives
the QLF for the bolometric luminosity L bol . However, using Runnoe
et al. (2012) to convert L 1450 to L bol at z = 2, we find that our counts
are reduced by a factor of 1.3, 2.2, and 3.8 at m i = 24, 25, and 26,
respectively. We therefore conclude that our higher number counts,
compared to the LSST Science Book, can be attributed almost entirely to the different adopted QLFs. Additional, smaller differences
could result from our simplified selection function. Note, in particular, that LSST's single-image detection efficiency incorporates selections via colours, lack of proper motion, variability, and combinations
with external data, and drops below unity at m i = 24 − 25 (Ivezić
et al. 2014).
To be more specific, the faint-end slope of the Hopkins et al.

Periodic Quasars in LSST as future LISA sources
(2007) LF at z = 2, β = −1.27 (their Table 3) is much shallower
than the slope β = −1.98 in K19, and the one we adopted after
interpolating between redshifts (β = −1.9). The faint-end slope in
Hopkins et al. (2007) was determined from the 2QZ survey (Croom
et al. 2004), while K19 used data from the more recent and deeper
2SLAQ survey (Croom et al. 2009). As discussed in Appendix B
in K19, this makes the faint-end slope somewhat steeper. However,
as shown in their Fig. B1, K19's faint-end slope, inferred from the
same data, is significantly steeper even than obtained by Croom
et al. (2009). This disagreement may be caused by differences in
the K-corrections, selection-functions, and choices of binning, to
which this faint-end slope is especially sensitive, and needs further
investigation. For now, we proceeded to adopt the K19-based number
counts, and simply note that there is roughly an order of magnitude
uncertainty in our predictions.
Finally, we note that there remain uncertainties in K19's LF determination itself. First, the statistical errors on the fitting parameters
are subdominant compared to the other uncertainties (as can be seen
in the blue shaded areas in Figure 2). However, choices in determining these parameters and interpolating them over redshift must
be made. After excluding the double power–law parameters that are
affected by systematic errors in the AGN sample (open circles in Figure 1; note that including these discarded data points would increase
our predicted counts), one can approximate the evolution of the four
fitting parameters as smooth functions of redshift. K19 introduce
three models in which different approaches are taken to describe the
evolution of the faint-end slope.
Given that φ★, M★ and α are fitted with quadratic, cubic and
linear functions of redshift, respectively, the faint-end slope β is
first being modelled with a double power-law in z, to account for
the discontinuity around z ∼ 3. The second model uses the same
exact procedure to find the four parameters as in the first model, but
excludes the sample of highest-redshift AGNs that only have rough
estimates of selection functions. In the last model, they again exclude
the high-z samples and approximate φ★, M★ and α with quadratic,
cubic and linear fittings, but β is approximated as a linear function
of z.
Our analysis here is closest to this third approach. If we had adopted
the other two approaches, our analysis would yield only slightly
different results, approximately by 2-3%.
4.2 Co-adding LSST data and identifying periodicity
As noted above, we employed a fiducial magnitude limit of m i = 26,
which is 2 magnitudes deeper than LSST's single-visit detection
threshold of m i ≈ 24. Over a full 10-year LSST survey, assuming
each field is visited on average every 3 days, or ∼ 100 visits per year,
we could naively expect that co-adding √
these ∼ 1000 visits can lower
the detection threshold by a factor of ≈ 1000 ≈ 30 in flux, or by 3.7
magnitudes. On the other hand, co-adding every visit into a single
effective combined exposure would make it impossible to detect any
periodicity. As a rough estimate for a possible compromise, m i = 26
represents the magnitude limit after co-adding ∼ 30 visits. This
effectively leaves ∼ 30 independent data-points (each a co-add of 30
visits), which may facilitate both the detection of a faint, sub-singleexposure quasar and the identification of its periodicity.
Securely identifying the periodicity will require a dedicated analysis. The expected periods are 1-2 days, which is comparable but
somewhat shorter than the time between individual visits. For precisely uniform time-sampling, these periods would fall below the
Nyquist limit and could not be detected. However, the LSST time
sampling will not be uniform, with a pair of exposures during each

9

overnight visit, and somewhat different times elapsing between successive exposures. This should, enable, at least in principle, to fold
the effective light-curves and detect 1-2-day periodicities. Co-adding
different exposures will introduce a trade-off between going deeper
(which allows LSST to discover many more quasars) but having effectively fewer points sampling the light-curve (which makes it harder
to detect periodicities). One can also imagine that choices of which
sets of (not just how many) individual exposures to co-add and combine into single effective data-points will also affect the efficiency
of a periodicity search. The optimal approach to such co-adding and
light-curve-folding will require a detailed dedicated analysis, which
we plan to perform in a follow-up publication.
4.3 Massive black holes below ≈ 106 M
As mentioned above, in our analysis we have chosen to include
quasars with BH masses down to a few ×105 M . Excluding quasars
fainter than Mi = −20 (corresponding to BH masses below 5 ×
105 M ) would decrease our fiducial predictions from 100 million
to 79 million. This assumes Eddington ratios of fEdd in the conversion
between bolometric luminosity and BH mass; adopting a lower fEdd
would imply larger Mbh .
While early dynamical searches for low-mass MBHs yielded nondetections, several campaigns in recent years have shown that a
high fraction (50-80%) of small galaxies (with masses of Mgal ∼
109−10 M ) harbour nuclear MBHs with masses down to at least
Mbh ≈ 105 M . Furthermore, these BHs obey the scaling relations
such as between Mbh and σ (the host's velocity dispersion) seen at
higher masses (see the recent review by Greene et al. 2020, and references therein), and these low-mass MBHs are found among luminous
AGN (e.g. Kimbrell et al. 2021, and references therein). Based on
these results, we included MBHs down to these lower masses.

4.4 Quasar lifetime and relation to MBH binaries
Our analysis here is based on the simplified notion that quasars are
often activated by galaxy mergers, and that quasars are therefore are
related to MBH binaries. As argued in the Introduction, the connection between quasars and mergers are based in part on theoretical
modelling, which helps explain the evolution of the QLF over cosmic time - particularly the rise and fall in quasar activity, and its
peak at z ∼ 2 (e.g. Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000). There is also
well-established theoretical (e.g. Barnes & Hernquist 1991) and empirical (e.g. Genzel et al. 2010) support that major mergers drive
gas to galactic nuclei and that they are associated with AGN (e.g.
Goulding et al. 2018).
It also seems inevitable that both MBHs, contained in the two
merging galaxies, end up rapidly shrinking to the nucleus of the
new merger-remnant galaxy (e.g. Begelman et al. 1980). However,
there remains a major uncertainty about the precise relative timing
of the quasar phase and the inspiral and eventual merger of the
MBH binary. The duration of the bright quasar phase is known to
last ∼ 106−8 years (e.g. Martini 2004), while the inspiral time of
the binary remains poorly understood. Simple timescale arguments,
associated the inspiral timescale with a modified viscous timescale
of the AGN disk itself suggest that the coalescence of a compact
MBH binary in the gas-rich nucleus of a merger remnant may be
comparably short (Haiman et al. 2009). It is plausible to assume
that the MBH merger takes place during the luminous quasar stage,
and the statistics of periodic quasar candidates to date, listed in the
Introduction, are consistent with this assumption. Nevertheless, we
MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2020)

10

Xin & Haiman

emphasise that this remains a key assumption that is currently poorly
understood, but which will be tested by the LSST quasar variability
data.
Assuming that the mergers of MBH binaries coincide with luminous quasar phases allows us to forego modelling of the evolving
MBH binary population (e.g. based on underlying galaxy merger
trees; Kelley et al. 2019), and directly predict their number from the
observed quasar luminosity functions.

Our conclusions are subject to several caveats, primarily due to the
poorly constrained faint-end slope of the quasar LF, and the details
of the analysis required to co-add single-visit LSST data to search for
the faint (m i ≈ 26) and ultra-short (P ≈ 1-2 day) period AGN. Future
work will clarify the feasibility of the discovery of these verification
binaries.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
4.5 Chirping of MBHBs in LSST
Finally, an intriguing aspect of our conclusions is that there may be
a handful of ultra-short period binary quasars in the LSST survey,
whose period progressively shortens due to their GW-driven inspiral.
Over the timescale of years, the period will change from a ∼day to
hours. As an example, the observed orbital period (twice the GW
period, P = 2/ fobs ) of a binary with a total mass of 3 × 105 M
at z = 2 (a typical "Verification Binary") will change from 2.3 days
at t m = 10 years prior to merger to 0.6 days at t m = 5 years.
Whether or not LSST data is capable of inferring this "chirp" from
the optical light-curve needs to be addressed by a dedicated analysis,
as described in § 4.2 above, but incorporating the expected rate of
period-change P¤ due to the GW emission. A secure detection of
P¤ > 0, in agreement with the expected value from the GW chirp,
could provide a smoking-gun evidence for the presence of a MBH
binary.

5 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we computed the number of faint quasars expected
to be discovered in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST, and
found it to be as large as 20-100 million, down to the apparent
magnitudes m i = 24 − 26 reached over the multi-year survey. We
further hypothesised that a small fraction f (t m ) of these sources
correspond to ultra-short period binary quasars, powered by massive
BH binaries at the last stages of their coalescence, i.e. within the time
t m prior to their merger.
Our model is based on the quasar LF derived from a recent
compilation of data from multiple AGN surveys, and the simple
ansatz that the late-stage merging fraction is given by the product
f (t m ) = (t m /t Q ) fQ,b . This expresses the product of the probability
of "catching" a quasar during the last t m years of its full lifetime t Q ,
and the underlying fraction fQ,b of quasars that are associated with
MBH mergers.
Our main result is that the LSST quasar catalogue may contain
a handful, and perhaps up to several hundred, such ultra-compact
binaries, which will subsequently move into LISA's mHz frequency
band, and become detectable as a GW sources. We dub these massive
BH "verification binaries", since their presence may be known before
LISA is launched – in analogy with a handful of known Galactic white
dwarf verification binaries.
These results can be interpreted in the reverse direction, as well:
once LISA detects a population of MBH binaries, it will be possible
to look back in the LSST (and similar) archival data, and retroactively
search for periodicities of quasars. While in some cases, there may be
a single quasar in the three-dimensional LISA error volume (Kocsis
et al. 2006), in the majority of cases there will be several. The archival
search should offer a way to uniquely identify the true counterpart,
i.e. as the single AGN whose past periodicity matches the expected
orbital period, extrapolated back in time from the LISA detection.
