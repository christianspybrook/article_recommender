Abstract. In our previous two papers, we studied (positive) 3D gadgets in origami extrusions
which create a top face parallel to the ambient paper and two side faces sharing a ridge with two
simple outgoing pleats.
Then a natural problem comes up whether it is possible to construct a 'negative' 3D gadget from
any positive one having the same net without changing the outgoing pleats, that is, to sink the top
and two side faces of any positive 3D gadget to the reverse side without changing the outgoing
pleats. Of course, simply sinking the faces causes a tear of the paper, and thus we have to modify
the crease pattern. There are two known constructions of negative 3D gadgets before ours, but they
do not solve this problem because their outgoing pleats are different from positive ones.
In the present paper we give an affirmative solution to the above problem. For this purpose,
we present three constructions of negative 3D gadgets with a supporting triangle on the back side,
which are based on our previous ones of positive 3D gadgets. The first two are an extension of those
presented in our previous paper, and the third is new. We prove that our first and third constructions solve the problem. Our solutions enable us to deal with positive and negative 3D gadgets on
the same basis, so that we can construct from an origami extrusion constructed with 3D gadgets its
negative using the same pleats if there are no interferences among the 3D gadgets. We also treat repetition/division of negative 3D gadgets under certain conditions, which reduces their interferences
with others.
1. I NTRODUCTION
As in our previous two papers [2], [3], we are concerned with 3D gadgets in origami extrusions,
where an origami extrusion is a folding of a 3D object in the middle of a flat piece of paper, and 3D
gadgets are ingredients of origami extrusions which create faces with solid angles. In particular, we
focus on 3D gadgets with two simple outgoing pleats which create a top face parallel to the ambient
paper, and two side faces sharing a ridge, where a simple pleat is one that is formed by a mountain
and a valley fold parallel to each other. There are two known constructions of such 3D gadgets.
One is developed by Carlos Natan [4] as a generalization of the conventional cube gadget, and
these conventional 3D gadgets have a supporting pyramid on the back side. The other newer one is
presented in our previous papers [2], [3]. Our new 3D gadgets, which have flat back sides above the
ambient paper, are completely downward compatible with the conventional ones in the sense that
any conventional one can be replaced by ours with the same outgoing pleats, but the converse is not
always possible. Also, there are several advantages of our new 3D gadgets over the conventional
ones. In particular, we can change angles of the outgoing pleats under certain conditions.
Let us call the above 3D gadgets positive 3D gadgets. For the development of a given positive
3D gadget, if we forget the crease patten and only consider the net with the same orientation, we
may expect as the resulting 3D object not only the original one extruded with the 3D gadget, but
also its negative, that is, the 3D object which is constructed by sinking all faces of the original one
to the reverse side. We shall say that a 3D gadget is a negative one if it extrudes the negative of the
3D object which a positive one does.
Then the following problem naturally comes up.

Problem 1.1. We focus on positive 3D gadgets with two simple outgoing pleats which creates a top
face parallel to the ambient paper and two side faces sharing a ridge, which are all presented in [3].
Then for any given positive 3D gadget, is it possible to construct a negative one with the same net
as the positive one without changing the outgoing pleats?
For an individual positive 3D gadget, there may be a desirable negative one. For example, let
us consider a simple case of cube gadgets as shown in Figure 1.2, where 'CP' stands for 'crease
pattern' throughout this paper. Then there correspond negative 3D gadgets of two types as shown in
Figure 1.3. Although there are two known constructions of negative 3D gadgets before ours which
apply to any net of positive 3D gadgets, these constructions do not solve Problem 1.1. Indeed,
negative cube gadgets constructed by the two known constructions, which are shown in Figure 1.4,
have different outgoing pleats from those of the original ones. In these figures, the faces of the
outgoing simple pleats bounded by a mountain and a valley fold are shaded.

F IGURE 1.2. CPs of a cube extruded with the conventional and our cube gadgets

F IGURE 1.3. CPs of a negative cube extruded with the conventional and our negative cube gadgets
In the present paper we give affirmative solutions to Problem 1.1. For this purpose, we present
three constructions of negative 3D gadgets with a supporting triangle on the back side. These
constructions are based on those presented in [2] and [3], with a major difference that two supporting
flaps on the back side in the positive cases, which are called 'ears' and overlap with the side faces,
form a single triangle and do not generally overlap with the side faces in the negative cases. Among
our three constructions, the first two are an extension of those presented in [2], Section 9, and the

F IGURE 1.4. CPs of a negative cube extruded with negative cube gadgets by two
known constructions before ours
third is new. We will see that our first construction produces infinitely many negative 3D gadgets
for any positive one in Problem 1.1, while our third one gives a unique negative 3D gadget.
Our solutions to Problem 1.1 enables us to deal with positive and negative 3D gadgets on the
same basis. Thus from an origami extrusion constructed with 3D gadgets, may they be a mixture of
positive and negative ones, we can construct its negative if there are no interferences among the 3D
gadgets.
We will also review two known constructions of negative 3D gadgets before ours because they
are useful in their own right. The first is well-known, and the second is presented by Cheng in [1],
for which we shall give an extension corresponding to the changes of the angles of the outgoing
pleats.
Convention 1.5. For the later convenience, we will hereafter adopt the following convention on the
standard orientation of the development for both positive and negative 3D gadgets:
For a given 3D gadget, we determine the standard side from which we see the development
so that the extruded faces lie above the ambient paper. In other words, for a negative (resp.
positive) 3D gadget we consider its development seen from the back (resp. front) side. We
add subscripts 'L' and 'R', which stand for 'left' and 'right' respectively, to the points,
lines, angles, etc. of the 3D gadget according to this orientation.
One advantage of the above convention is that a positive and a negative 3D gadget constructed
from the same development engage with each other. We have another advantage when we consider
both positive and negative 3D gadgets. If a positive and a negative 3D gadget share a side face, then
the top edge of one gadget is the bottom edge of the other. However, if we see either gadget from its
standard side, then the subscripts 'L' and 'R' of the other gadget are consistent with the orientation.
Also note that to construct the negative 3D gadget corresponding to a given positive one in Problem
1.1, we have to begin with the horizontally flipped development of the positive one.
Notation and terminology. To keep consistency with the previous papers [2] and [3], we will use
the same notation and terminology as possible as we can. For example, we use subscript σ for L
and R which stands for 'left' and 'right' respectively, and σ 0 to indicate the other side of σ, that is,

R if σ = L,
0
σ =
L if σ = R.
Also, we will denote a simple pleat as (`, m), where ` is either a mountain or a valley fold, and m
is the reverse fold.

F IGURE 1.6. Net of a 3D object which we want to extrude with a 3D gadget
Construction 1.7. We consider a net on a piece of paper as in Figure 1.6. We require the following
conditions.
(i) α < βL + βR , βL < α + βR and βR < α + βL .
(ii) α + βL + βR < 2π.
To construct a negative gadget from the above net, we prescribe its simple outgoing pleats by in−−→
troducing parameters δσ for their changes from the direction of ABσ for σ = L, R, for which we
further require the following conditions:
(iii.a) δL , δR > 0, where we take clockwise (resp. counterclockwise) direction as positive for
σ = L (resp. σ = R).
(iii.b) δσ < βσ and δσ < π/2 for σ = L, R.
(iii.c) α + βL + βR − δL − δR > π, or equivalently, γ + δL + δR < π.
In particular, if δL = δR = 0, then conditions (iii.a)–(iii.c) are simplified as
(iii) α + βL + βR > π, or equivalently, γ < π.
Then we construct creases (`L , mL ) and (`R , mR ) (resp. (`0L , mL ) and (`0R , mR )) which we prescribe as the outgoing pleats of a negative 3D gadget in Section 3 (resp. in Section 2.2) as follows,
where we regard σ as taking both L and R.

(1) Draw a ray `L starting from BL and going to the direction of ABL followed by a clockwise
−−−→
rotation by δL . Also, draw a ray `R starting from BR ang going to the direction of ABR followed
by a counterclockwise rotation by δR .
(2) Draw a perpendicular to `σ through Bσ for both σ = L, R, letting C be the intersection point.
(3) Draw a perpendicular bisector mσ to segment Bσ C for both σ = L, R, letting P be the intersection point.
(4) Draw a ray `0σ parallel to and going in the same direction as `σ and mσ , starting from C.
The resulting creases are shown as solid lines in Figure 1.8.
The following result will be crucial in Cheng's construction of negative 3D gadgets given in
Section 2.2.
Proposition 1.9. Segment AP bisects γ = ∠BL ABR . Also, we have
∠ABL P = ∠ABR P = γ/2 + δL + δR .

Proof. Since P is the excenter of 4CBL BR , segment AP is a perpendicular bisector of side BL BR
of 4ABL BR with |ABL | = |ABR |, and thus AP bisects γ. This proves the first assersion. For the
second assersion, See [3], Lemma 3.5.

We end this section with the organization of this paper. In Section 2, we review two known
constructions of negative 3D gadgets before ours. Section 2.1 gives a well-known construction of
negative 3D gadgets with one simple outgoing pleat, and Section 2.2 gives an extension of Cheng's
construction. In Section 3, we present our three constructions of negative 3D gadgets, where the first
two are an extension of those presented in [2], Section 9, and the third is new. In particular, we give
a solution to Problem 1.1 in Sections 3.1 and 3.3. Section 3.4 discusses the condition that there are
no interferences between two 3D gadgets which share a side face and include at least a negative one.
Section 4 deals with repetition/division of negative 3D gadgets under certain conditions. Finally,
we give our conclusion in Section 5.
2. K NOWN CONSTRUCTIONS OF NEGATIVE 3D GADGETS
In this section we review two known constructions of negative 3D gadgets. A basic idea common
to both constructions is to extend one side face by swinging the flap resulting from bisecting γ to
the other side face. It turns out that we can swing the flap to either side face and obtain two negative
3D gadgets for each choice of the angles. The resulting 3D gadgets are never symmetric even when
both βL = βR and δL = δR hold.
2.1. Construction with one simple pleat. This construction is simple, but the resulting pleat is
easy to loosen. Thus to stabilize the resulting extrusion, we may need to combine it with additional
folds such as twists. Also, the resulting 3D gadget has a large interference distance to other 3D
gadgets. For a development as in Figure 1.8, precreasing as in Figure 2.1 and swinging the resulting
flap formed by BL Ab and BR Ab to either side face until it extends the other side face and the
connected pleat overlaps with the ambient paper, we obtain the following construction.

(1) Draw a ray b starting from A which bisects γ.
(2) Choose τ = L or τ = R and extend kτ so that kτ starts from a point Bτ0 in b.
(3) Draw a ray cτ 0 starting from Bτ 0 , parallel to b and going in the same direction as b.

τ 0 , is calculated as
sin(γ/2)

Note also that there is no interference on the side of τ 0 .

1.8, precreasing as in Figure 2.5 and swinging the resulting the flap formed by BL AP and BR AP
to either side face and at the same time the two simple pleats to the side of `0L and `0R until the
flap extends the other side face and the two pleats overlap with the ambient paper, we obtain the
following construction.
Construction 2.6. Consider a development as in Figure 1.8, for which we require condition (i),(ii)
and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7. Then the crease pattern of the negative 3D gadget with prescribed simple outgoing pleats (`0L , mL ) and (`0R , mR ) is constructed as follows.
(1) Choose τ = L or τ = R and extend kτ so that kτ starts from a point Bτ0 in polygonal chain
AP mτ .
(2) If Bτ0 lies in mτ \ {P }, or equivalently, if βτ > γ/2 + δL + δR , then draw a line which is a
reflection of Bτ0 C across segment P C, letting Bτ0 0 be the intersection point of the line and mτ 0 .
If Bτ0 lies in AP , or equivalently, if βτ 6 γ/2 + δL + δR , then we set Bτ0 0 = Bτ0 .
(3) Draw a ray parallel to AP from Bτ 0 and let Qτ 0 be the intersection point of the ray and mτ 0 .
(4) The desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in Figure 2.7 for βτ 6 γ/2 + δL + δR and
Figure 2.8 for βτ > γ/2 + δL + δR , and the assignment of mountain and valley folds is given
in Table 2.9.

Remark 2.10. In Cheng's original construction [1], where δL = δR = 0, Qτ 0 ∈ mτ 0 in (3) was
determined so that |P C| = |CQτ 0 | (= |Bτ 0 Qτ 0 |). This is justified for δL = δR = 0 because AP
and P C form a straight line, so that P C and Bτ 0 Qτ 0 are parallel to each other with the same length.
Also note that if δL = δR = 0, then βτ + γ/2 < π always holds, and thus the case Bτ0 ∈ AP in (2)
does not occur.
Proposition 2.11. For our choice of τ in (2), we have ∠ABτ 0 Bτ0 0 = βτ .

Proof. If Bτ0 ∈ AP , then 4ABτ Bτ0 and 4ABτ 0 Bτ0 0 are congruent by Proposition 1.9, where Bτ0 =
Bτ0 0 . Thus we have ∠ABτ 0 Bτ0 0 = ∠ABτ Bτ0 = βτ . Also, if Bτ0 ∈ mτ \ {P }, then we have
∠P Bτ Bτ0 = ∠P CBτ0 = ∠P CBτ0 0 = ∠P Bτ 0 Bτ0 0 ,
so that by Proposition 1.9 again, we have
∠ABτ 0 Bτ0 0 = ∠ABτ 0 P + ∠P Bτ 0 Bτ0 0 = ∠ABτ P + ∠P Bτ Bτ0 = βτ .


This completes the proof.

For the choice of τ in (2), the extended length of the base kτ of the side face, which may cause

Note that the extended length in the first case is the same as Construction 2.2. Note also that there
is no interference on the side of τ .
Now let us check the flat-foldability around P and C. Around P , noting that
∠AP mσ − ∠CP mσ = ∠AP Bσ

for σ = L, R,

we have the flat-foldability condition
∠AP mR − ∠CP mR + ∠CP mL − ∠AP mL = ∠AP BR − ∠AP BL = 0
as desired.
To prove the flat-foldability around C, first suppose Bτ0 ∈ mτ \ {P }. Then we calculate as
∠P CBτ0 = ∠P Bτ Bτ0 = ∠ABτ Bτ0 − ∠ABτ P = βτ − γ/2 − δL − δR ,
∠Bτ0 0 CQτ 0 = ∠Bτ0 0 Bτ 0 Qτ 0 = ∠ABτ 0 Qτ 0 − ∠ABτ 0 Bτ0 0 = π − γ/2 − βτ ,
∠`0L C`0R = γ + δL + δR ,
so that we have
(2.1)

∠P CBτ0 + ∠Bτ0 0 CQτ 0 + ∠`0L C`0R = π = ∠P CBτ0 0 + ∠Qτ 0 C`0τ 0 + ∠Bτ0 C`0τ .

Next suppose Bτ0 ∈ AP . Then we have similarly
∠P CQτ 0 = ∠P Bτ 0 Qτ 0 = ∠ABτ 0 Qτ 0 − ∠ABτ 0 P = π − γ − δL − δR ,
∠`0L C`0R = γ + δL + δR ,
so that
(2.2)

∠P CQτ 0 + ∠`0L C`0R = π = ∠Qτ 0 C`0τ 0 + ∠P C`0τ .

Hence (2.1) and (2.2) yield the flat-foldability around C.

3. C ONSTRUCTIONS OF NEGATIVE 3D GADGETS WITH PRESCRIBED OUTGOING PLEATS
(`L , mL ) AND (`R , mR )
In this section we shall give three constructions of negative 3D gadgets, which all use the prescribed two simple pleats (`L , mL ) and (`R , mR ). In particular, we will prove that our first and third
constructions solve Problem 1.1. We will also discuss in Section 3.4 the interferences between two
adjacent 3D gadgets at least one of which is negative.
3.1. First Construction. This is an extension of our first construction of negative 3D gadgets given
in [2], Section 9, and similar to Constructions 2.2 and 2.6 in that we swing the supporting triangle
to either side face until it overlaps with the other. We can construct an infinite number of negative
3D gadgets with the same outgoing pleats for each τ ∈ {L, R}.
Construction 3.1. Consider a development as in Figure 1.8, for which we require condition (i),
(ii), (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7. Then the crease pattern of our first negative 3D gadget with
prescribed simple outgoing pleats (`L , mL ) and (`R , mR ) is constructed as follows.
(1) Choose τ = L or τ = R. Also choose a point Eτ in mτ so that ∠ABτ Eτ satisfies
h
i
γ
(3.1)
∠ABτ Eτ ∈ π − βτ , π − βτ + + δL + δR ∩ (γ + δL + δR , π).
2
(For a practical choice of ∠ABτ Eτ , see Remark 3.10.) Also redefine mτ to be a ray starting
from Eτ and going in the same direction as ray `τ .
(2) Let D be the point in the circular arc BL BR with center A such that φτ = ∠Bτ AD =
2∠Bτ AEτ .
(3) Let Gτ be the point in segment AEτ such that ∠ABτ Gτ = π − βτ . If we choose ∠ABτ Eτ =
π − βτ in (3.1), then we have Gτ = Eτ .
(4) Let Eτ 0 be the intersection point of mτ 0 and a bisector of ∠DABτ 0 . Also redefine mτ 0 to be a
ray starting from Eτ 0 and going in the same direction as ray `τ 0 .
(5) Let Gτ 0 be the intersection point of a ray starting from Gτ through D and segment AEτ 0 . If we
choose ∠ABτ Eτ = π − βτ + γ/2 + δL + δR in (3.1), then we have Gτ 0 = Eτ 0 .
(6) Let Pτ be a point in mτ such that ∠Eτ Bτ Pτ = δτ . If δτ = 0, then we have Pτ = Eτ .
(7) Let Pτ 0 be the intersection point of a ray starting from Pτ through C and ray mτ 0 .
(8) If ∠ABτ Eτ < π − βτ + δτ , then determine a point Qτ in mτ such that ∠Qτ Bτ `τ = βτ − δτ .
Also, determine a point Rτ in segment Eτ Pτ such that ∠Rτ Bτ Eτ = ∠Qτ Bτ Eτ . (In particular,
if ∠ABτ Eτ = π − βτ , then we have Eτ = Gτ = Rτ . For the existence of Qτ and Rτ , see
Proposition 3.9.) Then draw segments Bτ Qτ , Bτ Rτ , CQτ and CRτ .
(9) If ∠ABτ Eτ > βτ 0 + γ + δτ , then determine a point Qτ 0 in `0τ 0 such that ∠Qτ 0 Bτ 0 `0τ 0 =
βτ 0 − δτ 0 . Also, determine a point Rτ 0 (6= Eτ 0 ) in segment Eτ 0 Pτ 0 such that ∠Rτ 0 Bτ 0 Eτ 0 =
∠Qτ 0 Bτ 0 Eτ 0 . (For the existence of Qτ 0 and Rτ 0 , see Proposition 3.9.) Then draw segments
Bτ 0 Qτ 0 , Bτ 0 Rτ 0 , CQτ 0 and CRτ 0 .
(10) If ∠ABτ Eτ ∈ [π − βτ + δτ , βτ 0 + γ + δτ ], then the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid
lines in Figure 3.2. If not, then the desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in Figure
3.3. The assignment of mountain and valley folds to the additional creases is given in Table 3.4,
where σ takes both L and R.
The following result is immediate.
Lemma 3.5. For the choice of τ in (1), we have ∠ADGτ 0 = ∠ABτ 0 Gτ 0 = βτ .
Thus for the choice of τ in (1) and also φτ in (2), the extended length of the base kτ of the side
face, which may cause an interference on the side of τ 0 , is given by |DGτ 0 |, which is calculated as
|DGτ 0 | = |Bτ 0 Gτ 0 | =

|AB|

The above constuction of negative 3D gadgets leads to the following two results, where the validity
of the construction and the foldability of the crease patterns are verified below.
Theorem 3.6. For any positive 3D gadget with (α, βL , βR , δL , δR ) satisfying conditions (i), (ii)
and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7, we can apply Construction 3.1 to obtain an infinite number

of negative 3D gadgets for each τ ∈ {L, R} with the same net and prescribed outgoing pleats as the
positive one in the development. All of these negative 3D gadgets engage with the original positive
one.
Also, if we consider the horizontally flipped crease pattern of each negative 3D gadget resulting
in Theorem 3.6, we have the following result, which solves Problem 1.1.
Corollary 3.7. For any positive 3D gadget with (α, βL , βR , δL , δR ) satisfying conditions (i), (ii)
and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7, we can apply Construction 3.21 to obtain an infinite number
of 3D gadgets for each τ ∈ {L, R} with the same outgoing pleats such that the top and two side
faces are negatively extruded, or in other words, sunk to the opposite direction.
Now let us see where condition (3.1) in (1) of Construction 3.1 comes from. We will follow the
discussion and terminology in [3], Section 4. In particular, we set ψσ = ∠Bσ AC − ∠Bσ AD and
ρσ = ∠ACEσ − ∠DCEσ for σ = L, R, so that we have γL + γR = γ and ψL + ψR = ρL + ρR = 0.
For simplicity, we denote below Bτ , kτ , βτ , ψτ , etc. by B, k, β, ψ, etc., and Bτ 0 , kτ 0 , βτ 0 , ψτ 0 , etc.
by B 0 , k 0 , β 0 , ψ 0 , etc. with an exception that we denote γ = γL + γR by γ+ to avoid confusion. Also,
we denote δL + δR by δ+ .
Firstly, for the existence of point G, we need ∠ABG 6 ∠ABE, which is equivalent to
γ ψ

by [3], Lemma 4.4. Secondly, it follows from −γ < ψ < γ and γ 0 + δ 0 − π/2 < ρ < π/2 − γ − δ
that

Thirdly, for the existence of point G , we need

Fourthly, for the existence of point P , we need

if δ > 0.

The left-hand side of the second inequality of (3.5) is calculated as

In a similar way, we see that the first inequlity of (3.5) is included in (3.7).
Therefore we obtained four inequalities (3.2), (3.3), (3.4) and (3.7), which are arranged into the
following inequalities for ∠ABE = π/2 + γ/2 + δ + ψ/2 + ρ:
γ+
π − β 6 ∠ABE 6 π − β +
+ δ+ ,
2
(3.8)
γ+ + δ+ < ∠ABE < π,
which is the same as condition (3.1), where the left (resp. the right) equality of the first inequality
of corresponds to G = E (resp. G0 = E 0 ). This explains how we find point Eτ in Construction 3.1,
(1). Note that the range of ∠ABE determined by (3.8) is nonempty because of
γ+
(3.9)
β+
< π and γ+ + δ+ < π,
2
which come from conditions (i) and (iii.c) of Construction 1.7 respectively.
Now we have the following results.
Proposition 3.8. For the choice of τ ∈ {L, R} in Construction 3.1, (1), we have the following
relations:
γ
γ
∠Eτ Bτ Gτ + ∠Eτ 0 Bτ 0 Gτ 0 = + δL + δR , ∠Eτ 0 Bτ 0 Pτ 0 = + δτ 0 ,

∠Eτ Pτ Pτ = π − ∠ABτ Eτ , ∠Eτ Pτ Pτ = ∠ABτ Eτ − (γ + δL + δR ), so that
∠Eτ Pτ Pτ 0 + ∠Eτ 0 Pτ 0 Pτ = π − (γ + δL + δR ).
In particular, we have Eτ 0 6= Pτ 0 . Also, we have
γ

∠ABτ 0 Eτ 0 = π + + δL + δR − ∠ABτ Eτ ,

∠Pτ 0 Bτ 0 `τ 0 = ∠ABτ Eτ − (γ + δL + δR ).

∠Eτ 0 Bτ 0 Gτ 0 = π − βτ +
(3.11)

Proof. First we will prove (3.10). Using
∠EBG + ∠E 0 B 0 G0 = ∠EDG + ∠E 0 DG0
= π − ∠EDE 0 = π − ∠ECE 0
= ∠ECP + ∠E 0 CP 0 = ∠EBP + ∠E 0 B 0 P 0

which follows from the calculation of (3.6), we obtain the first equation in the first line, and also
the second equation by ∠EBP = δ. For the second line, the first equation is easy and the second
follows from the calculation of (3.6), which leads to the third line.
Next we will prove (3.11). Using the first line of (3.10), we calculate as
∠E 0 B 0 G0 = γ+ /2 + δ+ − ∠EBG
= γ+ /2 + δ+ − (∠ABE − ∠ABG) = π − β + γ+ /2 + δ+ − ∠ABE,
so that using Lemma 3.5 we have
∠AB 0 E 0 = ∠AB 0 G0 + ∠E 0 B 0 G0 = π + γ+ /2 + δ+ − ∠ABE.
Thus using the above equations and the first line of (3.10), we have
∠P 0 B 0 `0 = (π + δ 0 ) − ∠AB 0 E 0 − ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 = ∠ABE − (γ+ + δ+ )
as desired. This completes the proof of Propositon 3.8.

Proposition 3.9. If ABτ Eτ ∈ [π − βτ , π − βτ + δτ ), then we have
∠Eτ Bτ Pτ > ∠Pτ Bτ `τ − ∠kτ Bτ `τ > 0,
where equality holds for ∠ABτ Eτ = π − βτ , or equivalently, Eτ = Gτ . Thus there exist points Qτ
and Rτ in (8) of Construction 3.1.
If ∠ABτ Eτ ∈ (βτ 0 + γ + δτ , π − βτ + γ/2 + δL + δR ], then we have
∠Eτ 0 Bτ 0 Pτ 0 > ∠kτ 0 Bτ 0 `τ 0 − ∠Pτ 0 Bτ 0 `τ 0 > 0.
Thus there exist points Qτ 0 and Rτ 0 in (9) of Construction 3.1 such that Rτ 0 6= Eτ 0 .
Proof. First suppose ABE ∈ [π − β, π − β + δ). Then we have
∠P B` − ∠kB` = (π + δ − ∠ABE − δ) − (β − δ) = π − β + δ − ∠ABE > 0,
so that
∠EBP − (∠kB` − ∠P B`) = δ − (π − β + δ − ∠ABE) = ∠ABE − (π − β) > 0,
where equality holds for ∠ABE = π − β. This proves the first assertion.
Next suppose ∠ABE ∈ (β 0 + γ+ + δ, π − β + γ+ /2 + δ+ ]. Then by Proposition 3.8 we have
∠P 0 B 0 `0 − ∠k 0 B 0 `0 = (∠ABE − γ+ − δ+ ) − (β 0 − δ 0 ) = ∠ABE − (β 0 + γ+ + δ) > 0,
so that by Proposition 3.8 again we have
∠E 0 B 0 P 0 − (∠P 0 B 0 `0 − ∠k 0 B 0 `0 ) = (γ+ /2 + δ 0 ) − (∠ABE − β 0 − γ+ − δ)
= β 0 + 3γ+ /2 + δ+ − ∠ABE > β 0 + 3γ+ /2 + δ+ − (π − β + γ+ /2 + δ+ )
= β + β 0 + γ+ − π > 0
as desired. This proves the second assertion.



Remark 3.10. Here we discuss a practical choice of ∠ABE, not to say the best. Although we can
construct a negative 3D gadget under (3.8), we need additional creases if we have ∠kB` < ∠P B`
or ∠k 0 B 0 `0 < ∠P 0 B 0 `0 , which are equivalent to ∠ABE < π − β + δ and ∠ABE > β 0 + γ+ + δ
respectively. This is because if so the face bounded by polygonal chain `σ Bσ Pσ mσ overlaps with
the side face for σ, and particularly with kσ for either σ = L or σ = R. Thus it is practical to
assume
(3.12)

γ
∠ABτ Eτ ∈ π − βτ + δτ , min π − βτ + + δL + δR , βτ 0 + γ + δτ ∩ (γ + δL + δR , π)

instead of (3.1). The range determined by (3.12) is still nonempty because of βτ + βτ 0 + γ =
2π − α > π and βτ − δτ > 0 coming from conditions (i) and (iii.b) respectively of Construction
1.7, as well as (3.9).
Also, so as not to make ∠EP P 0 and ∠E 0 P 0 P too small, we should take ∠ABE well over
γ+ + δ+ and well below π by the second line of (3.10) in Proposition 3.8. In particular, by the
fourth line of (3.10) we have ∠EP P 0 = ∠E 0 P P 0 if we can take ∠ABE satisfying (3.1) as
∠ABE = (π + γ+ + δ+ )/2.
Even if we can not, it is practical to take ∠ABE as close to (π + γ+ + δ+ )/2 as possible.
To end this subsection, we check the foldability of the resulting crease patterns.
• flat-foldability around B. This holds without the creases made with k, and thus we will forget
them. The creases starting from B except for those made with k are

AB and `
if δ = 0,
AB, BE, BP and ` if δ > 0,

16

MAMORU DOI

The flat-foldability in the first case is trivial because AB and ` form a straight line, and that in the
second case holds because we have
∠EBP + ∠AB` = δ + (π − δ) = π = ∠ABE + ∠P B`.
• flat-foldability around G and P . This is obvious except for G = E or P = E, which is included
in the flat-foldability around E below.
• flat-foldability around E. As with B, the creases from E except for those made with k are
(
AE, EE 0 , EP 0 and m if δ = 0,
AE, BE, EE 0 and m

if δ > 0.

Then we can check the flat-foldability in the respective cases as
∠AEE 0 − ∠E 0 EP 0 + ∠P 0 Em − ∠AEm
= (∠AED + ∠DEE 0 ) − ∠CEE 0 + ∠CEm − (∠AEB + ∠BEm) = 0,
∠AEE 0 − ∠E 0 Em + ∠BEm − ∠AEB
= (∠AED + ∠DEE 0 ) − (∠CEE 0 + ∠CEm) + ∠BEm − ∠AEB = 0
using
∠AEB = ∠AED, ∠CEE 0 = ∠DEE 0 ,
• flat-foldability around P 0 . This is obvious.
• flat-foldability around E 0 (6= G0 ). We have

∠BEm = ∠CEm.

∠AE 0 B 0 − ∠B 0 E 0 P 0 + ∠EE 0 P 0 − ∠AE 0 E
= ∠AE 0 B 0 − ∠B 0 E 0 P 0 + (∠CE 0 P 0 + ∠CE 0 E) − (∠DE 0 E + ∠AE 0 D) = 0
as desired.
• foldability around B 0 . We check that ∠k 0 B 0 G0 = π − α. Let us forget the creases made with k 0 .
Then using Proposition 3.8, we calculate as
∠k 0 B 0 G0 = ∠k 0 B 0 `0 − ∠P 0 B 0 `0 + ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 − ∠E 0 B 0 G0
(3.13)

= (β 0 − δ 0 ) − (π + δ 0 − ∠AB 0 E 0 − ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 ) + ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 − (∠AB 0 E 0 − β)
= β + β 0 + γ+ − π = π − α

as desired.
Remark 3.11. We can include the case α = βL + βR in Construction 3.1, where the resulting
extrusion is flat. The assignment of mountain and valley folds to the creases on the side of τ 0 for
Eτ 0 = Gτ 0 is given in Table 3.11, while the assignment for Eτ 0 6= Gτ 0 is the same as Tables 3.4.
To verify this, suppose α = β + β 0 . Note that we have
∠AB 0 G0 = β,

∠AB 0 k 0 = π − β 0 ,

so that
(3.14)

∠AB 0 G0 − ∠AB 0 k 0 = α − π.

Thus if G0 6= E 0 , then summing up (3.13) and (3.14) gives that
∠k 0 B 0 `0 − ∠P 0 B 0 `0 + ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 − ∠E 0 B 0 G0 + ∠AB 0 G0 − ∠AB 0 k 0 = 0,
which implies the flat-foldability around B 0 . If G0 = E 0 , where ∠ABE = π − β + γ+ /2 + δ+ ,
then we have
∠AB 0 P 0 = ∠AB 0 G0 + ∠E 0 B 0 P 0 = β + γ+ /2 + δ 0 ,

k 0 B 0 `0 = β 0 − δ 0 ,

∠P 0 B 0 `0 = ∠ABE − (γ+ + δ+ ) = π − β − γ+ /2,

∠AB 0 k 0 = π − β 0 ,

where we used Proposition 3.8, so that
∠AB 0 P 0 + ∠k 0 B 0 `0 = β + β 0 + γ+ /2 = π = 2π − (β + β 0 + γ+ /2) = ∠AB 0 k 0 + ∠P 0 B 0 `0 ,
which implies the flat-foldability around B 0 . Also, we have
∠AE 0 P 0 − ∠EE 0 P 0 + ∠EE 0 G − ∠AE 0 G
= (∠AG0 B 0 + ∠B 0 E 0 P 0 ) − (∠CE 0 P 0 + ∠CE 0 E) + ∠DE 0 E − ∠AG0 D
= (∠AG0 B 0 − ∠AG0 D) + (∠B 0 E 0 P 0 − ∠CE 0 P 0 ) − (∠CE 0 E − ∠DE 0 E) = 0,
which implies the flat-foldability around E 0 .

3.2. Second construction. This is an extension to δσ > 0 of our second construction of negative
3D gadgets given in [2], Section 9. Suppose either βL , βR 6 π/2 or βL , βR > π/2 holds. Here
we consider a development as in Figure 3.12 with prescribed simple outgoing pleats (`L , mL ) and
(`R , mR ) instead of Figure 1.8. Then we consider the crease pattern as in Figure 3.13, where we take
GL , GR , PL0 , PR0 so that segments GL GR and PL0 PR0 are parallel to segment EL ER . Since 4AGL GR
does not face the correct direction, this is not the correct crease pattern, and thus 4AGL GR has to
be rotated with a rotation of crease PL0 PR0 . Let B 0 be the intersection point of a perpendicular
through BL to kL and a perpendicular through BR to kR in the crease pattern. Also, let θ be the
angle such that if AC rotates counterclockwise around A by θ ∈ (−π/2, π/2], then AC overlaps
with an extension of AB 0 . To be more precise, we define B00 as B 0 if βL , βR > π and the antipodal
point of B 0 in the circle with center A and radius |AB 0 | if βL , βR 6 π. We see easily that B00
lies strictly inside ∠BL ABR if βL , βR > π/2 or βL , βR < π/2, and in ABσ if βσ = π/2 and
βσ0 6= π/2, while B 0 = B00 = A if βL = βR = π/2. Then θ is defined for B00 6= A by
θ = ∠BL AB00 − ∠BL AC
For B00 6= A, we calculate θ as

F IGURE 3.13. CP of a negative 3D gadget where crease PL0 PR0 is to be rotated
Let us define projA,0 to be the projection of the resulting extrusion to the crease pattern in the bottom
plane {z = 0} with projA,0 (A) = A. Then we have projA,0 (B) = B 0 . Since GL GR in the bottom
plane {z = 0} must be perpendicular to AB in the resulting extrusion, and also perpendicular to
AB 0 in the crease pattern, we have to rotate GL GR counterclockwise around D by θ with a rotation
of crease PL0 PR0 in the crease pattern.
Let us observe how a rotation of crease PL0 PR0 in the crease pattern affects the resulting extrusion.
As in Figure 3.13, suppose we use instead of PL0 PR0 a new crease PL PR made with a counterclockwise rotation of PL0 PR0 by , and accordingly Bσ Pσ instead of Bσ Pσ0 for σ = L, R. Then in the

resulting extrusion we have
∠kL DGL = ∠kL BGL = ∠kL BL `L − ∠PL BL `L + ∠EL BL PL − ∠EL BL GL
= ∠kL BL `L − (∠PL0 BL `L − ) + (∠EL BL PL0 + ) − ∠EL BL GL
= (βL − δL ) − (π + δL − ∠ABL EL − ∠EL BL PL0 )

(3.16)

+ ∠EL BL PL0 − (∠ABL EL − π/2) + 2
= βL − 2δL − π/2 + 2∠EL BL PL0 + 2
= βL + γL − π/2 + 2,

and similarly
∠kR DGR = βR + γR − π/2 − 2,

(3.17)
where we used

∠Eσ Bσ Pσ0 = ∠Eσ CPσ0 = ∠CEσ Eσ0 = γσ /2 + δσ

for σ = L, R

by [3], Lemma 4.4 for ψσ = ρσ = 0. On the other hand, to make GL GR orthogonal AB in the
resulting extrusion we need
(3.18)

∠kL DGL = ∠jL AB00 − π/2 = βL + γL − π/2 + θ,
∠kL DGR = ∠jR AB00 − π/2 = βR + γR − π/2 − θ.

Hence comparing (3.16) and (3.17) with (3.18), we conclude that  = θ/2.
However, we have some constraints on the range of Pσ , and thus on that of .
Firstly, let θσ,1 and θσ,2 for σ = L, R be the angles shown in Figure 3.13, which are calculated as
π
θσ,1 = ∠Pσ0 0 C`0σ0 = ∠Pσ0 0 Bσ0 `σ0 = π + δσ0 − ∠ABσ0 Eσ0 − ∠Eσ0 Bσ0 Pσ0 0 = − γσ0 − δσ0 ,
2
γσ
0
θσ,2 = ∠Eσ CPσ = ∠CEσ Eσ0 =
+ δσ ,
2
where we used [3], Lemma 4.4 for ψσ = ρσ = 0. Then PL ∈ mL and PR ∈ mR imply
−θL,2 6  < θR,1

and

− θL,1 <  6 θR,2

respectively, which we arrange into
−θL,1 <  < θR,1 and
−θL,2 6  6 θR,2 .

(3.19)
(3.20)

Secondly, we have ∠kσ DGσ > 0 for σ = L, R. It follows from (3.16) and (3.17) that
π/2 − βL − γL 6 2 6 βR + γR − π/2.

(3.21)

Thus letting θσ,3 be the angles shown in Figure 3.13, we have
θσ,3 = ∠kσ Bσ `σ − ∠Pσ0 Bσ `σ = βσ − δσ − θσ0 ,2 = βσ + γσ −

π
,
2

so that (3.21) becomes
(3.22)

− θL,3 6 2 6 θR,3 .

Lemma 3.14. Suppose βL , βR > π/2 or βL , βR 6 π/2, and either βL 6= π/2 or βR 6= π/2, so that
θ is well-defined. For  = θ/2, conditions (3.20) and (3.22) hold automatically.
Proof. Condition (3.20), and condition (3.22) for βL , βR > π/2 are obvious because we have
−γL 6 θ 6 γR .
Suppose βL , βR 6 π/2 in condition (3.22). For σ = L, R, let pσ be a ray starting from A which
is parallel to B 0 Bσ and going to the side of Bσ as shown in Figure 3.15. Then it follows from
(3.23)

γL + θ = ∠BL AB00 = ∠BL ApL + ∠B00 ApL = π/2 − βL + ∠B00 ApL > π/2 − βL ,

20

we have the left inequality of (3.22). Also, it follows from
(3.24) γL + θ = ∠BL ABR − ∠B00 ApR − ∠BR ApR = βR + γ − π/2 − ∠B00 ApR 6 βR + γ − π/2,
we have the right inequality of (3.22). Equality in the left (resp. the right) inequality of (3.22) holds
if ∠B00 ApL = 0 (resp. ∠B00 ApR = 0), or equivalently βL = π/2 and βR < π/2 (resp. βR = π/2
and βL < π/2), because ∠B00 Apσ ∈ [0, (π − α)/2] can be determined by

Lemma 3.16. Suppose βL , βR 6 π/2, and either βL 6= π/2 or βR 6= π/2, so that B00 6= A. For
σ = L, R, let pσ be a ray starting from A which is parallel to B 0 Bσ and going to the side of Bσ as
shown in Figure 3.15. Then we have
(3.26)

π/2 − βσ 6 ∠B00 Apσ

for σ = L, R,

where equality holds if βσ = π/2.
Proof. If cos βσ0 − cos α cos βσ 6 0 in (3.25), then we have ∠B00 Apσ > π/2, so that (3.26) holds.
Thus we may assume cos βσ0 − cos α cos βσ > 0, and it is sufficient to prove

Proposition 3.17. Suppose βL , βR > π/2 or βL , βR 6 π/2, and either βL 6= π/2 or βR 6= π/2,
so that the angle θ is well-defined. Also suppose θ satisfy conditions (3.19), (3.20) and (3.22) for
 = θ/2. Then for this θ we have
∠kσ Bσ `σ > ∠Pσ Bσ `σ

for σ = L, R.

Thus in our second construction, there appear no creases like Bσ Qσ or Bσ Rσ in Construction 3.1
which are made with kσ .
Proof. Since we have
(3.28)

∠kL BL `L − ∠PL BL `L = βL + γL − π/2 + θ/2,
∠kR BR `R − ∠PR BR `R = βR + γR − π/2 − θ/2

by a calculation similar to (3.16), it is sufficient to prove that the right-hand sides are positive.
First suppose βL , βR > π/2. Then using (3.20) for  = θ/2, we have
γL + θ/2 > γL /2 + δL > 0,

γR − θ/2 > γR /2 + δR > 0,

from which follows the positivity of the right-hand sides of (3.28).
Next suppose βL , βR 6 π/2. Then we calculate the double of the first line of (3.28) as
2βL + 2γL − π + θ = (βL + γL + θ − π/2) + (βL + γL − π/2)
= ∠B00 ApL + βL + γL − π/2 > γL > 0,
where we used (3.23) and Lemma 3.16 in the second line. Also, we can use (3.24) and Lemma 3.16
to prove that the second line of (3.28) is positive. This completes the proof of Proposition 3.17. 
Hence setting θσ = 2θσ,1 , we see from (3.19), (3.20), (3.22) and Lemma 3.14 that our second
construction is possible if θ = 2 satisfies θ ∈ (−θL , θR ). Note that the flat-foldability around Pσ
is obvious and that around Eσ is verified in the same way as in Section 3.1.
Now our second construction is summarized as follows.
Construction 3.18. Consider a development as in Figure 3.12, for which we require condition (i),
(ii) and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7. Suppose either βL , βR 6 π/2 or βL , βR > π/2 holds. Let
B 0 be the intersection point of a perpendicular through BL to kL and a perpendicular through BR to
kR . Also, let B00 be B 0 if βL , βR > π and the antipodal point of B 0 in the circle with center A and
radius |AB 0 | if βL , βR 6 π, so that B00 lies inside ∠BL ABR . If either βL 6= π/2 or βL 6= π/2, then
define an angle θ numerically by (3.15) or geometrically in Figure 3.13 by
θ = ∠BL AB00 − ∠BL AC.
Also define θσ for σ = L, R by
θσ = π − 2γσ0 − 2δσ0
(We can also define θσ geometrically in Figure 3.13 by
θσ /2 = θσ,1 = ∠Pσ0 0 C`0σ0 = ∠Pσ0 0 Bσ0 `σ0
after procedure (2) below.) Suppose θ ∈ (−θL , θR ) if either βL 6= π/2 or βR 6= π/2, or choose
any θ ∈ (−θL , θR ) if βL = βR = π/2. Then the crease pattern of our second negative 3D gadget
with prescribed simple outgoing pleats (`L , mL ) and (`R , mR ) is constructed as follows, where we
regard σ as taking both L and R.
(1) Let Eσ be the intersection point of mσ and a bisector of ∠Bσ AC. Also redefine mσ to be a ray
starting from Eσ and going in the same direction as `σ .
(2) Let D be the intersection point of AC and the circular arc BL BR with center A. Draw a
perpendicular through D to AD, letting Gσ be the intersection point of the perpendicular and
AEσ . Also draw a perpendicular through C to AC, letting Pσ0 be the intersection point of the
perpendicular and mσ .

(3) Rotate the line through PL0 and PR0 around C by θ/2 in the counterclockwise direction, letting
Pσ be the intersection point of the rotated line and mσ .
(4) The desired crease pattern is shown in Figure 3.19, and the assignment of mountain and valley
folds is given in Table 3.20.

3.3. Third construction. We begin with the following construction.
Construction 3.21. Consider a development as in Figure 1.8, for which we require condition (i),
(ii) and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7. Then the crease pattern of our third negative 3D gadget
with prescribed simple outgoing pleats (`L , mL ) and (`R , mR ) is constructed as follows, where we
regard σ as taking both L and R.
(1) Determine a point D in the circular arc BL BR with center A such that ψL = ∠BL AC −
∠BL AD or ρL = ∠BL CA − ∠BL CD is calculated using Theorem 3.25.
(2) Let Eσ be the intersection point of mσ and the bisector of ∠Bσ AD, and redefine mσ to be
a ray starting from Eσ and going in the same direction as `σ .
(3) Draw a parallel to segment EL ER through D, letting Gσ be the intersection point of the
parallel and segment AEσ .

Before finding ψL or ρL in (1) of the above construction, we check the foldability of the gadget.
Proposition 3.24. Regardless of the position of D in the circular arc BL BR with center A, we have
∠Eσ Bσ Gσ = ∠Eσ Bσ Pσ

for σ = L, R.

Proof. For any ψL = ∠BL AD − ∠BL AC, we have
∠Eσ Bσ Gσ = ∠Eσ DGσ = ∠DEσ Eσ0 ,
∠Eσ Bσ Pσ = ∠Eσ DPσ = ∠CEσ Eσ0 ,
which are equal because EL ER is a perpendicular bisector of CD.

Thus in the resulting extrusion, using [3], Lemma 4.4 we have for both σ = L, R that
(3.29)

Hence we see from (3.29) and (3.30) together with the flat-foldability around Eσ and Pσ for
σ = L, R that we can construct successfully the supporting flap 4AGL GR on the back side of
the negative gadget if there exists an appropriate choice of ψL or ρL .
Now let us find an equation which ψL or ρL satisfies. In the resulting extrusion, noting that ridge
AB overlaps with AD, we need
∠ADGR = ∠ABGR .

Thus we calculate as

Now define a function Γ = Γ(δσ ; δσ0 ) by

Γ(δσ ; δσ0 ) = tan−1

1 − cos γ + sin γ tan δσ0
sin γ + cos γ tan δσ0 + tan δσ



Then we can write γL and γR as
γL = Γ(δL ; δR ),

(3.37)

γR = Γ(δR ; δL ).

Therefore, r is considered as a function r(δσ , δσ0 ) defined by
r(δσ ; δσ0 ) =

cos Γ(δσ ; δσ0 ) − sin Γ(δσ ; δσ0 ) tan δσ

which satisfies
r(δL ; δR ) = r(δR ; δL ).

(3.38)

Let us return to equations (3.35) and (3.36). Using the second expression of (3.33), we have that
cos(γσ ± ρL ) = (cos γσ ∓ sin γσ tan ρL ) cos ρL ,
sin(γσ ± ρL ) = (sin γσ ± cos γσ tan ρL ) cos ρL .
Consequently, we calculate (3.36) as

+ {(cos βL cos γL − sin βL sin γL ) cos βR − (cos βR cos γR − sin βR sin γR ) cos βL }.
Also, since it follows from the second expression of (3.33) that
sin(ψL + ρL )
= sin ψL + cos ψL tan ρL
cos ρL
= (r − cos ψL ) tan ρL + cos ψL tan ρL = r tan ρL ,
we calculate (3.35) as

Theorem 3.25. Suppose α, βL , βR , δL and δR satisfy conditions (i), (ii) and (iii.a)–(iii.c) of Construction 1.7. Then there exists a unique solution ρL ∈ (γR + δR − π/2, π/2 − γL − δL ) of equation

To simplify the expression, we set
CC = cos βL cos βR , SC = sin βL cos βR ,
cσ = cos δσ , sσ = sin δσ for σ = L, R.

CS = cos βL sin βR ,

SS = sin βL sin βR ,

Then V1 , V2 and W are written as
V1 = CC(sL + sR ) + SCsL + CScR ,
V2 = CC sin γ + SC cos γ + CS cos γ − SS sin γ,
W = CC(cL − cR ) − SCsL + CSsR ,
so that we have
V1 cos γL − W sin γL = CC(cL sR + sL cR ) + SC(c2L + s2L ) + CS(cL cR − sL sR )
= CC sin γ + SC + CS cos γ,

there exists ρL ∈ (γR + δR − π/2, π/2 − γL − δL ) such that Φ = 0, which is a desired solution of
(3.41). Also, we see that V1 − rV2 > 0, so that (V1 − rV2 ) tan ρL is monotonically increasing with
respect to ρL , from which follows the uniqueness of the solution ρL .

Corollary 3.28. For any positive 3D gadget with (α, βL , βR , δL , δR ) satisfying conditions (i), (ii)

This negative 3D gadget engages with the original positive one.
If we consider the horizontally flipped crease pattern of the negative 3D gadget resulting in Corollary 3.28, we have the following result, which solves Problem 1.1.

In particular, if βL + βR = π, then we have ρL = (βR − βL )/2.
As in the previous sections, the triangular flap 4AGL GR may interfere with adjacent 3D gadgets
within the length Kneg,σ (B) on the side of σ, which are calculated as

where we used
∠ADGL = π/2 + ψL + ρL ,

∠ADGR = π/2 − ψL − ρL .

In particular, if βL = βR and δL = δR , then ψL = ρL = 0, so that we have
γ

which do not depend on either βσ or δσ .
Remark 3.32. As with our first construction, we see from Lemmas 3.26 and 3.27 that we can also
include the case α = βL + βR or equivalently βL + βR + γ/2 = π in Construction 3.21 because Φ
in those lemmas do not vanish and thus φL takes a value strictly between 0 and γ. In this case the
resulting negative gadget is flat, and we have the flat-foldability condition around Bσ
∠ABσ Gσ + ∠Eσ Bσ Pσ + ∠kσ Bσ `σ = π = ∠Eσ Bσ Gσ + ∠Pσ Bσ `σ + ∠ABσ kσ ,
which is rewritten as
(3.51)

∠ABσ Eσ + ∠kσ Bσ `σ = π = ∠ABσ kσ + ∠Eσ Bσ `σ

by Proposition 3.24. On the other hand, there is a unique positive flat gadget with the same α, βσ
and δσ for both σ = L, R, where the assignment of mountain and valley folds is given in Table 3.33.
For this positive gadget, it follows from [3], Section 3 that ∠Bσ AEσ = ζσ with ζL + ζR = γ/2,
where ζσ is given geometrically in Definition 3.2 and numerically in Proposition 3.6 of [3]. This
also satisfies the flat-foldability condition (3.51) around Bσ . Thus we must have ∠Bσ AEσ = ζσ
for the negative flat gadget, which does not hold if α < βL + βR where there are an infinite number
of positive 3D gadgets.

3.4. Interferences caused by negative 3D gadgets. Here we only consider flat-back positive 3D
gadgets given in [2] and [3], and negative ones by our third construction, but other cases are similar.
As discussed in [2], Section 5 and [3], Section 5, for two positive 3D gadgets sharing a side face,
an interference may occur in the bottom edge. However, since our negative 3D gadgets have a
supporting triangle which does not necessarily overlap with their side faces, an interference between
two adjacent negative ones may occur at the intersection point of the extentions of the bases of their
supporting triangles.
Suppose two negative 3D gadgets share a side face A1 A2 B2 B1 , where A1 and A2 may be identical, and B1 is located to the left of B2 . We will add subscripts '1' and '2' to the quantities

30

and points belonging to the left and the right gadget respectively. Set θ1,R = ∠B2 B1 G1,R and
θ2,L = ∠B1 B2 G2,L in the resulting extrusion, which are calculated using (3.29) as
θ1,R = β1,R + γ1,R − ρ1,L − π/2,

θ2,L = β2,L + γ2,L + ρ2,L − π/2.

Then the minimum length Kneg,min (B1 B2 ) of |B1 B2 | such that no interference occurs is given by

where Kneg,R (B1 ) and Kneg,L (B2 ) are given by (3.50). Hence there are no interferences between
the two negative 3D gadgets if and only if |B1 B2 | > Kneg,min (B1 B2 ). Of course, we have to
consider another minimum of |B1 B2 | which is given by the length of B1 B2 when we set A1 = A2
for β1,L + β2,R > π.
Interferences caused by a flat-back positive 3D gadget given in [3] and a negative one which
share a side face, may be rather complicated to treat.
Example 3.34. As an example, let us consider the resuting extruded prism of the crease pattern
shown in Figure 3.35, where the divided parts of the top face and the side faces are lightly and dark
shaded respectively. In the figure, we set
α1 = α2 = π/3, β1,L = β1,R = β2,L = β2,R = π/2, so that γ1 = γ2 = 2π/3,
δ1,L = δ1,R = δ2,L = δ2,R = 0, ψ1,L = ψ2,L = 0, and
|A1 B1,R | = |A1 B2,L | ,

so that A1 B2,L A2 B1,R is a square.

Then we see that there are no interferences. However, let us see how interferences occur if we make
|A1 B2,L | (and accordingly |A2 B1,R |) shorter. Suppose |A1 B1 | = 1, so that |A2 B2 | = 1. Then we
have the following.
• The flap formed by kite A1 B
√1,R G1,R D1 of the positive 3D gadget collides with A2 if
|A2 B1,R | < |B1,R G1,R | = 1/ 3.
• The flap formed by kite A2 B
√2,L G2,L D2 of the negative 3D gadget collides with j1,L if
|A1 B2,L | < |B2,L G2,L | = 1/ 3.
• The crease which is the reflection of j1,L across `2,L collides with the flap
√formed by kite
A2 B2,L G2,L D2 of the negative 3D gadget if |A1 B2,L | < |B2,L G2,L | = 1/ 3.
• The crease which is the reflection of j2,R across `1,R collides with the flap√formed by kite
A2 B2,L G2,L D2 of the negative 3D gadget if |A2 B1,R | < |B1,R G1,R | = 1/ 3.
√
Thus in any of the above four cases, there
√ are no interferences if and only if |A1 B2 | > 1/ 3. We
show the crease pattern for |A1 B2 | = 1/ 3 in Figure 3.36.
Thus in the presence of both positive and negative 3D gadgets, there may be not only interferences
between a 3D gadget and another one or a side face which is not necessarily adjacent to the first
one, but also ones beween a 3D gadget and an edge of a side face reflected by an outgoing pleat as
in the third and fourth cases of Example 3.34. Using the repeating gadgets given in [3], Section 7
for positive ones and those given in the next section for negative ones, or changing the angles of the
outgoing pleats, we may be able to avoid these interferences. However, the more 3D gadgets we
have, the more difficult it becomes to handle their interferences. For the treatment of intersections
of outgoing pleats, see [2], Section 9.

4. R EPETITION AND DIVISION OF NEGATIVE 3D GADGETS
As we explained in [2] and [3], division and repetition of 3D gadgets are the same but the gadget
we start from. The repeating 3D gadgets presented in [3], which have flat back sides, can also be
used for negative 3D gadgets with a little modification. The creases of the negative 3D gadget does
not affect on those of the repeating gadgets in the resulting crease pattern because the supporting

32

MAMORU DOI

triangle overlaps with the repeating gadgets only at the ridge. As in [2] and [3], we shall treat the
cases with δL = δR = 0. The general cases with δL , δR > 0 are rather complicated, and thus
will be treated elsewhere. In the construction below, we will use a negative 3D gadget by our third
construction as the lowest gadget. However, we can use any of our constructions as long as it is
applicable.
Construction 4.1. Consider a development as shown in Figure 4.2, for which we require conditions
(i), (ii) and (iii) of Construction 1.7. Suppose p1 , . . . , pd > 0 with p1 + * * * + pd = d satisfy
r+1
(4.1)
* pn 6 qn for n = 2, . . . , d, where qn = p1 + * * * + pn .
2
(The meaning of (4.1) will be explained in Remark 4.5.) In particular, in the case of equal division
p1 = * * * = pn = 1, (4.1) holds if and only if
√
γ 6 2 cos−1 (1/3) = 2 tan−1 (2 2) ≈ 141.06◦ .
Then the crease pattern of the proportional division of a negative 3D gadget by our third construction
into d gadgets in the ratio p1 : * * * : pd from the bottom with p1 + * * * + pd = d is constructed as
follows, where we regard σ as taking both L and R.
(1) Divide segment CA (not AC) into d parts proportionally in the ratio p1 : * * * : pd , letting
A(1) , . . . , A(d−1) to be the divided points in order from the side of C.
(n)
(2) For n = 1, . . . , d − 1, draw a ray `σ parallel to `σ , starting from A(n) and going in the
(n)
same direction as `σ , letting Bσ be the intersection point with Bσ C.

Also, if we have p1 = * * * = pd = 1 (equal division) and ψL = * * * = ψL = ψL , then

(9) For n = 2, . . . , d such that Gσ , G0σ(n−1) exist, draw a line through Gσ which is a re(n)

(10) The desired crease pattern is shown as the solid lines in Figure 4.3, and the assignment of
mountain and valley folds is given in Table 4.4.

5. C ONCLUSION
In this paper we studied fives constructions of negative 3D gadgets, whose features are listed in
Table 5. In particular, we saw in Section 3.3 that our first and third constructions solve Problem

1.1. These solutions enable us to treat positive and negative 3D gadgets on the same basis as long
as there are no interferences among the 3D gadgets, and also broaden the range of 3D objects
which can be folded in origami extrusions, although it is still limited and to be further broadened.
Each of the two constructions has its own merits, and we can select them interchangeably for our
purpose. Our first construction produces an infinite number of negative 3D gadgets for any positive
3D gadget in Problem 1.1, but choosing ∠ABτ Eτ in Construction 3.1, (1) is a little troublesome.
On the other hand, our third construction gives a unique solution, for which we do not need to
care about the choice. To prove the existence and uniqueness of the desired negative 3D gadget by
our third construcion for any given positive 3D gadget in Problem 1.1, we solved equation (3.32)
numerically and found rather complicated formulas for the unique solution in Theorem 3.25 and
Proposition 3.31. However, we still do not either know how to construct D geometrically except
for some cases such as α = βL + βR , or understand the geometric meaning of the formulas for
the solution which may possibly explain the existence and uniqueness of the desired gadget more
naturally and easily.
Also, it is still a major problem in origami extrusions to handle outgoing pleats and various
interferences which increase as the extruded object becomes more complex. Although we have
many ways of handling an individual difficulty such as changing the angles of the outgoing pleats,
composing their intersections, and using repeating 3D gadgets, at this point we depend more or less
on our skills in designing the whole crease pattern of an origami extrusion, which is to be further
developed in future researches.
