Abstract
With the example of a Stern-Gerlach measurement on a spin-1/2 atom, we show that a superposition of both paths may be observed compatibly with properties attributed to state collapse
- for example, the singleness (or mutual exclusivity) of outcomes. This is done by inserting a
quantum two-state system (an ancilla) in each path, capable of responding to the passage of the
atom, and thus acting as a virtual detector. We then consider real measurements on the compound
system of atomic spin and two ancillae. Nondestructive measurements of a set of compatible joint
observables can be performed, one for a superposition and others for collapse properties. A novel
perspective is given as to why, within unitary quantum theory, ordinary measurements are blind
to such superpositions. Implications for the theory of measurement are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Opinions differ on whether or not there is a quantum measurement problem, and if so,
exactly what it is [1, 2]. A more focused question regards the collapse of the state vector
in projective measurements, as formalized by von Neumann [3]. By collapse we mean the
observed process described by one of the textbook postulates, which states (in its simplest
form) [4, 5]:
Measurement Postulate: A measurement of the observable A yields one of its eigenvalues,
an , and, in an ideal measurement [6, 7], places the measured object in the corresponding
eigenstate, φn (where Aφn = an φn ).
Included with this, or stated as a separate postulate, is the Born rule probability of this
outcome, |hφn |ψi|2 , where ψ is the initial state of the object being measured. All interpretations must agree on the above as a statement of fact, but they disagree on its status - i.e., is
it independent of the other postulates, which stipulate unitary evolution in the appropriate
Hilbert space, or is it derivable from them?
Regarding attitudes on this more focused issue, it seems reasonable to identify a small
number of broad categories. Here is a grouping into three: The most conservative takes
collapse as axiomatic - that is, it cannot be derived from the other axioms - suggesting that
the collapse process itself is not subject to quantum analysis [8, 9]. This position is consistent
with most textbooks written over more than the last half century, which list collapse among
the axioms. It is intended to include those who apply quantum theory according to these
textbook axioms, without (however) adopting any particular interpretation philosophically.
It also includes the epistemic and information-based approaches [10], whose intellectual roots
extend back to the Copenhagen interpretation [11, 12]. We refer to this general position as
Standard Quantum Theory (SQT), interpreted broadly.
A contrasting position is that the collapse phenomenon, as observed, is in fact derived
from the other axioms, following unitary evolution of an appropriate closed system which
includes the apparatus and the relevant environment [13, 14], as well as the object of study.
And indeed unitary evolution describes what we see, but it also describes what we do not
see - namely, that all branches of the state vector (representing all possible measurement
outcomes) survive the measurement process. This is nevertheless consistent because it also
predicts that an observer can be aware of only one such outcome [15]. We shall refer to this

2

position as unitary quantum theory (UQT). It includes the Many Worlds Interpretation [16–
18], which asserts that the unobservable branches are just as real as the branch we experience,
but it is broader. It includes orthodox decoherence theory [19, 20], whose practitioners
represent a variety of interpretations [21, 22], and other operational approaches which assert
independence from interpretations [5, 23], while assuming unitarity.
A third position holds that the unobserved branches are removed from the theory by a
mechanism of yet unknown origin, which takes effect in sufficiently large systems, and which
is, in principle, subject to quantum analysis. The mechanism is represented by adding a
nonlinear stochastic term to the Hamiltonian, whose effect is to remove all but a single
branch [24–27]. This approach, in effect, replaces the collapse postulate with an expansion
of the dynamics postulate beyond its otherwise unitary and deterministic character. This
has consequences, which are measurable in principle, but to date undetected. Predicted
effects are difficult to separate from decoherence and other random influences. There are
proposals to utilize molecular interferometry and optomechanical phenomena, as well as
particle diffusion [28], and it is hoped that over the next decade or two, definitive tests will
be possible [29]. We refer to this general position as objective collapse theory (OCT). It has
fewer adherents than the other two [2], but it provides an important alternative.
In this paper we will make several points about the measurement process, mostly interpretation independent, although the blindness of ordinary measurements to superpositions
calls for specific justification within the UQT approach. For all points it will be useful to
distinguish two stages of the measurement process. First comes the reversible premeasurement stage, where the object of interest becomes entangled (unitarily) with an ancillary
system in the apparatus (in our case, two paths). Second is the detection stage, where
the ancillary system transfers its entanglement to the detector system (in our case, two
detectors), which then act irreversibly and record a result. Perhaps surprisingly, two signature collapse properties are established in the premeasurement stage, as properties of the
object/ancillary system, and survive through the detection stage as correlations among the
object and the two detectors. These are implicit in the postulate stated above: (i) singleness
(or mutual exclusivity of outcomes an ); and (ii) projection (the correlations between detector readings and the post-measurement spin state). Note that the singleness of outcomes
implies randomness. Randomness is not a property of the premeasurement state - it only
shows up at the detection stage as a result of local ("which path") measurement, which
3

breaks the entanglement while preserving the correlations. There is a third property of the
premeasurement state (not a collapse property!), namely (iii) superposition (the state vector
is a superposition of distinct collapse scenarios). In the ancilla model, this property can be
detected, but in an ordinary apparatus it cannot be, so that its survival in the state vector
is open to interpretation.
The ancilla model expands the premeasurement stage by adding a physical realization
(qubits) to the ancillary system. The three properties are represented by Hermitian operators
in the Hilbert space of the object/ancilla system. The operators commute, and all three
properties are observable at the detection stage. In an ordinary apparatus without the
ancillae, we will show that all three properties are again present in the premeasurement
stage, but that only the two collapse properties are observable at the detection stage.
Interpretations differ on the reason behind this blindness of an ordinary apparatus to
superpositions. In two of the approaches outlined above, only one branch of the state vector
survives the detection stage - in SQT this is axiomatic; in OCT it is by construction of the
model interaction. In UQT, on the other hand, the superposition extends to the detectors
and persists through the detection stage. We will offer a physically intuitive explanation
why it is nonetheless undetectable, prompted by comparison with the ancilla model. This
will provide a useful perspective on a more conventional explanation in decoherence theory
(Sec. III and Appendix A).
In the next section we introduce the Stern-Gerlach measurement model with ancilla qubits
as virtual detectors, and we then show how this atom/ancilla system may be "observed"
in a real experiment. This observation demonstrates the compatibility of the two collapse
properties with the superposition property for this system. In Section III, we compare the
analogous measurements made with two ordinary detectors. We show that the collapse
properties are identical to those of the ancilla model, while the superposition that persists
in the UQT approach is now undetectable. We discuss the reason for this blindness and
compare with the decoherence perspective. Results are summarized in Sec. IV.

A MODEL MEASUREMENT WITH VIRTUAL DETECTORS

Consider the compound system consisting of a spin-1/2 atom and two quantum two-state
systems (ancillae, A↑ and A↓ ) serving as virtual detectors in the Stern-Gerlach interferometer

pictured in Fig. 1 [30]. Each ancilla interacts locally with the atom, and it makes a transition
from its 0 to its 1 state if and only if the atom passes through it. The interaction is spinindependent, preserving the spin state of the atom on its path. We assume that the process
is reversible, so that the ancilla by itself does not perform a measurement - hence we call it
a virtual detector.
Let us trace the evolution of entanglement as the atom passes through the device from
points 1 - 4. The atom enters the picture at time t1 with the spatial wavefunction φ(~r, t1 ),
in an arbitrary pure spin state, (α, β),

Finally, a reversed magnetic field gradient brings the two paths back together at t4 . Assuming
that there is no net phase difference between the paths, the result is

|ψ(t4 )i = φ(~r, t4 ) α| ↑is |1iA↑ |0iA↓ + β| ↓is |0iA↑ |1iA↓ .

The last step allows us to ignore the spatial part and study the remaining entanglement

between the spin and the two ancillae. We further simplify by setting α = β = 1/ 2,

where the spin states (↑, ↓) are relabeled as (1, 0), and the ordering of the indices identifies
with (spin,A↑ , A↓ ).
This is a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state [31, 32], an entangled state of three
qubits. It was first realized experimentally in 1999 ([33]) as a polarization state of three
photons. Analogous states (and their generalizations to more than three particles) have been
produced and documented in other systems - for example, trapped ions [34], superconducting
circuits [35, 36], and Rydberg atoms [37]. The original goal was to demonstrate non-locality
[38]; more practical goals involve quantum error correction [39] and quantum communication
[40], and in general the manipulation of entanglement.
Let us discuss the observables that characterize the state, and then the question of how
to measure them. The three-qubit system lives in a Hilbert space of dimension eight, and
|ψ(t4 )i is an eigenstate of three tensor product operators, whose eigenvalues determine it
completely. The choice is not unique [41]; the most revealing in the present context is ZZI,
ZIZ, and XXX. Recalling the definitions of the individual Pauli matrices Z, X, and Y , as
given in Table I, one may confirm that |ψ(t4 )i is indeed the (unique) simultaneous eigenstate
of the three tensor products with the eigenvalues quoted in Table II.
Each observable may be characterized by a statement about its physical meaning, with
eigenvalue (±1) giving the truth value [42]. With GHZ entanglement, all such statements
concern either two-particle or three-particle correlations, and none concerns a property of
an individual particle. The combination of statements appearing in Table II is an example.
These statements may appear contradictory, because the product of the first two tells us that
IZZ = −1, whose clear physical meaning is that the atom can be found on one and only one
path (the "singleness" property, or mutual exclusivity). On the other hand, the definiteness
of XXX implies that the state vector (5) is a superposition of two classically inconsistent
scenarios. We will explain in detail why the singleness and superposition statements are not
contradictory. But first we must describe the measurements, made with real (irreversible)
detecting devices [43]. We will describe two modes (called local and joint) which differ in
the acquisition of local information.

We begin with the simpler and more typical mode of GHZ experiments [33], in which
one measures the local factors and multiplies the results together to obtain the eigenvalue
of the desired joint observable. First consider the local Z factors, each of which can take
the value 1 or −1. We measure the ancilla factors, ZA↑ and ZA↓ , with a standard readout
device [44] for each ancilla qubit. We measure the atomic spin component, Zs , with another

"downstream" Stern-Gerlach device, similarly oriented, with a single-atom detector placed
in the ↑ path to register the arrival (or not) of the atom and thus record the value of Zs . The
results are as follows: The outcome of each local measurement is random because no local
observable has Ψ(t4 ) ∼ |110i + |001i as an eigenstate [45], but the product of any two Z
factors is definite, as shown in the top two panels in Table III). These are collapse properties,
and they are properties of the state Ψ(t4 ) prior to measurement. They characterize the
observed collapse phenomenon that we would see in an ordinary measurement without the
ancillae. We emphasize that IZZ = −1 represents the singleness, or mutual exclusivity of
measurement outcomes, while ZZI = 1 and ZIZ = −1 represent the projection property the perfect correlation between detector readouts and the (remeasured) value of the atomic
spin downstream.
It is notable that the two-way correlations above persist in the face of local measurements
(ZII, IZI, and IIZ), whose random outcomes indicate that the measurement changed the
state of the system. The specific "which path" information thus obtained is not a property of
Ψ(t4 ); it enters only at the detection stage. Its randomness, a feature shared with ordinary
measurements, is a necessary consequence of the singleness property.
Now consider the measurements of the individual X factors. Clearly, to measure Xs ,
we simply reorient the "downstream" Stern-Gerlach system. To measure XA↑ and XA↓ ,
noting that the readout devices are keyed to the ancillas' Z-bases, we apply a Hadamard
transformation (H) [46] to each ancilla before the readout. The readout value (±1) then
indicates in which linear combination of Z-basis states (|1i ± |0i) each ancilla has been
"found." The results of these X-measurements are the following: The individual outcomes
are again random, but the product of all three is always +1. The definiteness of the product
indicates a coherent superposition, and its positivity confirms the sign in Eq. 5. Note that

8

this measurement distinguishes the pure entangled state from a mixed state of the same two
components. The mixed state would duplicate the Z-measurement results but reveal itself
through random outcomes for the product XXX.
To better fill out the picture of how the same state, Ψ(t4 ), can accommodate both a
collapse scenario and a superposition, consider the local measurement of the spin component
Xs , which "finds" the atom to have taken both paths. The outcome is random: When it
is (+1), then the product XA↑ XA↓ must also be (+1). Knowing the compatible product
ZA↑ ZA↓ = −1 (Table III), it is easy to see that the state of the two ancillae is the Bell state,
1
|ΨiAA → √ (|10i + |01i)AA .
2

(6)

On the other hand, when Xs is (−1), then XA↑ XA↓ must also be (−1), and this, combined
again with ZA↑ ZA↓ = −1, indicates another Bell state,
1
|ΨiAA → √ (|10i − |01i)AA .
2

(7)

Each of these Bell states represents perfect anticorrelations between the ancilla's Z-values,
which are individually random. This shows how the ancillae are able to respect the singleness
property, while (in correlation with the atomic spin) enabling the coherent superposition of
both paths.
It may be worth noting that the observation of either superposition state is just another form of apparent collapse - instead of finding "which path," one is finding "which
superposition of paths."
So far, we have appealed to local measurements to verify the joint eigenvalues which
define Ψ(t4 ). But since these measurements change the state, each new set of them requires
another identically prepared state of the system. One can circumvent this need and achieve
a more direct demonstration of compatibility, as follows.
B. Joint measurements and compatibility
One can measure compatible joint observables nondestructively by refusing to acquire
local information. For the singleness property (IZZ), one couples A↑ and A↓ to an added
ancilla qubit (B) through CNOT gates (Fig. 3a), so that the state of B changes if and only
if ZA↑ and ZA↓ are opposite. Thus, the readout will show that IZZ = −1 without revealing
the value of either ZA↑ or ZA↓ . Similar measurements hold for the projection property (ZZI

or ZIZ), by moving one of the CNOT connections to ancilla C, located on the (↑) leg of the
downstream Stern-Gerlach device. To measure XXX, one couples three ancillae (A↑ , A↓ ,
and C) to B through Hadamard and CNOT gates (Fig. 3b). The readout will show that
XXX = 1, and this, together with the above, establishes the superposition property.
While these joint measurements provide the (logically) most direct demonstration of
compatibility, the local measurements have the virtue of demonstrating the randomness
characteristic of ordinary measurements. So the ancilla model, subjected to local Z measurements only, is reduced to an ordinary apparatus. But the X measurements give it access
to the superposition property, which is not accessible to ordinary measurements.
It should be noted in passing that the ancilla setup in either form can be realized starting
with a photon propagating through a Mach-Zender interferometer and two ancillae, one
associated with each arm. This is an extension of the so-called delayed choice quantum
eraser (DCQE), which employs a single ancilla and is capable of realizing Wheeler's proposed
delayed choice experiment [47] (the choice between which path and a superposition of paths),
as closely realized experimentally by V. Jacques et. al. [48]. A different realization, and a
comprehensive discussion of DCQE setups, is provided in Ref. [49]. With a single ancilla,
one has a two qubit system and is able to detect the superposition and projection properties
(XX and ZZ). Superposition (XX) is manifested by interference as a function of the difference
in path lengths, and the action of the ancilla X factor corresponds to quantum erasure of
which path information. But this system cannot detect singleness as the third independent
observable. With two ancillae, on the other hand, one has a three qubit system which
accommodates this observable. Furthermore, the two-ancillae system forms a parallel with
an ordinary apparatus which employs two detectors. We show below that the singleness
10

property must hold here as a correlation between the detectors.

III.

APPARATI WITH REAL DETECTORS

Reconsider the Stern-Gerlach setup of Fig. 1 with ancillae replaced by real detectors, D↑
and D↓ . These act like the ancillae together with their readout devices: Like the ancillae,
they transmit the atom without changing its spin state (this is in keeping with the von
Neumann measurement formalism [3, 6] and the stated postulate). And, like the readout
devices, they record (irreversibly) the passage (or not) of the atom.
In this section, first, we show that the collapse properties of ordinary apparati are equivalent to those of the ancilla model, in the sense that the singleness and projection properties
are represented by observables and established at the premeasurement stage, while the randomness of "which path" information enters only at the detection stage. Then second,
we discuss the superposition property, which survives the detection stage in UQT but is
nonetheless undetectable. We offer a physical explanation why this is the case.
A. Equivalence of Collapse Properties
Recall that the ancilla-based premeasurement state, Ψ(t4 ), exhibits nonrandom collapse
properties represented by joint observables: (i) the singleness property, by ZA↑ ZA↓ = −1,
and (ii) the projection property, by Zs ZA↑ = +1 and Zs ZA↓ = −1. To show that these
properties are similarly (pre)established in ordinary measurements, note that the ancilla
operators, ZA↑ and ZA↓ , act as stand-ins for path occupation variables. And we can define
such variables for the ordinary setup as ZP ↑ = 2P↑ − 1 and ZP ↓ = 2P↓ − 1, where Pk is a
projector onto that subvolume of the path k = (↑, ↓) occupied by the spatial wave packet
φk (~r, t2 ) at time t2 . So ZP k → ±1 tells us whether or not the atom will enter the detector
Dk . The path occupation states analogous to the ancilla states may be written as |1iP ↑ |0iP ↓
and |0iP ↑ |1iP ↓ . These convey all of the necessary information about the spatial wave packets
φ↑ (t2 ) and φ↓ (t2 ), so that |ψ(t2 )i may be written as

1 
|ψ(t2 )i = √ |1is |1iP ↑ |0iP ↓ + |0is |0iP ↑ |1iP ↓ ,
2

(8)

which is analogous to Eq. 4 of the ancilla system prior to readout. This is clearly an
eigenstate of ZP ↑ ZP ↓ , Zs ZP ↑ , and Zs ZP ↓ , with eigenvalues -1, 1, and -1, respectively, thus
establishing the singleness and projection properties in the premeasurement state. These
11

properties arise here from the entanglement of just the spin and the path, with path occupation alone playing the ancillary role.
By the time t3 , the path occupation variables have mediated correlations between the
atom's spin and the detectors - analogous to the readout state in the ancilla case. The
main difference is that here, a detector readout follows closely the passage of the atom - one
cannot delay this readout as was done with the ancilla system. But the ancilla system can
duplicate this situation by moving the ancilla readouts to an earlier time, say t3 , ahead of
the atomic spin remeasurement (at some t > t4 ). The time ordering has no effect on the
final result [50].
As an aside on the projection property - although this property is axiomatic in SQT,
it is nonetheless conditioned on the above assumption that a detector transmits the atom
without changing its spin state [6]. Clearly this assumption fails for detectors which work
by absorbing the atom. In this case the projection property still holds, but it takes the form
of a correlation between the reading of a detector and the angular momentum imparted to
it. Only one detector can receive the impulse (the singleness property), and that impulse
(±~) is delivered to D↑ or D↓ , respectively, depending on which detector reads 1.
B. Blindness to Superpositions
While the collapse properties of the two systems are equivalent, the superposition property is not, being detectable in the ancilla system but not in the ordinary system. All
approaches outlined at the beginning of the paper must agree on the facts: the observation
of a single definite outcome (with its associated probability), and the invisibility of superpositions to ordinary apparati. But the approaches differ fundamentally on the physics behind
these facts. In the SQT and OCT approaches, because the detectors are macroscopic, one
of the terms existing in the premeasurement state is removed from the theory at detection. In SQT the removal is axiomatic; in OCT it is dynamical, a result of the nonlinear
stochastic model. The evolution is nonunitary in both cases. In the UQT approach, on
the other hand, the evolution including the detectors is unitary, and therefore, the state
of the atom/detectors system must reflect the superposition in Eq. 8. This approach is
viable, as we have said, only if the superposition of distinct detector states is undetectable.
Decoherence theory shows that it is (see Appendix A), but the ancilla analogy suggests a
more fundamental explanation involving irreversibility [51].

12

In UQT, the state of the atom/detectors system, at time t4 , has the same GHZ form as
Eq. 8 (or, for that matter, Eq. 5 of the ancilla system). The crucial difference is that the
detector states involve microscopic internal degrees of freedom [52], whose states are labeled
by μ and μ0 in addition to the necessary readout variables, 0 and 1 respectively. So Eq. 8
becomes

1 
(9)
|ψ(t4 )i = √ |1is |1, μ0 iD↑ |0, μiD↓ + |0is |0, μiD↑ |1, μ0 iD↓ ,
2
where we have dropped the common spatial factor at t4 as done in Eq. 5. One can imagine
(0) to be a metastable configuration of a detector, which would make a transition to a final
stable configuration (1) if triggered by the passage of the atom. Equation 9 represents just
a single element of an ensemble in which each initial state μ of the (0) configuration evolves
unitarily into the state μ0 of the (1) configuration [53]. The corresponding density matrix is
written in Appendix A. In the text, for clarity, we shall continue to refer to state vectors.
Again we ask - how can one observe a superposition involving both paths? One must
measure, among other things, the spin component Xs . Since this measurement by itself
produces random outcomes, one must measure a correlation of which Ψ(t4 ) is an eigenstate,
of which the simplest is XXX. There are three other options, such as XY Y , but these
offer nothing further. So, supposing that the Xs measurement produces the outcome +1, we
must then show that the product of detector X values is also +1. Given that the product
of detector Z values is −1, this would demonstrate that the detectors are in the Bell state
analogous to Eq. 6:

A detector operator Xk connects its 0 and 1 states, that is, |1, μ0 iDk = XDk |0, μiDk and
|0, μiDk = XDk |1, μ0 iDk . Since the first of these represents the natural evolution of the
detector, |1, μ0 i = U (t3 , t2 )|0, μi, the X operators must be
XDk = Pk (1)Uk (t3 , t2 )Pk (0) + Pk (0)Uk−1 (t3 , t2 )Pk (1),

(11)

where Pk (i) are projection operators onto the i = 0 or 1 configurations of detector Dk .
Now Uk (t3 , t2 ) represents the time evolution of a complex many-body system, and while this
is reversible in principle, it is not reversible thermodynamically [54]. That is, we do not
have control over the microscopic degrees of freedom required to implement Uk−1 (t3 , t2 ). So
the detector operators Xk are not accessible to us, and without them we cannot detect a
13

superposition of states in the 0 and 1 configurations of Dk - and we cannot access XXX,
which would demonstrate a Schrödinger cat-like superposition of the two collapse scenarios
of the spin/detectors system. In short, we only have access to the detector variables Zk
which the detectors record, and in these there can be no evidence for the existence of the
superposition which (in UQT) continues to exist in the state vector. A different but related
argument on thermodynamic irreversibility in measurement was given by Peres [55].
The demonstration of blindness changes very little with detectors which absorb the atom
rather than transmitting it, as is essentially the case in the original Stern-Gerlach experiment
[56]. This case is discussed in Appendix B.
The above arguments suggest that our inability to detect superpositions of detector output states is a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. One can imagine a
quantum Maxwell Demon who possesses the microscopic control that we lack, and is capable of detecting superpositions which are invisible to us. Thus, the quantum measurement
process, by its construction, employs the thermodynamic arrow of time. There is no need
to invoke a different "measurement" arrow.
C. A Decoherence Perspective
A decoherence argument for blindness involves the concept of the pointer; Brasil [57]
defines "pointer states (as) eigenstates of the observable of the measuring apparatus that
represents the possible positions of the display pointer of the equipment." The concept was
introduced in the present context by Zeh [58] and developed by Zurek [14, 59], who showed
that interactions with the environment select the pointer's preferred basis (the states we
observe). In our system these states are associated with the pair of detectors; they are
denoted by |1iD↑ |0iD↓ and |0iD↑ |1iD↓ (or in shorthand, |10iDD and |01iDD ), by simply
dropping the environmental variables μ and μ0 .
An argument specific to our system is written out in Appendix A. In brief, one traces
over the environmental degrees of freedom (μ and μ0 ) within each detector, and derives the
reduced density matrix of the spin/pointer system, which is diagonal in the basis |110isDD
and |001isDD , where the second and third indices refer to the pointer. In the case of detectors
which absorb the atom, this basis reduces to just that of the pointer, |10iDD and |01iDD .
In either case, blindness to superpositions is represented by the diagonality of the (2 × 2)
density matrix.

14

There are interesting consequences when the pointer is realized within the system of
two detectors. Environmental interactions determine the preferred basis of an individual
detector, |1iDk and |0iDk (corresponding to atom/no atom, or ZDk = ±1). But they do
not determine the preferred basis of the full pointer associated with the pair of detectors,
because they do not exclude the possibility of |11iDD and |00iDD - exclusion resulting from
the singleness property. In fact, the environment is not responsible for the singleness or
the projection property, or implicitly, for the choice of which spin component is measured
- all of which are established in premeasurement. So, while the environment is crucial for
enforcing the blindness to superpositions, its role (whether internal or expanded to include
the external) is limited to the proper functioning of the individual detectors.
This separation between the premeasurement stage (governed by reversible unitary evolution), and the detection stage (where the environment enters bringing practical irreversibility), is the defining characteristic of controlled von Neumann-type measurements. The roles
of these stages are in some sense complementary: While blindness to superpositions may be
seen as an emergent classical property induced by interactions with the environment, the
singleness and projection properties are quantum entanglement properties, represented by
observables and manifested in correlations between noninteracting macroscopic objects.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

We studied an ancilla-aided Stern-Gerlach experiment allowing delayed-choice measurements on the three-qubit system of atomic spin and two ancillae acting as virtual detectors.
We first considered local measurements, and showed that one choice (Zi ) reproduces the
collapse properties of ordinary (unaided) measurements, while another (Xi ) demonstrates a
superposition of the two collapse-like scenarios, involving both paths. Both choices require
repeated measurements on identically-prepared states of the system, since local measurements destroy the state.
So secondly, we showed that nondestructive measurements can be made by avoiding
the acquisition of local information. Thus relinquishing only the specific "which path"
information, one can still measure a complete set of commuting joint observables - these
represent the superposition property and the two (nonrandom) collapse properties, namely
the singleness and projection properties.
15

In Sec. III we applied the above ideas to an ordinary apparatus. First, we showed that the
collapse properties occur with the same status as in the ancilla model: The singleness and
projection properties are represented by operators and established at the premeasurement
stage, while the randomness of local measurement outcomes enters only at the detection
stage, as a consequence of the singleness property. The various approaches mentioned in
the introduction - the standard, unitary, and objective collapse approaches - agree on the
observed collapse phenomenon itself, but they differ on its unobservable underpinnings - the
existence/nonexistence of unobserved branches in the state vector - and the nature of the
observed randomness of outcomes (is it objective or subjective?). It is possible, but far from
certain, that future experiments alone will resolve these differences.
The viability of the UQT approach rests upon the invisibility of the alternate (unobserved)
branches in the state vector. The ancilla system points to a simple explanation: Detectors
are irreversible, and this makes the required complementary local observables (XD↑ and
XD↓ ) inaccessible. The absence of a known fundamental mechanism of irreversibility acting
in typical measurements suggests that the irreversibility is thermodynamic, so that (at least
within UQT), the observed collapse phenomenon is a manifestation of the second law.
Appendix A: Density Matrix of Spin-Detectors System
Here we write out the density matrix of the spin/detectors system, and we show how
the trace over the unobserved states of the detectors' internal degrees of freedom yields
the appropriate reduced density matrix, which expresses the blindness of the apparatus to
superpositions of output states.
The initial mixed state of the spin/detectors system, assuming probabilities pμ↑ and pμ↓
for the microstates, |0, μ↑ iD↑ and |0, μ↓ iD↓ of the two detectors, is

Since we only read the detectors' outputs and do not monitor the microscopic degrees of
freedom (considered as the "environment" E), we trace over the latter to define the reduced
16

density matrix describing the state of the spin and the detector displays, which is called
the spin/pointer system [57]). To be more precise, each detector consists of its own pointer
(with readout states 0 and 1), and its own environment (with associated states μ and μ0 ,
respectively). The trace consists of independent traces over the environments within each
detector, i.e., ρr (t4 ) ≡ T rE↑ ,E↓ ρ(t4 ). To evaluate each of these, it is convenient to sum over
P
μ (i.e., μ hμ|...|μi in those terms where the pointer state 0 appears, and over μ0 where it
does not. The latter choice is legitimate because the two sets are related unitarily. It is
straightforward then to show that
ρr (t4 ) = |α|2 |1is |1iD↑ |0iD↓ h1|s h1|D↑ h0|D↓

(14)

The environmental sums in the second and third terms essentially vanish (they are undetectably small) because the inner product factors, none greater than unity in magnitude,
have random phases, in contrast with analogous factors (hμ|μihμ0 |μ0 i = 1) which appeared
in the first and fourth terms and summed to unity. Thus ρr is diagonal in the spin-pointer
basis, which consists of |1is |1iD↑ |0iD↓ and |0is |0iD↑ |1iD↓ . The surviving singleness and projection correlations result from the entanglement generated between Eqs. 12 and 13 by the
passage of the atom. In fact it should be noted that, except for the remaining summations in
the off-diagonal terms, Eq. 14 is equivalent in form to the density matrix of the spin-ancilla
system (see Eq. 4 in Sec. II). Thus, the environmental factors in 14 neatly summarize how
the superposition of outcomes becomes undetectable with real detectors.
Appendix B: Detectors that Absorb
In the original Stern-Gerlach experiment [56], silver atoms were directed at a glass plate
and formed two separated deposits, with segments of the glass acting as the two detectors.
Imagining ideally a pair of absorbing single-atom detectors, their state at time t3 could
still be written as in Eq. 10, but the 1 states now represent the absorbed atom as well as
excitations created by the absorption event. Natural evolution produces these states from
the 0 states of the detectors multiplied by the corresponding path occupation states |1iP k

17

of the atom: |1, μ0 iDk = U (t3 , t2 )|0, μiDk |1iP k . So the XDk operator analogous to Eq. 11 is
XDk = Pk (1)Uk (t3 , t2 )|1iP k Pk (0)h1|P k + |1iP k Pk (0)h1|P k Uk−1 (t3 , t2 )Pk (1),

(15)

and the subsequent blindness argument is unchanged.
The decoherence approach of Appendix A is similarly adapted: Since the |μ0 i states
include the absorbed atom, the inner product factors in 14 are replaced by h1|P k hμ|μ0 i or
its complex conjugate. The set {μ0 } is not complete because it refers to more particles than
{μ}, but it includes all states generated unitarily from {μ} and the incident atom.
