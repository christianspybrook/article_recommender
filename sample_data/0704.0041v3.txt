Abstract
We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact
quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described
by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact
quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly
noncommutative) manifold. Our formulation accommodates spectral
triples which are not of type II. We give explicit description of quantum
isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this
context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in [8] as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative
torus.

Introduction

Since the formulation of quantum automorphism groups by Wang ([9], [10]),
following suggestions of Alain Connes, many interesting examples of such
quantum groups, particularly the quantum permutation groups of finite sets
and finite graphs, have been extensively studied by a number of mathematicians (see, e.g. [1], [2], [11] and references therein), who have also found
applications to and interaction with areas like free probability and subfactor
theory. The underlying basic principle of defining a quantum automorphism
group corresponding to some given mathematical structure (for example, a
finite set, a graph, a C ∗ or von Neumann algebra) consists of two steps :
first, to identify (if possible) the group of automorphisms of the structure as
a universal object in a suitable category, and then, try to look for the universal object in a similar but bigger category by replacing groups by quantum
groups of appropriate type. However, most of the work done so far concern

some kind of quantum automorphism groups of a 'finite' structure, for example, of finite sets or finite dimensional matrix algebras. It is thus quite
natural to try to extend these ideas to the 'infinite' or 'continuous' mathematical structures, for example classical and noncommutative manifolds. In
the present article, we have made an attempt to formulate and study the
quantum analogues of the groups of Riemannian isometries, which play a
very important role in the classical differential geometry. The group of Riemannian isometries of a compact Riemannian manifold M can be viewed as
the universal object in the category of all compact metrizable groups acting
on M , with smooth and isometric action. Therefore, to define the quantum
isometry group, it is reasonable to consider a category of compact quantum
groups which act on the manifold (or more generally, on a noncommutative
manifold given by spectral triple) in a 'nice' way, preserving the Riemannian
structure in some suitable sense, to be precisely formulated. In this article,
we have given a definition of such 'smooth and isometric' action by a compact quantum group on a (possibly noncommutative) manifold, extending
the notion of smooth and isometric action by a group on a classical manifold. Indeed, the meaning of isometric action is nothing but that the action
should commute with the 'Laplacian' coming from the spectral triple, and
we should mention that this idea was already present in [2], though only in
the context of a finite metric space or a finite graph. The universal object
in the category of such quantum groups, if it exists, should be thought of as
the quantum analogue of the group of isometries, and we have been able to
prove its existence under some regularity assumptions, all of which can be
verified for a general compact connected Riemannian manifold as well as the
standard examples of noncommutative manifolds. We believe that a detailed
study of quantum isometry groups will not only give many new and interesting examples of compact quantum groups, it will also contribute to the
understanding of quantum group covariant spectral triples. In a forthcoming article [3] with J. Bhowmick; we shall provide explicit computations of
quantum isometry groups of a few classical and noncommutative manifolds.
However, we briefly quote some of main results of [3] in the present article.
One interesting observation is that the quantum isometry group of the noncommutative two-torus Aθ (with the canonical spectral triple) is (as a C ∗
algebra) a direct sum of two commutative and two noncommutative tori,
and contains as a quantum subgroup (which is universal for certain class of
isometric actions called holomorphic isometries) the 'quantum double-torus'
discovered and studied by Hajac and Masuda ([8]).

Definition of the quantum isometry group

We begin with a well-known characterization of the isometry group of a (classical) compact Riemannian manifold. Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian
manifold and let Ω1 = Ω1 (M ) be the space of smooth one-forms, which has
a right Hilbert-C ∞ (M )-module structure given by the C ∞ (M )-valued inner
product << *, * >> defined by
<< ω, η >> (m) =< ω(m), η(m) > |m ,
∗ M at
where < *, * > |m is the Riemannian metric on the cotangent space Tm
1
the point m ∈ M . The Riemannian volume form allows us to make Ω a preHilbert space, and we denote its completion by H1 . Let H0 = L2 (M, dvol)
and consider the de-Rham differential d as an unbounded linear map from
H0 to H1 , with the natural domain C ∞ (M ) ⊂ H0 , and also denote its closure
by d. Let L := −d∗ d. The following identity can be verified by direct and
easy computation using the local coordinates :

(∂L)(φ, ψ) ≡ L(φ̄ψ)−L(φ̄)ψ−φ̄L(ψ) =<< dφ, dψ >> for φ, ψ ∈ C ∞ (M ) (∗).
Proposition 2.1 A smooth map γ : M → M is a Riemannian isometry if
and only if γ commutes with L in the sense that L(f ◦ γ) = (L(f )) ◦ γ for
all f ∈ C ∞ (M ).
Proof :
If γ commutes with L then from the identity (*) we get for m ∈ M and
φ, ψ ∈ C ∞ (M ) :
< dφ|γ(m) , dψ|γ(m) > |γ(m)
= << dφ, dψ >> (γ(m))
= (∂L(φ, ψ) ◦ γ)(m)
= ∂L(φ ◦ γ, ψ ◦ γ)(m)
= << d(φ ◦ γ), d(ψ ◦ γ) >> (m)
= < d(φ ◦ γ)|m , d(ψ ◦ γ)|m > |m
= < (dγ|m )∗ (dφ|γ(m) ), (dγ|m )∗ (dψ|γ(m) ) > |m ,
∗
∗ M is an isometry. Thus, γ is a
which proves that (dγ|m )∗ : Tγ(m)
M → Tm
Riemannian isometry.
Conversely, if γ is an isometry, both the maps induced by γ on H0 and
H1 , i.e. Uγ0 : H0 → H0 given by Uγ0 (f ) = f ◦ γ and Uγ1 : H1 → H1

3

given by Uγ1 (f dφ) = (f ◦ γ)d(φ ◦ γ) are unitaries. Moreover, dUγ0 = Uγ1 d on
C ∞ (M ) ⊂ H0 . From this, it follows that d∗ d (and hence L) commutes with
Uγ0 . ✷
Now let us consider a compact metrizable (i.e. second countable) group
G acting continuously on M and let α : C(M ) → C(M )⊗C(G) ∼
= C(M ×G)
be the map given by α(f )(m, g) := f (gm) for g ∈ G, m ∈ M and f ∈ C(M ).
For a state φ on C(G), denote by αφ the map (id ⊗ φ) ◦ α : C(M ) → C(M ).
Then we have the following
Theorem 2.2 (i) The G-action is smooth, i.e. m 7→ gm is C ∞ for every
g ∈ G, if and only if αφ (C ∞ (M )) ⊆ C ∞ (M ) for all φ.
(ii) If the action is smooth, then it is also isometric (i.e. m 7→ gm is
isometry ∀g) if and only if αφ commutes with (L − λ)−1 for all state φ
and all λ in the resolvent of L (equivalently, αφ commutes with the heat
semigroup Tt ≡ etL for all t ≥ 0).
Proof :
The 'if part' of (i) follows by considering the states corresponding to point
evaluation, i.e. C(G) ∋ ξ 7→ ξ(g), g ∈ G. For the converse, we note that
an arbitrary
state φ corresponds to a regular
Borel measure μ on G so that
R
R
φ(ξ) = ξdμ, and thus, αφ (f )(m) = f (gm)dμ(g) for f ∈ C(M ). From
this, by interchanging differentiation and integation (which is allowed by
the Dominated Convergence Theorem, since μ is a finite measure) we can
prove that αφ (f ) is C ∞ whenever f is so. The assertion (ii) follows from
Proposition 2.1 in a straghtforward way. ✷
In view of the above result and the fact that the group of isometries
of M , denoted by ISO(M ), is a compact second countable (i.e. compact
metrizable) group, we see that ISO(M ) is the maximal compact second
countable group acting on M such that the action is smooth and isometric.
In other words, if we consider a catogory whose objects are compact metrizable groups acting smoothly and isometrically on M , and morphisms are the
group homomorphisms commuting with the actions on M , then ISO(M )
(with its canonical action on M ) is the initial object of this cateogory. It
is now quite natural to formulate a quantum analogue of the above. In
fact, we want to go beyond classical manifolds and define quantum isometry
group QISO(A∞ , H, D) for a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D), with A∞ being
unital. Given a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D), we recall from [7] and [5] the
construction of the space of one-forms. We have a derivation from A∞ to
the A∞ -A∞ bimodule B(H) given by a 7→ [D, a]. This induces a bimodule
4

morphism π from Ω1 (A∞ ) (the bimodule of universal one-forms on A∞ ) to
B(H), such that π(δ(a)) = [D, a], where δ : A∞ → Ω1 (A∞ ) denotes the
universal derivation map. We set Ω1D ≡ Ω1D (A∞ ) := Ω1 (A∞ )/Ker(π) ∼
=
π(Ω1 (A∞ )) ⊆ B(H). Assume that the spectral triple is of compact type and
has a finite dimension in the sense of Connes ([5]), i.e. there is some p > 0
such that the operator |D|−p (interpreted as the inverse of the restriction of
|D|p on the closure of its range, which has a finite co-dimension since D has
compact resolvents) has finite nonzero Dixmier trace, denoted by T rω (where
ω is some suitable Banach limit, see, e.g. [5], [7]). Consider the canonical
'volume form' τ coming from the Dixmier trace, i.e. τ : B(H) → C defined
1
−p ). Let us at this point assume that the
by τ (A) := T rω (|D|
−p ) T rω (A|D|
∞
∞
spectral triple is QC , i.e. A and {[D, a], a ∈ A∞ } are contained in the
domains of all powers of the derivation [|D|, *]. Under this assumption, τ is a
positive trace on the C ∗ -subalgebra generated by A∞ and {[D, a] a ∈ A∞ },
0 . Similarly, we equip
and the GNS Hilbert space L2 (A∞ , τ ) is denoted by HD
1

ΩD with a semi-inner product given by < η, η >:= τ (η ∗ η ′ ), and denote the
1 . The map d : H0 → H1 given by
Hilbert space obtained from it by HD

D
dD (*) = [D, *] is an unbounded densely defined linear map. Let us assume
the following:
Assumption(i) (a) dD is closable (the closure is denoted again by dD );
(b) A∞ ⊆ Dom(L), where L := −d∗D dD and A∞ is viewed as a dense sub0 ;
space of HD
At this point, let us show that this assumption is valid under a very
natural condition on the spectral triple.
Lemma 2.3 Suppose that for every element a ∈ A∞ , the map R ∋ t 7→
αt (X) := exp(itD)Xexp(−itD) is differentiable at t = 0 in the normtopology of B(H), where X = a or [D, a]. Then the assumption (i) is satisfied. Moreover, in this case, L maps A∞ into the weak closure of A∞ in
0 ).
B(HD
Proof :
We first observe that τ (αt (A)) = τ (A) for all t and for all A ∈ B(H), since
exp(itD) commutes with |D|−p . If moreover, A belongs to the domain of
→ i[D, A] in operatornorm-differentiability (at t = 0) of αt , i.e. αt (A)−A
t
norm, then it follows from the property of the Dixmier trace that τ ([D, A]) =
τ (αt (A))−τ (A)
1
= 0. Now, since by assumption we have the normi limt→0
t
5

differentiability at t = 0 of αt (A) for A belonging to the ∗-subalgebra (say
B) generated by A∞ and [D, A∞ ], it follows that τ ([D, A]) = 0 ∀A ∈ B. Let
us now fix a, b, c ∈ A∞ and observe that
< a dD (b), dD (c) >= τ ((a dD (b))∗ dD (c) >= −τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ c])+τ ([D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]c),
using the fact that τ ([D, b∗ ]a∗ c) = 0. This implies
1

| < a dD (b), dD (c) > | ≤ k[D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]kτ (c∗ c) 2 = k[D, [D, b∗ ]a∗ ]kkck2 ,
1

0 . This proves that
where kck2 = τ (c∗ c) 2 denotes the L2 -norm of c ∈ HD
a dD (b) belongs to the domain of d∗D for all a, b ∈ A∞ , so in particular
d∗D is dense, i.e. dD is closable. Moreover, taking a = 1, we see that
dD (A∞ ) ⊆ Dom(d∗D ), or in other words, A∞ ⊆ Dom(d∗D dD ). This proves
(i)(a) and (i)(b). The last sentence in the statement of the lemma can be
proven along the line of Theorem 2.9, page 129, [7]. ✷
We need few more assumptions on the operator L to define the quantum
isometry group.

Assumption (ii): L has compact resolvents,
Assumption(iii): L(A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ ;
Assumption(iv): Each eigenvector of L (which has a discrete spectrum,
hence a complete set of eigenvectors) belongs to A∞ ;
Assumption(v) ('connectedness assumption'): the kernel of L is one-dimensional,
0 .
spanned by the identity 1 of A∞ , viewed as a unit vector in HD
We call L the noncommutative Laplacian and Tt the noncommutative heat
semigroup. We summarize some simple observations in form of the following
Lemma 2.4 (a) If the assumptions (i)-(v) are valid, then for x ∈ A∞ , we
have L(x∗ ) = (L(x))∗ .
0 into A∞ for all t > 0, the the assumption
(b) If Tt := exp(tL) maps HD
(iv) is satisfied.
Proof :
It follows by simple calculation using the facts that τ is a trace and dD (x∗ ) =
−(dD (x))∗ that
τ (L(x∗ )∗ y)
= −τ (dD (x)dD (y)) = −τ (dD (y)dD (x)) = τ ((dD (y ∗ ))∗ dD (x))
= < y ∗ , L(x) >= τ (yL(x)) = τ (L(x)y),
0 (a) follows. To prove (b), we note
for all y ∈ A∞ . By density of A∞ in HD
0 is an eigenvector of L, say L(x) = λx (λ ∈ C), then we have
that if x ∈ HD

6

Tt (x) = eλt x, hence x = e−λt Tt (x) ∈ A∞ . ✷
Since by assumption, L has a countable set of eigenvalues each with finite
multiplicity, let us denote them by λ0 = 0, λ1 , λ2 , ... with V0 = C 1, V1 , V2 , ...
be corresponding eigenspaces (finite dimensional), and for each i, let {eij , j =
1, ..., di } be an orthonormal basis of Vi . By Lemma 2.4, Vi ⊆ A∞ for each i,
Vi is closed under ∗, and moreover, {e∗ij , j = 1, ..., di } is also an orthonormal
basis for Vi , since τ (x∗ y) = τ (yx∗ ) for x, y ∈ A∞ . We also make the following
Assumption (vi) The complex linear span of {eij , i = 0, 1, ...; j = 1, ..., di },
∞
say A∞
0 , is norm-dense in A .
Lemma 2.5 The assumptions (i)-(iv), (vi) are satisfied by the usual Laplacian on an arbitrary compact Riemannian spin manifold M , and (v) is satisfied if M is connected.
Proof :
We prove only the assumption (vi), since the rest are quite well-known properties of the Laplacian. The property (vi) is a consequence of the asymptotic
estimates of eigenvalues λi , as well as the uniform bound of the eigenfunctions eij . For example, it is known ([6],Theorem 1.2) that there exist conn−1
n−1
2 , where n is the
stants C, C ′ such that keij k∞ ≤ C|λi | 4 , di ≤ C ′ |λi | T
dimension of the manifold M . Now, for f ∈ C ∞ (M ) ⊆ k≥1 Dom(Lk ), we
P
write f as an a-priori L2 -convergent series ij fij eij (fij ∈ C), and observe
P
that
|fij |2P
|λi |2k < ∞ for every k ≥ 1. Choose and fix sufficiently large
k such that i≥0 |λi |n−1−2k < ∞, which is possible due to the well-known
Weyl asymptotics of eigenvalues of L. Now, by Cauchy-Schwartz and the
estimate for di , we have

Thus, the series ij fij eij converges to f in sup-norm, so A∞

sup-norm in C (M ), hence in C(M ) as well. ✷
Definition 2.6 We say that a spectral triple satisfying the assumptions (i)(vi) admissible.

Remark 2.7 We have just seen that classical spectral triple (A∞ = C ∞ (M ), H, D),
where M is compact connected spin manifold, H is the L2 space of square
integrable spinors and D is the Dirac operator, is indeed admissible in our
sense. Later on we shall discuss how we can weaken the connectedness
assumption as well, thus accommodating a general classical (commutative)
spectral triple in our set-up. Moreover, the standard examples of noncommutative spectral triples, e.g. those on Aθ , quantum Heisenberg manifold
etc., do belong to the admissible class.
Lemma 2.8 Let us assume that the spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) is admissible.

If Ψ : A∞
0 → A0 is a (norm-) bounded linear map, such that Ψ(1) = 1, and
Ψ ◦ L = L ◦ Ψ on the subspace A∞
0 spanned (algebraically) by Vi , i = 1, 2, ...,
then τ (Ψ(x)) = τ (x) for all x ∈ A∞ .
Proof :
Since Ψ commutes with L it is clear that Ψ mapsTeach Vi into itself. By
assumption (v), V0 is T

0 . By the norm-continuity of Ψ and τ it extends to the whole of A .
✷
We now introduce the quantum analogue of a smooth isometric action
on the noncommutative manifold A∞ . We recall from [12] that a compact
quantum group is a unital separable C ∗ algebra S equipped with a unital
C ∗ -homomorphism ∆ : S → S ⊗ S (where ⊗ denotes the spatial tensor
product) satisfying
(ai) (∆ ⊗ id) ◦ ∆ = (id ⊗ ∆) ◦ ∆ (co-associativity), and
(aii) the linear span of ∆(S)(S ⊗ 1) and ∆(S)(1 ⊗ S) are norm-dense in
S ⊗ S.
It is well-known (see [12]) that there is a canonical dense ∗-subalgebra S ∞
of S, consisting of the matrix coefficients of the finite dimensional unitary
(co)-representations of S, and maps ǫ : S ∞ → C (co-unit) and κ : S ∞ → S ∞
(antipode) defined on S ∞ which make S ∞ a Hopf ∗-algebra.
We say that the compact quantum group (S, ∆) (co)-acts on a unital C ∗
algebra B, if there is a unital C ∗ -homomorphism α : B → B ⊗ S satisfying
the following :
(bi) (α ⊗ id) ◦ α = (id ⊗ ∆) ◦ α, and
(bii) the linear span of α(B)(1 ⊗ S) is norm-dense in B ⊗ S.
8

It can be proved (see [10]) that the condition (bii) is equivalent to the following :
(bii′ ) there exists of a dense unital ∗-subalgebra B ∞ of B such that the action α on B ∞ is algebraic in the sense that α(B ∞ ) ⊆ B ∞ ⊗alg S ∞ , and
(bii′′ ) (id ⊗ ǫ)α = id on B ∞ .

Before we formulate the quantum analogue of smooth isometric action,
let us prove a slightly stronger version of Theorem 2.2.
Lemma 2.9 Let M be a compact connected Riemannian spin manifold, with
the admissible spectral triple (A∞ = C ∞ (M ), H, D), where D is the standard Dirac operator on square integrale spinors, and let G, L, α be as in
Theorem 2.2. Let A∞
0 be the alegbraic span of eigenvectors of L. Then we
haveTthe following
(i) n≥0 Dom(Ln ) = A∞ .
(ii) α is smooth isometric if and only if for every state φ on C(G), we have
∞
∞
αφ (A∞
0 ) ⊆ A0 , and αφ L = Lαφ on A0 .
Proof :
The assertion (i) follows from the well-known Sobolev Embedding Theorem.
To prove the nontrivial implication in (ii), we assume that αφ leaves A∞
0
invariant and commutes with L on it, for every state φ. To prove that α
is a smooth isometric action, it is enough (by Theorem 2.2) to prove that
αg (A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ for all g ∈ G, where αg := (id⊗evg ), evg being the evaluation
at the point g. Clearly, α is a ∗-automorphism of A, which extends to a
unitary on L2 (M, dvol) by Lemma 2.8, to be denoted by the same notation.
Since A∞
0 is a core for the self-adjoint operator L and αg commutes with
n
L on A∞
0 , it follows that αg commutes with L for all n, and in particular
leaves invariant the domains of each Ln , hence αg (A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ . ✷
In view of the above characterization of smooth isometric action on a
classical manifold, we make the following definition.
Definition 2.10 A compact quantum group (S, ∆) is said to act on the noncommutative manifold A∞ (or, more precisely on the corresponding spectral
triple) smoothly and isometrically if there is a C ∗ -action α : A → A ⊗ S
(where A denotes the C ∗ algebra obtained by completing A∞ in the norm of
0 )), such that α := (id ⊗ φ) ◦ α maps A∞ into itself and commutes
B(HD
φ
0
with L on A∞ 0 , for every state φ on S.

Let us now recall the concept of universal quantum groups as in [11],
[9] and references therein. We shall use most of the terminologies of [9],
e.g. Woronowicz C ∗ -subalgebra, Woronowicz C ∗ -ideal etc, however with
the exception that we shall call the Woronowicz C ∗ algebras just compact
quantum groups, and not use the term compact quantum groups for the
dual objects as done in [9]. For Q ∈ GLn (C), let Au (Q) denote the universal compact quantum group generated by uij , i, j = 1, ..., n satisfying the
relations
uu∗ = In = u∗ u, u′ QuQ−1 = In = QuQ−1 u′ ,
where u = ((uij )), u′ = ((uji )) and u = ((u∗ij )). We refer the reader to [11]
for the definition of the coproduct and discussion on the structure and classification of such quantum groups. Let us denote by Ui the quantum group
Adi (I), where di is dimension of the subspace Vi . We fix a representation
P
(i)
βi : Vi → Vi ⊗Ui of Ui on the Hilbert space Vi , given by βi (eij ) = k eik ⊗ukj ,
(i)

for j = 1, ..., di , where u(i) ≡ ukj are the generators of Ui as discussed before.
Thus, both u(i) and u ̄(i) are unitaries. It follows from [9] that the representations βi canonically induce a representation β = ∗i βi of the free product
U := ∗i Ui (which is a compact quantum group, see [9] for the details) on the
0 , such that the restriction of β on V coincides with β for
Hilbert space HD
i
i
all i. We are now ready to state and prove a key lemma.
Lemma 2.11 Consider an admissible spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) and let
(S, ∆) be a compact quantum group acting on A∞ smoothly and isometrically. Moreover, assume that the action (say α) is faithful in the sense that
there is no proper Woronowicz C ∗ -subalgebra S1 of S such that α(A∞ ) ⊆
A∞ ⊗ S1 . Then α : A∞ → A∞ ⊗ S extends to a unitary representation
0 . Moreover, we can find an isomorphism
(denoted again by α) of S on HD
(of compact quantum groups) φ : U/I → S between S and a quotient of U
by a Woronowicz C ∗ -ideal I of U, such that α = (id ⊗ φ) ◦ (id ⊗ ΠI ) ◦ β on
0 , where Π denotes the quotient map from U to U/I.
A ∞ ⊆ HD
I
Proof :
Let ω be any state on S. Since the action α : A∞ → A∞ ⊗ S is smooth
and isometric, we conclude by Lemma 2.8 that τ (αω (x)) = τ (x)ω(1) for all
x ∈ A. Since ω is arbitrary, we have (τ ⊗ id)α(x) = τ (x)1S for all x ∈ A.
So, < α(x), α(y) >S =< x, y > 1S , where < *, * >S denotes the S-valued
0 ⊗ S. This proves that α̃ defined by
inner product of the Hilbert module HD
α̃(x ⊗ b) := α(x)(1 ⊗ b) (x ∈ A∞ , b ∈ S) extends to an S-linear isometry on
0 ⊗ S. Moreover, since α(A∞ )(1 ⊗ S) is norm-dense
the Hilbert S-module HD
10

in Ā ⊗ S, it is clear that the S-linear span of the range of α(A∞ ) is dense in
0 ⊗ S, or in other words, the isometry α̃ has a dense
the Hilbert module HD
range, so it is a unitary. Since αω leaves each Vi invariant, it is clear that
(i)
α maps Vi into Vi ⊗ S for each i. Let vkj (j, k = 1, ..., di ) be the elements
P
(i)
(i)
of S such that α(eij ) = k eik ⊗ vkj . The algebra generated by vkj is a
(i)

Hopf algebra, and vi := ((vkj )) is a unitary in Mdi (C) ⊗ S. Moreover, the
(i)

∗-subalgebra generated by all vkj 's , with i, j, k varying, must be dense in
S by the assumption of faithfulness.
Now, we have already remarked that {e∗ij } is also an orthonormal basis of Vi , and since α, being a C ∗ -action on A, is ∗-preserving, we have
P
(i)∗
(i)∗
α(e∗ij ) = (α(eij ))∗ = k e∗ik ⊗ vkj , and therefore ((vkj )) is also unitary. By
(i)

universality of Ui , there is a C ∗ -homomorphism from Ui to S sending ukj to
(i)

vkj , and by definition of the free product, this induces a C ∗ -homomorphism,
say Π, from U onto S, which is easily seen to be a surjective morphism
of compact quantum groups. Thus, we obtain the Woronowicz C ∗ -ideal
I := Ker(Π), so that U/I ∼
= S. ✷
Now we can give the definition of the quantum isometry group. Fix an
admissible spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) and consider a category QISO whose
objects are the pairs (S, α) where S is a compact quantum group and α is
a smooth isometric (not necessarily faithful) action of S on A∞ . The set of
morphisms from (S, α) to (S ′ , α′ ) are the morphisms ψ : S → S ′ of compact
quantum groups, satisfying (id ⊗ ψ) ◦ α = α′ . We prove below that the
category QISO has a (unique upto isomorphism) universal (initial) object.
We shall need an elementary fact, which is stated as a lemma.
Lemma 2.12 Let C be a C ∗ algebra and F be a nonempty collection of
closed ideals of C. Then for any x ∈ C, we have
sup kx + Ik = kx + I0 k,

I∈F

where I0 denotes the intersection of all I in F and kx + Ik = inf {kx −
yk : y ∈ I} denotes the norm in C/I.
Proof :
It is clear that supI∈F kx + Ik defines a norm on C/I0 , which is in fact a
C ∗ -norm since each of the quotient norms k * +Ik is so. Thus the lemma
follows from the uniqueness of C ∗ norm on the C ∗ algebra C/I0 . ✷
11

Theorem 2.13 There exists a (unique upto isomorphism ) compact quantum group (S0 , ∆0 ) which is universal in the category QISO.
Proof :
Recall the quantum group U considered before, and its unitary representa0 . By our definition of β, it is clear that β(A∞ ) ⊆ A∞ ⊗
tion β on HD
alg
0
0
U. However, β is only a linear map (unitary) but not necessarily a ∗homomorphism. We shall construct the universal object as a suitable quotient of U. Let F be the collection of all those Woronowicz C ∗ -ideals I of
∞
U such that the composition ΓI := (id ⊗ ΠI ) ◦ β : A∞
0 → A0 ⊗alg (U/I)
∗
extends to a C -homomorphsim from Ā to Ā ⊗ (S/I), where ΠI denotes
the quotient map from U onto U/I. This collection is nonempty, since
the trivial group, viewed as a quantum group, acts faithfully, smoothly
and isometrically on A∞ , and by Lemma 2.11 we do get a member of F.
Now, let I0 be the intersection of all ideals in F. We claim that I0 is
again a member of F. Since any C ∗ -homomorphism is contractive, we have
kΓI (a)k ≡ kβ(a) + Ā ⊗ Ik ≤ kak for all a ∈ A∞
0 and I ∈ F. By Lemma
,
so ΓI0 extends to a norm2.12, we see that kΓI0 (a)k ≤ kak for a ∈ A∞
0
∞
contractive map on Ā by the density of A0 in Ā. Moreover, For a, b ∈ Ā
and for I ∈ F, we have ΓI (ab) = ΓI (a)ΓI (b). Since ΠI = ΠI ◦ ΠI0 , we can
rewrite the homomorphic property of ΓI as
ΓI0 (ab) − ΓI0 (a)ΓI0 (b) ∈ Ā ⊗ (I/I0 ).
Since this holds for every I ∈ F, we conclude that ΓI0 (ab) − ΓI0 (a)ΓI0 (b) ∈
T
I∈F Ā ⊗ (I/I0 ) = (0), i.e. ΓI0 is a homomorphism. In a similar way, we
can show that it is a ∗-homomorphism. To see that ΓI0 is indeed an action of
the compact quantum group U/I0 on Ā, we observe that the conditions bii′
and bii′′ are satisfied by taking for B ∞ the ∗-subalgebra generated by A∞
0 ,
since ΠI0 (U ∞ ) ⊆ (U/I0 )∞ . Indeed, the counit of U/I0 , say ǫ0 , is nothing
but the composite map ǫ ◦ ΠI0 where ǫ denotes the counit of U, defined
(i)
by ǫ(ukj ) = δkj (δkj denotes the Kronecker delta), and it is clear from the
construction of β that (id ⊗ ǫ)(β(a)) = a for a ∈ A∞
0 . It follows from this
∞
that (id ⊗ ǫ0 ) ◦ ΓI0 = id on A0 , hence on the ∗-algebra generated by A∞
0 .
Finally, we claim that S0 := U/I0 is the desired universal object. To see
this, consider any compact quantum group S acting smoothly and isometrically on A∞ . Without loss of generality we can assume the action to be
faithful, since otherwise we can replace S by the Woronowicz C ∗ -subalgebra
generated by the matrix elements of the action on A∞
0 . But by Lemma 2.11
we can further assume that S is isomorphic with U/I for some I ∈ F. Since
12

I0 ⊆ I, we have a natural morphism of quantum groups from U/I0 onto
U/I, sending x + I0 to x + I. ✷
Definition 2.14 We shall call the universal object (S0 , ∆0 ) obtained in the
theorem above the quantum isometry group of (A∞ , H, D) and denote it
by QISO(A∞ , H, D), or just QISO(A∞ ) (or sometimes QISO(Ā)) if the
spectral triple is understood from the context.
Remark 2.15 Assume that an admissible spectral
triple (A∞ , H, D) also
T
satisfies the condition (i) of Lemma 2.9, i.e.
Dom(Ln ) = A∞ . Let α :
A → A⊗S be a smooth isometric action on A∞ by a compact quantum group
S. We recall from the proof of Lemma 2.11 that the map α̃ from A ⊗ S to
0 ⊗ S, i.e.
itself extends to an S-linear unitary on the Hilbert S-module HD
0
α̃ can be viewed as a unitary in B(HD ) ⊗ S. Clearly, for any state φ on
0 ). Now, by the definition of a smooth
S, we have αφ = (id ⊗ φ)(α̃) ∈ B(HD
isometric action, the bounded operator αφ commutes with the self-adjoint
L. So, αφ must commute with Ln
operator L on A∞
0 , which is a core for T
∞
for all n, and in particular keeps A = n Dom(Ln ) invariant.
Let us now briefly indicate how one can weaken the hypothesis of connectedness. Such an extension of our results is desirable to accommodate
the classical spaces, including the finite sets and graphs, in our framework.
We present a rather tentative approach to do this, and do hope to improve
on it in future. If A∞ = C ∞ (M ) where M is manifold with N connected
components, say M1 , ..., MN , any element of the classical isometry group
ISO(M ) maps each Mi to some Mj . Taking this as the guiding principle,
we make the following

Definition 2.16 We say that a spectral triple (A∞ , H, D) has N admissible
connected components if it is a direct sum of N admissible spectral triples.
That is, there is a direct sum decomposition H = ⊕N
i=1 Hi into closed sub∞
spaces, such that A∞ (Hi ) ⊆ Hi for each i (hence A∞ = ⊕N
i=1 A i , with
A∞ i = A∞ |Hi ⊆ B(Hi )) and D = ⊕i Di , so that for each i, (A∞ i , Hi , Di ) is
a spectral triple, which is admissible, i.e. satisfies our assumptions (i)-(vi).
For a spectral triple with N admissible connected components as in the
above definition, we consider the category of compact quantum groups
(S, ∆) acting smoothly isometrically and also satisfying the following (where
α denotes the action on A∞ )
∀i, ∃ j s.t. α(Āi ) ⊆ Āj ⊗ S.
13

It is easy to see that for such an action, Ψ = αφ (where φ is any state on S)
will satisfy Lemma 2.8, by an obvious modification of the arguments in the
proof. Since this is the only place where the connectedness condition was
used in the construction of quantum isometry group, we can prove the existence of a universal object in this category, to be called QISO(A∞ , H, D).
Remark 2.17 It is easy to see how to extend our formulation and results
to spectral triples which are not necessarily of type II, i.e. when the trace
τ is replaced by some non-tracial positive functional. Indeed, our construction will go through in such a situation more or less verbatim, by replacing
the universal quantum groups Adi (I) by Adi (Qi ) for some suitable choice of
matrices Qi coming from the modularity property of τ .

Examples and computations

We give some simple yet interesting explicit examples of quantum isometry
groups here. However, we give only some computational details for the first
example, and for the rest, the reader is referred to a forthcoming article
([3]).
Example 1 : commutative tori
Consider M = T, the one-torus, with the usual Riemannian structure. The
∗-algebra A∞ = C ∞ (M ) is generated by one unitary U , which is the multiplication operator by z in L2 (T). The Laplacian is given by L(U n ) = −n2 U n .
∞ smoothly, let A , n ∈ Z be
If a compact quantum group (S, ∆P
S ) acts on A
n
elements of S such that α0 (U ) = n U n ⊗ An (here α0 : A∞ → A∞ ⊗alg S
is the S-action on A∞ ). Note that this infinite sum converges at least
in the topology of the Hilbert space L2 (T) ⊗ L2 (S), where L2 (S) denotes
the GNS space for the Haar state of S. It is clear that the condition
(L ⊗ id) ◦ α0 = α0 ◦ L forces to have An = 0 for all but n = ±1. The
conditions α0 (U )α0 (U )∗ = α0 (U )∗ α0 (U ) = 1 ⊗ 1 further imply the following:
A∗1 A1 + A∗−1 A−1 = 1 = A1 A∗1 + A−1 A∗−1 ,
A∗1 A−1 = A∗−1 A1 = A1 A∗−1 = A−1 A∗1 = 0.
It follows that A±1 are partial isometries with orthogonal domains and
ranges. Say, A1 has domain P and range Q. Hence the domain and
range of A−1 are respectively 1 − P and 1 − Q. Consider the unitary
V = A + B, so that V P = A, V (1 − P ) = B. Now, from the fact that
14

(L ⊗ id)(α0 (U 2 )) = α0 (L(U 2 )) it is easy to see that the coefficient of 1 ⊗ 1 in
the expression of α0 (U )2 must be 0, i.e. AB + BA = 0. From this, it follows
that V and P commute and therefore P = Q. By straightforward calculation
using the facts that V is unitary, P is a projection and V and P commute, we
can verify that α0 given by α0 (U ) = U ⊗ V P + U −1 ⊗ V (1 − P ) extends to a
∗-homomorphsim from A∞ to A∞ ⊗C ∗ (V, P ) satisfying (L⊗id)◦α0 = α0 ◦L.
It follows that the C ∗ algebra QISO(T) is commutative and generated by a
unitary V and a projection P , or equivalently by two partial isometries A,
B such that A∗ A = AA∗ , B ∗ B = BB ∗ , AB = BA = 0. So, as a C ∗ algebra
it is isomorphic with C(T) ⊕ C(T) ∼
= C(T × Z2 ). The coproduct (say ∆0 )
can easily be calculated from the requirement of co-associativity, and the
Hopf algebra structure of QISO(T) can be seen to coincide with that of
the semi-direct product of T by Z2 , where the generator of Z2 acts on T by
sending z 7→ z̄.
We summarize this in form of the following.
Theorem 3.1 The universal quantum group of isometries QISO(T) of the
one-torus T is isomorphic (as a quantum group) with C(T >⊳Z2 ) = C(ISO(T)).
We can easily extend this result to higher dimensional commutative tori,
and can prove that the quantum isometry group coincides with the classical
isometry group. This is some kind of rigidity result, and it will be interesting to investigate the nature of quantum isometry groups of more general
classical manifolds.
Example 2 : Noncommutative torus; holomorphic isomrtries
Next we consider the simplest and well-known example of noncommutative
manifold, namely the noncommutative two-torus Aθ , where θ is a fixed
irrational number (see [5]). It is the universal C ∗ algebra generated by
two unitaries U and V satisfying the commutation relation U V = λV U ,
where λ = e2πiθ . There is a canonical faithful trace τ on Aθ given by
τ (U m V n ) = δmn . We consider the canonical spectral triple (A∞ , H, D),
where A∞ is the unital ∗-algebra spanned by U, V , H = L2 (τ ) ⊕ L2 (τ ) and
D is given by


0
d1 + id2
D=
,
d1 − id2
0
where d1 and d2 are closed unbounded linear maps on L2 (τ ) given by
d1 (U m V n ) = mU m V n , d2 (U m V n ) = nU m V n . It is easy to compute the
space of one-forms Ω1D (see [4], [7], [5]) and the Laplacian L = −d∗ d is given
by L(U m V n ) = −(m2 + n2 )U m V n . For simplicity of computation, instead
of the full quantum isometry group we at first concentrate on an interesting quantum subgroup G = QISOhol (A∞ , H, D), which is the universal
15

quantum group which leaves invariant the subalgebra of A∞ consisting of
polynomials in U , V and 1, i.e. span of U m V n with m, n ≥ 0. The proof
of existence and uniqueness of such a universal quantum group is more or
less identical to the proof of existence and uniqueness of QISO. We call G
the quantum group of "holomorphic" isometries, and observe in the theorem
stated below without proof (see [3]) that this quantum group is nothing but
the quantum double torus studied in [8].
Theorem 3.2 Consider the following co-product ∆B on the C ∗ algebra B =
C(T2 )⊕A2θ , given on the generators A0 , B0 , C0 , D0 as follows ( where A0 , D0
correspond to C(T2 ) and B0 , C0 correspond to A2θ )
∆B (A0 ) = A0 ⊗ A0 + C0 ⊗ B0 , ∆B (B0 ) = B0 ⊗ A0 + D0 ⊗ B0 ,
∆B (C0 ) = A0 ⊗ C0 + C0 ⊗ D0 , ∆B (D0 ) = B0 ⊗ C0 + D0 ⊗ D0 .
Then (B, ∆0 ) is a compact quantum group and it has an action α0 on Aθ
given by
α0 (U ) = U ⊗ A0 + V ⊗ B0 , α0 (V ) = U ⊗ C0 + V ⊗ D0 .
Moreover, (B, ∆B ) is isomorphic (as quantum group) with G = QISOhol (A∞ , H, D).
We refer to [3] for a proof of the above result, and to [8] for the computation
of the Haar stat and representation theory of the compact quantum group
G.
Example 3 : Noncommutative Torus; full quantum isometry group
By similar but somewhat tedious calculations (see [3]) one can also describe
explicitly the full quantum isometry group QISO(A∞ , H, D). It is as a
C ∗ algebra has eight direct summands, four of which are isomorphic with
the commutative algebra C(T2 ), and the other four are irrational rotation
algebras.
Theorem 3.3 QISO(Aθ ) = ⊕8k=1 C ∗ (Uk1 , Uk2 ) (as a C ∗ algebra), where for
odd k, Uk1 , Uk2 are the two commuting unitary generators of C(T2 ), and for
even k, Uk1 Uk2 = exp(4πiθ)Uk2 Uk1 , i.e. they generate A2θ . The (co)-action
on the generators U, V (say) of Aθ are given by the following :
α0 (U ) = U ⊗(U11 +U31 )+V ⊗(U52 +U62 )+U −1 ⊗(U21 +U41 )+V −1 ⊗(U72 +U82 ),
α0 (V ) = U ⊗(U51 +U71 )+V ⊗(U12 +U22 )+U −1 ⊗(U61 +U81 )+V −1 ⊗(U32 +U42 ).

From the co-associativity condition, the co-product of QISO(Aθ ) can easily
be calculated. For the detailed description of the coproduct, counit, antipode
and study of the representation theory of QISO(Aθ ), the reader is referred
to [3]. It is interesting to mention here that the quantum isometry group of
Aθ is a Rieffel type deformation of the isometry group (which is same as the
quantum isometry group) of the commutative two-torus. The commutative
two-torus is a subgroup of its isometry group, but when the isometry group
is deformed into QISO(Aθ ), the subgroup relation is not respected, and
the deformation of the commutative torus, which is A2θ , sits in QISO(Aθ )
just as a C ∗ subalgebra (in fact a direct summand) but not as a quantum
subgroup any more. This perhaps provides some explanation of the nonexistence of any Hopf algebra structure on the noncommutative torus.
